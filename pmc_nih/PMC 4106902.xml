                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Bitter taste is the primary culprit for rejection of pediatric liquid medications. We probed the underlying biology of bitter sensing and the efficacy of two known bitter blockers in children and adults.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>A racially diverse group of 154 children (3-10 years old) and their mothers (N = 118) evaluated the effectiveness of two bitter blockers, sodium gluconate (NaG) and monosodium glutamate (MSG), for five food-grade bitter compounds (quinine, denatonium benzoate, caffeine, propylthiouracil (PROP), urea) using a forced-choice method of paired comparisons. The trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01407939).</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>The blockers reduced bitterness in 7 of 10 bitter-blocker combinations for adults but only 3 of 10 for children, suggesting that efficacy depends on age and is also specific to each bitter-blocker combination. Only the bitterness of urea was reduced by both blockers in both age groups, whereas the bitterness of PROP was not reduced by either blocker in either age group regardless of <italic>TAS2R38</italic> genotype. Children liked the salty taste of the blocker NaG more than did adults, but both groups liked the savory taste of MSG equally.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions and Relevance</title>
                  <p>Bitter blocking was less effective in children, and the efficacy of blocking was both age and compound specific. This knowledge will pave the way for evidence-based strategies to help develop better-tasting medicines and highlights the conclusion that adult panelists and genotyping alone may not always be appropriate in evaluating the taste of a drug geared for children.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Unlike most adults, children have problems swallowing medicines in formulations such as pills or tablets, which have the advantage of encapsulating the active pharmaceutical ingredients (API). Instead, parents prefer that their children take medicine in liquid formulations, but here the central challenge becomes a “matter of taste” because APIs, by their nature, often are rejected because of their unpleasant tastes, with bitter being the primary culprit <xref rid="pone.0103107-Milne1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Most drugs work by changing physiological processes within cells, so APIs have the potential to be toxic when ingested in sufficient quantity. Bitter taste is thought to have evolved as a deterrent against ingestion of potentially harmful substances <xref rid="pone.0103107-Glendinning1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, which may explain why many drugs taste bitter. However, this bitter taste is also a major challenge to achieving medication compliance in pediatric patients.</p>
              <p>Bitter perception starts at the level of the receptor. These are about 25 different bitter receptors (T2Rs) with genes clustered primarily on chromosomes 7 and 12 <xref rid="pone.0103107-Adler1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103107-Chandrashekar1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The large number of receptors is needed because, of all the basic tastes, bitter is the most diverse <xref rid="pone.0103107-Meyerhof1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Most T2Rs studied have binding profiles that involve several different bitter-tasting ligands <xref rid="pone.0103107-Meyerhof1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103107-Behrens1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Likewise, a given bitter-tasting ligand can activate more than one T2R. This system accommodates the range of molecules that are perceived as bitter. Bitter taste is also perceptually diverse, and people differ markedly in their perceptions of the same compound. As an example, the perception of 6-<italic>n</italic>-propylthiouracil (PROP), which is primarily recognized by the most intensively studied T2R gene—the <italic>TAS2R38</italic> bitter receptor <xref rid="pone.0103107-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>—differs among people due to genetic variants within its receptor.</p>
              <p>Bitter taste biology has opened new avenues to better understand taste perception in children and how unpleasant tastes might be reduced <xref rid="pone.0103107-Mennella1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103107-Mennella2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Although several molecules that inhibit bitterness have been identified <xref rid="pone.0103107-Palmer1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103107-Ley1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, there are few peer-reviewed studies on the effectiveness of these bitter blockers (e.g., sodium salts, monosodium glutamate) in adults <xref rid="pone.0103107-Mennella1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103107-Breslin1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103107-Roy1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103107-Keast1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103107-Keast2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103107-Breslin2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103107-Narukawa1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, and even fewer involving children <xref rid="pone.0103107-Mennella1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. To this end, the present study tested the efficacy of two food-grade bitter blockers, sodium gluconate (NaG) and monosodium glutamate (MSG), against five generally recognized as safe (GRAS) bitter agents in solution, in both children and adults. We used the same methodology in both age groups to determine if there were age-related differences in the efficacy of the blockers against quinine, denatonium benzoate (DB), caffeine, PROP, and urea, which represent a range of presumed classes of bitterness <xref rid="pone.0103107-Delwiche1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> but whose intensity can be as great as many oral formulations of medications, thus providing a useful model system for evaluating bitter blockers in children. Genetic variants of <italic>TAS2R38</italic> affect an individual's perception of the bitterness of PROP, even in children <xref rid="pone.0103107-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103107-Bufe1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, so each participant was genotyped for its receptor and phenotyped for PROP detection thresholds using a method that has shown reliability for children, adolescents, and adults <xref rid="pone.0103107-Mennella3" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Surprisingly, there have been no studies to date investigating whether the bitter taste of PROP can be blocked by either of these sodium salts.</p>

                <title>Participants</title>
                <p>Women with one or more children between the ages of 3 and 10 years were recruited from advertisements in local newspapers and Internet sites and from a database of past participants who asked to be notified of future research studies. During the telephone interview, the mothers were given detailed descriptions of the procedures for the “taste study” but were not told the goals of the study or hypotheses being tested. Women who were diabetic, pregnant, or lactating were not eligible; pregnancy tests were conducted on the day of testing to confirm they were not pregnant. The Office of Regulatory Affairs at the University of Pennsylvania approved all procedures. Written informed consent was obtained from each adult, and assent was obtained from each child 7 years of age or older. Mothers completed questionnaires regarding demographics and racial/ethnicity identity. The trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01407939).</p>

We also selected two putative blockers based on previous studies of their effectiveness for some but not all bitter ligands <xref rid="pone.0103107-Mennella1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103107-Breslin1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103107-Roy1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103107-Keast1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103107-Keast2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103107-Breslin2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103107-Narukawa1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>: 0.3 M sodium gluconate (NaG) and 0.1 M monosodium L-glutamate (MSG). NaG was chosen because previous research revealed that it was highly effective at suppressing the bitterness of urea and caffeine in adults and tasted less salty than sodium chloride <xref rid="pone.0103107-Breslin2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. The water used to prepare the solutions and as a rinsing solution was deionized Millipore-filtered water (Millipore Milli-Q Academic model). Solutions were stored in amber glass bottles and replaced at least every two weeks.</p>

                <p>Following abstinence from eating for at least 1 hour, participants were tested individually in rooms specifically designed for sensory testing. As described below, after training, children and adults participated in the forced-choice, paired-comparison test to evaluate the bitterness of five food-grade (GRAS) bitter stimuli, separately and combined with each of the two blockers. <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Methods</xref> were identical for children and adults.</p>

                  <title>Training</title>
                  <p>To ensure that subjects understood the taste of bitterness (or bad/unpleasant taste), they were presented with three reference solutions that were identified as salty (0.3 M NaG, which is less salty than 0.3 M NaCl), sweet (0.3 M sucrose), and bitter (0.5 M urea). Then subjects were given a training session in which they received pairs of samples that differed in their sweetness and bitterness <xref rid="pone.0103107-Mennella1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>; in some cases the more bitter solution was also sweet. Thus, subjects learned that in some cases the more bitter solution may be a complex mixture.</p>

                  <title>Psychophysical Testing</title>
                  <p>An age-appropriate, game-like task that minimized the impact of language development was used for both adults and children <xref rid="pone.0103107-Mennella1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Using a forced-choice procedure, each subject was presented, in randomized order, six pairs of solutions for each bitter/blocker combination (see <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0103107.s001">Table S1</xref></bold>)<bold>,</bold> one pair at a time, and was asked to indicate which of the pair tasted more bitter. Included in the pairings was the comparison of the blocker alone and water to assess its contribution to the taste of bitter+blocker mixture. Procedures were identical for the children and their mothers, and testing for the five bitters was assessed with one blocker on one testing day and with the other on a separate testing day(s). Adults were presented with all pairs for a given blocker during one test session; children often required two sessions to complete a bitter blocker set.</p>
                  <p>Aliquots of 5 ml of each solution were presented in 30-ml polyethylene medicine cups. The order of presentation of the solutions was randomized within and between each pair of samples and between subjects. Subjects rinsed and expectorated with water two times after tasting each sample and four times between each pair. A 60-s interval separated each pair of solutions. During these intervals, subjects were offered a small unsalted cracker to cleanse their palate and a cup containing water for rinsing. To assess liking rather than bitterness, after all pairs had been presented, subjects were then presented with the putative blocker versus deionized water and asked which solution they preferred.</p>

                <title>PROP Taste Thresholds</title>
                <p>We measured the lowest concentration of PROP at which subjects could recognize bitterness (bitterness threshold) for two reasons. First, we wanted to confirm the age-related differences in <italic>TAS2R38</italic> genotype–PROP phenotype relationship <xref rid="pone.0103107-Mennella3" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103107-Spielman1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103107-Mennella4" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Second, if either of the blockers was effective in reducing PROP bitterness, we would then determine whether efficacy was related to genotype. To this end, we used a forced-choice ascending categorization procedure, developed by Anliker and colleagues <xref rid="pone.0103107-Anliker1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> and modified by Mennella and colleagues <xref rid="pone.0103107-Mennella3" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, to accommodate the fact that children have difficulty with intensity/scaling measures. This method has proved to be reliable for children, adolescents, and adults: most children retested 9 months later demonstrate similar thresholds <xref rid="pone.0103107-Mennella3" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. In brief, each subject was given four cups, one at a time, containing 5 ml of solution, which they were asked to taste and spit out after 5 s. The first cup was water, and the remaining cups were three different concentrations of PROP (56, 180, and 560 µM) presented in ascending order. To incorporate the task into a child-friendly game, subjects were told that if the solution tasted like water, they should give the cup to a stuffed toy Big Bird (a likeable puppet), but if it tasted “yucky” or bitter, they should give it to Oscar the Grouch (a grumpy puppet), so that he can “throw it in his trash can” <xref rid="pone.0103107-Mennella3" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> (both puppets are well-known television characters). Based on their responses, subjects were classified into four groups representing the lowest concentration, if any, given to Oscar the Grouch.</p>

                <p>For the paired-comparison data, we tested the null hypothesis that there were no systematic differences in children's or mothers' bitterness ranking between the four different solutions (i.e., bitter, bitter combined with blocker, blocker, and diluent). We analyzed the paired-comparison data for each blocker and each bitter stimulus separately. First, we determined the number of times (out of six possible pairings) that each subject chose each of the four solutions as tasting more bitter. From these data, we ranked the four solutions according to the subject's preferences, where 1 was the least chosen (least bitter) and 4 was the most chosen (most bitter). An example of the ranking procedure is shown in <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0103107.s001">Table S1</xref></bold>. Data obtained from mothers were analyzed separately from children. Separate Friedman Two-Way Nonparametric analyses were conducted on these bitter rankings derived from the paired-comparison data, one for each of the five bitter stimuli and for each of the two blockers. When significant, post hoc tests were performed to determine which differences among the solutions were significant <xref rid="pone.0103107-Siegel1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.</p>
                <p>The associations between the taste thresholds and <italic>TAS2R38</italic> genotypes were analyzed with chi-square analyses <xref rid="pone.0103107-Siegel1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>; Yates' chi square was used when fewer than five subjects had a particular genotype. Follow-up partition analyses were then used to further examine these significant effects.

                      <p>All Friedman statistical tests of rank tests were significant at p≤0.0001. Abbreviations: SEM, standard error of the mean. Bitter compounds—0.5 M urea; 0.008 M caffeine; 1.19×10<sup>−4</sup> M quinine; 5.60×10<sup>−4</sup> M PROP (propylthiouracil); 4.92×10<sup>−7</sup> M denatonium benzoate. Putative bitter blockers—NaG, 0.3 M sodium gluconate; MSG, 0.1 M glutamate. Diluent was distilled water. Blockers were compared separately against each bitter alone, bitter + blocker, and diluent. Rankings for bitterness range from 1 (least) to 4 (most); see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0103107.s001">Table S1</xref> for ranking procedure. Different letters indicate rankings that are statistically different from each other within each row using p&lt;0.05 as the statistical threshold for the omnibus and post-hoc tests.</p>

              <p>Consistent with previous studies in adults <xref rid="pone.0103107-Mennella1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103107-Breslin1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103107-Roy1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103107-Keast1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103107-Keast2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103107-Breslin2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103107-Narukawa1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, the ability of sodium salts to block bitter taste is compound specific and, as we show for the first time here, also specific to the age of the subject. In general, if the blocker worked for a given bitter in children, it also worked for adults, but not vice versa—in no case did a blocker work for children but not for adults. Further, if the bitterness for a particular compound was blocked by NaG in a given age group, then MSG was an effective blocker for that compound for that age group as well, but not vice versa. For only one bitter compound (caffeine) did NaG work but MSG did not. Overall, these results suggest that types of bitter receptors exist that respond differently based on the age of the subject and the chemical nature of the blocker and bitter agent.</p>
              <p>The inborn rejection of bitter-tasting substances is thought to have evolved to protect the animal from being poisoned and the plant producing these chemicals from being eaten <xref rid="pone.0103107-Glendinning1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. It may be that bitter receptors that detect poisons are most sensitive in childhood, when the risks of accidental poisoning are high <xref rid="pone.0103107-Mowry1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. To this point, denatonium (commonly called Bitrex) has a long history of being added to detergents and paints <xref rid="pone.0103107-Sibert1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103107-Rodgers1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> to deter pediatric poisonings, especially when used in conjunction with other preventive measures, such as child-resistant closures <xref rid="pone.0103107-Lawless1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Unlike in adults, neither of the sodium salts under study was effective in blocking the bitterness of denatonium in children as a group. One explanation may be that children are more sensitive to its bitter taste than are adults.</p>
              <p>To date, little research has assessed how children differ from adults in taste detection thresholds for bitter, with the exception of PROP <xref rid="pone.0103107-Mennella3" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Consistent with previous findings <xref rid="pone.0103107-Mennella3" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103107-Mennella4" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, in our study children had lower detection thresholds than did adults, especially those with taste-sensitive genotypes. Therefore, blockers may be generally less effective for some children due to genotype because there is greater bitter taste to overcome. Unfortunately, we couldn't test this hypothesis for ratings of PROP solutions because neither blocker worked for that bitter compound. Our previous studies showed that the relationship between receptor genotype and bitter taste begins to resemble the adult pattern during mid-adolescence <xref rid="pone.0103107-Mennella4" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, and it may be that during childhood, a time of heightened bitter sensitivity to avoid accidental poisoning, this safety mechanism may fluctuate with age such that bitter sensitivity may peak at times when children begin making independent food choices. Further studies investigating both age- and genotype-related effects on blocker efficacy and bitter thresholds over time will be needed to pinpoint when and why some individuals are more bitter sensitive than others and how that changes with age. Such age-related effects extend beyond comparisons between children and adults since previous studies have shown that during adulthood there are significant compound-specific declines in bitter taste sensitivity <xref rid="pone.0103107-Schiffman1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103107-Cowart1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103107-Stevens1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> and detection of tastes in mixtures <xref rid="pone.0103107-Stevens1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> between young and elderly subjects. Although foods and beverages having a prominent bitter taste component constitute a very small proportion of total consumption in industrialized countries <xref rid="pone.0103107-Mattes1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, repeated exposure via dietary habits, learning and adaptation can shift hedonic responses to bitter-tasting foods and beverages and thus may also be key to understanding age-related effects <xref rid="pone.0103107-Stein1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>.</p>
              <p>Past research in adults suggests that when the two sodium salts NaG and MSG are effective in blocking bitter taste, they are acting at the level of peripheral taste receptors and not by central cognitive effects <xref rid="pone.0103107-Breslin1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103107-Keast1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103107-Breslin2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103107-Kroeze1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103107-Bartoshuk1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Because bitter compounds can stimulate multiple receptors <xref rid="pone.0103107-Meyerhof1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103107-Born1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, the selectivity of NaG and MSG for specific bitter agents presumably arises because they stimulate different receptors that are more or less sensitive to their blocking effects. One suggestion is that for NaG or MSG, the allosteric effects of sodium ions might modify the activity of bitter receptors as it does for other G-protein-coupled receptors <xref rid="pone.0103107-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. If the sodium is the active blocker, we would expect MSG to be less effective than NaG at the concentrations tested because it has less sodium. However, Keast and colleagues <xref rid="pone.0103107-Keast2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> found that the bitter-suppressing effect of MSG was not sodium dependent because increasing the MSG concentration from 10 to 100 mM did not reduce bitterness more. Thus, the mechanism whereby MSG blocks bitterness is not solely or perhaps even partially due to the sodium ion. Studies of non-sodium umami compounds are needed to understand its contribution <italic>per se</italic> to bitter blocking.</p>
              <p>To our knowledge, this is the first study that has investigated whether PROP (the most widely studied bitter agent <xref rid="pone.0103107-Guo1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>), can be blocked by sodium salts. That it cannot be blocked by either NaG or MSG suggests that its receptor, <italic>TAS2R38</italic>, might be unaffected by sodium. However, we emphasize that when the blockers are effective, the exact nature their mechanisms of action remains unknown. Other supporting data for the peripheral effect of these bitter blockers comes from the ratings of liking for the blocker alone: we can rule out the possibility that the pleasantness of the blockers acted in the brain by distracting subjects from the negative aspects of bitterness, because children liked the taste of the NaG blocker more than adults, even though the blockers were less effective for them.</p>
              <p>Studies that compare adults and children (especially the very young, like those studied here) require special measures to assure that the results are due to genuine sensory differences and not due to differences in children's ability to understand the task. The appropriateness of this method was confirmed in several ways. First, the majority of children understood and completed the task. Second, they were similar to adults in the ability of both blockers to reduce the bitterness of urea, thus suggesting that their responses were guided by the intensity of the bitter perception, not the complexity of the mixture (see also <xref rid="pone.0103107-Mennella1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>). Third, as a further measure of validation, we took advantage of the relationship between the threshold measures of PROP and genotype of the <italic>TAS2R38</italic> receptor and confirmed not only the tight match between genotype and phenotype but also the effect of age on this relationship. Because the bitterness of PROP was not blocked by either blocker in either age group or genotype, we were prevented from examining bitter blocker efficacy by <italic>TAS2R38</italic> genotype. However, it is important to emphasize that, although paired-comparison methods can be used to investigate bitter blocking in children, there are limitations since this method cannot illustrate the magnitude of the efficacy of the blocker, as can other methods such as the general labeled magnitude scale <xref rid="pone.0103107-Bartoshuk2" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, drugs often taste very bitter, and this bad taste is a challenge to administering medications, especially liquid oral formulations for children <xref rid="pone.0103107-Mennella2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Our results highlight the limitations of using adults to study the taste experiences of children <xref rid="pone.0103107-Mennella3" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103107-Mennella6" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Adult taste panels do not represent the sensory worlds of children, and, as shown here, children do not receive the same benefit from bitter blockers as do adults. Consistent with a large body of research on age-related changes in sweet, salty, and bitter tastes <xref rid="pone.0103107-Mennella2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103107-Mennella4" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103107-Mennella6" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103107-Beauchamp1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, the pattern of preferences was also different between the age groups: children preferred the taste NaG over water more than did the adults. Thus, children may like high-salt bitter blockers, as they do higher levels of sweetness <xref rid="pone.0103107-Mennella7" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, tastes that most adult taste panelists would reject. Furthermore, the methods used in the present study to assess the ability of blockers to reduce bitter taste represent a valuable tool for future assessment of taste in children, but we acknowledge that the need for more research on wider range of bitter stimuli including medicines as well as blockers in this area is acute <xref rid="pone.0103107-Mennella2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103107-Giacoia1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Future efforts should be directed at matching bitter medicines (ligands) to the appropriate bitter receptor(s) and the development of receptor-specific blockers</p>
              <p>Children and adults are subject to many of the same ailments and diseases and, by necessity, are often treated with the same drugs. However, most of these drugs lack Food and Drug Administration approval for pediatric labeling for safety and efficacy <xref rid="pone.0103107-Giacoia1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Only a small fraction of these drugs, including their excipients, have been tested adequately for acceptability by pediatric populations, and many may not be appropriate for pediatric use <xref rid="pone.0103107-Salunke1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, especially when many children cannot consume medication in solid oral dosage forms. The lack of “child-friendly” formulations leaves many of the world's children at increased risk for avoidable adverse events, including lack of adherence to medication regimens <xref rid="pone.0103107-Milne1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Any drug will be ineffective in children unless it is made in such a way that children will take it, and therefore a focus on taste and compliance is essential for pediatric medicine. More knowledge about the science of distaste and development of psychophysical methods that measure the human and especially the childhood taste experience will help realize a new era in drug development for children—an era that is still in its infancy <xref rid="pone.0103107-Giacoia1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Increasing knowledge about individual variation in taste due to both age and genetics will shed light on potential directions for developing personalized medicine (see also <xref rid="pone.0103107-Soares1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>).</p>
