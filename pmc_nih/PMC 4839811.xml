                <p>Autoimmune manifestations are common in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients. However, the autoantibody spectrum associated with HIV infection and the impact of antiretroviral therapy (ART) remains to be determined.</p>
                <p>The plasma autoantibody spectrum for HIV patients was characterized by protein microarrays containing 83 autoantigens and confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Regulatory T cells (Tregs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) were analyzed by flow cytometry and their effects on autoantibodies production were determined by B cell ELISpot.</p>
                <p>Higher levels of autoantibody and higher prevalence of elevated autoantibodies were observed in ART-naive HIV patients compared to healthy subjects and HIV patients on ART. The highest frequency of CD33<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>HLA-DR<sup>+</sup> cells was observed in ART-naive HIV patients and was associated with the quantity of elevated autoantibodies. In addition, CD33<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>HLA-DR<sup>+</sup> cells other than Tregs or MDSCs boost the B cell response in a dose-dependent manner by <italic>in vitro</italic> assay.</p>
                <p>In summary, HIV infection leads to elevation of autoantibodies while ART suppresses the autoimmune manifestation by decreasing CD33<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>HLA-DR<sup>+</sup> cells <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
                <p>The roles of CD33<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>HLA-DR<sup>+</sup> cells on disease progression in HIV patients needs further assessment.</p>

              <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
              <p>Increased prevalence and titer of circulating autoantibodies have been reported in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Up to 68.1% of HIV patients have circulating antinuclear antibodies (ANAs),<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>â<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> including autoantibodies against cellular DNA,<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs),<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> histone H2B,<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Smith (Sm),<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> SSA (Ro),<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> and SSB (La).<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> In addition to ANAs, autoantibodies against peripheral blood cells,<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> MHC II,<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> and phospholipids<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> have also been frequently observed in HIV patients. The increased incidence and titer of autoantibodies are associated with lower CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell count and higher mortality in HIV patients who are naive to antiretroviral therapy (ART),<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> indicating that autoantibodies may play a pathogenic role or can serve as a prognostic indicator in HIV infection. In fact, autoimmune diseases including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatological syndromes, antiphospholipid syndrome, vasculitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, polymyositis, Gravesâ disease, and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura have been frequently reported in HIV/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Therefore, it is important to characterize the spectrum of emerging autoantibodies in HIV patients as this may shed light on resolving HIV infection related autoimmune manifestation.</p>
              <p>Moreover, in the current era of ART, a plethora of concerns about autoimmune manifestations in HIV patients have been raised, which could determine the therapeutic efficiency. Therefore, further elucidating the impact of ART on autoantibody spectrum in HIV patients is important and valuable for therapeutic evaluation.</p>
              <p>Recently, immune regulatory cells, including regulatory T cells (Tregs, CD25<sup>+</sup>FoxP3<sup>+</sup>) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs, CD33<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>HLA-DR<sup>â</sup>), are widely observed to increase in frequency in HIV patients, which is thought to be responsible for the severe impaired cytotoxic T cell (CTL) immune response <italic>in vivo</italic>.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>â<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> These immune regulatory cells play pivotal roles in the maintenance of self-tolerance as well as control of immune activation, particularly during chronic infections.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>â<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> In the setting of autoimmune manifestation caused by HIV infection, it also becomes crucial to know the roles of Tregs, MDSCs, and other immune cells in the development of an autoimmune response.</p>
              <p>In the present study, we investigated autoantibody profiles in HIV patients who had maintained undetectable viral loads on long-term ART, HIV patients who were ART-naÃ¯ve, and healthy subjects, and further explored the roles of immune regulatory cells on regulating the autoimmune response.</p>

                <title>Study Participants</title>
                <p>The study was performed according to a protocol approved by the Institutional Review Boards for Human Research at the Indiana University School of Medicine (Indianapolis, IN). Written informed consent was obtained from each of all participants before blood collection. Three groups of individuals were recruited in this study: 20 healthy controls, 17 HIV-infected ART-naive individuals (CD4 cell counts: 422âcells/mm<sup>3</sup>, range 16â1237; viral load: 11,532âcopies/mL, range 59â570,156âcopies/mL), and 14 HIV-infected individuals on ART with undetectable viral load (&lt;50âcopies/mL) for at least 2 years (CD4 cell counts: 556âcells/mm<sup>3</sup>, range 231â1310). Peripheral blood from these participants was collected in BD Vacutainer tubes (containing 143 USP units of sodium heparin per 10-mL tube, BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ). These blood samples were separated into peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and plasma and stored at <bold>â</bold>80âÂ°C or liquid nitrogen until use.</p>

                <title>Autoantigen Protein Microarray</title>
                <p>Circulating autoantibody profiles in plasma samples from uninfected and HIV-infected individuals were determined using an autoantigen protein microarray as previously described.<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> The autoantigen protein microarray included 83 autoantigens and 4 control proteins and was performed in the Microarray Core Facility of the Texas University (Dallas, TX). Briefly, the plasma sample diluted at 1:100 was added to the arrays in duplicate. Net fluorescence intensities (NFIs) were generated by A Genepix 4000B scanner and Genepix Pro 6.0 software and normalized using anti-human IgG spotted onto each array. Values obtained from duplicate spots were averaged. Tests of significance between groups were carried out using a Student's <italic>t</italic>-test or one-way ANOVA for multiple groups (GraphPad Prism 5.02). Correlations between continuous variables were determined using Pearson <italic>r</italic>, and dichotomized variables were compared using Fisher exact test. A <italic>P</italic> valueâ&lt;â0.05 was considered significant. Diagrams with row-wise and column-wise clustering were generated using Cluster and Treeview software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rana.lbl.gov/EisenSoftware.htm">http://rana.lbl.gov/EisenSoftware.htm</ext-link>).</p>

                <title>ELISA</title>
                <p>An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed to confirm the microarray data and to titrate autoantibodies in plasma samples. Briefly, 96-well plates were coated with individual recombinant human autoantigens including centromere protein B (CENP-B), Intrinsic Factor, nuclear pore glycoprotein-210 (gp210), mitochondrial antibody subtype M2 (MA-M2), synthetase (PL7), proteins of the nucleolar PM/Scl macromolecular complex (PM/Scl-75), SP100, signal recognition particle 54âkDa protein (SRP54), Lupus La protein or SjÃ¶gren syndrome type B antigen (La/SS-B), and small nucleoprotein particles (snRNPs) such as U1-snRNP-68, U1-snRNP-A, U1-snRNP-BBâ², and U1-snRNP-C (SurModics, Eden Prairie, MN). After washing and blocking with 5% FBS/PBS, plates were incubated with serially diluted plasma, followed by the addition of goat anti-human IgG monoclonal antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP). Optical densities (OD) at 450ânm were determined using an ELISA plate reader (ELX 808 microplate reader, Winooski, VT). Results were expressed as titers.

The common 32 autoantibodies did not show any elevation among all 3 groups.

                <p>B cell ELISpot was used to determine whether these autoantibodies were produced by specific autoreactive B cells <italic>in vivo</italic>.

The strongest autoantigen specific B cell response was observed in ART-naive HIV patientâ samples, and healthy control samples had the weakest response (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A, B). These results were consistent with the frequency of elevated autoantibodies in these 3 groups; the maximum prevalence of elevated autoantibodies was in ART-naive HIV patients, followed by HIV patients on ART (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).

To examine which cell types are involved in the alterations of the autoantibody profile in HIV patients, we depleted the CD33<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> or CD3<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> cells by FACS and performed B cell ELISpot assays on these depleted PBMCs.

However, the depletion of CD33<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> cells remarkably impaired the production of both autoantibodies and total IgG in all 3 groups as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>. In order to further determine which subpopulation of CD33<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> cells contributes to this effect, CD33<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> cells were subsequently sorted into CD33<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>HLA-DR<sup>+</sup> cells and CD33<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>HLA-DR<sup>â</sup> cells (mainly M-MDSCs). These cells were cocultured with CD33<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> cell-depleted PBMCs at indicated ratios (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A, B). Interestingly, we observed that the CD33<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>HLA-DR<sup>+</sup> cells significantly promoted the production of both autoantibodies and total IgG in a dose-dependent manner, while the CD33<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>HLA-DR<sup>â</sup> cells had no effect (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>AâC).

However, the complex nature of the mechanism of the autoimmune response <italic>in vivo</italic>, and minimal number of studies characterizing the spectrum of plasma autoantibodies in HIV patients in the presence or absence of ART implied that emerging autoantibodies in primary HIV patients is nonspecific.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>â<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Therefore, it is crucial to evaluate whether there is a specific autoantibody profile related to HIV infection.

First, altered autoantibody profiles were observed in ART-naive HIV patients and HIV patients on ART compared to healthy controls. Fifteen autoantibodies in ART-naive HIV patients and 8 of 15 in HIV patients on ART were significantly higher than that in healthy controls. Meanwhile, 5 of 15 autoantibodies in ART-naive HIV patients were significantly higher than that of HIV patients on ART. Additionally, the highest titer of the 15 specific elevated autoantibodies was also observed in ART-naive HIV patients. This study not only characterizes the spectrum of the plasma autoantibody profile, but also reveals the possibility of ART improving the autoimmune manifestation by decreasing the titer and incidence of autoantibodies in HIV patients.</p>
              <p>Second, autoantibodies also displayed a significantly higher incidence in HIV patients than healthy controls. Particularly, the higher incidence of 15 specific autoantibodies is 2â10/17 in ART-naive HIV patients and 0â4/20 in healthy controls. Statistical analysis also confirmed that these 15 specific autoantibodies had a significantly higher prevalence in HIV patients (both ART-naive patients and patients on ART) than healthy controls. Finally, autoantibody-producing B cells were confirmed by B cell ELISpot. Similar to the order of interaction of autoantibodies from the 3 groups against autoantigens, the strongest autoreactive B cell response was found in the ART-naive HIV group, followed by HIV patients on ART, and healthy controls had the weakest response. Collectively, we have established the autoantibody spectrum related to HIV infection for the first time, and our data suggest that ART improves the autoimmune response during HIV infection.</p>
              <p>Although some aspects of HIV immunopathogenesis relevant to the promotion of autoimmunity were discussed previously, the mechanisms underlying the interplay between immune dysregulation and the impact of ART may provide important insight into understanding the manifestations of autoimmunity during HIV infection.<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>â<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> Immune dysregulation is a hallmark of HIV infection, which may be caused by altering the frequency of function of immune cells such as T cells, B cells, and other immune cells.<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>â<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> Recent studies indicated that elevated immune regulatory cells (MDSCs and Tregs) are associated with progression of HIV/AIDS.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>â<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Despite the lack of common biomarkers, MDSCs are believed to be derived from CD33<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> cells. Our <italic>in vitro</italic> studies demonstrated that depletion of CD33<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> cells, but not CD3<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> cells leads to a remarkably impaired B cell response. As MDSCs encompass a heterogeneous population, CD33<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> cells strongly promote the B cell response <italic>in vitro</italic>. In these cells, more than 90% of the cells are CD14 positive and/or HLA-DR positive and &lt;10% are MDSCs. Unexpectedly, additional experiments with sorted CD33<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> cells indicated that CD33<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>HLA-DR<sup>â</sup> cells (mainly MDSCs) have no effect on secretion of autoantibodies or total IgG <italic>in vitro</italic>. On the contrary, CD33<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>HLA-DR<sup>+</sup> cells promoted a robust production of both autoantibodies and total IgG in a dose-dependent manner. Notably, CD33<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>HLA-DR<sup>+</sup> cells displayed the same role in HIV patients and healthy controls, which suggest that CD33<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>HLA-DR<sup>+</sup> cells contribute to the development of autoimmunity in a nonspecific way.</p>
              <p>Based on the previously mentioned results, we proposed that an increase in the CD33<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>HLA-DR<sup>+</sup> cells would promote the production of autoantibodies <italic>in vivo</italic>. Flow cytometry data from all participants displayed a significant increase in the frequency of CD33<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>HLA-DR<sup>+</sup> cells in ART-naive HIV patients rather than HIV patients on ART or healthy controls. Meanwhile, the frequency of CD33<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>HLA-DR<sup>+</sup> cells positively correlated with the occurrence of elevated autoantibodies per sample in both healthy controls and HIV patients. The above results suggest that a higher CD33<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>HLA-DR<sup>+</sup> cell frequency promotes increased production of elevated autoantibodies in ART-naive HIV patients, and ART can improve autoimmunity in HIV patients, which is at least partly due to decreased frequency of CD33<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>HLA-DR<sup>+</sup> cells.</p>
              <p>Although MDSCs and Tregs have been documented to a play critical role in immune tolerance and the control of the autoimmune response, the effects of MDSCs and Tregs may be dependent on the interaction between these immune regulatory cells and T cells.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>â<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>â<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> Notably, T cell exhaustion and impaired function caused by HIV infection may hinder the function of these immune regulatory cells against the development of autoimmunity. On the contrary, immune activation and immune dysfunction lead to increased CD33<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>HLA-DR<sup>+</sup> cells, which promote the development of autoimmunity in a nonspecific way. The proposed mechanism of CD33<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>HLA-DR<sup>+</sup> cells in the promotion of the autoimmune response may shed light on these controversies in HIV infection and pathogenesis; an increased population of CD33<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> cells promotes persistent immune activation and autoimmune response, while an increased population of suppressor cells may lead to impaired T cell immunity.</p>
              <p>In this study, we reveal that HIV infection leads to autoimmune manifestation with a specific spectrum of circulating autoantibodies, meanwhile ART may improve the autoimmune condition and alter their autoantibody spectrum by reducing the number of CD33<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>HLA-DR<sup>+</sup> cells. However, a better understanding of the mechanism behind the effect of ART on the CD33<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>HLA-DR<sup>+</sup> cells may provide the necessary insight for resolving the mechanism of immune dysfunction caused by HIV infection and reconstitution of the immune system in HIV patients, which requires further investigation.</p>
