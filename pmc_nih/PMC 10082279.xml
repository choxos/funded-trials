                <title>PURPOSE</title>
                <p>Chemotherapy has not demonstrated benefit over adjuvant endocrine therapy alone for postmenopausal patients with node-positive breast cancer with a 21-gene breast recurrence score (RS) of 25 or below (RS ≤ 25). We tested whether combined results from RS and the sensitivity to endocrine therapy (SET2,3) index of endocrine-related transcription (SET<sub>ER/PR</sub>) adjusted for baseline prognostic index (BPI) improve prognostic assessment, and whether SET2,3 predicted benefit from anthracycline-based chemotherapy.</p>
                <sec>
                  <title>METHODS</title>
                  <p>A blinded retrospective clinical validation of SET2,3 in two randomized treatment arms from the SWOG S8814 trial comparing adjuvant anthracycline-based chemotherapy followed by tamoxifen endocrine therapy for 5 years, versus tamoxifen alone. SET2,3 assay was calibrated and measured using whole-transcriptome RNA sequence of tumor samples already tested for RS. The primary end point was disease-free survival (DFS).</p>

                  <title>RESULTS</title>
                  <p>There were 106 events in 283 patients over a median follow-up of 8.99 years. Proportional hazards assumptions were met during the first 5 years only. SET2,3 index and RS were not correlated (r = –0.04) and were independently prognostic (SET2,3: hazard ratio [HR], 0.48 per unit; 95% CI, 0.34 to 0.68; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; .001; RS: HR, 1.28 per 10 units; 95% CI, 1.14 to 1.44; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; .001). SET2,3 index did not predict chemotherapy benefit (interaction <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = .77). SET2,3 was high in 93/175 (53%) patients with RS ≤ 25 (concordant low-risk), with 5-year DFS 97%. SET2,3 was low in 55/108 (51%) patients with RS &gt; 25 (concordant high-risk), with 5-year DFS 53%. Both components of SET2,3 index were prognostic after adjustment for RS: SET<sub>ER/PR</sub> (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.46 to 0.92) and BPI (HR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.31 to 0.64).</p>

                  <title>CONCLUSION</title>
                  <p>SET2,3 index was not correlated with RS, demonstrated additive prognostic performance, and was not chemopredictive in this subset of patients from S8814. The SET<sub>ER/PR</sub> and BPI components of SET2,3 each added prognostic information to RS.</p>

              <p>It remains an important clinical challenge to identify which patients with estrogen receptor–positive (ER+), node-positive breast cancer will have very low risk of disease recurrence after adjuvant endocrine therapy alone, and therefore do not benefit from chemotherapy.<sup><xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Ideally, selection criteria should combine predictions of favorable prognostic risk, negligible benefit from chemotherapy, and high sensitivity to endocrine therapy. We considered that two test results combined might refine this approach for patients with node-positive disease, if their results were independent and complementary.</p>

              <p>Oncotype Dx recurrence score (RS) has been shown to be both prognostic and predictive of chemotherapy benefit in women with node-negative and node-positive ER+ breast cancer.<sup><xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Nevertheless, nodal status still contributes independently to prognosis.<sup><xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> RS was prognostic in the recent RxPONDER trial that evaluated the contribution of chemotherapy to adjuvant endocrine therapy for patients with 1-3 involved lymph nodes and RS of 25 or below (RS ≤ 25).<sup><xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> No significant benefit from chemotherapy was observed in postmenopausal women, although the trial was not powered to establish noninferiority.<sup><xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup></p>
              <p>The sensitivity to endocrine therapy (SET2,3) index is a customized assay for formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissues, which yields reproducible results within and between different laboratories, offering prognostic information for patients receiving endocrine therapy.<sup><xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>-<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> It combines the SET index of transcription related to estrogen and progesterone receptors (SET<sub>ER/PR</sub>) with a baseline prognostic index (BPI) derived from pathologic tumor size, nodal involvement, and molecular subtype by RNA4 (<italic toggle="yes">ESR1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">PGR</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">ERBB2</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">AURKA</italic>).<sup><xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>-<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Each component, SET<sub>ER/PR</sub> index and BPI, added independent prognostic information in prior studies<sup><xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> and multivariable Cox models of SET2,3 demonstrated that the RNA4 within the BPI could be substituted by contemporary prognostic signatures, but the SET<sub>ER/PR</sub> index could not be substituted.<sup><xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> High SET2,3 scores are associated with endocrine sensitivity and more favorable prognosis, and low SET2,3 scores with endocrine therapy resistance and less-favorable outcomes.<sup><xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>-<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup></p>

              <p>There were 106 events over a median follow-up of 9.1 years in the 283 patients in this study. Clinical characteristics of the 283 patients in this analysis are compared with a larger published subset of 367 patients with known RS result, and to the 927 patients overall in the two treatment arms from the parent S8814 trial in Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. There were no significant differences between those with SET2,3 values and those with RS only (Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). As the proportional hazards assumption only held during the initial 5 years of follow-up, the primary analyses were restricted to years 0-5 with 57 events. Five years was chosen since it is the end of recommended endocrine therapy. Continuous SET2,3 index was independently prognostic, with hazard ratio (HR, 0.46) and 95% CI (0.32 to 0.66; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; .001) adjusted for treatment arm. However, it did not predict chemotherapy benefit (interaction <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = .77). High SET2,3 in 52% (146/283) of patients appeared to have prognostic gain only during the early follow-up (Fig <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). SET2,3 was highly prognostic within each treatment arm, with a 5-year DFS of 91.4% (95% CI, 80.5 to 96.3) in SET2,3 high patients and 71.2% (95% CI, 57.8 to 81.0) in SET2,3 low patients only receiving tamoxifen (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = .0026, Appendix Fig A<xref rid="figA3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, online only).

              <p>Since the BPI component of SET2,3 includes pathologic tumor size and number of involved nodes, we separately analyzed the BPI and SET<sub>ER/PR</sub> index to explore the prognostic contribution from each. Therefore, we evaluated multivariable Cox models of RS with BPI, and separately, RS with SET<sub>ER/PR</sub> index while adjusting for treatment. In both models, RS was independently prognostic during years 0-5 (Table <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). BPI was independently prognostic from RS during years 0-5 (HR, 0.45; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; .001) and after 5 years (HR, 0.50; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = .001). In the other model, SET<sub>ER/PR</sub> index was independently prognostic from RS during years 0-5 (HR, 0.65; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = .014), but neither RS nor SET<sub>ER/PR</sub> index was prognostic after 5 years (Table <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">3</xref>).</p>

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>The universal use of chemotherapy in women with node-positive, ER+ breast cancer leads to overtreatment of a significant number of women who neither need nor benefit from such treatment. Genomic test results and clinicopathologic information can guide these recommendations for chemotherapy, but the utility of SET2,3 index in this patient population has not yet been evaluated. Our results demonstrated that SET2,3 added complementary prognostic information to RS results in the S8814 trial for postmenopausal patients with node-positive disease treated with tamoxifen, but did not predict benefit from CAF chemotherapy. Interestingly, the independent prognostic contribution from BPI was during the full 10 years of follow-up, perhaps because BPI combines purely prognostic information from tumor size, number of involved lymph nodes, and molecular subtype. We might expect the risk associated with a purely prognostic biomarker to persist during the full natural history of the disease. However, both the SET<sub>ER/PR</sub> index and RS contributed to prognosis during the 5 years of adjuvant treatment (possibly also a brief carryover period until years 6-7; Fig <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). This might be expected from a predictive biomarker if the discrimination between patient outcomes only lasts the duration of the benefit from the treatment itself.</p>
              <p>Unlike other prognostic biomarkers, SET2,3 was not correlated with RS.<sup><xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> The correlation coefficient for RS with SET2,3 was –0.04 in our analysis of 283 ER+ cancers from S8814, whereas the reported correlation coefficients of RS with PAM50 risk of recurrence (ROR) score, EndoPredict score, and Breast Cancer Index were 0.32, 0.63, and 0.35, respectively, in 785 ER+ cancers from the TransATAC trial.<sup><xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Visual inspection of the published scatterplots from the TransATAC analysis illustrated that few cancers with RS &gt; 25 have low-risk PAM50 ROR, EndoPredict, or Breast Cancer Index status.<sup><xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> However, we observed that 49% of tumors with RS &gt; 25 were classified as high SET2,3 index (high sensitivity to endocrine therapy adjusted for baseline prognosis) and those patients had better DFS than patients with RS &gt; 25 and low SET2,3, even in the tamoxifen-alone treatment arm. This has potential relevance for contemporary treatments for patients with high-risk ER+ cancer that are combined with endocrine therapy, for example, combining a cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitor with endocrine therapy. We think it would be informative to evaluate both RS and SET2,3 in that treatment setting.</p>
              <p>The TransATAC analysis of biomarkers also concluded that RS had more correlation with endocrine-related transcription and less correlation with proliferation than PAM50 ROR, EndoPredict, or Breast Cancer Index.<sup><xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Interestingly, we have demonstrated that the SET<sub>ER/PR</sub> index, the component of SET2,3 that was designed to measure endocrine-related transcriptional output that is not directly related to proliferation, by itself added independent prognostic information to RS. We interpret this as added information about endocrine activity in the tumor. Overall, we can interpret the added prognostic contribution from SET2,3 to be from both the inclusion of tumor size and nodal burden in the BPI, and the additional measure of endocrine activity from the SET<sub>ER/PR</sub> index. Hence, combination of SET2,3 and RS could improve prediction of sensitivity to endocrine therapy by RS alone, since these biomarkers are not correlated and SET2,3 alone predicted early response and long-term survival following neoadjuvant endocrine therapy in the Z1031 trial.<sup><xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Caution is advised if considering our results from S8814 in the postmenopausal population in RxPONDER. These populations differed in the proportion of tumors with RS &gt; 25 (38% in S8814 [Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">1</xref>], <italic toggle="yes">v</italic> 11% of patients screened for RxPONDER), number of involved lymph nodes (38% with ≥ 4 nodes involved in S8814, <italic toggle="yes">v</italic> only 1-3 nodes involved in RxPONDER, with only one node involved in 66% and including micrometastasis only), tumor stage (33% with pT1, <italic toggle="yes">v</italic> 59%), proportion with progesterone receptor–negative status (21% <italic toggle="yes">v</italic> 8%), likely human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)–positive status (12% estimated from gene expression level, <italic toggle="yes">v</italic> 0%), patients who received chemotherapy containing a taxane (0% <italic toggle="yes">v</italic> 96%), and the type of endocrine therapy (all tamoxifen, <italic toggle="yes">v</italic> 86% aromatase inhibitor).<sup><xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Essentially, the populations of S8814 and RxPONDER represent different eras in the management of node-positive ER+ breast cancer. Nevertheless, it would be important to study this combination of biomarkers in samples from RxPONDER.</p>
              <p>The combined results from two complementary tests could also be useful for patients with node-positive ER+ breast cancer of lower risk (such as RS ≤ 25), if they strengthen the prognostic basis for relying on endocrine therapy alone. In the recent RxPONDER trial, postmenopausal women with RS ≤ 25 did not benefit from chemotherapy, but RS remained prognostic in each treatment arm.<sup><xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Although the S8814 population had higher risk and received less effective adjuvant treatment than the patients in RxPONDER, patients from S8814 whose cancer had RS ≤ 25 and high SET2,3 had 5-year DFS of 97%, even in the tamoxifen alone treatment arm. We did observe that relapse after 5 years was associated with disease burden and molecular subtype (BPI), but not RS or SET<sub>ER/PR</sub> index. However, contemporary endocrine therapy is more effective and of longer duration, and this might influence the duration of their prognostic effect. Patients with node-positive ER+ breast cancer have increased prognostic risk and two tests may be reasonable to support a decision to de-escalate adjuvant treatment, if the tests are additive and independent. Our results suggest that combining SET2,3 and RS might improve prognostic assessment for node-positive patients with RS ≤ 25, to increase confidence in endocrine therapy alone. This needs to be confirmed in a second clinical trial.</p>
              <p>A limitation of our study is that SET2,3 was interpreted from wtRNAseq data, rather than tested on samples, albeit with calibration of the highly correlated measurements from these techniques using linear regression.<sup><xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Additionally, treatments in S8814 are no longer contemporary: chemotherapy did not include a taxane and endocrine therapy did not include aromatase inhibition. Additionally, S8814 predates HER2 testing and targeted therapy that might influence outcomes in this cohort. We estimate that 12% of samples might be from HER2-positive cancers, on the basis of RS measurements of <italic toggle="yes">ERBB2</italic> expression, with most of those having RS &gt; 25 and low SET2,3.<sup><xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup></p>
              <p>SET2,3 index testing is already being performed in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments–certified laboratory in the context of ongoing clinical trials under investigational device exemption from the US Food and Drug Administration (I-SPY, ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01042379" ext-link-type="uri">NCT01042379</ext-link>). It adds independent prognostic information to response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and has demonstrated ability to identify patients for whom neoadjuvant endocrine therapy would be appropriate.<sup><xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Added value of this test in the future would probably derive from its accurate measurement of endocrine transcriptional activity in the tumor to predict sensitivity to endocrine therapy, since that information is relevant to a patient's overall endocrine treatment strategy.</p>
              <p>In summary, the prognostic, chemopredictive, and endocrine predictive qualities of RS and SET2,3 provided clinically meaningful assessment of prognosis during the first 5 years of follow-up. Their combined results were stronger than either biomarker alone and were similar in both treatment arms. Thus, we conclude that SET2,3 is a biomarker with potential to improve the clinical performance of genomic testing of stage II-III breast cancer and deserves further evaluation of clinical utility.</p>
