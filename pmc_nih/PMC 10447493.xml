                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Preclinical studies suggest that blueberry consumption is associated with improved bone health.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Objectives</title>
                  <p>We conducted a blueberry dose-response study in ovariectomized (OVX)-rats that informed a study in postmenopausal women using the urinary appearance of calcium (Ca) tracers from prelabeled bone to reflect changes in bone balance. We hypothesized that blueberry consumption would reduce bone loss in a dose-dependent manner compared with no treatment.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>OVX rats were fed 4 doses of blueberry powder (2.5%, 5%, 10%, and 15%) in randomized order to determine bone <sup>45</sup>Ca retention. Fourteen healthy, nonosteoporotic women ≥4 y past menopause were dosed with 50 nCi of <sup>41</sup>Ca, a long-lived radioisotope, and equilibrated for 5 mo to allow <sup>41</sup>Ca deposition in bone. Following a 6-wk baseline period, participants were assigned to a random sequence of 3 6-wk interventions, a low (17.5 g/d), medium (35 g/d), or high (70 g/d) dose of freeze-dried blueberry powder equivalent to 0.75, 1.5, or 3 cups of fresh blueberries incorporated into food and beverage products. Urinary <sup>41</sup>Ca:Ca ratio was measured by accelerator mass spectrometry. Serum bone resorption biomarkers and urinary polyphenols were measured at the end of each control and intervention period. Data were analyzed using a linear mixed model and repeated measures analysis of variance.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>In both OVX rats and postmenopausal women, blueberry interventions benefited net bone calcium balance at lower but not at higher doses. In women, net bone calcium retention increased by 6% with the low (95% CI: 2.50, 8.60; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01) and 4% with the medium (95% CI: 0.96, 7.90; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) dose compared with no treatment. Urinary excretion of hippuric acid increased dose-dependently with blueberry consumption. No significant relationships were found between bone resorption biomarkers, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, and interventions.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>Moderate consumption (&lt;1 cup/d) of blueberries may be an effective strategy to attenuate bone loss in healthy postmenopausal women.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="p0010">Osteoporosis is the most common bone disease in older adults, characterized by low bone mass and increased fragility that can result in fractures at the spine, hip, or wrist [<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Women at menopause undergo a major and rapid decrease in estrogen secretion, causing a loss in bone mass that adds substantially to the increased incidence of age-related osteoporotic fracture [<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. During this period, the hormonal imbalance results in an increase in oxidative stress, which increases bone resorption and decreases bone formation resulting in rapid bone loss [<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Dietary flavonoid intakes were positively associated with bone mineral density (BMD) in a large sample of perimenopausal women [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p>
              <p id="p0015">Blueberries (Vaccinium spp.) are rich in polyphenols, including anthocyanins, phenolic acids, and flavan-3-ols [<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. These account for a total phenolic content ranging from 262 to 930 mg/100 mg fresh weight [<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], depending on the cultivar. Most bone-related benefits of blueberries have been demonstrated in preclinical models of ovariectomy-induced (OVX) bone loss. In this model, blueberry (BB) powder at doses as low as 1%-10% of the diet (w/w) administered for 5-14 wk prevented bone loss as assessed by BMD, decreased bone resorption, increased bone formation, and improved bone histomorphometry [<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>]. Several of the constituent polyphenols in blueberries were also shown to prevent bone loss in animal models. Oral administration of delphinidin, one of the major anthocyanidins in berries, at 10 mg/kg and 3 mg/kg significantly prevented bone loss in both the OVX- and the activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoporosis model [<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p>
              <p id="p0020">More recent preclinical studies suggest that the metabolites arising from bacterial fermentation of BB polyphenolics may be, in part, responsible for the bone-protective effects of BB. For instance, 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-propionic acid (3-OH-PPA) in mice increased bone volume, trabecular thickness, and osteoblastic cell number while decreasing the number of osteoclasts in vivo, and promoted cell differentiation toward osteoblasts in vitro [<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Hippuric acid derived from the serum of BB-fed rats decreased RANKL expression in bone marrow-derived stromal cells and decreased osteoclast resorptive activity [<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Both 3-OH-PPA and hippuric acid (2 phenolic acid metabolites that appear in the serum of BB diet–fed rats in the highest concentrations [<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]) from mice fed 10% BB diet suppressed osteoblast maturation, proliferation, and resorptive activity through RANKL-independent pathway [<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and increased bone mass dose-dependently [<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p>
              <p id="p0025">The aims of our studies were as follows: <italic>1)</italic> to conduct a proof-of-principle study in rats to determine whether an approach of a randomized crossover design with an outcome measure of the urinary appearance of a calcium tracer from prelabeled bone would be successful in evaluating a dose-response effect of BB feeding on bone calcium balance and <italic>2)</italic> to use a similar approach in postmenopausal women to evaluate the dose-response effect of BB powder added to a regular diet on net bone calcium retention<italic>.</italic> We initially hypothesized a positive dose-response effect of blueberries on bone; however, the rat study suggested that lower doses would be more effective at reducing bone loss in postmenopausal women<italic>.</italic></p>

                  <p id="p0030">This study was a randomized, crossover intervention to evaluate the dose-response effect of 2.5%, 5%, 10%, and 15% (w/w) freeze-dried BB diet on net bone calcium balance following the design previously reported [<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and shown in <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>. Twenty 4-mo-old female OVX Sprague Dawley rats (Harlan Laboratories) were individually housed in stainless steel wire-bottom cages with a 12-h on-off cycle. Rats were allowed to acclimate to their new environment and stabilize from ovariectomy for 75 d. On d 45, they were dosed via a tail-vein injection with 63 microcuries (μCi) of <sup>45</sup>Ca dissolved in 200 μl of sterile saline and allowed to equilibrate in bone. On d 65, 10 d prior to the determination of baseline <sup>45</sup>Ca excretion, rats were changed from a chow diet to an AIN93-M polyphenol-free diet (soybean oil replaced with corn oil, Research Diets). The BB diets were modified from the polyphenol-free diet by adjusting the quantities of sugars, maltodextrin, and cellulose that the BB powder displaced. The freeze-dried BB powder was provided by the Wild Blueberry Association of North America and freeze-dried by FutureCeuticals, Inc. The diets were prepared and pelleted under low-temperature conditions to avoid polyphenol degradation (Research Diets, Inc). Upon arrival, the diet was stored at −80°C, and weighed out portions for each rat were transferred to −20°C during treatment periods.</p>
                  <p id="p0035">Each intervention was provided for 10 d, followed by a 10-d nonintervention period. During baseline, intervention, and nonintervention periods, animals were placed in metabolic cages. Twenty-four h urine was collected, and <sup>45</sup>Ca was measured with the use of Beckman LS 6500 Scintillation counter (Beckman Instruments Inc) and total calcium by atomic absorption spectrometry (AAnalyst 300, PerkinElmer Instruments) to determine the urinary <sup>45</sup>Ca:Ca ratio.</p>

Each woman signed a written consent form and completed a screening that included height and weight measurements, a brief medical history, diet, and physical activity assessment. All participants were healthy, as verified by serum biochemistries, including a comprehensive metabolic panel. Exclusion criteria included having a history of metabolic bone disease, personal history or family history of low trauma fractures, personal history of cancer, thromboembolisms, clotting disorders, uncontrolled hypertension, uncontrolled thyroid function, malabsorption syndrome, seizure disorders, heart attack, or severe obesity (BMI &gt; 35 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). Subjects taking any medications for osteoporosis, including HRT or glucocorticoids within 6 mo or bisphosphonates within 2 y of the study and those who declined to discontinue the use of supplements of their own selection were also excluded.

During equilibration, participants collected 24-h urine monthly and biweekly during the subsequent baseline period to monitor <sup>41</sup>Ca urinary excretion.<fig id="fig2"><label>FIGURE 2</label><caption><p>Human study design. Participants were dosed with <sup>41</sup>Ca and completed a 5-mo equilibration, a 6-wk baseline, and a random sequence of 3 interventions, each followed by a 6-wk washout. Urine was collected over 24 h weekly during the intervention and every 3 wk during washout for the assessment of primary outcome, net bone calcium retention. Secondary outcomes, including bone metabolism biomarkers, serum calcium, vitamin D, and urinary polyphenolics, were measured in fasting blood collected at the end of each study period.</p></caption><alt-text id="alttext0020">FIGURE 2</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr2"/></fig></p>
                <p id="p0065">After baseline, participants were randomly assigned to a sequence of 3 intervention periods, each corresponding to a low (17.5 g/d), medium (35 g/d), or high (70 g/d) dose of freeze-dried BB powder equivalent to 0.75, 1.5, or 3 cups of fresh blueberries. Each intervention lasted for 6 wk and was followed by a 6-wk washout period, determined to be optimal by simulation modeling of data from prior studies. Participants were instructed to maintain their usual exercise and dietary habits during the study. The intervention products were provided in a double-blind manner between February and November 2018. Products were coded by research staff prior to dispensing them to the participants by the study coordinator. Unconsumed foods were collected weekly during each intervention to monitor adherence. Participants received a list of polyphenol-rich foods to avoid and/or limit. Participants were instructed to complete a 4-d dietary record at the end of baseline and each intervention and washout period to quantify habitual intakes of energy and bone-relevant nutrients. The records were analyzed with the use of the Nutrition Data System for Research (2018 ed.; University of Minnesota). Participants collected 24-h urine weekly during the intervention and every 3 wks during washout to monitor <sup>41</sup>Ca excretion. Urinary creatinine concentrations were measured in 24-h urine to check for collection completeness. To minimize attrition and maintain adherence, participants received weekly e-mail reminders and calendars to check off all completed specimen collections, questionnaires, and dietary records.</p>

This effect size was based on our previous studies using nutritional interventions with a primary outcome of bone calcium retention [<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The primary response variable in this study was the log of the <sup>41</sup>Ca:Ca ratio. For each subject, a simple linear regression model was fit through all nontreatment values to create a regression line, and the predicted <sup>41</sup>Ca:Ca ratio for each 24-h urine collection during the intervention was subtracted from the observed value. The means of these differences were computed for each individual and averaged across individuals to provide estimates of treatment effects. Results were back transformed to the original scale and expressed in terms of net bone calcium retention. Bootstrap resampling was used to calculate 95% CIs. Our bootstrap had 2 levels of sampling, i.e., sampling subjects (to assess variation between subjects) and sampling residuals (to assess within-subject variation). After obtaining the prediction curves for each subject and collecting all the residuals from the model used to obtain these curves, we first performed with-replacement sampling from the subjects 14 times. Then, we applied random selection with the replacement of residuals from the original model to obtain a bootstrap data set. We performed this procedure 1000 times, and from each bootstrap data set, we obtained an estimate for % bone calcium retention. We then used these estimates to obtain bootstrap CIs from the empirical bootstrap distributions for each treatment. To examine the effect of BB dose, the 3 treatments were analyzed in a repeated measures mixed model that included treatment, serum polyphenol concentrations, and the interaction. Linear mixed models were used to test participant characteristics, serum polyphenols, and biochemical bone markers to predict response in % bone calcium retention. Bone biochemistry data (RANKL, RANKL/OPG ratio, and P1NP) and urinary polyphenolics and their metabolites were analyzed by RM ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s post hoc test.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="p0130">Freeze-dried BB powder at lower to moderate doses, but not higher doses, increased bone calcium balance in both OVX rats and healthy postmenopausal women. The rat study informed the doses chosen in the clinical study. In postmenopausal women, the effective doses were 17.5 g/d (best) and 35 g/d. The low dose BB improved bone balance by 6%, the equivalent of 41 g of total body calcium. In addition, a bone resorption marker RANKL was significantly reduced by the medium dose of BB powder. Bone formation marker P1NP was also reduced, suggesting a reduction in bone turnover overall, although it did not predict the urinary <sup>41</sup>Ca excretion, likely due to the higher variance in bone biomarkers as indicators of bone turnover compared with the more sensitive <sup>41</sup>Ca:Ca ratio. Neither the consumption of BB powder nor its dose influenced other bone metabolism markers, serum calcium, or 25(OH)D. The consumption of BB powder dose-dependently increased the urinary excretion of hippuric acid, a common end-stage metabolite of several BB polyphenols, and a stimulator of osteoblast maturation and proliferation [<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p>
              <p id="p0135">The lack of linear dose-response relationship is consistent with a report in OVX rats that a 100-d treatment with 5% (w/w semipurified diet) powdered freeze-dried blackberry, another polyphenol-rich fruit with similar phenolic content as BB, resulted in modest protection of tibial and femoral BMD, but no effect was seen with the higher dose of 10% [<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. This is indicative of a hormetic effect [<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], whereby low doses provide a beneficial effect, whereas higher doses exert either a null or negative effect.</p>
              <p id="p0140">There are several possible mechanisms by which the hormetic effect could be mediated, including cellular redox status, bone osteoblast, and osteoclast activities, and changes in gut microbial composition. The high levels of polyphenols in BB are thought to be the bioactive components that might act as antioxidants, reducing oxidative stress and, therefore, preventing bone loss. Sato et al. [<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] showed that BB increased the endogenous antioxidant response by bypassing the traditional antioxidant transcription factor Nrf2 in female but not male mice, and the effect was BB cultivar dependent. BB feeding also protected from estrogen deficiency, preserved bone, skeletal muscle, and body composition, and elicited antioxidant defense responses independently of classical antioxidant/estrogenic signaling. Similarly, BB increased both Alpha (within sample) and Beta (among sample) diversity of the gut microbiome and increased the prevalence of the taxon Ruminococcus1 in females but not males. Cladis et al. [<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] evaluated the dose-response effect of BB polyphenols on gut microbial and phenolic metabolite profiles in OVX rats. Both Alpha and Beta diversity of gut microbial populations increased with low to moderate doses of BB polyphenols but decreased with high doses, indicating a hormetic effect of BB polyphenols on the gut microbiota. Changes in microbial diversity and phenol metabolites were highly correlated, suggesting a potential interaction between host and gut microbiome metabolism, which may be disrupted at high doses of BB phenols. The authors speculated that higher doses of BB polyphenols might saturate metabolite pathways in the lower gut. In a subsequent study, freeze-dried BB at a dose equivalent to 1-2 cups of fresh BB in humans did not benefit BMD or bone mechanical properties [<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], consistent with the finding that higher doses do not offer additional benefits. Disruption of microbial metabolism at high doses may provide a clue to the mechanism underlying the hormetic effect observed in the present study, whereby high doses of BB have a negative effect on the gut microbiota and, subsequently, a null effect on bone health. Future studies to investigate the mechanisms causing the hormetic response are needed to evaluate this hypothesis.</p>

                <title>Strengths and limitations</title>
                <p id="p0145">Strengths of this paper include an agreement in the hormesis effect of BB with an animal model of postmenopausal women and a clinical study of postmenopausal women, the continued monitoring of a highly sensitive measure of bone balance, and mechanistic measures of polyphenol metabolites and gut microbiome profiles. The crossover design minimizes the potential confounding of the effect of BB on bone. Limitations include the use of a small convenience sample that lacked racial diversity and representation of the general population, thus, limiting the generalizability of the results. The long-term effects of BB consumption at different doses remain to be elucidated among postmenopausal women.</p>
                <p id="p0150">In conclusion, daily consumption of foods containing freeze-dried BB powder in the amount equivalent to 0.75 and 1.5 cups of blueberries, but not 3 cups, increased net bone calcium retention, indicative of a hormetic response and/or a possible negative gut microbiome-polyphenol interaction at higher doses. The effectiveness of a serving of blueberries in attenuating bone loss in healthy postmenopausal women demonstrates that a relatively short and accessible dietary intervention may prevent or delay bone loss without the side effects of conventional pharmacologic therapies. This practical dietary approach with food that already has a health connotation for consumers is likely to be well received by the public seeking osteoporosis prevention strategies.</p>
