                  <title>Purpose:</title>
                  <p>Viral infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT). In the absence of safe and effective antiviral treatments, virus-specific T cells have emerged as a promising therapeutic option. Posoleucel is a multivirus-specific T-cell therapy for off-the-shelf use against six viral infections that commonly occur in allo-HCT recipients: adenovirus, BK virus (BKV), cytomegalovirus, Epstein–Barr virus, human herpes virus-6, and JC virus.</p>

                  <title>Patients and Methods:</title>
                  <p>We conducted an open-label, phase II trial to determine the feasibility and safety of posoleucel in allo-HCT recipients infected with one or more of these viruses. Infections were either unresponsive to or patients were unable to tolerate standard antiviral therapies. Fifty-eight adult and pediatric patients were enrolled and treated.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Results:</title>
                  <p>Posoleucel was well tolerated, with no cytokine release syndrome or other infusion-related toxicities; two patients (3.4%) developed Grade 2 and one patient (1.7%) Grade 3 GvHD during the trial. The overall response rate 6 weeks after the first posoleucel infusion was 95%, with a median plasma viral load reduction of 97%. Of the 12 patients who had two or more target viral infections identified at study entry, 10 (83%) had a clinical response for all evaluable viruses. Of the 23 patients treated for refractory BKV-associated hemorrhagic cystitis, 74% had resolution of symptoms and macroscopic hematuria by 6 weeks post-infusion.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions:</title>
                  <p>In this open-label trial, treatment of refractory viral infections/disease in allo-HCT recipients with posoleucel was feasible, safe, and effective.</p>

In the absence of safe and effective antiviral treatments, virus-specific T cells have emerged as a promising therapeutic option. Posoleucel is a multivirus-specific T-cell therapy for off-the-shelf use against six viral infections that commonly complicate allo-HCT. Fifty-eight allo-HCT recipients with refractory viral infections were enrolled in a phase II clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of posoleucel. Posoleucel proved to be highly effective with clinical responses observed in 95% of patients. These efficacy data combined with a favorable safety profile and immediate product availability suggest that posoleucel is a promising therapeutic option in this context. Therefore, posoleucel is currently being investigated in three randomized phase 3 clinical trials for therapeutic and preventative indications.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Viral infections remain a major cause of morbidity and mortality for patients undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). The use of traditional antiviral agents for the treatment of these infections is limited by suboptimal efficacy, development of drug resistance, and frequent toxicity (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Donor-derived virus-specific T cells (VST) have emerged as a promising therapeutic option for refractory viral infections (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2–4</xref>). However, this approach is often complicated by the lack of immune memory to target viruses in some donors (e.g., cord blood), donor availability, and the time required for manufacture and release testing.</p>
              <p>One way to overcome these limitations is through the prospective creation of banks of third-party VSTs from healthy, seropositive donors for off-the-shelf administration (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5, 6</xref>). Posoleucel (previously ALVR105) is an off-the-shelf multi-VST designed for administration as a partially HLA-matched product for the treatment or prevention of viral infections or disease due to adenovirus (AdV), BK virus (BKV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), human herpes virus-6 (HHV-6), and JC virus (JCV) in immunocompromised patients. This phase II trial was the first to evaluate an off-the-shelf multi-VST that simultaneously targets six viruses. Interim results on the first 38 patients who received posoleucel were published previously (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). We now report results for the entire cohort of 58 patients treated in this trial.</p>

              <title>Patients and Methods</title>
              <p>This open-label, single-arm, phase II study, which was approved by the FDA and the Baylor College of Medicine institutional review board, was open to patients who had undergone allo-HCT from any donor source from day 28 after transplant. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients and the studies were conducted in accordance with recognized ethical guidelines (Declaration of Helsinki, US Common Rule). The 59 posoleucel lines used in this phase II study were manufactured as previously described (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). If eligibility criteria were met and a suitable, partially HLA-matched posoleucel line was identified, patients could consent to treatment. A full list of inclusion and exclusion criteria is available on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02108522). Treatment consisted of a single intravenous infusion of 2 × 10<sup>7</sup>/m<sup>2</sup> of posoleucel with the option to receive a second infusion after four weeks and additional infusions at biweekly intervals thereafter. Therapy with standard antiviral medications could be continued at the discretion of the treating physician. Immune monitoring was performed weekly for 6 weeks post-infusion using IFNγ ELIspot analysis as described previously (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). A positive response was defined as an increase in virus-specific, IFNγ-producing spot forming cells (SFC) or the detection of ≥10 SFC in patients with a previously negative result to antigen stimulation.</p>

                <p>Acute grade 3 to 4 GVHD within 42 days of the last dose of posoleucel, and grade 3 to 5 non-hematologic adverse events related to posoleucel within 28 days of the last infusion. Patients were also monitored for chronic GVHD for 12 months. Toxicities were graded by the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE), version 4.0.</p>

                <title>Efficacy endpoints</title>
                <p>Antiviral response was assessed six weeks after the first dose of posoleucel. Complete response (CR) was defined as return of viral load to normal range as defined by the specific assay used (Q-PCR in all reported patients) as well as resolution of clinical signs and symptoms. Partial response (PR) was defined as a viral load reduction of ≥50% by Q-PCR or a 50% improvement of clinical signs and symptoms in patients with assessable symptomatic disease (NCI-CTCAE v4.0 criteria). Stable disease was defined as changes insufficient to qualify as PR or progression. Progressive disease (PD) was defined as an increase in viral load of at least 50% from baseline or dissemination to other sites of disease.</p>

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p>Descriptive statistics were calculated to summarize clinical characteristics. One patient was enrolled twice for treatment of AdV and JCV. Both infusions for this patient were included in the safety and efficacy analyses. The proportion of clinical responses (i.e., PR or CR) was calculated and presented by virus type. In addition, the exact 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the binomial proportions were presented. Viral response was presented both as separate endpoints for each virus (i.e., as a proportion of patients with a given virus at baseline who had a PR or CR at time of assessment) and as one cumulative response endpoint (proportions of the total population with PR or CR in at least one virus at the time of assessment). Comparisons between groups were made using Fisher's exact tests for categorical variables. Overall response was defined as achieving CR/PR by 6 weeks post-infusion and summarized along with exact 95% binomial CIs. The percentage of change over time from baseline in viral load was calculated. Boxplots were generated to visually show viral reduction over time.</p>

Seventeen patients receiving more than one infusion were, therefore, evaluable for efficacy. In these patients, the reasons for repeat infusions were diverse, but usually due to incomplete response or recurrence after initial response. Depending on the response to the first posoleucel infusion, evaluable patients received a cell line from the same donor (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 9) or a different donor (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 8) for the second infusion at a median of 42 days (IQR 28–75 days) following the first infusion.

However, even preceding posoleucel administration, this patient exhibited poor graft function requiring G-CSF administration. Notably, the patient had also been receiving rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol for disseminated mycobacterium tuberculosis infection with bone marrow involvement, which may have further contributed to graft failure.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>For patients who undergo allo-HCT, the months between pretransplant conditioning and reconstitution of immune function are a period of great risk. Despite advances in prophylaxis, up to 90% of allo-HCT patients experience reactivation of at least one virus and almost two thirds of patients develop infections with more than one virus, further increasing their risk for morbidity and mortality (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p>
              <p>In this Phase II trial, we administered posoleucel to 58 allo-HCT recipients suffering from refractory viral infections. To our knowledge, this is the largest study to date using a third-party, off-the-shelf, multi-VST product and the only study using a VST product designed to target the six most commonly identified viruses in this setting simultaneously. Our data suggest promising clinical efficacy of posoleucel with the vast majority of patients (95%) experiencing clinical benefit by the sixth week post-infusion. The high rate of response (83%) among the 12 patients with more than one viral infection at baseline suggests that posoleucel has the potential to treat multiple viruses that occur in immunocompromised patients.</p>
              <p>One of the most appealing aspects of using third-party, off-the-shelf multi-VSTs, is the rapid product availability, which mitigates any potential delays in treatment of these often life-threatening viral infections. Indeed, from a bank of 59 posoleucel VST lines, we were able to identify a suitable line for 58/60 (97%) of screened and eligible patients, allowing treatment of local patients within 48 hours. Clinical benefit was achieved even with posoleucel matched on a single HLA allele, though the majority of patients received lines matched at a median of two alleles.</p>
              <p>Posoleucel is derived from healthy, seropositive third-party donors rather than being an autologous or HLA-matched HCT donor source. Hence, there is theoretically an increased risk of GVHD. However, the incidence of <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> or worsening GVHD in our study—beyond the development of mild, transient rashes—was low, in line with comparable studies using third-party VSTs and not higher in incidence or severity than that seen in allogeneic HCT patients not infused with VSTs (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13–17</xref>). This is likely attributable to the fact that posoleucel is enriched for virus-reactive T cells and consists almost entirely of cells with a central and effector memory phenotype without overt allo-reactivity. Hence, absent viral peptides, these T cells remain quiescent.</p>
              <p>More than one third of patients enrolled in this study received posoleucel for the treatment of BKV-induced HC. In the absence of effective antiviral treatments, BK-HC management has historically relied primarily on supportive care. An effective treatment of BK-HC may positively impact morbidity, including kidney damage, prolonged hospitalization, and increased healthcare costs associated with this complication (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Our findings of rapid resolution of hemorrhagic cystitis in the vast majority of posoleucel recipients are consistent with recent reports by Nelson and colleagues and Olson and colleagues (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14, 13</xref>).</p>
              <p>Given the unknown rate of spontaneous viral clearance and normal biological fluctuation in the viruses under consideration, the interpretation of the results of this uncontrolled trial is necessarily limited, in particular for EBV, HHV-6, and JCV, where the number of enrolled patients was low.</p>
              <p>In summary, results of our trial suggest that posoleucel is a safe and effective therapy for the treatment of severe viral infections following allogeneic HCT. Its use might aid in alleviating the morbidity and mortality associated with post-HCT viral infections and helps avoid the nephrotoxic and myelosuppressive side effects associated with the use of conventional antiviral medications. On the basis of these promising findings, posoleucel is currently being evaluated in three randomized phase III trials for both treatment and preventive indications.</p>
