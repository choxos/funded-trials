            <p id="P3">Monotherapy of HIV-1 infection with single antiretroviral agents is ineffective because error-prone HIV-1 replication leads to the production of drug-resistant viral variants<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. Combinations of drugs can establish long-term control, however, antiretroviral therapy (ART) requires daily dosing, can cause side effects and does not eradicate the infection<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. Although anti-HIV-1 antibodies constitute a potential alternative to ART<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>, treatment of viremic individuals with a single antibody also results in emergence of resistant viral variants<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>–<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. Moreover, combinations of first generation anti-HIV‐1 broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) had little measurable effect on the infection<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. Here we report on a phase 1b clinical trial (NCT02825797) in which two potent bNAbs, 3BNC117<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> and 10–1074<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>, were administered to 7 HIV-1 viremic individuals in combination. Infusions of 30 mg/kg of each of the antibodies were well tolerated. In the 4 individuals with dual antibody-sensitive viruses, immunotherapy resulted in an average reduction in HIV-1 viral load of 2.05 log<sub>10</sub> copies/ml that remained significantly reduced for 3 months following the first of up to three infusions. In addition, none of these individuals developed resistance to both antibodies. Larger studies will be necessary to confirm the efficacy of antibody combinations in reducing HIV-1 viremia and limiting the emergence of resistant viral variants.</p>
            <p id="P4">3BNC117 and 10–1074 are potent broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) that target the CD4 binding site and the base of the V3 loop on the HIV-1 envelope spike, respectively<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. Infusion of the combination of 3BNC117 and 10–1074 during ART interruption maintains suppression of viremia and prevents the emergence of resistant variants<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>.</p>
            <p id="P5">Controlling infection in viremic individuals represents a much more difficult problem than maintaining suppression in ART-treated individuals undergoing treatment interruption simply because of the large diversity of circulating HIV-1 variants present during active infection. Thus, although monotherapy with any one of 3 different bNAbs reduced viremia by 1.1 – 1.5 log<sub>10</sub>, these effects were transient and superseded by the emergence of antibody-resistant viral variants<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>–<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. To determine whether the combination of 3BNC117 and 10–1074 is safe and results in improved antiviral activity against HIV-1 as compared to monotherapy we conducted a phase 1b trial in viremic individuals.</p>
            <p id="P6">Viremic participants were selected from a cohort that was screened for sensitivity to 3BNC117 and 10–1074 by TZM-bl assays performed on viruses derived from bulk CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell outgrowth cultures (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. In agreement with previous reports, 67% and 58% of the individuals tested showed IC<sub>50</sub>s &lt; 2μg/ml to 3BNC117 and 10–1074, respectively, and 40% were sensitive to both (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. The seven viremic participants had been diagnosed for a median of 5 years and had a geometric mean viral load of 11,494 copies/ml on the day of the first infusion (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref> and <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Tables 2</xref> and <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">3</xref>). In addition, eight individuals on ART with viral loads below the limit of detection were included for safety and pharmacokinetic assessments (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref> and <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Tables 2</xref> and <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">3</xref>).</p>
            <p id="P7">Participants received either a single intravenous infusion of 3BNC117 and 10–1074 at a dose of 30 mg/kg per antibody, or three infusions of 30 mg/kg per antibody every two weeks (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). Viral loads, antibody serum levels, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell counts and clinical parameters were monitored for 24 weeks after the last antibody infusion (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Tables 3</xref> and <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">4</xref>).</p>
            <p id="P8">Administration of both antibodies was well tolerated. No serious adverse events or treatment-related adverse events graded as moderate or severe were observed (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell counts did not change significantly during the observation period (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref> and <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). We conclude that the combination of 3BNC117 and 10–1074 is generally safe and well tolerated.</p>
            <p id="P9">3BNC117 and 10–1074 antibody levels were determined by ELISA using anti-idiotypic antibodies and by the TZM-bl assay that measures the antibodies’ neutralizing activities in serum. In viremic individuals, the half-lives of 3BNC117 and 10–1074 were 11.1 and 12.2 days when measured by ELISA, and 8.5 and 11.5 days when determined by the TZM-bl assay, respectively (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>, <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref> and <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Tables 3</xref> and <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">5</xref>). In ART-treated individuals, half-lives of 3BNC117 and 10–1074 were 14.5 and 19.0 days by ELISA, and 11.5 and 18.4 days in the TZM-bl assay, respectively (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>, <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref> and <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 5</xref>). Viremic individuals generally showed lower antibody half-lives than individuals on ART with suppressed viral loads, possibly due to an antigen sink effect<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. Overall, these values are consistent with the results obtained when both antibodies were administered individually (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. Thus, pharmacokinetics of 3BNC117 and 10–1074 do not appear to be altered when the antibodies are administered in combination.</p>
            <p id="P10">Plasma HIV-1 RNA levels were measured on a weekly basis for 4 weeks after antibody infusions and every 2–4 weeks thereafter (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a-c</xref>, <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref> and <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). The average drop in viral load for all viremic individuals was 1.65 log<sub>10</sub> copies/ml and viremia remained significantly reduced until day 86 (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>). The 4 individuals with sensitive viruses (see below) showed a more pronounced drop in viral load compared with the other individuals (average of 2.05 log<sub>10</sub> copies/ml) and were significantly suppressed until day 94 (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a,e-f</xref>). In comparison to a single infusion of either 3BNC117<sup>7</sup> or 10–1074<sup>8</sup>, viremic individuals receiving one or three infusions of the combination of both antibodies showed significantly prolonged viral suppression (<italic>P</italic>=0.00018) (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>, <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). We conclude that the combination of 3BNC117 and 10–1074 is more effective in suppressing viremia than either antibody alone.</p>
            <p id="P11">Despite the pronounced difference in the duration of viremia reduction between monotherapy and combination therapy, there was considerable variation in the response of individual participants receiving 3BNC117 and 10–1074 combination treatment (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). To define the relationship between individual responses to antibody therapy and circulating virus sensitivity to the antibodies we performed single genome amplification (SGA) of plasma viruses. 382 intact full-length <italic>env</italic> sequences were initially analyzed from the 7 viremic participants (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). All of these individuals were infected with epidemiologically distinct clade B viruses (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). In addition, sequences isolated from circulating virus at the time of viral rebound were polyclonal, and as expected for viremic individuals, recombination events were detected between circulating viruses in most individuals (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b,c</xref>).</p>
            <p id="P12">Pseudoviruses constructed from plasma SGA were tested for bNAb sensitivity in TZM-bl assay (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>, and <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 6</xref>). 91C33, the individual that failed to respond to therapy, had preexisting circulating viruses that were resistant to both antibodies. These viruses carried mutations in 3BNC117 contact sites (N280S and A281H) and in 10–1074 contact sites (N332T and S334N, <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref> and <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 6</xref>). Two individuals, 91C35 and 9341, responded to antibody therapy with a decrease in viremia of −1.58 and −1.32 log<sub>10</sub> copies/ml but HIV-1 RNA levels returned to baseline within 3 and 4 weeks, respectively (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). 91C35 was found to have pre-infusion circulating viruses with reduced sensitivity to 3BNC117, and carried a CD4 contact residue mutation (A281T) that was associated with viral escape from 3BNC117 (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>, <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref> and <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 6</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. Pre-infusion viruses derived from bulk CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell outgrowth cultures of 9341 showed a 10–1074 IC<sub>80</sub> which was 1.3 log<sub>10</sub> higher than the geometric mean IC<sub>80</sub> of all other enrolled viremic individuals (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). In both of these cases, rebounding viruses were resistant to both antibodies and carried mutations resulting in the loss of the potential <italic>N</italic>-linked glycosylation site at position 332 that is critical for 10–1074 binding (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a, b</xref>, <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>, <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref> and <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 6</xref>). In addition, 91C35 and 9341 rebound viruses contained G471E and N276D mutations, respectively, that are associated with increased resistance to 3BNC117<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. These mutations were not found in the pre-infusion circulating viruses described above or in additional 113 pre-infusion <italic>env</italic> sequences that were analyzed from these two participants (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 8</xref>). Thus, 91C35 and 9341 were infected with viruses with reduced sensitivity to one of the two antibodies and resemble individuals that received antibody monotherapy, both in the magnitude of the drop in viremia and time required to return to baseline viremia<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>–<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. We conclude that the bulk outgrowth cultures used for initial screening failed to detect partial or complete pre-existing resistance against one or both of the antibodies in 3 of the 7 individuals studied.</p>
            <p id="P13">The four remaining individuals showed no detectable pre-existing resistant viruses in circulation and experienced significantly suppressed viremia until day 94 after the first antibody infusion with an average maximum drop in viral load of −2.05 log<sub>10</sub> copies/ml (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a, e</xref>, <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref> and <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 6</xref>). The individual in this group with the highest initial viral load (97,800 copies/ml; 9343) was the first to rebound at 8 weeks (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>, <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). The 2 individuals with the lowest initial viral loads, 91C22 and 9342 (750 and 2,550 copies/ml, respectively), demonstrated suppression to near or below the limit of detection for 12 and 16 weeks, respectively (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>, <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). Finally, viremia in participant 91C34 was reduced for a period of 12 weeks but never dropped below 810 copies/ml. Despite the persistent viremia, no resistance against both antibodies developed in this individual for as long as bNAb serum levels were above 10 μg/ml (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>, <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref> and <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 3</xref>).</p>
            <p id="P14">In 3 of the 4 initially sensitive individuals, rebound viremia was associated with the appearance of viruses that were resistant to 10–1074, but remained sensitive to 3BNC117 (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>, and <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 6</xref>). This is consistent with the relatively shorter half-life of 3BNC117, which means that participants were effectively exposed to 10–1074 monotherapy at the end of the observation period. In accordance with the increased resistance to 10–1074, rebound viruses carried mutations in 10–1074 contact sites (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>, <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref> and <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). In contrast, there was no accumulation of <italic>de novo</italic> mutations in 3BNC117 contact sites (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>, <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref> and <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). 91C22, the participant with the lowest initial viral load, only returned to baseline viremia after both antibodies were below the limit of detection, and rebound viruses remained sensitive to both antibodies (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>, <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>, <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 3</xref> and <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 6</xref>). Overall none of the 4 participants that were initially sensitive to the two antibodies developed <italic>de novo</italic> resistance to 3BNC117 over a cumulative observation period of over 1 year (56 weeks), despite the residual viremia observed in three of these participants and frequent recombination events between circulating viruses (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>).</p>
            <p id="P15">Combination bNAb therapy for HIV-1 in humans showed a number of similarities with bNAb therapy for macaques infected with SHIV<sub>AD8</sub>. For example, suppression was incomplete in macaques with higher initial viral loads, but despite persistent low-level viremia there was no emergence of 3BNC117 and 10–1074 double resistant variants<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. In contrast to the macaque infection with a clonal virus, each of the 4 antibody sensitive individuals in this study was infected with a uniquely diverse swarm of viruses. Thus, the relative difficulty of HIV-1 to develop resistance to the combination of 3BNC117 and 10–1074 is not limited to any particular strain of HIV-1. Macaque CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses can control viremia and this type of cellular immunity can be enhanced by bNAb therapy<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells have also been implicated in HIV-1 control in humans<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. Whether such responses can also be enhanced by immunotherapy in humans remains to be determined.</p>
            <p id="P16">3BNC117 and 10–1074 target distinct epitopes on the Env trimer. 3BNC117 interacts with the CD4 binding site, which is critical for HIV-1 binding to its cellular receptor CD4. Thus, escape mutations from 3BNC117 are limited by the requirement of continued affinity to CD4 and are associated with reduction in viral fitness<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>. Combinations of just 2 antibodies that synergize to further restrict viral escape may be even more effective than 3BNC117 and 10–1074<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>.</p>
            <p id="P17">Should antibodies enter clinical practice for HIV-1, adequate safeguards will be required to minimize the emergence of resistant variants. Reliable screening methods that identify viral resistance against individual drugs facilitate the selection of antiretroviral drug combinations with full activity. In contrast, the culture-based method used to screen for resistance in this study failed to detect partial or complete pre-existing antibody resistance in 3 of the 7 viremic participants. This is likely due to outgrowth of a limited set of viruses <italic>in vitro</italic> that fails to represent the entire population that is circulating or archived <italic>in vivo</italic><sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. Sequence-based screening methods that encompass a much larger group of viruses are currently being developed and should be far more effective than the bulk cultures.</p>
            <p id="P18">This study highlights some of the limitations of immunotherapy with the combination of 3BNC117 and 10–1074 in viremic individuals. 3BNC117 and 10–1074 infusions failed to suppress viremia to undetectable levels in the two dual antibody-sensitive individuals with the highest pre-infusion viral load despite persistent reductions for up to 12 weeks. Sustained suppression of plasma HIV-1 RNA levels to below 20 copies/ml was only achieved in individual 91C22 who had the lowest pre-infusion viral load (730 copies/ml). Thus, whereas 2 antibodies may be sufficient to achieve and/or maintain suppression in sensitive individuals with very low levels of viremia or ART-suppressed individuals undergoing ATI<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>, additional antibodies or combinations of small molecule drugs and antibodies would be required if this type of therapy is to be considered for viremic individuals.</p>
            <p id="P19">This trial was limited to 3 bNAb infusions but despite the small number of infusions, sensitive individuals maintained reductions in viral load for up to 3 months after the last infusion. In the case of anti-RSV antibodies and the anti-HIV-1 antibody VRC01, antibody half-life can be increased by up to more than a factor of 4 by mutations that alter binding to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRN)<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>–<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>. In macaques, the same half-life extension mutations lead to a significant increase in the half-life and protective efficacy of 3BNC117 and 10–1074<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>. Should they also do so in humans, intermittent infusions of combinations of antibodies or antibodies plus long acting antiretroviral drugs every 3–6 months might be an alternative to daily ART.</p>

The required stock volume of 3BNC117 or 10–1074 was calculated according to body weight and diluted in sterile normal saline to a total volume of 250 ml. Each monoclonal antibody was administered intravenously over 60 minutes. Both antibodies were administered individually and sequentially. Study participants were observed at the Rockefeller University Hospital or the University Hospital Cologne for four hours (groups 1A-C) or one hour (group 3) after the last antibody infusion. Participants returned for scheduled follow-up visits for safety assessments, which included physical examination as indicated and measurements of clinical laboratory parameters such as hematology, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell counts, chemistries, urinalysis and pregnancy tests. Plasma HIV-1 RNA levels were monitored at each visit. Study investigators evaluated and graded adverse events according to the Division of AIDS (DAIDS) Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events (version 2.0, November 2014) and determined the causality of events. Blood samples were collected before and at multiple times after the infusions of 3BNC117 and 10–1074 or placebo. Samples were processed within 4 h of collection. Serum and plasma samples were stored at −80°C. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated by density gradient centrifugation and the absolute number of PBMCs was determined by an automated cell counter (Vi-Cell XR; Beckman Coulter) or manually.

                <p id="P25">This assay was performed as previously described<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. Briefly, serum samples were heat-inactivated for one hour at 56°C and tested using a primary 1:20 dilution and a 5-fold titration series against HIV-1 Env pseudoviruses Q769.d22 and X2088_c9. These pseudoviruses are highly sensitive to neutralization by 3BNC117 and 10–1074, respectively, and fully resistant against the other administered antibody. If serum titers exceeded 100,000 against X2088_c9, immediate post-infusion levels of 10–1074 were also determined using the less sensitive Du422 strain. 3BNC117 and 10–1074 clinical drug products were tested in parallel at a starting concentration of 10 μg/ml with a 5-fold titration series. Pseudoviruses were produced with an ART-resistant backbone vector that reduces the inhibitory activity of antiretroviral drugs (SG3ΔEnv/K101P.Q148H.Y181C, M. S. Seaman unpublished data). In viremic indivduals, serum concentrations of 3BNC117 and 10–1074 were calculated by multiplying the determined ID<sub>50</sub> titer of the respective serum sample and the determined IC<sub>50</sub> concentration of each monoclonal standard antibody. In individuals on ART serum bNAb concentrations were calculated using the ID<sub>80</sub> serum titers and IC<sub>80</sub>s of the monoclonal antibodies as described above to minimize the impact of nonspecific ART-mediated background activity. Viruses pseudotyped with the envelope protein murine leukemia virus (MuLV) were used as negative control and measurements were excluded if nonspecific serum activity against MuLV-pseudotyped viruses was observed (ID<sub>50</sub> or ID<sub>80</sub> &gt; 20 in viremic individuals or individuals on ART, respectively). All assays were performed in a laboratory meeting GCLP standards. The lower limit of detection was determined to be 0.24 μg/ml and 0.10 μg/ml for the 3BNC117 and 10–1074 TZM-bl assay, respectively.</p>

                <p id="P26">3BNC117 and 10–1074 serum concentrations were measured by a validated sandwich ELISA. High bind polystyrene plates were coated overnight at 2–8°C with 4 μg/ml of an anti-idiotypic antibody that specifically recognizes 3BNC117 (anti-ID 1F1–2E3 mAb) or 2μg/ml of an anti-idiotypic antibody specifically recognizing 10–1074 (anti-ID 3A1–4E11 mAb). After washing, plates were blocked with 5% Milk Blotto (w/v), 5% NGS (v/v), and 0.05% Tween 20 (v/v) in PBS. Serum samples, QCs and standards were added (1:50 minimum dilution in 5% Milk Blotto (w/v), 5% NGS (v/v), and 0.05% Tween 20 (v/v) in PBS) and incubated at room temperature. A horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated mouse anti-human IgG kappa-chain-specific antibody (Abcam) was used to detect 3BNC117 and an HRP-conjugated goat antihuman IgG Fc-specific antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) to detect 10–1074. For detection, the HRP substrate tetra-methylbenzidine was added. A 5-PL curve fitting-algorithm (Softmax Pro, v. 5.4.5) was used to calculate serum 3BNC117 and 10–1074 concentrations from respective standard curves run on the same plate. Standards and positive controls were created from the drug product lots of 3BNC117 and 10–1074 that were used in the clinical study. The capture anti-idiotypic mAbs were produced in a stable hybridoma cell line (Duke Protein Production Facility<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>). If day 0 samples had measurable levels of antibody by the respective assays, the background measured antibody level was subtracted from subsequent results. In addition, samples with measured antibody levels within 3-fold from background were excluded from the analysis of PK parameters. The lower limit of detection was determined to be 0.51 μg/ml and 0.14 μg/ml in HIV-1 seropositive serum for the 3BNC117 and 10–1074 ELISA, respectively. For values that were detectable (i.e., positive for mAb) but below the lower limit of quantitation, values are reported as &lt; 0.78 μg/ml and &lt; 0.41 μg/ml for 3BNC117 and 10–1074 ELISA.</p>
