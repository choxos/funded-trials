                <p>Pre- and post-migration stressors can put resettled refugee children at risk of poor mental health outcomes. The Family Strengthening Intervention for Refugees (FSI-R) is a peer-delivered preventative home visiting program for resettled refugees that aims to draw upon familiesâ strengths to foster improved family communication, positive parenting, and caregiver-child relationships, with the ultimate goal of reducing childrenâs risk of mental health problems. Using an explanatory sequential mixed methods design, this study draws upon qualitative interviews with caregivers (n = 19) and children (n = 17) who participated in a pilot study of the FSI-R intervention in New England, as well as interventionists (n = 4), to unpack quantitative findings on mental health and family functioning from a randomized pilot study (n = 80 families). Most patterns observed in the quantitative data as published in the pilot trial were triangulated by qualitative data. Bhutanese caregivers and children noted that children were less shy or scared to speak up after participating in the FSI-R. Somali Bantu families spoke less about child mental health and underscored feasibility challenges like language barriers between caregivers and children. Interventionists suggested that families with higher levels of education were more open to implementing behavior change. In both groups, families appreciated the intervention and found it to be feasible and acceptable, but also desired additional help in addressing broader family and community needs such as jobs and literacy programs.</p>

              <title>1. Introduction</title>
              <p>The global population of refugeesâindividuals who are forced to leave their native country and cross international borders searching for safety from war, violence, persecution, and other natural disastersâhas doubled in the last decade as a result of ongoing global conflict, up to approximately 26 million [<xref rid="B1-ijerph-19-12415" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Perhaps most remarkable is the extent to which refugee communities overwhelmingly demonstrate profound strength and resilience in the face of such tremendous adversity. Research with diverse refugee communities has identified numerous individual, family and community-level resources (faith, family and community relationships, cultural values and practices) which refugees rely on to overcome difficulty and support adjustment and wellbeing [<xref rid="B2-ijerph-19-12415" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-ijerph-19-12415" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p>
              <p>At the same time, research also indicates that exposure to violence, trauma, and loss experienced in country of origin and during migration increases risks for common mental disorders (e.g., depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress). Resettlement to the United States and other host countries introduces additional post-migration stressors and living difficulties (e.g., economic pressures, legal status, education and health care access) which often exacerbate risks to mental health. Several systematic reviews have identified high rates of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among refugee adults and children [<xref rid="B4-ijerph-19-12415" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-ijerph-19-12415" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-ijerph-19-12415" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-ijerph-19-12415" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Bogic et al., for example, found that resettled refugees in Western countries were 14 times more likely to be depressed and 15 times more likely to experience PTSD compared to the general population [<xref rid="B4-ijerph-19-12415" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Similar disparities have been identified in refugee children and adolescents [<xref rid="B6-ijerph-19-12415" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p>
              <p>Forced migration can also separate families from extended kin, change family roles, and upend family configurations, potentially resulting in poor family functioning and child mental health consequences [<xref rid="B8-ijerph-19-12415" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Traumas and stressors experienced across the migration continuum may also adversely impact the entire family system and can result in decreased family cohesion, reliance on harsh or ineffective parenting strategies, negative parentâchild interactions, and increased risk of family conflict [<xref rid="B9-ijerph-19-12415" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p>
              <p>These shifting family dynamics, in turn, can further increase risk of mental health and psychosocial problems for children. For example, resettled refugee children sometimes adopt new roles to help their family meet their daily needs, such as interpreting or functioning as a cultural mediator for their parents. While adaptive in nature, this role expansion can complicate family dynamics and lead to anxiety and stress in children who may be exposed to sensitive or distressing information or pressures inappropriate for their age [<xref rid="B10-ijerph-19-12415" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In addition to refugee childrenâs own direct experiences of trauma and stress, parental exposure to past trauma and ongoing adversity can affect parenting. For example, it may reduce their daily functioning or result in emotional dysregulation or emotional distance from children, dynamics which increase childrenâs risk of mental health problems [<xref rid="B11-ijerph-19-12415" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-ijerph-19-12415" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Parenting can be complicated by resettlement, as caregivers find themselves in a new culture in which parenting practices from their country of origin may be at odds with parenting norms expected in their new environment, with limited support from extended kin or friends to assist with emotional needs or childcare responsibilities [<xref rid="B13-ijerph-19-12415" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Parental isolation can contribute to poor parental mental health and resultant unhealthy parenting patterns contributing to increased family and parentâchild discord. Such vulnerabilities create a family context that is challenging for children at a time when they most need assistance and support to navigate a new culture and context as resettling refugees [<xref rid="B14-ijerph-19-12415" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p>
              <p>Yet, it is important to also highlight the strengths and perseverance that refugee families and communities commonly exhibit, and which can be leveraged to support wellbeing and adjustment. The family is an important resource for refugee families and functions as a pivotal source of support for coping with past and ongoing challenges [<xref rid="B15-ijerph-19-12415" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. A study with Iraqi refugee families, for example, found that close family relationships, cultural practices in the home and a renewed focus on their future were critical ingredients in making meaning of resettlement related stress and adversity [<xref rid="B16-ijerph-19-12415" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Indeed, family relationships are crucial to childrenâs developing sense of culture and identity. This is particularly true for many refugee families, where identity is often strongly grounded in relation to oneâs family and community [<xref rid="B17-ijerph-19-12415" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Moreover, many refugees rely more strongly on their families for support in the post-migration period, as migration can interrupt their previous social support networks. Positive social support from the family has been found to mediate the negative mental health outcomes experienced by refugee adults [<xref rid="B18-ijerph-19-12415" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and has been associated with better psychosocial functioning in refugee children [<xref rid="B19-ijerph-19-12415" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. For refugee children and adolescents, family-level factors including engaged parenting and family cohesion have been found to be important to fostering long-term resilience [<xref rid="B20-ijerph-19-12415" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Thus, strengthening family support, functioning, and resilience may be a critical approach for mitigating the effects of trauma and stress in families and promoting child mental health [<xref rid="B21-ijerph-19-12415" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-ijerph-19-12415" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-ijerph-19-12415" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p>

                <title>1.1. Resettled Bhutanese and Somali Bantu Communities in New England</title>
                <p>New Englandâs resettled Bhutanese community is an ethnically Nepali refugee population who had been residing in Bhutan while retaining their Nepali language and customs for several generations. In the 1980s, the Kingdom of Bhutan embarked upon a campaign of âBhutanizationâ that resulted in many human rights abuses, including death threats and torture, towards the Lhotshampsa population (ethnically Nepali Bhutanese) and their displacement from the country. They subsequently lived in refugee camps in eastern Nepal for over 20 years [<xref rid="B14-ijerph-19-12415" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. From 2007 to date, over 110,000 Bhutanese refugees have been resettled to the United States [<xref rid="B24-ijerph-19-12415" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p>
                <p>Resettled Bhutanese communities demonstrate strong resilience in the face of adversities, including a strong âculture of helpingâ in which families and communities proactively provide social support to individuals facing psychosocial challenges [<xref rid="B25-ijerph-19-12415" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-ijerph-19-12415" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. However, they also demonstrate high levels of mental health problems. Literature has found that experiencing torture was associated with mental health problems for Bhutanese not only while living in camps in Nepal [<xref rid="B27-ijerph-19-12415" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], but also three decades later in the United States [<xref rid="B28-ijerph-19-12415" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Research has also found that having less education and being illiterate in Nepali is linked to psychological distress, depression, and post-traumatic stress in resettled Bhutanese [<xref rid="B29-ijerph-19-12415" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30-ijerph-19-12415" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Most alarmingly, resettled Bhutanese have an increased risk of suicidal ideation, with rates of suicide being nearly double the US average in 2013 [<xref rid="B31-ijerph-19-12415" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-ijerph-19-12415" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. This increased risk of adult suicide has been associated with perceiving oneself as a burden and a lack of a sense of belonging, which are in turn linked to struggles obtaining employment, poor health, and family conflict [<xref rid="B33-ijerph-19-12415" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Other risk factors for suicide include unemployment, substance use, family discord, isolation and family separation [<xref rid="B34-ijerph-19-12415" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B35-ijerph-19-12415" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. One study of resettled Bhutanese found that three-quarters believed other people would look down on them if they pursued mental health counseling, and this was more common amongst participants without a secondary education [<xref rid="B36-ijerph-19-12415" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p>
                <p>A large community of Somali Bantu refugee families have resettled in the New England area as well. âSomali Bantuâ is an imperfect umbrella term for ethnic minorities in Somalia who were both indigenous to the country and those forcibly brought as enslaved people from other African regions starting in the nineteenth century [<xref rid="B37-ijerph-19-12415" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The Somali Bantu mostly settled in farming communities along the Jubba and Shabelle rivers [<xref rid="B37-ijerph-19-12415" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Following the collapse of the Somali government in 1991, much of the Somali Bantu population escaped the violence and fled to refugee camps in Dadaab and Kakuma, Kenya. Identifying the Somali Bantu as a persecuted minority group in 1999, the US government resettled about 10,000 Somali Bantu refugees between 2004 and 2006 [<xref rid="B38-ijerph-19-12415" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p>
                <p>Somali Bantu refugees have demonstrated high rates of problems often associated with trauma exposure and post-resettlement challenges such as depression, PTSD, anxiety and a high involvement of youth in the juvenile justice system [<xref rid="B39-ijerph-19-12415" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40-ijerph-19-12415" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Research with a mix of Somali-majority and Somali Bantu youth found that cumulative trauma was a risk factor for depression and PTSD, and discrimination was also linked to depression [<xref rid="B40-ijerph-19-12415" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Indeed, youth within this community face the challenges of negotiating intersectionality of marginalized identities in the United States, including being black, Somali, and Muslim. In the context of such obstacles, schools have reported some Somali Bantu students struggle with behavioral problems [<xref rid="B41-ijerph-19-12415" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Nevertheless, the community draws resilience and strength from retaining a strong cultural identities, commitment to religion and spirituality, and a sense of community and interdependence with other Somali Bantu that crosses distance and geographic boundaries [<xref rid="B2-ijerph-19-12415" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. While Somali Bantu youth have low rates of service utilization and evidence exists of stigma towards mental health problems, some Somali Bantu youth and adults have said they feel they can turn to religious leaders and the Quran in times of psychosocial need [<xref rid="B42-ijerph-19-12415" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="B43-ijerph-19-12415" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="B44-ijerph-19-12415" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].</p>

                <title>1.2. The Family Strengthening Intervention for Refugees (FSI-R)</title>
                <p>To respond to the significant mental health needs and strengthen adaptive capacities in resettled refugee communities in New England, researchers and community partners began using community based participatory research (CBPR) approaches in 2004 to assess and collaboratively develop family based programs for refugee children and adolescents. Following CBPR best practices, researchers partnered with existing community groups, first in the Somali Bantu and then in the Bhutanese community, with intentionality towards deconstructing power dynamics. Towards this end, community members were involved in each stage of the intervention development and delivery process [<xref rid="B45-ijerph-19-12415" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Involvement included the use of community advisory boards (CABs); extensive measurement tailoring within each community; hiring and training community members as research assistants and interventionists; and collaborating with community members as co-authors on all study presentations and manuscripts. To ensure frequent opportunities for formal feedback, youth and adult CABs convened quarterly. CAB members shared community perspectives and cultural insight to provide project direction and guidance to the researchers to help improve recruitment, engagement, and retention, and problem-solve cultural or implementation barriers.</p>
                <p>The resulting Family Strengthening Intervention for Refugees (FSI-R) has the central goal of promoting family functioning to reduce risk of mental health problems among youth. Designed for refugees, by refugees, the intervention was constructed to be delivered by trained community member interventionists across ten 90-min weekly home-visiting sessions. Interventionists selected from the communities all had shared life experiences as refugees navigating the resettlement process, were often parents, and had prior experience in social services or case management but did not hold advanced mental health degrees. Each session covered different topics related to resettlement and family well-being, such as improving communication, navigating the US education system, and learning positive parenting strategies. A central part of the intervention is the development of the âfamily narrativeâ whereby families reflect on their migration journey to date and choose important family events to discuss, with the interventionist highlighting the familyâs unique strengths in overcoming their challenges [<xref rid="B46-ijerph-19-12415" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The intervention ends with a family meeting, which brings together all members of the familyâwith parents leadingâto reflect on their experience and goals for the future [<xref rid="B46-ijerph-19-12415" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p>
                <p>The Masterâs-level FSI-R Program Manager provided daily staff support and oversaw quality improvement. Weekly supervision was provided to the interventionists by on-site clinical supervisors who also provided group supervision to interventionists two times per month [<xref rid="B47-ijerph-19-12415" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The study investigators provided âsuper supervisionâ on the overall implementation and problem solving implementation barriers and a child psychiatrist provided periodic consultation. Families were offered referrals when appropriate for more intensive mental and physical health services (including substance abuse treatment) and case management.</p>

                  <title>FSI-R Conceptual Model and Theory of Change</title>
                  <p>The Family Strengthening Intervention for Refugees, which has been described in previous literature [<xref rid="B46-ijerph-19-12415" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="B47-ijerph-19-12415" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], is based on a prevention framework that aims to reduce the incidence and prevalence of mental health problems in refugee children by targeting known risk factors in the family and broader resettlement context and strengthening the coping mechanisms of children and parents (see <xref rid="ijerph-19-12415-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, which presents an updated conceptual model following on that which was published previously [<xref rid="B46-ijerph-19-12415" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]). The intervention is informed by several complementary theoretical frameworks that inform intervention components. The FSI-R is based on developmental and ecological models of human development which view mental health problems in children and adolescents as the result of a dynamic interplay between factors in the family, community and broader society [<xref rid="B48-ijerph-19-12415" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Using evidence-based components including psychoeducation, positive parenting and problem-solving skills, the model aims to strengthen key family processes including parentâchild relationships, parenting skills and navigation of informal and formal resources to promote child and adolescent mental health.</p>
                  <p>The FSI-R is also informed by the stress adjustment paradigm [<xref rid="B49-ijerph-19-12415" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] which identifies stress as resulting from an imbalance between external or internal demands and the personal and social resources to cope and manage them. To facilitate adjustment, the model includes components that aim to increase understanding of different forms of and sources of stress, particularly those common to refugee families and self-management of stress using techniques of behavioral activation, mindfulness and by strengthening social support.</p>
                  <p>The intervention also draws on the strengths-based perspective which views individuals holistically through the lens of their strengths and capacities and which are seen as important resources to be harnessed to address challenges and facilitate resilience [<xref rid="B50-ijerph-19-12415" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. A principal way that strengths are identified in the FSI-R is through the development of a family narrative that includes important life experiences prior to and since resettling in the U.S., challenges experienced and strengths and problem-solving capacities that the family utilized to overcome adversity. The process of developing the familyâs narrative with attention to strengths and capacities is conceptualized to bring the family together to reflect on the past, present and future while promoting recognition and activation of strengths to promote functioning.</p>

              <p>The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health. Adult participants provided oral consent, children under the age of 18 years and younger provided oral assent, and primary caregivers provided oral consent for their children to participate. Research Assistants (RAs) who were also hired from the resettled communities and spoke the same languages (i.e., Maay Maay or Nepali as well as English), recruited all participants via phone calls, home visits, and community events. RAs completed ethics training online in addition to intensive training and supervision from study staff.</p>
              <p>In order to be eligible for the study, families needed to have U.S. government refugee status, at least one child ages 7â17 years, and have lived in the U.S. for at least three months. If families were experiencing a crisis such as severe psychiatric illness, ongoing legal proceedings, they were referred to a higher level of care and were not enrolled in the pilot. Eligible families were randomized into the FSI-R or care-as-usual (CAU) arms of the study, described in previous publications [<xref rid="B47-ijerph-19-12415" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p>
              <p>Families in both arms participated in quantitative child and caregiver assessments in Nepali, Maay Maay, or English, which occurred pre- and post-FSI-R delivery. The post-tests were meant to be given to families immediately after completing the intervention. Some families took longer to move through the intervention modules than others; for intervention participants, the mean time between pre- and post-test was 12.91 months, and for CAU families, it was 9.81 months. RAs were blinded to group assignment and trained to collect survey data on digital tablets. In all, 146 Somali Bantu individuals participated in quantitative data collection (103 children and 43 caregivers) as well as 111 Bhutanese individuals (49 children and 62 caregivers).</p>
              <p>Twenty families per community in the FSI-R arm of the study were selected via a random-digits table to participate in qualitative exit interviews post-FSI-R. One child and one caregiver were asked to complete semi-structured interviews from each family, conducted in Nepali, Maay-Maay, English, or a mix of languages. Out of the 20 families per community recruited, 11 Bhutanese families and 10 Somali families participated (n = 10 Somali Bantu caregivers, n = 8 Somali Bantu children, n = 9 Bhutanese caregivers, n = 9 Bhutanese children). These interviews were conducted between January and March 2019.</p>
              <p>Finally, four interventionists (n = 3 Bhutanese and n = 1 Somali Bantu) also participated in semi-structured interviews about their experiences delivering the FSI-R.</p>

Child-reported parenting practices were assessed using an adaptation of the Alabama Parenting Questionnaire (APQ) [<xref rid="B52-ijerph-19-12415" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] developed for this study. Subscales included positive parenting (Î± = 0.83, 6 items, high scores representing greater positive parenting, such as whether caregivers use encouraging language (i.e., telling the child they âare doing a good jobâ on homework, etc.), poor monitoring (Î± = 0.88, 10 items, high scores representing poorer monitoring, such as whether the child âstay[s] out in the evening past the time [they] are supposed to be homeâ), and parental involvement (Î± = 0.77, 10 items, high scores representing greater involvement, such as whether caregivers âplay games or do other fun thingsâ with the child). Responses could range from 1 (âneverâ) to 5 (âalwaysâ), and the score on each subscale was the sum of its items. Intergenerational congruence was measured with a version of the Intergenerational Congruence in Immigrant Families Scale [<xref rid="B53-ijerph-19-12415" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] modified for this study to include 17 items scored from 0 (âneverâ) to 4 (âevery dayâ); items include, for example, âMy father/mother and I agree on types of friends I haveâ and âMy father/mother and I agree on the amount of time we spend togetherâ.

The larger authorship team then employed axial coding to discuss connections within categories and themes. Finally, authors who were members of each refugee community offered final feedback to ensure trustworthiness [<xref rid="B59-ijerph-19-12415" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>].

                <p>FSI-R family outcomes are displayed in <xref rid="ijerph-19-12415-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Caregivers, children, and interventionists reported seeing meaningful changes in their families due to the intervention, especially with regard to communication and spending time together, and to a lesser degree, in caregiver discipline practices, as well.</p>
                <p>Somali Bantu children and caregivers noted that after the intervention, they began to take time to be with one another, especially amongst siblings. As a Somali Bantu mother, aged 38, noted, before the intervention: <italic toggle="yes">âchildren were not coming out from their room. Recently, they sat in the living room to share how school was and share daily living activities.â</italic> They also noted increased communication, including in terms of caregivers listening to their children. One Somali Bantu 55-year-old father explained, <italic toggle="yes">âWe never talk priority for my kids, always working working. But [the intervention] give me small lesson[s] that I also need to listen to them about their thought[s].â</italic></p>
                <p>A Somali Bantu interventionist also reflected on similar changes he saw in the families with whom he worked, stating,</p>

                </disp-quote>
                <p>Somali Bantu families also made changes in their parenting practices (although this topic presented some acceptability issues, as discussed in subsequent sections). A 37-year-old mother stated that the most important topic for her family was parenting, stating, <italic toggle="yes">âI was punished before by my parent with a stick. Here in the US, [we are] not allowed to punish with [a] stick or belt, only talking to them politely.â</italic> She went on to explain, <italic toggle="yes">âBefore the intervention, as a parent I used to yell at my kids all the time. Now [we have] better communication, I talk to them as an adult now, in [a] respectful way.â</italic> Likewise, one Somali Bantu interventionist did see changes in caregiversâ thinking and behaviors around discipline:</p>
                <disp-quote>
                  <p>
                    <italic toggle="yes">âDuring the modules like for example module 4 â¦parenting strategies, we see disciplining the kids was need[ing] to be, like, taughtâ¦before, they didnât even know anything about that but right now, you know, they have made some new changes about what they have learned through tools from me.â</italic>
                  </p>
                </disp-quote>
                <p>Bhutanese families and interventionists also described important improvements in communication and time spent as a family. As one interventionist described, <italic toggle="yes">âI also noticedâ¦that the parents are more involved in asking what is going on in the school systems, how their sons, or how their students are making progress or not.â</italic></p>
                <p>A 40-year-old mother reflected, <italic toggle="yes">âWe do home family meeting and gathering, and talk about school, and felt more awareness and importance of talking with kids, felt closeness, know[ing] kidsâ needs, and sharing. Very helpful.â</italic></p>
                <p>However, interventionists also noted that they did not see the same degree of change in all families. Bhutanese interventionists believed that caregivers with higher education levels were better primed to implement the parenting practices they were taught in the intervention. One interventionist explained:</p>
                <disp-quote>
                  <p>
                    <italic toggle="yes">âWith one family... Probably due to their educational status being a bit higher, both caregivers were educated. I got [a] very positive response from them. They said they used to have family discussions in some ways, but they realized they could do it differently and effectively, as discussed in the intervention.â</italic>
                  </p>
                </disp-quote>
                <p>Another Bhutanese interventionist explained that, <italic toggle="yes">âEvery family has their own comprehension level. The families with a very low comprehension level, or illiterate families were also there.â He found that these families with âlow comprehension levelsâ</italic> would tell him it was not necessary to implement practices from the FSI-R:</p>
                <disp-quote>
                  <p>
                    <italic toggle="yes">âIt will be different in different families. Some families are in good condition. These families take what I taught and suggest during intervention very positively; therefore, we can see positive impacts on these families, whereas some families do not even care, they are good until the intervention session exists, but after the session is over, they do not follow what was taught or said during the intervention session. I have continuously followed up with those families, but then they respond [that] they are okay! And their lifestyle or [their] relationship does not does not require any changes....For this, I can see I found impact in families 50â50.â</italic>

                </disp-quote>
                <p>In this small-sample pilot, the differential impact between families well-positioned to receive the intervention and families facing more barriers to behavior change could have muted the quantitative improvements.</p>

                <p>In addition, a Bhutanese boy, aged 16, from another family explained, <italic toggle="yes">âNowâ¦ Iâm not shy anymore â¦ I can help my family without being scared of them or what they think about me.â</italic> He also noted, <italic toggle="yes">âthe Family Intervention hasâ¦made my family happierâ¦more engaging with each other.â</italic></p>
                <p>Similar to the qualitative accounts, Bhutanese children were observed to have significantly reduced depression (Î² = â9.20, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.04) following the FSI-R intervention compared to families in usual care.</p>
                <p>Bhutanese children also had a reduction in conduct problems (Î² = â0.92, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.01). Though this was not explicitly mentioned by participants in the qualitative data, a Bhutanese mother, age 40, described that they <italic toggle="yes">âfelt more importance of the family. Kids [were] also much [more] obedient and working together. Going time for each other, avoiding electronics devices, closeness with each other, limiting the electronics and focusing more on studies.â</italic></p>
                <p>In contrast, when asked what changes they saw in their families, Somali Bantu caregivers and children who participated in the intervention, as well as the Somali Bantu interventionist, did not bring up child mental health.</p>
                <p>Because mental health problems are often stigmatized in diverse refugee communities, the FSI-R places more emphasis on psychoeducation around resettlement stressors, the impact of displacement on wellbeing and various approaches for coping and promoting resilience in families. Once more rapport is built, later modules of the FSI-R do emphasize the importance of health promotion and accessing services, including mental health services where relevant. One Bhutanese interventionist explained how the topic of mental health was extremely new for families:</p>
                <disp-quote>
                  <p>
                    <italic toggle="yes">âI know our community have very little knowledge about mental health, and people really doesnât want to talk about it, and people really doesnât want to seek mental health help and mental health providers. So I think that piece of mental health information in that module [of the FSI-R] was very helpful, and were having healthy conversation about those thingsâ¦. In terms of impact, I did saw people started using mental health services.â</italic>
                  </p>
                </disp-quote>
                <p>However, Bhutanese children had measurable mental health improvements even amidst this stigma.</p>

                  <title>3.3.1. Overall Satisfaction</title>
                  <p>Both the quantitative and qualitative data indicate that the intervention was overall highly acceptable to both communities. Nuances in the quantitative outcomes, however, can be further explained through the qualitative findings (<xref rid="ijerph-19-12415-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). When asked directly about satisfaction, 85.7% of the Bhutanese community indicated that they were satisfied (the remaining 14.3% were neither satisfied nor dissatisfied) compared to 76.9% the Somali Bantu community being satisfied. However, when measuring satisfaction indirectly, via willingness to participate again and willing to recommend to a neighbor or friend, the Somali Bantu responded with 100% satisfaction, while the Bhutanese community came in lower at 64.3% and 85.7%, respectively. One possibility for the discrepancy between general satisfaction and more specific indicators of satisfaction among Bhutanese is the cultural emphasis placed on politeness and the desire to not offend an interventionist whom they know from the community. A Bhutanese interventionist noted, <italic toggle="yes">âI have felt that they [participants] might have been dissatisfied [though]...they did not say openly that they were dissatisfied.â</italic> This possibility notwithstanding, much of the qualitative data supported the majority of both communities indicating high levels of satisfaction and continuing to practice what they learned in the FSI-R.</p>
                  <p>Exit interviews with participants triangulated our quantitative finding that more Bhutanese reported that they were continuing to practice skills learned in the FSI-R compared to those in the Somali Bantu community. A 40-year-old Bhutanese mother described <italic toggle="yes">âdoing [family meetings] oftenâ¦ encouraged to do so from the intervention,â</italic> and a 17-year-old Bhutanese girl from another family said they do theirs <italic toggle="yes">âevery Sunday.â</italic></p>
                  <p>Even though Somali Bantu families said the intervention was, for example âfun,â âvery helpful,â and that their âkids loved it,â and 100% of caregivers said they would recommend the FSI-R to a friend or neighbor, some caregivers also described it being difficult to use what was learned in the intervention due to limited time. A 32-year-old mother explained, <italic toggle="yes">âwho has the time? I am working all day,â</italic> while a 40-year-old Somali Bantu mother said, <italic toggle="yes">âI like asking my child a question about his day at school, talk[ing] to them. [But] some of the things that [the interventionist] telling us need[s] time, and I donât have time.â</italic> It is evident here how acceptability is intimately related to feasibility; the quantitative discrepancies between acceptability measures within each community may relate to whether or not participants felt it was possible to integrate what was learned in the intervention into their daily lives.</p>

                  <p>Fifty-four percent of Somali Bantu participants reported that the intervention met their needs, whereas the Bhutanese communityâs report was higher, at 78.6% (<xref rid="ijerph-19-12415-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Members of both communities brought up the desire for more practical skills, including English language learning, applying to jobs, financial literacy, and building connections across the community.</p>
                  <p>One 42-year-old Somali Bantu mother described: <italic toggle="yes">âI was so excited, but at the end not happyâ¦ If you give us ways to save money, learn English, job training, and many other things that other offices do, it help[s] the community.â</italic> The same participant also shared that the intervention <italic toggle="yes">âtalk[ed] about things that we already know,â</italic> and that she would have preferred to learn information that was new to her. It is possible that this family already had strong parenting and communication skills and was looking to gain other practical skills.</p>
                  <p>The diverse needs of families posed difficulties for interventionists, who sometimes felt like they were limited in the help that they could offer families. A Bhutanese interventionist mentioned feeling like he did not always have the tools needed to assist, saying in some cases, <italic toggle="yes">âthe resources to address these needs are not known to us either.â</italic> He went on to explain:</p>

                  <p>Satisfaction with the contents of the intervention, exercises, and information gained were high for both communities (<xref rid="ijerph-19-12415-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). Interviews with participants revealed that both communities particularly appreciated the modules covering the US education system, parenting strategies, and ways to spend time as a family. Though differences were minor, Somali Bantu were slightly less satisfied with the content and exercises of the FSI-R compared to the Bhutanese community, though Somali Bantu satisfaction with both was still high at 76.9%. Several Somali Bantu caregivers cited struggling with the FSI-Râs content regarding child discipline, as it was different from what was accepted in their culture. A mother, age 37, explained, <italic toggle="yes">âWhen it come[s] to disciplin[ing] children, it was uncomfortable for me. I thought if I tell you about what I do you would report me</italic>.â Another mother, also 37, shared that she <italic toggle="yes">âpersonally like [learning] parenting strategies, but [there is] still no proper way of disciplining the children.

                  <p>Another possible explanation for slightly lower satisfaction among Somali Bantu compared to Bhutanese was the language barrier across generations within the family, an issue frequently brought up by Somali Bantu caregivers and children. In several cases, mothers only spoke Maay Maay while their children spoke only English. Several Somali Bantu caregivers reported language barriers as a frustrating aspect of the intervention, sharing: <italic toggle="yes">âthe family meeting went well, but most of the time my own children were speaking English,â âmy children speak English but we donât,â</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">âsome of my kids donât speak Maay Maay, so it was very difficult for me to initiate communication with them.â</italic> Bhutanese participants reported very different language experiences within the family in the context of the intervention, as one child remarked that <italic toggle="yes">âEnglish is very important [to my caregiver],â</italic> and therefore speaking English was encouraged although several Bhutanese families also expressed valuing their childrenâs efforts to learn Nepali and using it at home.</p>

Bhutanese caregivers rated their satisfaction slightly higher than Somali Bantu caregivers, yet both were above 75% satisfaction.

              <title>4. Discussion</title>
              <p>This mixed methods study adds nuance and depth to previous research which (1) indicated that the FSI-R pilot was generally acceptable and feasible with Bhutanese and Somali Bantu communities in New England and (2) found positive patterns in improved parenting skills and child mental health, with the need to have the effectiveness outcomes confirmed in a fully powered trial. Interviews with intervention participants reinforced these findings (including community member interventionists contributing to acceptability and feasibility and childrenâs improved mental health), as well as suggested several plausible explanations for the potential patterns of differences in certain outcomes by the community. Qualitative interviews suggest that families with varying levels of education and social status may have responded differently to FSI-R. In addition, unique feasibility challenges for the Somali Bantu participants, such as large family sizes and language barriers between caregivers and children, will need greater attention in future iterations of the model.</p>
              <p>Children who received the intervention demonstrated improvements in parent-reported depression and child-reported PTSD symptoms. Participants talked about how children were more comfortable opening up to their caregivers after the FSI-R. Indeed, previous literature indicates that refugees, such as previous studies with Bhutanese refugees suffering from mental health problems âkeep their problems to themselves and try to work things out on their ownâ [<xref rid="B62-ijerph-19-12415" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], so the FSI-Râs approach to strengthening communication and connectedness is highly relevant for this community.</p>
              <p>Regarding family outcomes, many interventionists and participants spoke about important changes that the FSI-R brought about. In Somali Bantu families, both children and caregivers reflected on how the FSI-R brought siblings together and strengthened their relationships. This is consistent with prior research on resettled Somali Bantu families, which found that sibling bonds strengthened after resettlement as their shared experiences led siblings to rely on one another for support, including in the midst of strained caregiver-child relationships [<xref rid="B63-ijerph-19-12415" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Sibling relationships were not assessed in this quantitative pilot but were often reflected upon in participant interviews, and therefore could be an important mediator or moderator of child mental health outcomes to examine in future studies.</p>
              <p>Some unique challenges facing each community were illuminated by this mixed methods study. For example, participating Somali Bantu families had many childrenâalmost three times as many as Bhutanese families, on average [<xref rid="B47-ijerph-19-12415" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]âand both participants and interventionists spoke about how difficult it was to find space in everyoneâs competing schedules to hold FSI-R sessions with the whole family at once.</p>
              <p>Language barriers between Somali Bantu caregivers and children also created a significant feasibility challenge to implementing the FSI-R, while also serving as a risk factor for poor family functioning. Because Somali Bantu families resettled several years before the Bhutanese families, many of the Somali Bantu youth were born in the United States, and they often did not learn their native language Maay Maay. Prior literature describes not only a language barrier between caregivers and children, but also a cultural divide, with caregivers sometimes frustrated with their children for not retaining their cultural and religious practices as they assimilate to American life [<xref rid="B63-ijerph-19-12415" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>].</p>
              <p>Although both groups showed improvements in ratings of PTSD and depression in children, more mental health improvements were demonstrated in the Bhutanese in this small pilot sample. Similarly, Bhutanese interventionists said that they witnessed meaningful changes in family functioning due to the intervention, though not necessarily in all families. Quantitative changes were not detected on the scale used to assess family functioning which may be attributed to the small pilot sample or measurement issues. Consistent with the transtheoretical model of behavioral change, wherein individuals are theorized as having different levels of readiness to change their behavior [<xref rid="B64-ijerph-19-12415" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>], Bhutanese interventionists said that some caregivers were ready and willing to adopt new practices such as family meetings or positive parenting approaches, while others were not. They stated that more âeducatedâ families were better positioned to adopt behavior changes. This is interesting in light of literature that has found that amongst resettled Bhutanese adults, illiteracy in the Nepali language and lower educational attainment are risk factors for mental health problems [<xref rid="B29-ijerph-19-12415" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30-ijerph-19-12415" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Future research should investigate the links between education, literacy, mental health, and parenting in this population. Although the Somali Bantu interventionist did not mention seeing differential effects among families (and the fact that only one Somali Bantu interventionist was able to participate in interviews limits the claims that can be made about patterns of change observed in families from that community), prior research has found that Somali Bantu community members were often unable to access education in their homeland and during displacement which led to various struggles in their resettled life [<xref rid="B63-ijerph-19-12415" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>].</p>
              <p>Health and mental health interventions aimed at facilitating behavior changes amongst diverse populations, especially resettled and immigrant groups, must navigate an inevitable tension that arises from introducing new ideas from the dominant culture to replace individualsâ existing practices. This can be even more fraught in the context of parenting and families, where culture and homeland are intimately involved in influencing familial relationships. If done without care, behavior change interventions can serve as little more than an intrusive vehicle of assimilation. For these reasons, the FSI-R relied carefully on CBPR principles at every stage of development and implementation. Interventionists, who came from participantsâ cultural communities, were carefully trained on navigating the more controversial topics, such as discipline and positive parenting, and did not teach caregivers that particular behaviors were âwrong.â Rather, they introduced parenting strategies that may have been unfamiliar to them that they could draw upon if they found them useful in navigating their new lives in the United States.</p>
              <p>The findings of this study point to the importance of tailoring interventions to meet participants where they are. Indeed, the overall findings suggest high levels of feasibility, acceptability among families engaged in the intervention. These findings very likely reflect the fact that the intervention was developed in close partnership with refugee communities, gaining input from community stakeholders along the way to craft a model that would be appropriate and responsive to the needs of families. Taken as a whole, this suggests that family-based mental health services can be useful for resettled communities. Qualitative insights from this study also shed light on future adaptations to family-based mental health services including strengthening attention to practical needs and supports (e.g., English language learning, employment) as part of an overall approach to service delivery. As the refugee crisis continues to grow globally, the ability to quickly adapt interventions to be culturally appropriate for different refugee populations becomes increasingly important. An intervention done âfor refugees, by refugees,â in line with CBPR principles, has tremendous potential as an acceptable and feasible approach to quickly pivoting to address the needs of diverse refugee groups in need of support.</p>

                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p>This study also has important limitations. While interventionist interviews suggested there may be a differential impact on Bhutanese caregivers by educational attainment, the quantitative portion of this pilot study, only containing 20 Bhutanese intervention families, is too small to untangle whether the same dynamic played out in the quantitative data. As the FSI-R is adapted and evaluated in more refugee communities, it will be important to examine such treatment moderators in better powered samples, while also investigating treatment mediators (i.e., mechanisms of change). Another validity issue pertains to social desirability bias wherein, due to cultural norms, Bhutanese adults were very reluctant to say things that could be perceived as negative, despite the efforts of the interviewers (whom all spoke Nepali) in this study to probe for both positive and negative experiences.</p>
                <p>Another limitation is that the qualitative interview protocol had more questions about acceptability and feasibility than it did questions about specific mental health and family functioning outcomes. For this reason, interview data did not contain information that could explain every construct measured in the quantitative survey. Future research should investigate both qualitative and quantitative data on intervention mediators such as parental involvement, positive parenting, communication and conflict management along with potential moderators such as educational level, literacy and family size on outcomes such as intervention effects on symptoms of depression, anxiety, traumatic stress reactions.</p>

              <title>5. Conclusions</title>
              <p>The FSI-R is a promising family-based preventative intervention developed using CBPR approaches to promote functioning and child mental health in resettled refugee families. This randomized pilot trial with Somali Bantu and Bhutanese refugees in New England showed that the FSI-R reduced child depression symptoms and PTSD in refugee children. Interventionists described generally positive acceptability and feasibility driven by the experience with peer providers who knew their language and culture. In some cases, potential differences were hypothesized such as seeing more âeducatedâ families adopt new parenting practices more readily than other families or language barriers limiting parentâchild communication. Such dynamics should be investigated in future research along with how the integration of such programs into broader community initiatives may also address some of the unmet needs for tangible inputs such as language, savings and cultural initiatives for families in addition to family-based mental health promotion. Future research should continue to examine the mediators and moderators of FSI-R impact so that the intervention can continue to be adapted for the unique needs of a diverse array of refugee families.</p>
