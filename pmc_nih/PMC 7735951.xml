                  <title>Purpose</title>
                  <p>Tyrosine kinase with immunoglobulin-like and EGF-like domains 2 (Tie2) activation in Schlemm's canal (SC) endothelium is required for the maintenance of IOP, making the angiopoietin/Tie2 pathway a target for new and potentially disease modifying glaucoma therapies. The goal of the present study was to examine the effects of a Tie2 activator, AKB-9778, on IOP and outflow function.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>AKB-9778 effects on IOP was evaluated in humans, rabbits, and mice. Localization studies of vascular endothelial protein tyrosine phosphatase (VE-PTP), the target of AKB-9778 and a negative regulator of Tie2, were performed in human and mouse eyes. Mechanistic studies were carried out in mice, monitoring AKB-9778 effects on outflow facility, Tie2 phosphorylation, and filtration area of SC.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>AKB-9778 lowered IOP in patients treated subcutaneously for diabetic eye disease. In addition to efficacious, dose-dependent IOP lowering in rabbit eyes, topical ocular AKB-9778 increased Tie2 activation in SC endothelium, reduced IOP, and increased outflow facility in mouse eyes. VE-PTP was localized to SC endothelial cells in human and mouse eyes. Mechanistically, AKB-9778 increased the filtration area of SC for aqueous humor efflux in both wild type and in Tie2<sup>+/−</sup> mice.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>This is the first report of IOP lowering in humans with a Tie2 activator and functional demonstration of its action in remodeling SC to increase outflow facility and lower IOP in fully developed mice. Based on these studies, a phase II clinical trial is in progress to advance topical ocular AKB-9778 as a first in class, Tie2 activator for treatment for ocular hypertension and glaucoma.</p>

          <body>
            <p>Open-angle glaucoma (OAG) is a leading cause of blindness worldwide, affecting approximately 45 million people. In the United States, OAG impacts approximately 3 million people, a number that is expected to increase to 7.3 million by 2050.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref><sup>–</sup><xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> OAG is characterized by death of retinal ganglion cells, degeneration of the optic nerve and progressive vision loss. Elevated IOP is a primary and modifiable risk factor for OAG. Fortunately, OAG is treatable, and effective reduction in IOP slows or prevents vision loss.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref><sup>–</sup><xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> Despite the availability of efficacious IOP-lowering drugs, many patients require multiple agents to control IOP. Unfortunately, current drug combinations often fail to achieve a “target” IOP to minimize disease progression.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref></p>
            <p>The conventional outflow (CO) pathway, consisting of the trabecular meshwork (TM) and Schlemm's canal (SC), regulates IOP within a narrow range in healthy eyes and is the site of increased resistance to aqueous outflow in OAG.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref><sup>–</sup><xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> First line therapies for OAG do not target CO, but rather reduce IOP by either decreasing the formation of aqueous humor or increasing outflow through the secondary, unconventional outflow pathway.

Relevant to the current analysis, ophthalmic safety assessments were performed at baseline and monthly during the 3-month treatment period including a single IOP measurement by applanation tonometry in both the study eye and the fellow eye at each time point. IOP measurements were conducted by qualified site personnel who had received protocol-specific training. Sites were encouraged to have the same operator conduct all IOP measurements for a given subject. By protocol, all patients had baseline IOP &lt; 24 mm Hg (i.e. were ocular normotensive).</p>

The level of significance was set at 0.05. A post hoc analysis of the subject level IOP measure was the change from baseline in the average over both eyes within a subject for each time point. Statistical testing of each time point was completed using ANCOVA with baseline IOP (averaged over both eyes within a subject) as covariate; additionally, statistical testing averaging across all time points was completed using a mixed-model repeated measures ANCOVA.

                <p>The TIME2b clinical trial was a phase II, randomized placebo-controlled, double-masked clinical trial to assess the safety and efficacy of subcutaneously administered AKB-9778 15 mg once daily or 15 mg twice daily monotherapy for 48 weeks in patients with moderate to severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR). The study was conducted at 55 sites in the United States. The study was carried out with institutional review board approval. Informed consent for the research was obtained from all subjects and the study complied with the Declaration of Helsinki and the Health Insurance Portability and Accessibility Act. The study was registered at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov">www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> under the identifier NCT03197870, June 23, 2017.</p>

                <p>IOP data were analyzed using mixed-design two-factor ANOVA, with time as the within-subjects factor and treatment as the between-subjects factor. IOP values for day 7 and day 8 were analyzed using one-way ANOVA. The change from baseline IOP on day 7 and on day 8 was calculated for each animal, and the resulting values were analyzed using 1-way ANOVA. The area under the curve (AUC) was calculated for all AM IOP measurements throughout the study for each group; AUC values for the different groups were analyzed using 1-way ANOVA. Where appropriate, post hoc testing was performed using Tukey's multiple comparisons tests. The level of significance was set at 0.05.</p>

In the TIME2b trial, subjects were treated with 15 mg AKB-9778 once daily (QD), 15 mg AKB-9778 twice daily (BID), or placebo for 48 weeks. AKB-9778 reduced IOP at all post-baseline time points whereas there was a slight elevation in IOP in the placebo-treated group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.

There also appears to be a relationship between AKB-9778 dose and IOP lowering, with a larger reduction for the BID dose compared to the QD dose at every time point, ranging from 0.2 to 0.7 mm Hg. A mixed-effect model, repeated measure analysis showed a statistically significant 1.26 mm Hg mean reduction in IOP in the AKB-9778 BID group compared to placebo (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001; 95% CI = ‒0.62 to ‒1.90), whereas the 0.63 mm Hg reduction in the AKB-9778 QD group compared to placebo did not reach statistical significance (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0553, 95% CI = 0.01 to ‒1.27).

                <p>At the 24-week visit, the AM dose was withheld until after the IOP measurement so that drug pharmacokinetics could be assessed.

              <p>In two consecutive clinical trials assessing subcutaneous administration of a novel Tie2 activator, AKB-9778, for the treatment of diabetic retinopathy, significant IOP reduction was observed. The IOP-lowering effect of AKB-9778 was subsequently examined in two different animal models to explore its mechanism of action. Topical ocular administration of AKB-9778 in rabbits lowered IOP more than subcutaneous administration in a dose-dependent manner supporting a local ocular effect. In mice, the molecular target of AKB-9778, VE-PTP, was expressed by SC endothelium, and topical ocular administration of AKB-9778 increased Tie2 activation, enhanced SC filtration area, and increased outflow facility, resulting in reduced IOP. Taken together, these data support AKB-9778 as the first glaucoma drug candidate to lower IOP by selectively targeting SC function.</p>

SC endothelium also expresses blood vascular endothelial markers including Tie2, VEGFR2, PECAM1/CD31, and endomucin. The present study shows the first demonstration of VE-PTP protein expression in SC endothelium, displaying lower expression than neighboring vascular endothelium.

              <p>Results herein provide indirect and direct lines of evidence that AKB-9778 reduces IOP by specifically targeting SC in the CO pathway. Despite the expression of various endothelial markers on cells of the TM, we found no evidence that the TM expressed either Tie2 or VE-PTP, suggesting that the IOP-lowering effect of AKB-9778 was exclusively mediated by SC endothelia.<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr"><sup>52</sup></xref> A second indirect indication was that IOP reduction in rabbits was larger with topical ocular administration than with subcutaneous administration, supporting a local effect of AKB-9778 on IOP regulation. Direct evidence showed that topical administration of AKB-9778 to mouse eyes, rapidly increased Tie2 phosphorylation in SC endothelial cells, enhanced SC area and increased outflow facility following three days of topical ocular dosing, which was consistent with IOP effects of VE-PTP inhibition in both mice and rabbits. Because the system used here functionally isolates the CO pathway, all perfusion media must cross the inner wall of SC where VE-PTP is expressed. Importantly, both mouse and human CO pathway are anatomically alike, having a continuous, circular SC. Similar to AKB-9778 effects on outflow facility in mice, data from the two consecutive human trials show that AKB-9778 is more efficacious in people with higher IOPs, suggesting that AKB-9778 targets the pressure-dependent, CO pathway.</p>
              <p>Emerging mouse and human genetic data have established a role for the Tie2 pathway in the development and maintenance of SC. However, the precise molecular and cellular mechanisms of CO facility regulation and IOP lowering have not been fully elucidated. Tie2 activation results in downstream signaling through the AKT, MAP kinase, and eNOS, pathways known to be important for vascular endothelial cell viability and function. It seems likely that these roles are reprised in SC endothelium and contribute to the beneficial effects of Tie2 activation in SC. This is consistent with degeneration of SC that occurs in mice following conditional double knockout of Angpt1 and 2 and with degeneration of SC during aging, both of which were partially rescued with a Tie2 activator, ABTAA.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref></p>
              <p>It was recently reported that the developmental defect of SC size in Tie2<sup>+/−</sup> mice could be partially compensated by removing one VE-PTP allele in double hemizygous mice.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> Although this study indicated a role for VE-PTP during development of SC, no studies were done to assess the role of VE-PTP in the fully developed SC. Moreover, the investigators did not document expression of VE-PTP or enhanced Tie2 activation in SC endothelium and thus an indirect effect of Tie2 activation in other components of the CO tract or systemic vasculature could not be ruled out. In contrast, the findings in the present study validate VE-PTP as a pharmacological target in SC endothelial cells in adult WT mice, emphasizing the role of VE-PTP in SC maintenance and repair.</p>
              <p>Continual replication and replacement of damaged SC cells is critical due to the constant fluctuations in IOP that induce dramatic mechanical stress in the basal to apical direction, forming large outpouchings called “giant vacuoles.”<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr"><sup>53</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr"><sup>54</sup></xref> Interestingly, Tie2 pathway disruption in both knockout and aging mouse eyes reduced the size and number of giant vacuoles characteristic of the inner wall of SC as well as reduced overall SC lumen size. Importantly, SC luminal area is smaller and outflow facility lower in glaucomatous eyes compared to age-matched controls.<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr"><sup>55</sup></xref><sup>–</sup><xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr"><sup>57</sup></xref> Moreover, in Angpt1 conditional KO mice, failure of SC development is associated with marked diminution of TM formation.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> Based on these findings and the findings in the current study, Tie2 signaling may be important for maintaining both the structural integrity of SC and the normal structure/function relationship between the anterior wall of SC and juxtacanalicular TM. The interface between SC and juxtacanalicular TM is critical for CO facility and IOP regulation and is known to be the site of increased outflow resistance and pathology in OAG.<xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr"><sup>58</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr"><sup>59</sup></xref> Taken together these findings further support Tie2 activation with AKB-9778 as a potential disease modifying approach to treating OAG mediated by the short-term functional effects of eNOS activation and Rho kinase pathway inhibition and the longer-term anatomic remodeling effects on SC and potential secondary effects on juxtacanalicular portion of the trabecular and TM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref>).</p>

                  <p><bold>Potential pleiotrophic effects of AKB-9778 mediated Tie2 activation on restoring normal structure/function of SC.</bold> Tie2 and VE-PTP, the molecular target of AKB-9778 and a critical negative regulator of Tie2 activation, are expressed in Schlemm's canal (SC) endothelial cells (ECs). In the normal SC, Tie2 activation is maintained principally by Angpt-1 produced by cells adjacent to SC endothelial cells including trabecular meshwork cells. Reduced Tie2 signaling has been implicated in the development of congenital glaucoma, ocular hypertension and open angle glaucoma. Tie2 signaling may be important for maintaining both the structural integrity of SC and the normal structure/function relationship between the anterior wall of SC and TM. Tie2 activation with AKB-9778 appears to have both short-term functional effects mediated by eNOS activation and Rho kinase pathway inhibition and longer term anatomic remodeling effects on lumen size of SC, with potential secondary effects on TM. Thus, restoring Tie2 signaling with AKB-9778 represents a novel SC targeted approach to the treatment of OHT/OAG.</p>

              <p>A limitation of the clinical IOP data presented in this report is that the IOP measurements were obtained as safety data in subjects with diabetic retinopathy and normal IOP. As such, the precision of the measurements was probably reduced compared to a typical IOP lowering trial in which measurements are made in triplicate and time of measures are more tightly controlled. It would be expected that a more formal IOP lowering trial in patients with elevated IOP would give additional insight to the true magnitude of the IOP lowering effect of Tie2 activation. A second limitation of the clinical IOP data is that the drug was delivered via subcutaneous administration rather than topical ocular administration.</p>
              <p>Notably, similar IOP lowering effects have been observed in ocular normotensive individuals being treated with oral beta-blocker therapy, a class of drugs widely used topically for IOP lowering.<xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr"><sup>60</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr"><sup>61</sup></xref> Importantly, these studies suggest that larger IOP lowering effects are expected with topical ocular therapy in patients with OAG/ocular hypertension with higher baseline IOPs.<xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr"><sup>60</sup></xref> Consistent with this possibility, there were larger IOP reductions in rabbits with topical ocular versus subcutaneous AKB-9778 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>) and there were larger IOP reductions in patients with ocular normotension with higher baseline IOP (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>C). To explore this possibility, a phase II clinical trial is ongoing to assess the IOP lowering effect of topically administered AKB-9778 in patients with OAG/OHT not well controlled with prostaglandins, the current first-line standard of care (NCT04405245). Because AKB-9778 works by increasing CO, it represents an ideal adjuvant therapy to standard of care prostaglandins that reduce IOP primarily via a secondary outflow route known as the uveoscleral or unconventional outflow pathway.<xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr"><sup>62</sup></xref></p>
              <p>In summary, the present study demonstrates that AKB-9778 lowers IOP in three different species, including humans. Importantly, AKB-9778 is a first-in-class therapeutic agent to increase outflow function and lower IOP by targeting VE-PTP in SC endothelium. Because VE-PTP is only expressed in SC endothelium and not in the TM, this establishes AKB-9778 as the only candidate glaucoma drug to date that selectively interacts with SC. Mechanistically, these results show that AKB-9778 inhibits VE-PTP increasing Tie2 activation resulting in the enlargement of SC filtration area, thereby improving CO function and thus reducing IOP.</p>
