                  <p>Baseline expression of <italic>FCRL5</italic>, a marker of naive and memory B cells, was shown to predict response to rituximab (RTX) in rheumatoid arthritis. This study investigated baseline expression of <italic>FCRL5</italic> as a potential biomarker of clinical response to RTX in granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA).</p>

                  <p>A previously validated quantitative PCR–based (qPCR-based) platform was used to assess <italic>FCRL5</italic> expression in patients with GPA/MPA (RAVE trial, NCT00104299).</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) are small-vessel vasculitides that are characterized by the presence of antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies (ANCA). These autoantibodies activate neutrophils and monocytes, resulting in damage to the vascular endothelium (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). B cell depletion through treatment with rituximab (RTX), an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, was shown to be noninferior to a cyclophosphamide-azathioprine (CYC/AZA) regimen for the induction of remission in GPA/MPA in the RAVE trial (NCT00104299) (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). A total of 64% of the patients in the RTX group, as compared with 53% of the patients in the CYC/AZA group, had complete remission (CR) at 6 months. At 12 and 18 months, 48% and 39%, respectively, of the patients in the RTX group had maintained CR, as compared with 39% and 33%, respectively, in the comparison (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p>
              <p>The RAVE study also showed that patients with relapsing disease (versus a new diagnosis) and those who were proteinase 3–ANCA<sup>+</sup> (PR3–ANCA<sup>+</sup>) at baseline achieved complete response more frequently when treated with RTX compared with those patients without these characteristics. In contrast, there was no observed difference in response by treatment group among patients who were positive for antimyeloperoxidase (anti-MPO) ANCA (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Interestingly, PR3-ANCA–positivity and relapsing disease at presentation are variables associated with highest risk of relapse (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p>
              <p>In our previous work, we developed a quantitative PCR–based (qPCR-based) platform to identify B cell lineage biomarkers of clinical response to RTX in rheumatoid arthritis (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). A subgroup of treated patients characterized by a combination of elevated baseline mRNA levels of <italic>IgJ</italic> (a marker for antibody secreting plasmablasts) and reduced levels of Fc receptor-like 5 (<italic>FCRL5</italic>), preferentially expressed on naive and memory B cells, predicted nonresponse to RTX in inadequate responders to anti-TNF therapy.</p>
              <p>FCRL5, also known as CD307, is encoded by the immunoglobulin superfamily receptor translocation-associated 2 (<italic>IRTA2</italic>) gene and was originally cloned from myeloma cell lines. FCRL5 contains 9 extracellular Ig domains, as well as 2 immunoreceptor tyrosine–based inhibitory motifs (ITIM) and one presumed immunoreceptor tyrosine–based activation motif (ITAM) in its cytoplasmic tail. Using a chimeric receptor containing the cytoplasmic tail of FCRL5, cross-linking FCRL5 and the B cell receptor (BCR) was shown to recruit SHP-1 to the 2 ITIM motifs of FCRL5, resulting in reduced BCR-induced calcium mobilization and protein tyrosine phosphorylation (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). FCRL5 binds intact IgG via a complex mechanism; therefore, immune complexes may link FCRL5 to the BCR, potentially blocking B cell activation similarly to the inhibitory FcγRIIB or CD22 (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p>
              <p>Intriguingly, <italic>FCRL5</italic> was found to be overexpressed in tissue-like memory B cells based on microarray analysis (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). FCRL5<sup>+</sup> cells were found enriched on CD21<sup>−/lo</sup> CD27<sup>+</sup>IgM<sup>+</sup> marginal zone–like B cells in patients with hepatitis C virus–related mixed cyoglobulinemia vasculitis (HCV-MC), but not in healthy donors (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>); feature T-bet expression; and may be enriched during chronic antigenemia. Consistent with this, <italic>FCRL5</italic> mRNA and cell surface protein expression required prolonged BCR stimulation and de novo protein synthesis (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). FCRL5 was also found to be upregulated in circulating “atypical” memory B cells, which are associated with exposure to Plasmodium falciparum and may represent dysfunctional or exhausted B cells with downmodulated BCR signaling and reduced capacity to produce antibody and to undergo recall responses (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p>
              <p>We investigated <italic>FCRL5</italic> expression levels in patients from the RAVE trial with the goal of determining whether <italic>FCRL5</italic> mRNA expression at baseline could serve as a predictive biomarker for achieving CR.</p>

                <p><italic>FCRL5</italic> mRNA gene expression analysis was successfully carried out in 190 of 197 study subjects and matched with clinical data in 188 subjects, 97 in the RTX arm, and 91 in the CYC/AZA arm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).

                <p>The proportion of patients achieving CR at 6 months in this patient cohort was 64% in the RTX arm versus 54% in the CYC/AZA arm, consistent with response rates observed in the RAVE trial population.</p>
                <p>In the RTX arm, mean baseline <italic>FCRL5</italic> level was significantly higher in patients who went on to achieve CR at 6 months as compared with these who did not (median 0.005 expression units [range 0.003–0.012] versus 0.004 [range 0.002–0.006]; <italic>P</italic> = 0.026) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>).

                <p>A threshold sensitivity analysis identified a threshold of 0.01 <italic>FCRL5</italic> expression units to be the most discriminatory for the 6-month response to RTX. Application of this threshold resulted in a significant enrichment for responders in the <italic>FCRL5</italic><sup>hi</sup> subgroup, in the RTX but not the CYC/AZA arm. In the RTX arm, baseline <italic>FCRL5</italic> expression was associated with CR at 6 months (<italic>FCRL5</italic><sup>hi</sup> 84% versus <italic>FCRL5</italic><sup>lo</sup> 57%, <italic>P</italic> = 0.016) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). In contrast, there was no difference in CR in the CYC/AZA arm (<italic>FCRL5</italic><sup>hi</sup> 48% versus <italic>FCRL5</italic><sup>lo</sup> 56%, <italic>P</italic> = 0.8). In both arms, <italic>FCRL5</italic><sup>hi</sup> subgroup represented roughly 25% of patients (25 of 97 in the RTX arm and 22 of 92 in the CYC/AZA arm).</p>
                <p>Similar associations were identified at 12 months in the RTX arm (<italic>FCRL5</italic><sup>hi</sup> 68% versus <italic>FCRL5</italic><sup>lo</sup> 40%, <italic>P</italic> = 0.02) and the CYC/AZA arm (<italic>FCRL5</italic><sup>hi</sup> 29% versus <italic>FCRL5</italic><sup>lo</sup> 44%, not significant) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p>
                <p>The rate of CR at 18 months in the RTX arm was only 29% in the <italic>FCRL5</italic><sup>lo</sup> subset (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0009) and 47% in all patients.

                <p>Examining the baseline characteristics between <italic>FCRL5</italic><sup>hi</sup> versus <italic>FCRL5</italic><sup>lo</sup> patients, we observed that a significantly lower proportion of <italic>FCRL5</italic><sup>hi</sup> patients were GPA (65%) and PR3<sup>+</sup> (52%) as compared with <italic>FCRL5</italic><sup>lo</sup> where 81% and 73% of patients were GPA (<italic>P</italic> = 0.03) and PR3<sup>+</sup> (<italic>P</italic> = 0.01), respectively (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).

                <title>Association of FCRL5 expression with peripheral B cell subtypes.</title>
                <p>At baseline, <italic>FCRL5</italic> expression was positively correlated with the frequency of CD19<sup>+</sup> cells (Spearman’s ρ = 0.46), specifically with the frequency of activated naive B cells (CD19<sup>+</sup>CD27<sup>–</sup>CD86<sup>+</sup> [Spearman’s ρ = 0.47] and CD19<sup>+</sup>CD27<sup>–</sup>HLA-DR<sup>+</sup> [Spearman’s ρ = 0.47]). There were no significant correlations with baseline CD20<sup>+</sup> B cells, nonactivated and CD95-expressing memory cells, plasma, or germinal center founder cells. No correlation was observed with any of the T or myeloid cell populations.</p>
                <p>In a random forest model, activated naive and memory B cell subsets were the most important predictors of <italic>FCRL5</italic> expression at baseline (CD19<sup>+</sup>CD27<sup>–</sup>HLA-DR percent mean squared error [MSE], 8.15; CD19<sup>+</sup>CD27<sup>–</sup>CD86<sup>+</sup>, 6.63; IGD<sup>+</sup>CD27<sup>+</sup>CD19<sup>+</sup>IGM<sup>+</sup>, 6.23; CD19<sup>+</sup>HLA-DR<sup>+</sup>, 5.84; and CD19<sup>+</sup>CD38<sup>–</sup>IgD<sup>+</sup>CD23<sup>+</sup>, 5.51) (<xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>).</p>
                <p>The effect of induction treatment on peripheral blood B cell subsets was similar in both treatment groups regardless of baseline <italic>FCRL5</italic> status (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). During the follow-up period after induction, particularly in the RTX group, many of the examined B cell subsets repopulated more rapidly among <italic>FCRL5</italic><sup>hi</sup> patients compared with <italic>FCRL5</italic><sup>lo</sup> patients. The difference in median values achieved statistical significance at several time points after month 6. When treated with RTX but not CYC/AZA, <italic>FCRL5</italic><sup>hi</sup> subjects repopulated with significantly higher CD19<sup>+</sup> counts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>), naive B cells (CD19<sup>+</sup>CD27<sup>–</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>), activated naive B cells (CD19<sup>+</sup>CD27<sup>–</sup>HLA-DR<sup>+</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>), nonswitched memory B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>), and switched memory B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>).</p>
                <p>Of note, RTX subjects who failed to achieve CR at 6 months had higher activated naive B cells at the 1-month time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>). There was no difference in the percentage of the CD19<sup>+</sup> B cells or the aforementioned B cell subsets throughout the induction period between patients who achieved or failed to achieve CR at 6 months in either the RTX or CYC/AZA arms (not shown).</p>

                <title>Univariate and multivariate analyses adjusting for clinical and serological parameters.</title>
                <p>In univariate logistic regression analysis, <italic>FCRL5</italic> expression was significantly associated with CR at 18 months in the RTX arm (<italic>P</italic> = 0.016), and there was a trend toward achieving CR at 6 and 12 months. This trend at 6 months became significant in the multivariate analysis after adjusting for PR3-ANCA status, new onset versus relapsing disease status, and baseline Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score for Wegener’s Granulomatosis (BVAS/WG) score (<xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>).</p>
                <p>We found an association between log-transformed <italic>FCRL5</italic> as a continuous variable and achievement of CR at months 6 and 18. This implies direct correlation of response with <italic>FCRL5</italic> expression level, with an increase in <italic>FCRL5</italic> throughout the range of baseline values being associated with an increasing probability of CR in the RTX group. In contrast, there was no association between CR achievement and <italic>FCRL5</italic> levels in the CYC/AZA arm at any <italic>FCRL5</italic> level. There was sufficient separation between the RTX and CYC/AZA curves at the highest <italic>FCRL5</italic> levels to suggest a treatment benefit of RTX over CYC/AZA in this population. This effect nearly reaches statistical significance with respect to the primary endpoint (CR at 6 months; <italic>P</italic> = 0.087) despite being significantly underpowered for the analysis.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>ANCA-associated vasculitis is a rare and life-threatening autoimmune disease associated with B cell hyperactivity, the presence of autoantibodies, and elevated BAFF levels (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), suggesting that B cells play a critical role in the pathogenesis of this disease. Recent trials have begun to identify targeted immunotherapies that represent new options compared with conventional CYC (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). PR3-ANCA<sup>+</sup> and relapsing disease subgroups of patients in RAVE appear to receive greater benefit from RTX compared with CYC/AZA, providing clinicians with information that might impact therapeutic choices. Our analysis is important because it demonstrates that a baseline B cell marker in GPA and MPA is associated with increased achievement of CR among patients treated with RTX and may be associated with a prolonged duration of clinical remission following a single cycle of RTX therapy.</p>
              <p>In RAVE, patients who achieved CR off glucocorticoids at 6 months in the RTX arm had significantly higher baseline <italic>FCRL5</italic> expression. <italic>FCRL5</italic> expression at baseline seems to predict CR at 6, 12, and 18 months in patients treated with RTX but not those treated with CYC/AZA. Furthermore, <italic>FCRL5</italic> expression appears to have a predictive value independent of other response-predictive factors such as type of vasculitis, serology, or presence of relapsed disease in a multivariate analysis.</p>
              <p>While both RTX and CYC/AZA are peripheral blood B cell–depleting agents, our paper’s findings may relate to the greater depletion of CD20<sup>+</sup> B cells seen with RTX. Baseline <italic>FCRL5</italic> expression in the peripheral blood of patients with GPA or MPA is correlated with the frequency of memory B cells — specifically, nonswitched IgD<sup>+</sup>IgM<sup>+</sup> B cells — and, to a lesser extent, naive B cells. Although <italic>FCRL5</italic> was reported to be associated with switched memory B cells in healthy individuals (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), we observed only a weak correlation between <italic>FCRL5</italic> and switched IgD<sup>–</sup>IgM<sup>+</sup> B cells in this study, potentially due to the differences in the population of the subjects or the possibility that <italic>FCRL5</italic> was enriched only in CD27<sup>–</sup> atypical memory B cells, which were not quantified in this study. Despite higher total naive and memory B cell numbers at baseline, RTX <italic>FCRL5</italic><sup>hi</sup> patients had a similar extent of B cell depletion during the induction period compared with <italic>FCRL5</italic><sup>lo</sup> patients. The significance of B cell repletion in <italic>FCRL5</italic><sup>hi</sup> patients at later time points will require further investigation to understand the potential impact on relapse or PR3-ANCA status.</p>
              <p>This analysis has several strengths. It represents an unbiased selection of available samples from the RAVE study, one of the largest, extensively sampled, blinded placebo-controlled interventional trials in GPA or MPA. The proportion of <italic>FCRL5</italic><sup>hi</sup> patients is approximately 25% of the baseline cohort in RAVE, making these findings relevant to a subfraction of patients. Taken together, these results are an intriguing step in the direction of precision medicine for these patients but are purely hypothesis generating. These findings should be replicated in additional studies of anti-CD20 agents or CYC in the treatment of these severely ill patients in need of CR.</p>
              <p>One weakness of our analysis is that the sampling used for it was incomplete, and missing samples could have skewed or altered the analysis in an unknown manner. However, the number of unavailable samples was low (5%), and the trial outcomes of the subset included in our analysis mirrored that of the entire cohort. Another limitation of the study is that we do not have direct confirmation of <italic>FCRL5</italic> surface expression on B cells. It would be important for future studies to develop correlations between mRNA levels and surface expression in similar cohorts of clinically active GPA and MPA patients. A third weakness of the analysis is that further combinations of potentially predictive biomarkers such as B cell depletion status or ANCA status (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) were not evaluated together. Other groups have evaluated a Granularity Index from the RAVE publicly available database (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Our analysis introduces a new and biologically relevant biomarker for consideration.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, there is increasing interest in the identification of potentially novel response biomarkers in ANCA-associated vasculitis (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) that might aid therapeutic selection as new choices are made available to patients. RAVE is a NIAID-sponsored, ITN-supported open-source database that is available to a global community of researchers interested in these diseases. Truly useful biomarkers in many immunologic diseases are relatively rare. Our study findings of a subset of participants with higher baseline <italic>FCRL5</italic> expression could identify a subgroup of patients that may achieve a sustained benefit of RTX compared with CYC.</p>

                <p>Flow cytometry data were provided by the RAVE-ITN Group. This data set is available for download from the Immunology Database and Analysis ITN Portal and TrialShare public repositories (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.immunetolerance.org/researchers/trialshare">https://www.immunetolerance.org/researchers/trialshare</ext-link>).</p>
                <p>Flow cytometry analysis was carried out at predefined time points in the RAVE trial — at screening, at week 2, and at months 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 following enrollment — and was carried out using standardized protocols described in detail elsewhere (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p>

                <title>Statistics.</title>
                <p>The Biostatistics Team from the study sponsor (NIAID) provided raw, deidentified, individual-level patient data. These data sets are accessible to readers through TrialShare, a publicly accessible website developed and managed by the ITN (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.immunetolerance.org/researchers/trialshare">https://www.immunetolerance.org/researchers/trialshare</ext-link>). Selected clinical data were transferred from clinical trial databases into a customized Valicert database designed to facilitate analysis. Data analysis was performed using JMP (SAS), GraphPad Prism (GraphPad), and R statistical package (version 3.5.3) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.R-project.org">www.R-project.org</ext-link>).</p>
                <p>Differences in baseline <italic>FCRL5</italic> expression between responders and nonresponders (expressed as CR at 6, 12, and 18 months) in the RTX and CYC/AZA arms with respect to the linearly transformed values were measured using the nonparametric Wilcoxon rank-sum test.</p>
                <p>A threshold sensitivity method described elsewhere (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) was applied to baseline RNA samples in order to identify a <italic>FCRL5</italic> biomarker threshold that enriched for a control arm–corrected CR (at 6 months) to RTX. This threshold once established was then used in binary comparisons in order to compare outcomes in patients termed <italic>FCRL5</italic><sup>lo</sup> and <italic>FCRL5</italic><sup>hi</sup>. Differences in baseline variables (demographic, clinical, serological, and molecular data) — as well as in the proportion of patients achieving CR at 6, 12, and 18 months for the <italic>FCRL5</italic><sup>lo</sup> and <italic>FCRL5</italic><sup>hi</sup> patient subsets — were calculated, and nominal <italic>P</italic> values were determined. Continuous variables were compared using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. For categorical variables, 2 separate contingency tables, 1 for the experimental arm (RTX) and 1 for the control arm (CYC/AZA), were created to compare the proportion of responders in the <italic>FCRL5</italic><sup>lo</sup> and <italic>FCRL5</italic><sup>hi</sup> subsets, and <italic>P</italic> values were calculated using Fisher’s exact test.</p>
                <p>Spearman’s rank correlation (ρ) was used as a nonparametric test of association between flow cytometry cell populations at the screening visit and baseline FCRL5 expression. To identify flow cytometry populations that were independently correlated with <italic>FCRL5</italic> expression, a random forest decision tree algorithm was used to rank variables based on their predictive importance (expressed as proportion of MSE [%MSE]).</p>
                <p>Differences in FACS populations between <italic>FCRL5</italic> subgroups (high ≥ 0.01 versus low &lt; 0.01) at each time point were compared using Wilcoxon rank-sum test.</p>
                <p>Logistic regression was used to investigate the relationship between <italic>FCRL5</italic> and other baseline clinical characteristics. In univariate analysis, each characteristic was considered individually in separate logistic regression models. For multivariate analysis, all characteristics were included in a single logistic regression model to see if effects remained after adjustment for other factors. Statistical significance threshold was set at <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05. No correction was applied to account for multiple testing.</p>

                <p>(<bold>A</bold>) Baseline <italic>FCRL5</italic> mRNA levels assayed by qPCR in whole blood were compared in patients who achieved and failed to achieve complete remission at 6 months in both the RTX (<italic>n</italic> = 62 and <italic>n</italic> = 35, respectively) and the CYC arm (<italic>n</italic> = 49 and <italic>n</italic> = 42, respectively). Median and interquartile range shown as box plot; whiskers represent IQR. (<bold>B–D</bold>) Identified biomarker threshold (<italic>FCRL5</italic> ≥ 0.01 versus <italic>FCRL5</italic> &lt; 0.01) was tested in baseline mRNA samples from patients in the RAVE trial as a predictor of complete remission at 6 months (<bold>B</bold>), 12 months (<bold>C</bold>), and 18 months (<bold>D</bold>), in subjects treated with RTX (blue bars) versus CYC (red bars).
