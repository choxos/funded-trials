                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Abnormal patterns of muscle co-activation contribute to impaired movement after stroke. Previously, we developed a myoelectric computer interface (MyoCI) training paradigm to improve stroke-induced arm motor impairment by reducing the abnormal co-activation of arm muscle pairs. However, it is unclear to what extent the paradigm induced changes in the overall intermuscular coordination in the arm, as opposed to changing just the muscles trained with the MyoCI. This study examined the intermuscular coordination patterns of thirty-two stroke survivors who participated in 6Â weeks of MyoCI training.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">We used non-negative matrix factorization to identify the arm muscle synergies (coordinated patterns of muscle activity) during a reaching task before and after the training. We examined the extent to which synergies changed as the training reduced motor impairment. In addition, we introduced a new synergy analysis metric, disparity index (DI), to capture the changes in the individual muscle weights within a synergy.

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">There was no consistent pattern of change in the number of synergies across the subjects after the training. The composition of muscle synergies, calculated using a traditional synergy similarity metric, also did not change after the training. However, the disparity of muscle weights within synergies increased after the training in the participants who responded to MyoCI trainingâthat is, the specific muscles that the MyoCI was targeting became less correlated within a synergy. This trend was not observed in participants who did not respond to the training.

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p id="Par4">These findings suggest that MyoCI training reduced arm impairment by decoupling only the muscles trained while leaving other muscles relatively unaffected. This suggests that, even after injury, the nervous system is capable of motor learning on a highly fractionated level. It also suggests that MyoCI training can do what it was designed to doâenable stroke survivors to reduce abnormal co-activation in targeted muscles.</p>

              <p id="Par9">Stroke, the largest cause of long-term disability worldwide, often damages motor pathways in the brain and induces abnormal spatiotemporal patterns of co-activation across arm muscles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], also called abnormal muscle synergies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Using dimensionality reduction methods, such as non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) or principal component analysis (PCA), several studies characterized the stroke-induced abnormal muscle synergies based on the electromyography (EMG) signals of the arm muscles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Commonly observed abnormal muscle synergies after stroke include coupling of activity between elbow flexors and shoulder abductors during isometric torque generation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and dynamic reaching [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Moreover, stroke induces co-activation of the anterior, middle, and posterior deltoid during the stable force maintaining phase of the isometric reaching task [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This co-activation inhibits the ability to flex the shoulder maximally. These abnormal patterns contribute to motor impairment and reduced function after stroke, partially by limiting range of motion during reaching [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Thus, targeting these abnormal patterns is a potential new avenue for stroke rehabilitation.</p>
              <p id="Par10">Our previous study developed a myoelectric computer interface (MyoCI) paradigm to reduce abnormal co-activation and thereby impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Mugler et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] examined 6Â weeks of in-lab MyoCI training in thirty-two chronic stroke survivors with moderate-to-severe impairment. Before the training, each participant went through a screening process to identify the three most abnormally co-activating arm muscle pairs (defined by pairwise correlation coefficients) during free-reaching to targets, placed at waist and shoulder height, in front of and lateral to the impaired limb. After the screening, the participants were randomized to three different training groups (60 and 90Â min using isometric activation; 90Â min with activation during unrestricted movement). The participants were trained on and learned to activate each identified muscle pair separately for 2Â weeks. At the end of the MyoCI training, participants had reduced arm impairment (measured using the Fugl-Meyer Assessment), improved motor function and elbow range-of-motion, and reduced spasticity (measured with the Modified Ashworth Scale). However, it remains unclear how MyoCI training affected intermuscular coordination in the arm in reaching movements.</p>
              <p id="Par11">Here, we investigate to what extent MyoCI training changed intermuscular coordination. We assessed the composition and number of muscle synergies as effects on the more global arm muscle network. Further, we augmented our muscle synergy analysis by developing the disparity index (DI), which measures the disparity between the synergy activation weights of each pair of muscles trained.</p>

The time since stroke was 3.8âÂ±â6.2, 4.3âÂ±â4.1, and 5.3âÂ±â3.2Â years for 60I, 90I, and 90Â M groups, respectively (meanâÂ±âSEM) and ranged from 11 to 314Â months. All participants completed the entire 6Â weeks of training; 32 completed the 10-week evaluation. An occupational therapist performed the Fugl-Meyer Assessment of the upper extremity (FMA-UE) on the impaired arm to assess the motor impairment of participants. We included adult, chronic stroke survivors (at least 6Â months from stroke onset) who had persistent moderate to severe arm impairment (FMA-UE, 8-40/66) and increased arm tone. Full inclusion/exclusion criteria can be found in Mugler et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03579992. The study protocol was approved by the Northwestern University Institutional Review Board, and each participant gave written informed consent prior to eligibility assessment.</p>

                <title>Training and assessment paradigm</title>
                <p id="Par13">The MyoCI training involved using EMG envelopes of the targeted muscle pair to move a cursor to different targets in a custom-built game to reduce abnormal co-activation. The cursor started in the bottom left of the screen when the muscles were at rest. EMG amplitudes were multiplied by a gain, such that target distance corresponded to 10â20% of maximum voluntary contraction and then averaged over the previous 50Â ms. At each 50-ms time bin, the amplitudes of the targeted muscle pair were mapped to the position of a cursor along the cardinal [horizontal (X) and vertical (Y)] axes, respectively, and the cursor position was determined by a vector sum of these two components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Thus, only activating muscles in isolation would move the cursor along the cardinal axes. Participants trained on three muscle pairs for six sessions each over 2Â weeks. We assigned participants pseudo-randomly into three groups: two groups trained isometrically (restraining the arm) for either 60 or 90Â min per session (ISO<sub>60</sub> and ISO<sub>90</sub>, respectively) and one group trained without restraining the arm (movement group) for 90Â min per session (MVMT). Further details of the training, including specific muscle pairs, are described in our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par14">To assess the effects of the training on motor impairment, an occupational therapist blinded to the training group evaluated FMA-UE at ï»¿â2, 0, 2, 6, and 10Â weeks relative to the start of training. The occupational therapist was not fully blinded to the number of weeks; they knew when the first evaluation was done, but we did not explicitly tell them the week number of the subsequent sessions. We recorded EMG while each participant performed a reaching task on weeks â2, 0, 2, 4, 6, and 10, relative to the training start. As depicted in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, the task consisted of three reaches to each of six targets (approximately 4â³ in diameter and spaced 1 ft apart), placed at waist and shoulder height, in front of, and then lateral to, the impaired arm (36 reaches, in total, to sample a broad range of reaching directions). The participants were asked to reach to the target as best as they could (self-paced speed) and no adjustments were made for severely impaired survivors. After each reach, participants were asked to bring the arm back to the rest position at the side (elbow extended maximally, shoulder adducted, not flexed nor rotated with the thumb facing anteriorly). The resting period in between each reach was at least 3Â s.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>A reaching task that participants performed to assess the training effects using EMG data.

We identified co-activating muscles as targets for training in the study. We defined co-activation as the pairwise correlation coefficient between each pair of EMG envelopes during reaching. Muscle pairs with the largest abnormal co-activationâi.e., not seen in healthy arms during reachingâwere selected for the MyoCI training. The selected muscle pairs typically included biceps/anterior deltoid, anterior/posterior deltoid, and triceps lateral head/posterior deltoid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p>

The processed EMG envelope of each muscle was normalized by dividing it by the maximum amplitude over all trials for each week to avoid any bias in synergy extraction toward the muscles with high-amplitude activation. For each subject, the normalized EMG envelopes, which included the entire segment from rest to target and back to rest, were then concatenated across all trials per week to identify one representative set of muscle synergies that counted the entire set of 36 reaches. A KolmogorovâSmirnov test was used to test the normality of the data distribution, and the data were indeed normal (alphaâ=â0.05).</p>

                <p id="Par24">A DI value represents how much the pair of muscle weights diverged from their co-activation level, i.e., the mean of their weights. Therefore, a higher DI value indicated a lower level of co-activation of the muscle pair. After identifying m1<sub>base</sub> and m2<sub>base</sub> within a synergy and calculating DI<sub>base</sub>, we obtained the weights of the same muscles in a corresponding synergy at week 6 (m1<sub>wk6</sub> and m2<sub>wk6</sub>) to calculate their disparity index (DI<sub>wk6</sub>). The selection of the corresponding synergy vector at week 6 was based on the similarity score calculated from the scalar product. Once DI<sub>base</sub> and DI<sub>wk6</sub> of the trained muscle pair were obtained, we calculated the change in the weight disparity (ÎDI<sub>post-training</sub>â=âDI<sub>wk6</sub>âDI<sub>base</sub>) to quantify the training effect on the co-activation of the trained muscle pair (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). If more than one synergy at the baseline week contained both m1<sub>base</sub> and m2<sub>base</sub> exceeding Th<sub>CoA</sub>, the synergy with the smallest weight disparity between the two muscles was considered the representative synergy for the co-activation of the given muscle pair. That is, we chose the synergy with the most co-activation between the muscle pair because that was what we aimed to counteract with the MyoCI training. To summarize, as depicted in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, the algorithm selects the representative weights of each trained muscle pair from the baseline week (pre-training), which exceed the co-activation threshold and have minimal disparity, and compares them with the corresponding weights obtained from week 6 (post-training) using the DI method.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Calculating the disparity index (DI). From the synergy set of the baseline week, the synergy with the highest co-activation (lowest difference) between the targeted muscle pair (e.g., BI and AD in the second synergy (dark gray); m1<sub>base</sub> and m2<sub>base</sub>, their muscle weights) is identified. Both m1<sub>base</sub> and m2<sub>base</sub> are higher than Th<sub>CoA</sub>, the threshold of muscle co-activation. The synergy at week 6 (the second synergy of week 6) corresponding to the synergy of the baseline week is selected by calculating the scalar product with the baseline synergy 2. DI is calculated (<italic>right</italic>) from m1 and m2 at both time points, as the distance from the mean of m1 and m2 (Eq.Â <xref rid="Equ3" ref-type="">3</xref>).

Second, we computed the ÎDI<sub>post-training</sub> for the trained muscle pair and for all possible pairwise combinations of untrained muscles.

Typically, two to four synergies were identified from the EMGs of each participant before, interim, and after the MyoCI training in both responder and non-responder groups (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A). The average number of synergies across all participants and weeks was 2.41, indicating that three synergies predict most of the total EMG variance in both groups and across weeks. Overall, no consistent pattern of change in the number of muscle synergies was observed after the training in each group.

                <p id="Par27">The composition of three muscle synergies extracted from each participant at each week was distinctive with the dominant muscle weights but with inter-subject variability.

On average, the similarity (r-value) of three norm synergies (the mean of clustered synergies; Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B and C) between pre- (baseline week) and post-training (week 6) was 0.98âÂ±â0.01 and 0.99âÂ±â0.01 for responders and non-responders, respectively.

However, when the norm synergy per group and week was compared with its corresponding synergy of each participant, inter-subject variability of synergy composition within the same group was observed (Figs.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B and C). The mean r-value of each synergy was lower than the similarity threshold (0.86; <italic>p</italic>â&lt;â0.05), indicating substantial inter-subject variability of the synergy composition [responders: 0.84âÂ±â0.11 (baseline week), 0.83âÂ±â0.12 (week 6); non-responders: 0.80âÂ±â0.15 (baseline week), 0.82âÂ±â0.13 (week 6)]. Also, the same result was obtained even when extracting only two, instead of three, synergies (<italic>p</italic>â&lt;â0.05). In terms of the activation profile, regardless of the number of synergies extracted (two or three), there was no clear pattern of change in the mean magnitude of coefficients observed in both groups (pâ&gt;â0.05). Overall, the observations motivated us to develop a more precise way to quantify potential changes in a pair of muscle weights within a synergy, trained in the MyoCI protocol.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par31">In this study, we investigated the effect of MyoCI training on intermuscular coordination using muscle synergy analysis. The number of synergies identified during reaching ranged from two to four and did not change due to the training. The overall composition of muscle synergies also did not change. However, there was a notable change, within individual synergies, in the disparity of muscle weights of the trained muscles in responders to the training. While not all muscle pairs changed their co-activation, the muscle pairs with the largest abnormal co-activation before training showed the largest reduction in coupling after training, especially in the movement-based training group. These results suggest that our MyoCI paradigm did, in fact, allow participants to decouple the targeted muscle pairs (particularly the most abnormally co-activating, muscle pair 1), which, in turn, was correlated with improved movement. The fact that the training only changed the behavior of the trained muscles suggests that the CNS is capable of making highly fractionated changes in motor control, even after a stroke-causing severe impairment.</p>
              <p id="Par32">Our prior study showed that MyoCI training might reduce arm impairment in moderately and severely impaired stroke survivors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. That study found some reduction in pairwise correlations of the trained muscles during reaching in the movement group, but not in the isometric groups. This study, which looked at the within-synergy weights of the trained muscles, found increased disparity (reduced co-activation). Thus, the more comprehensive approach to intermuscular coordination using muscle synergy analysis revealed changes that were not seen in the simpler, pairwise correlation analysis.</p>
              <p id="Par33">In this study, we found no consistent pattern of change (e.g., merging or fractionation) observed in the overall composition of the synergy sets. Few studies have characterized the number of muscle synergies after stroke, as compared to unimpaired limbs, as having three different patterns: preservation, merging, and fractionation of unimpaired synergies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. More severe impairment after stroke correlated with having fewer synergies (merging) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] or fewer muscle networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. This observation suggests that we might expect to see fractionation of synergies (greater number of synergies) with improved function from MyoCI training. However, the current MyoCI paradigm was customized for each individualâs pattern of muscle co-activation, meaning that different muscle pairs were targeted for different participants. This inter-subject variability may have resulted in a diverse effect on the synergy composition across participants, given the variation in initial co-activation of muscles trained. Moreover, no clear pattern of change in the activation profile was observed due to the inconsistency of the pattern of change in the number and the composition of muscle synergies that arose from the high inter-subject variability.</p>
              <p id="Par34">To account for this diversity, we designed DI analysis to focus on the training effect on each individualâs muscle synergies, particularly those most relevant to the targeted muscle pairs. Previous studies showed that conventional synergy analysis can be misleading [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. When synergies are identified from a small subset of muscles, the conventional method using the VAF and its preset threshold for synergy identification can overestimate VAF, which affects the estimation of the number of synergies and the corresponding synergy composition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. This overestimation can lead to ignoring important features embedded in the residual muscle activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. DI analysis captured a consistent change in synergy activation weights in the responders that was not identified by conventional synergy analysis. DI thus complements conventional synergy analysis. However, the current DI method is limited to reflecting the change in the disparity between weights of a muscle pair only.</p>
              <p id="Par35">Only a few recent studies have investigated the effects of rehabilitation training on potential changes in the number and/or composition of muscle synergies and/or their activation profiles in stroke survivors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Two small studies showed that EMG feedback could reduce co-activation between agonist and antagonist muscles during training in stroke participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. While this finding aligns with our overall result, these studies did not assess the more global picture of arm intermuscular coordination. Pierella et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] showed that improved arm function in the subacute stage, coinciding with exoskeleton training, correlated with an increase in muscle synergy number and similarity to non-stroke controls in some of the participants. Two other studies showed some evidence of post-stroke synergies becoming more like those of unimpaired arm movement due to different rehabilitation strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. However, other studies showed unclear relationships between improved motor outcomes and either the number of muscle synergies or similarity between impaired and unimpaired synergies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Notably, these last two studies are pilot studies that included participants with only mild to moderate impairment.</p>
              <p id="Par36">One of the characteristics of human upper limb movements is that they can be highly fractionatedâi.e., we can precisely control the activation of individual joints and even single muscles. This is thought to be due to the precise connections of the corticospinal tract to small pools of motoneurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The presence of abnormal co-activation after stroke means that less fractionated movements are possible; this is thought to be due to corticospinal tract damage and higher reliance on the reticulospinal tract after stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Here, we showed that MyoCI training enabled stroke survivors to improve arm function not by changing entire synergies but rather by reweighting the activities of just those muscles that were targeted. This finding indicates that even severely impaired stroke survivors are capable of fractionated changes in movement control. This, in turn, suggests that some corticospinal tract functions may have remained in our responders to MyoCI. Alternatively, it is possible that plastic changes occurred at the spinal cord level. While we unfortunately did not directly examine the corticospinal excitability (e.g., with transcranial magnetic stimulation) or cortico-reticulospinal responses such as StartReact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], we hope to examine this in future studies to determine the extent to which this change is dependent on corticospinal tract changes. Regardless of the exact mechanism, MyoCI training enabled highly precise targeting of changes in muscular coordination.</p>
              <p id="Par37">This study did have some limitations. The muscle synergies were not investigated in the arms of neurologically intact persons or in the ipsilesional arm of stroke survivors. Therefore, the comparison of synergies was made only within the stroke-impaired arm. Moreover, since the total number of analyzed muscles affects synergy analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], further testing is important to examine whether the results remain consistent when more than eight arm muscles are examined. We are testing this in a follow-up, sham-controlled study with a wearable version of the MyoCI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Further, some muscles may co-activate normally at different times. Overall, we selected those muscle pairs for training that were typically not synergistic in multiple activities of daily living, in particular reaching, i.e., those that showed significantly less co-activation in age-matched, able-bodied individuals performing the same reaching task. Lastly, there is no widely accepted definition of âco-activationâ in terms of the weight of muscle within a synergy, which makes it unclear how best to quantify the degree of co-activation. The proposed DI method focuses on the change in weight disparity of a muscle pair to quantify the change in pair-wise co-activation level. This approach simplifies the quantification of change in co-activation. However, other factors, such as the change in the mean weight of aÂ muscle pair, could be also considered in future studies to interpret the training effect on the intermuscular coordination more comprehensively.

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p id="Par38">In conclusion, we demonstrated that the MyoCI paradigm improved the upper extremity motor impairment of the stroke survivors by rebalancing the muscle weights of trained muscles within muscle synergies. While there was no consistent pattern of change in the number and composition of muscle synergies after MyoCI training, the DI analysis captured the increase in weight disparity of trained muscle pairs within a synergy in the responders. Although not every muscle pair was decoupled, the results imply that MyoCI training can target abnormal co-activation, particularly of the most abnormally co-activating muscle pair. Further, MyoCI can enable functional improvement in people with severe impairment from stroke, even years after the stroke occurs.</p>
