                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Trials of intermittent preventive treatment (IPTp) of malaria in pregnant women that compared dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine with the standard of care, sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, showed dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine was superior at preventing malaria infection, but not at improving birthweight. We aimed to assess whether sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine shows greater non-malarial benefits for birth outcomes than does dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine, and whether dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine shows greater antimalarial benefits for birth outcomes than does sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>We defined treatment as random assignment to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine or dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine before pooling individual participant-level data from 1617 HIV-uninfected pregnant women in Kenya (one trial; n=806) and Uganda (two trials; n=811). We quantified the relative effect of treatment on birthweight (primary outcome) attributed to preventing placental malaria infection (mediator). We estimated antimalarial (indirect) and non-malarial (direct) effects of IPTp on birth outcomes using causal mediation analyses, accounting for confounders. We used two-stage individual participant data meta-analyses to calculate pooled-effect sizes.</p>

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>Overall, birthweight was higher among neonates of women randomly assigned to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine compared with women assigned to dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (mean difference 69 g, 95% CI 26 to 112), despite placental malaria infection being lower in the dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine group (relative risk [RR] 0·64, 95% CI 0·39 to 1·04). Mediation analyses showed sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine conferred a greater non-malarial effect than did dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (mean difference 87 g, 95% CI 43 to 131), whereas dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine conferred a slightly larger antimalarial effect than did sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (8 g, −9 to 26), although more frequent dosing increased the antimalarial effect (31 g, 3 to 60).</p>

                  <title>Interpretation</title>
                  <p>IPTp with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine appears to have potent non-malarial effects on birthweight. Further research is needed to evaluate monthly dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (or another compound with non-malarial effects) to achieve greater protection against malarial and non-malarial causes of low birthweight.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="para10">In sub-Saharan Africa, malaria infection during pregnancy is a major cause of low birthweight. For pregnant women, red blood cells infected with <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> sequester in the placenta, causing inflammatory cellular responses that lead to increased risk of preterm delivery (&lt;37 gestational weeks) and intrauterine growth restriction, which are both causes of low birthweight (&lt;2500 g).<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> To prevent adverse consequences of malaria infection, WHO recommends the provision of intermittent preventive treatment (IPTp) with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine to all pregnant women living in areas of moderate-to-high malaria transmission, administered at scheduled antenatal visits from the second trimester to delivery.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para20">Parasite resistance to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine in eastern and southern Africa has led researchers to evaluate alternative drug regimens for IPTp. Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine remains the most promising candidate, given its long-acting prophylactic effect and highly efficacious antimalarial activity. To date, three trials<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> in areas of high sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance have shown that dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine is well-tolerated and more effective in preventing malaria infection than is sulfadoxine-piperaquine. However, this effect did not translate into better birth outcomes.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> A plausible explanation for these results is that these studies lacked sufficient statistical power to detect differences in birth outcomes, as most of them were powered to detect differences in malaria outcomes, which were more prevalent. An alternative explanation is that sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, via the broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity of sulfadoxine, improves birth outcomes through mechanisms that are independent of its antimalarial activity (ie, via non-malarial mechanisms), and in these studies, the non-malarial effect has offset the greater antimalarial effect of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine on birth outcomes. Studies support this alternative hypothesis, suggesting IPTp with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine remains protective against low birthweight risk in areas with low malaria transmission<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> or high parasite resistance to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p>

                  <p id="para50">We searched <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov" id="interrefs10">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> and PubMed for original articles using the search terms “intermittent preventive treatment” AND “sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine” AND “malaria in pregnancy” OR “non-malarial effect” OR “bacterial vaginosis” OR “reproductive tract infections” OR “sexually transmitted infections”. No language or time restrictions were used in this search. We identified two observational studies, done in malarious regions of Zambia and Burkina Faso, and one editorial that addressed the potential non-malarial effect of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. Both observational studies found intermittent preventive treatment with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine in pregnant women (IPTp) had a dose-dependent effect on birth outcomes, with one study reporting that IPTp with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine was associated with reduced odds of sexually transmitted and reproductive tract infections, and overall adverse birth outcomes. The editorial, which cited a study done in a low malaria prevalence (&lt;1%) setting of Zambia, reported that IPTp with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine conferred a protective effect on birth outcomes. However, none of these studies differentiated between the non-malarial and antimalarial effects of IPTp with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine on adverse birth outcomes.</p>

                  <p id="para70">To our knowledge, this is the first study to use mediation analysis on individual-participant data from randomised controlled trials of IPTp to deconstruct the non-malarial and antimalarial effects of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine relative to dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine. Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine is one of the most promising candidates to replace sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine in IPTp regimens. Our findings show that IPTp with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine confers a greater non-malarial effect on birthweight than does IPTp with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine, but IPTp with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine has moderately greater antimalarial effects on birthweight than does IPTp with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine if given at monthly intervals.</p>

                    <bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para90">In areas with high parasite resistance to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, IPTp with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine could be more beneficial in improving birthweight through preventing the non-malarial causes of adverse pregnancy outcomes compared with IPTp with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine. However, IPTp with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine, when given monthly, has moderately greater antimalarial effects on birthweight than does IPTp with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. The combination of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine plus a partner compound that confers protection against the non-malarial causes of lower birthweight (eg, sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine) could increase the public health effect of IPTp more than dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine or sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine alone. However, further IPTp trials are needed to validate whether the combination of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (or any combination that targets both the malarial and non-malarial causes of lower birthweight) would be safe and efficacious.</p>

              </p>
              <p id="para100">To test this alternative hypothesis, we aimed to use data from three randomised trials in Kenya and Uganda to assess whether sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine shows greater non-malarial benefits for birth outcomes than does dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine, and whether dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine shows greater antimalarial benefits for birth outcomes than does sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. We used mediation analyses<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> to estimate the non-malarial and antimalarial effects of these two treatments. Mediation analysis is an epidemiological method that uses statistical modelling to examine quantitatively the extent to which certain intermediate variables mediate the overall effect of a treatment on an outcome. Mediation analysis is done by prespecifying a mediator and estimating the effect that a treatment has on an outcome either indirectly (via the mediator) or directly (via the non-mediated pathway). In this study, the term indirect effect is defined as the effect of IPTp on birthweight that is attributed to preventing placental malaria (ie, antimalarial effect). The term direct effect is defined as the effect of IPTp on birthweight that is not attributed to preventing placental malaria (ie, non-malarial effect). Here, we present analyses of the relative overall, indirect, and direct effects of these two IPTp regimens on birth outcomes.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="para360">By pooling data from three randomised controlled trials, we found evidence that IPTp influences birthweight through both antimalarial and non-malarial mechanisms. Crude analyses of data from these trials showed that, despite the substantially larger protective effect of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine on placental malaria, birthweight was higher for neonates of women randomly assigned to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. We did mediation analyses to investigate this seemingly paradoxical relationship. We found, via mechanisms mediated by malaria prevention, that monthly IPTp with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (as observed in the Uganda-BC3 study) was associated with a modest, but significant increase in birthweight (31 g) compared with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. By contrast, there was little difference in the antimalarial effect on birthweight between IPTp groups in studies with less frequent IPTp dosing (ie, Kenya-STOPMiP and Uganda-BC1). We found that, via mechanisms not mediated by malaria, sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine was associated with a significant increase in birthweight (87 g) compared with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine, and this effect was similar across studies. Antimalarial effects on preterm delivery risk did not follow birthweight or low birthweight trends, suggesting the mechanism by which IPTp affects birthweight might be via promotion of intrauterine fetal growth, rather than timing of delivery. We observed some evidence in Uganda that non-malarial effects were greater in multigravidae, which might reflect a greater attributable fraction of non-malarial causes of low birthweight compared with primigravidae, for whom malaria might be a more predominant cause of low birthweight.</p>
              <p id="para370">Although we do not know the exact non-malarial mechanisms by which sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine is improving birthweight, it is likely that the antibiotic properties of sulfadoxine are, at least partly, responsible for these observed effects.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Sulfadoxine belongs to a group of agents (sulfonamides) that have been previously used to treat <italic>Trichomonas vaginalis,</italic><xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref>

              <p id="para380">In the Uganda-BC3 study, 457 (73%) of 633 women received at least six IPTp doses, whereas in the Kenya-STOPMiP and Uganda-BC1 study, 592 (73%) of 806 and 178 (100%) of 178 women received three or less IPTp doses, respectively. More frequent dosing could explain why the antimalarial effect of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine was larger in the Uganda-BC3 study than the other studies. Our findings support the results of the original Uganda-BC1 study,<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> which found that dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine administered every 4 weeks was associated with lower malaria and adverse birth outcome risk than when administered every 8 weeks. Thus, to take advantage of the full antimalarial benefits of IPTp with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine, particularly in areas of high sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance or high malaria burden, doses should be given at monthly intervals and as early in the second trimester as possible.</p>
              <p id="para390">This study has limitations. First, mediation effect estimates might have been subject to unmeasured confounding, although our sensitivity analyses suggest non-malarial effects were fairly robust. Second, placental malaria (mediator) could have been measured with error, which would have probably, on average, have biased the antimalarial and non-malarial effect toward the null. However, a sensitivity analysis using a more specific definition of the mediator (active placental malaria infections) showed similar results. Third, our meta-analysis effect estimates were derived from only three studies and should be interpreted with caution. Finally, our study might have had low statistical power to detect true differences between gravidity subgroups and further studies are needed to support our findings.</p>
              <p id="para400">In conclusion, mediation analyses enabled us to quantify the greater benefits of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine against the non-malarial causes of lower birthweight compared with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine, and the greater benefits of monthly dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine against placental malaria as a cause of lower birthweight compared with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. These findings have two important policy implications. First, this study suggests that IPTp with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine might be beneficial in areas of low malaria transmission, where IPTp is not currently recommended, as long as the prevalence of these non-malarial causes are high. Second, the study suggests that in areas of high sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance or high malaria burden, rather than replacing sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine, a combination of these two regimens for monthly IPTp administration might be more efficacious in improving birthweight. Future IPTp trials need to validate the efficacy and safety of this combination. Provided IPTp with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine is safe and efficacious, this regimen or other combinations that target both malarial and non-malarial causes of lower birthweight (eg, dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine plus azithromycin<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> or dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine plus metronidazole<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref>) might have a greater public health impact than giving either therapy alone.</p>
