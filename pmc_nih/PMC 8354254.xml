                  <title>Objectives</title>
                  <p>We developed (a) a survey to investigate the knowledge of childhood health experts on public policies and behavioural insights (BI), as well as its use in Latin American and the Caribbean countries (LACs), and (b) an intervention (randomised controlled trial) to test the influence of nudges on the effect of a simulated public health programme communication.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Participants and settings</title>
                  <p>A total of 2003 LACs childhood health professionals participated in the study through a Hispanic online platform.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Primary and secondary outcomes</title>
                  <p>We used regression models analysing expertise-related information, individual differences and location. We extracted several outcome variables related to (a) ‘Public Policy Knowledge Index’ based on the participants’ degree of knowledge on childhood health public policies and (b) BI knowledge, perceived effectiveness and usefulness of a simulated public programme communication. We also analysed a ‘Behavioural Insights Knowledge Index’ (BIKI) based on participants’ performance in BI questions.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>In general, health professionals showed low BI knowledge (knowledge of the term BI: χ<sup>2</sup>=210.29, df=1 and p&lt;0.001; BIKI: χ<sup>2</sup>=160.5, df=1 and p&lt;0.001), and results were modulated by different factors (age, academic formation, public policy knowledge and location). The use of BI principles for the communication of the public programme revealed higher impact and clarity ratings from professionals than control messages.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>Our findings provide relevant knowledge about BI in health professionals to inform governmental and non-governmental organisations’ decision-making processes related with childhood public policies and BI designs.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>An alarming rate of children living in Latin American and the Caribbean countries (LACs) lags behind in comparison to children living in developed countries,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> since they are not receiving the required stimulation that ensures a proper cognitive and socio-emotional development.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> In 2017, the proportion of children at risk of stunting or extreme poverty in developing countries was 62.7%, and when low maternal schooling and child maltreatment were added, this proportion increased to 75%.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Both expert knowledge and effective interventions are crucial to prevent these adverse conditions. Standard economic models assume that people’s decision-making processes are rational.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> However, research on behavioural sciences suggests that this approach has serious weaknesses when predicting people’s behaviour. As such, behavioural sciences incorporate insights from several disciplines, such as psychology, in the understanding of people’s decisions.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Behavioural insights (BI) is the application of those insights drawn from behavioural science that complement the set of traditional tools available to governments when designing policies and communications.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> According to Thaler <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> those who apply BI are choice architects, in the sense that they create environments in order to influence people’s decisions. BI are widely applied to health settings,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 9</xref> showing its usefulness in improving childhood programmes’ effectiveness<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 10</xref> (for additional applications of BI in childhood policy, see <xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental references table A1</xref>). A growing number of BI-inspired initiatives have been directly applied to children<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11–13</xref> or their parents,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14–18</xref> over the last years (see <xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental references table A2</xref>). However, the use of BI for the improvement of health and development policies is still scarce in the region.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 19</xref></p>

              <p>Health development specialists represent a critical source in promoting the implementation of effective health programmes.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20 21</xref> Parents prefer receiving health advice on their children from paediatric specialists rather than based on specialists from other disciplines,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> while healthcare professionals have a pivotal role influencing parents on child vaccination.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Senior-level public health workers ascribe high degree of support for healthy public policies.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Still, to the best of our knowledge, the opinion of experts and specialists on the usefulness of BI in childhood policies has not yet been analysed. The opinion of health professionals regarding the efficiency, usefulness and real impact of BI in childhood development, particularly in LACs, remains largely unknown. Specifically, there are no clues about how age, expertise, academic degree and expert knowledge impact the perception and engagement with BI frameworks. This knowledge could help decision-makers target specific groups of professionals to improve the implementation of childhood policies. Accordingly, as our first aim, we investigated how these factors impact the knowledge of BI and childhood policies across experts working with children in LACs through a survey. Additionally, our second aim was to test whether applying BI in the communication of a simulated public programme would influence experts’ appraisal of said programme.</p>
              <p>The most common BI interventions in health settings are related to the reduction of drug prescriptions,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25–27</xref> the promotion of evidence-based decisions,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> the biases in diagnosis,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> the improvement of clinical performance<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30–32</xref> and the screening and maintenance of hand hygiene.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21 33</xref> Similarly, health professionals’ developments of BI have been investigated across LAC related to drug prescriptions,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> public policy knowledge about ageing<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> and clinical performance improvement.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36 37</xref> However, no previous BI interventions have been specifically designed for health professionals working on childhood development.</p>
              <p>In order to shed light on our understanding of the aforementioned issues, we developed a large-scale survey that was applied to 2003 expert health professionals working in child development across LACs. As our first aim, we collected professional appreciations about the knowledge, efficiency and usefulness of BI in childhood development. We applied different models to assess the impact of expertise-related aspects (experience and public policy knowledge), location (LAC-South and LAC-North) and individual differences (age and academic degree). In order to test experts’ knowledge on public policies, we used The Public Policy Knowledge Index (PPKI), an index based on participants’ degree of knowledge regarding childhood health public policies.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Since BI is not a widespread discipline in LACs, we predicted a general lack of knowledge of behavioural tools from child health specialists.</p>
              <p>Our second aim was to apply an experimental paradigm aimed at understanding whether BI can enhance health professionals’ acceptance and interest in child development public programmes. Thus, within the same survey, four communicational messages of a simulated public programme were developed using BI knowledge and were randomly assigned to different groups. Concerning this second aim, we expected that the BI-based messages would increase the perceived clarity, impact and interest in the policies, as described under previous BI literature.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38–40</xref></p>

                <p>The final sample (from an initial set of 2400 participants) comprised 2003 individuals (professionals working in development across LACs), with a mean age of 51.42 (SD=13.30), 55.62% being male. All participants were professionals and members of Intramed (<ext-link xlink:href="www.intramed.net" ext-link-type="uri">www.intramed.net</ext-link>), an online portal that congregates a large community of health professionals. Within its 24 years of existence, Intramed has developed a user-friendly platform where approximately 950 000 professionals gather medical information and interact periodically. This platform has already been used as a venue for different academic studies involving surveys or RCTs.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35 41 42</xref> By using the Intramed portal as the venue of this survey and recruiting experts that are already members of the platform, we guaranteed professionals were familiar with the platform. In addition, we developed a survey pilot to test its basic usability features (<xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental material B S1</xref>). The sample included professionals working in child development coming from different specialties and educational backgrounds from 18 countries (see below). Participation was strictly voluntary. Participants had to accept an invitation sent through a newsletter posted on the main page of their Intramed profiles and gave their informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki by pressing an ‘I agree’ button after an explanatory letter. The invitation was sent individually, and each respondent was allowed to complete the survey only once. This feature reduced the probability of contamination stemming from other respondents. Since participants were already members of the platform, we were able to access their relevant profile data automatically, which was then used to define variables for the modelling analysis of the participant responses, such as level of professional background and specific medical field of work. The institutional ethics committees of INECO Foundation and Intramed approved this study.</p>

                <p>The survey was distributed to participants through the Intramed online portal over a 13-month period. For the simulated public programme, each eligible participant was randomly assigned to one of four groups: control, simplification, social norm and visual information. The sample size was not initially restricted. We finished the experiment with 2400 total respondents. The answers were analysed in terms of region instead of country levels in order to avoid sample size issues. The final sample comprised 2003 professionals (see <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>). In addition, together with significance analysis, size effects were calculated and discussed in the posterior analysis. ORs were calculated from the logits through exponentiation of the values as an effect size measure, and the Cox and Snell R<sup>2</sup> included a likelihood function, which considered the sample size in the calculation (<xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental material B S3</xref>).</p>

It also included a section (<xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental material C</xref>) testing different BI interventions that participants had to answer immediately after the previous sections. The survey presented five sections, lasting 10 min in total. The first four sections, as well as the last section, took 5 min to be completed. The first section asked general questions related to the participant’s profile and working areas. The second section tested participants’ knowledge of childhood public policies. The third inquired into their impressions of the accessibility of childhood public policies in their countries. The fourth section asked about their satisfaction with their country’s ministerial initiatives in childhood development, and the fifth section was related to participants’ BI knowledge. The last section is described in the following Development and implementation section.</p>
                <p>We extracted several outcome variables related to (a) the participants’ degree of knowledge on childhood health public policies (PPKI)<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> and (b) BI knowledge, perceived effectiveness and usefulness and the ‘Behavioural Insights Knowledge Index (BIKI) based on participants’ performance in BI questions. As in a similar survey from our team,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> several predictors were considered for different dependent measures such as work context (private, public or both), experience (years in the field), academic degree, age, PPKI and location (north vs south).</p>

                <p>The control message included information on the characteristics of the programme. BI strategies were obtained from the Behavioural Insights Team’s (BIT) Easy, Attractive, Social and Timely (EAST) framework<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39 40</xref> to design three intervention messages. The first intervention message (simplification) was a simplified version of the control message. According to the EAST framework, easy materials have more probability to be processed and understood.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> Thus, in order to promote clear reading, we included bullet points, colloquial language and informative subtitles. The second intervention message (social norm) presented simplified content and included a message of social description, alluding that most professionals already participated in this public programme. This message was based on previous BI literature that suggests social comparison and the use of social norms can influence people’s behaviour towards an initiative.<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45 46</xref> In the last intervention message (simplification, social norm and visual information), photos of children were added to the content in order to increase the impact of the message based on previous literature showing that images promote awareness and influence decision-making.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39 47</xref> Once the first draft of the survey was developed, we implemented a first pilot (<xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental material B S1</xref>) testing its usability features and perfected the instrument several times before its implementation.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>In the present study, we evaluated the knowledge and perception of BI in health professionals working with children across LACs. Also, to assess potential effectiveness of these BI techniques, we tested the effect of BI interventions on a public programme. Results revealed a general lack of knowledge surrounding BI, as well as a lack of estimation on its usefulness and effectiveness. The factors that modulate these variables were related to age, academic degree, PPKI and location. Being older, having a higher degree formation, being from LAC-North and having high PPKI predicted a higher BI knowledge. In contrast, being younger and having a higher academic degree predicted higher BI perceived effectiveness. The second part of the study aimed at testing the effect of employing BI interventions to design policy communications, evidenced that simplified messages and the use of visualisation and social norms promoted higher levels of clarity and perceived impact across professionals compared with control material. This set of results may help governments in LACs to improve the design and implementation of strategies for childhood health professionals.</p>
              <p>Our survey suggested a poor knowledge of the BI term across the region, accentuated by demographics (younger people), academic formation (low degree) and public policy knowledge (low PPKI). Since experts’ trainings<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> are essential to guarantee a proper implementation of public policies in the region,<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51 52</xref> our results highlight the importance of focusing specifically in younger, less trained professionals in order to tackle the knowledge gap found in the region.</p>
              <p>Consistent with the results related to BI knowledge, most participants presented low BIKI. Factors accentuating the low BIKI were younger age, lower degree formation and lower PPKI. Based on these results, it may become useful to complement health professionals’ trainings along with BI knowledge; after all, interdisciplinary knowledge is recommended to improve health outcomes.<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43 52</xref> Being part of LAC-North location was a predictor of high BIKI, which may relate to the fact that BI discipline has had an important development in North America, spreading its influence to Mexico<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> through international programmes.<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></p>
              <p>Most participants had no knowledge on whether BI interventions are indeed effective, although more participants tend to consider them effective over those that do not. The lack of knowledge on BI effectiveness and usefulness may be explained by the low familiarity with BI and its related interventions. Low perceived effectiveness was accentuated by age (older professionals) and professional background (lower academic degrees). These results suggest a paradoxical effect of age: although older people know more about the discipline, they regard BI as less effective than younger people do. This suggests that the innovative aspects of BI, as well as its effectiveness, require increased public awareness to promote its implementation in childhood programmes.<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref></p>
              <p>Finally, compared with standard public policy communications,<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43 44</xref> the use of different BI interventions improved the perceived clarity and impact of the policy among participants. In line with relevant literature,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26 28 32</xref> our preliminary findings suggest that the use of nudges in policy messages can improve the perception across health professionals. However, the interventions did not significantly improve participants’ interest in being contacted. In this sense, the awareness of being in a simulated intervention (lacking ‘real-world’ criteria) may have played a role in participants’ limited willingness to participate. More public discussion may be needed to increase awareness of these methods, as well as including health professionals in the design of BI trials to let them use these initiatives firsthand.</p>
              <p>Interestingly, while participants showed scarce knowledge of BI ideas, they were nevertheless influenced by the use of its principles when evaluating the messages about the public programme. This reinforces the idea that the messages were effective in moderating the impact and clarity of the messages through automatic, non-conscious evaluation processes as posited by the nudge theory.</p>

                <title>Limitations and further assessments</title>
                <p>The main limitations of this study reside in the biases coming from the self-report surveys, where respondents tend to answer taking into account social desirability. However, this limitation is a general one for survey studies.<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55–57</xref> Nevertheless, we focused on professionals working in the field to maximise expertise in the issues and did not focus on socially undesirable questions that could affect the participants’ answers in an evident fashion.</p>
                <p>Another limitation of this study comes from the imbalance of samples across countries. Therefore, the present results should be extrapolated with caution. Notwithstanding, this is one of the largest LAC regional surveys of specialists working in child development. The consistency of responses in the different locations (LAC-North and LAC-South) and some expected discrepancies suggest our findings may have generalisability.</p>
                <p>This study paves the way for future studies to analyse health professionals’ knowledge on innovative strategies to implement public programmes in their communities. We expect future studies to research similar questions across the globe.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>Our study on professionals working with children across LACs evidenced a knowledge gap on BI appraisal that may have an impact in the implementation of public programmes. Additionally, our BI interventions showed an encouraging approach to improve public policy communications in the field. Overall, our results can help to identify main factors related to knowledge needs, helping governments to optimise their public policy implementations.</p>
