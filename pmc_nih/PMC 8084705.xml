          <body>
            <p id="P17">The prevalence of insomnia in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is high compared with typically developing peers and estimated at 50% to 80%.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> The most frequent problems are difficulty falling asleep (approximately 40%) and maintaining sleep (approximately 35%).<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>–<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> An accumulating body of evidence demonstrates both short- and long-term negative consequences of poor sleep in children, including inattention, hyperactivity, irritability, poor memory, poorer school performance, anxiety, depression, and poorer cardiometabolic health in early adolescence.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>–<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Sleep problems in children with ASD are particularly challenging to their families and associated with increased maternal distress, parental sleep disruption, and poor quality of life of caregivers.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> The improvement of sleep duration and onset in children with ASD is among their families’ priorities for research and treatment development.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup></p>
            <p id="P18">Clinical guidelines recommend sleep hygiene and/or behavioral intervention as the first-line treatment, but if this fails, there are no medications approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of pediatric insomnia.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Melatonin, a hormone produced by the pineal gland during the night, is an endogenous sleep promoter and regulator of the circadian clock in humans. Some evidence suggests impaired regulation of melatonin production in children with ASD.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> In certain neurogenetic disorders (eg, Smith-Magenis syndrome [SMS]), melatonin production is abnormally shifted to the daytime hours.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Exogenous melatonin has been found to be effective for sleep problems in ASD.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Melatonin replacement therapy in ASD and SMS is therefore a rational etiological approach.</p>
            <p id="P19">Whereas the ongoing need of using melatonin in the treatment of sleep problems in children with ASD is recommended as part of good clinical practice,<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> data are needed to support evidence-based clinical recommendations regarding the duration and safety of long-term melatonin use in these children. Pediatric prolonged-release melatonin (PedPRM) is an oral solid preparation of prolonged-release melatonin designed to mimic the physiological secretion profile of melatonin providing sustained plasma levels for 8 to 10 hours. Because the prolonged-release properties of the preparation are lost if crushed, a pediatric-appropriate 3-mm-diameter, film-coated tasteless and odorless prolonged-release melatonin mini-tablet (Slenyto; Neurim Pharmaceuticals Ltd., Tel Aviv, Israel) was developed, which can be more easily swallowed and better tolerated by young children. PedPRM has recently been licensed by the European Medicines Agency for use in pediatric populations with ASD and SMS.</p>
            <p id="P20">A randomized, double-blind (DB), placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter (European Union and United States) study of PedPRM for 13 weeks (2 mg with an optional dose escalation to 5 mg after 3 weeks) in children (N = 25; age range 2–17.5 years) with ASD and SMS with or without ADHD comorbidity demonstrated that PedPRM was efficacious and safe compared with placebo for treatment of insomnia.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> The main benefits of PedPRM demonstrated in the DB trial were that total sleep time (TST) increased: participants slept on average 57.5 minutes longer at night with PedPRM compared with 9.14 minutes with placebo (<italic>p</italic> = .034). Sleep latency also improved, decreasing by 39.6 minutes on average with PedPRM and 12.5 minutes with placebo (<italic>p</italic> = .011), without causing earlier wakeup time.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> In addition, externalizing behavior in children and caregivers’ quality of life improved significantly (<italic>p</italic> = .021 and <italic>p</italic> = .010, respectively, compared with placebo treatment).<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Completers of the DB phase entered a prospective 91 weeks of open-label (OL) PedPRM treatment and finally 2 weeks of placebo to evaluate withdrawal effects.</p>
            <p id="P21">Once all participants in the OL phase completed 39 weeks of follow-up (week 54), the 1-year data were summarized and published,<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> while 80 participants continued for an additional 52 weeks of PedPRM treatment and 2 weeks placebo to complete the study. In this article, we report on the benefits and risks of PedPRM treatment (2 mg, 5 mg, or 10 mg daily up to 2 years of continuous use) and discontinuation, including impact of treatment on child sleep, growth, and puberty and caregivers’ sleep and quality of life, thus providing clinicians with evidence-based data relating to PedPRM effectiveness and safety.</p>

                <p id="P22">Participants included children and adolescents (2–17.5 years of age) with confirmed physician-diagnosed ASD according to DSM-IV/DSM-5 or ICD-10 criteria or SMS and a minimum of 3 months of impaired sleep, defined as ≤6 hours of continuous sleep and/or ≥0.5-hour sleep latency from light off 3 out of 5 nights per week for 2 weeks based on parent reports and patient medical history as described.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> The trial complied with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki (1989) and standards of good clinical practices and was carried out between December 1, 2013, and February 28, 2018, in 14 centers in the United States and 10 centers in Europe. All caregivers gave written informed consent before participation and participants ≥6 years of age (according to country regulations) gave written informed consent in addition to their caregivers.</p>

                <p id="P23">The study design is illustrated in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>. Parents of children who did not have a documented history of sleep hygiene and behavioral intervention at screening received education in behavioral sleep interventions provided through a standardized pamphlet<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> and were asked to implement the outlined strategies for 4 weeks. Participants who were still eligible were then entered into the study. The study comprised a 2-week single-blind placebo run-in (baseline), followed by a 13-week randomized DB PedPRM (mini-tablet) or placebo taken nightly after the evening meal, 30 to 60 minutes before bedtime. Completers entered a 91-week OL PedPRM treatment period (according to the final DB dose) followed by a 2-week single-blind placebo run-out (withdrawal period), for a total of 108 weeks of study medication.</p>
                <p id="P24">The starting dose was 2 mg PedPRM (or placebo equivalent) with optional dose escalation from 2 to 5 mg after 3 weeks of DB treatment (week 5 in the trial) and from 2 to 5 mg or from 5 to 10 mg/day after 13 weeks of OL treatment (week 28) if participants failed to improve TST and/or sleep latency by at least 60 minutes from baseline. Optional decrease in dose was allowed at all times during the study, based on investigator decision (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>).</p>
                <p id="P25">Sleep variables, reported by parent/caregiver, were assessed using a validated sleep and nap diary (SND) that has been used in previous trials including a previous pediatric immediate-release melatonin trial.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> The SND was to be completed every morning by the parent/caregiver at home for 14 days before each visit throughout the 13-week DB period and the first 39 weeks of the OL period. The a priori defined primary efficacy endpoint was the changes from baseline in mean TST over the 14 days by the end of the DB period. The primary secondary endpoint was the change from baseline in mean sleep latency. Other secondary sleep variables were the changes from baseline in mean duration of wake after sleep onset, mean number of awakenings, and mean longest sleep episode, all from the SND.</p>
                <p id="P26">Child sleep was assessed at each visit throughout the 2-year study using the Composite Sleep Disturbance Index (CSDI), which scores the frequency and duration of the participant’s sleep habits over the previous month (6 habits: settling at bedtime, sleep induction, waking up during the night, resettling, early wake time, and co-sleeping with caregivers; scored 0–2; total score range 0–12).<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Caregiver measures included the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score (total score &gt;5 is considered significant sleep disturbances; total score range 0–21),<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> 5-item World Health Organization Well-Being Index (WHO-5) (covers positive mood, vitality, and general interests; total score range 1–25),<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> and a separate CSDI item that records satisfaction with the child’s sleep patterns rated from 1 to 5, all of which were recorded at each visit.</p>
                <p id="P27">Safety was monitored throughout the study, using standard clinical trials methods and definitions (treatment-emergent signs and symptoms [TESS],<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> adverse events, vital signs, and physical examination). Epilepsy and health status were also assessed.</p>
                <p id="P28">Child development was assessed in children ≥8 years of age using Tanner pubertal staging done by a physician, body mass index (BMI) percentiles (obesity), and z-scores.

Completers entered the OL phase with PedPRM; 74 completed the treatment (week 106), and 73 completed the run-out phase (70 had ASD [95.9%] and 3 [4.1%] had SMS) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). In the DB phase, significantly more participants discontinued in the placebo group than PedPRM-treated group; the most common reasons for discontinuation were withdrawal of parent consent mainly because of personal reasons (n = 6) and adverse events (n = 6).</p>

There were no notable differences in outcomes at week 106 between participants originally assigned to placebo when given PedPRM treatment for 91 weeks (placebo group) or participants originally assigned to PedPRM and given PedPRM for 104 weeks (PedPRM group), thus allowing us to combine the groups (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). The mean (SE) changes from baseline in CSDI sleep disturbance, caregiver’s satisfaction with child’s sleep patterns, and WHO-5 quality of life for the combined PedPRM and placebo groups (n = 74) in the follow-up phase are presented in <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>. For completeness, data on this combined population from week 28 and week 54<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> are also depicted (yellow outline). The same results were obtained when looking only at the 73 completers of the OL period. Increase in efficacy was observed between week 28 and week 54 that followed the dose optimization (at week 28) allowing some children to escalate to 10 mg/day. Improvements in CSDI (decrease), in caregiver satisfaction with child’s sleep patterns (increase), and WHO-5 (increase) were significant over baseline values and maintained until the end of PedPRM treatment.</p>
                <p id="P33">After the 2-weeks run-out on placebo (week 108), the treatment effects decreased but remained significantly better compared with baseline (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Similarly, mean (SE) change from baseline in caregiver PSQI for the combined PedPRM and placebo groups (n = 74) at week 106 improved −1.55 (0.448) (p = .001) showing maintenance of beneficial effect from values seen a year before (week 54).<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> The effects declined during run-out on placebo. Nevertheless, significant improvements in PSQI were still reported at withdrawal (not shown).

In the 91-week OL phase, 6 participants had unscheduled dose decreases owing to unacceptable increases in daytime fatigue; in 4 of 6 participants, the increases in daytime fatigue occurred shortly after dose escalation and resolved by decreasing the dose to that used before the dose escalation. One patient had a dose decrease because of another reason, and 1 patient had a dose decrease because the treatment effect was reduced at the highest (10 mg) dose.</p>

The most commonly reported severe treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in both randomization groups were agitation, fatigue, and mood swings (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>, available online).

Most of these TEAEs were similar between groups and known symptoms in children with ASD (eg, agitation, mood swings) or generally in children (eg, upper respiratory tract infection, cough, dyspnea, vomiting). In the DB period, somnolence was significantly more common in the PedPRM-treated group than placebo-treated group (<italic>p</italic> = .044), and headaches were more common in the PedPRM-treated group than placebo-treated group but not significantly (<italic>p</italic> = .29). In the PedPRM group, 1 participant discontinued use owing to nonserious adverse events (fatigue, agitation, and stereotypies).

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p id="P45">This study strongly supports the longer-term effectiveness and safety of PedPRM for insomnia in children with ASD. The CSDI provides evidence on several aspects of child sleep disturbances: settling at bed time, sleep induction, waking up during the night, resettling, early wake time, and co-sleeping with caregivers. Changes in CSDI were significantly correlated with TST. The improvement in sleep CSDI was maintained throughout the 2 years under the optimal dose (2, 5, or 10 mg nightly) and so were the benefits to caregivers.</p>
              <p id="P46">The pharmacological activity of PedPRM weans off after stopping the active treatment. With PedPRM, similar to prolonged-release melatonin in participants with insomnia ≥55 years of age,<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> participants did not show any emerging symptoms or worsening of insomnia during the run-out period, suggesting that discontinuation is not associated with withdrawal effects or rebound insomnia.</p>
              <p id="P47">Treatment compliance and acceptance in children with ASD, many of whom have swallowing difficulties and are sensitive to smell, was excellent without the need to crush or dissolve the mini-tablets (which would negate the prolonged-release properties) supporting the use of the tasteless and odorless mini-tablets in this population.</p>
              <p id="P48">There were no notable effects of long-term PedPRM on vital signs or measures of child growth, and no unexpected safety issues were reported. Adverse effects were few and generally mild, with fatigue and somnolence emerging as the main treatment-related TEAEs. Somnolence was usually reported only once by a participant at some time during the treatment period, most commonly within a short time after dose escalation, and was much less common in the OL phase (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S2</xref>, available online). Fatigue was usually reported shortly after dose escalation and resolved by decreasing the dose to that used before the dose escalation. Treatment-related somnolence and fatigue most probably reflected the pharmacological effect of residual daytime melatonin secondary to the excessive dose. It is possible that some of these participants were poor metabolizers of CYP1A2 enzyme and developed daytime somnolence or fatigue owing to melatonin accumulation.<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> However, gradual loss of effect of exogenous melatonin, which is to be expected with poor CYP1A2 metabolism,<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> was observed in only 1 participant on a 10-mg dose and resolved by decreasing the dose to the 5 mg used before dose escalation. Future studies measuring daytime melatonin levels in children with ASD before and after such treatment could elucidate whether somnolence and/or fatigue events were related to melatonin accumulation.</p>
              <p id="P49">Children and adolescents with ASD can have more frequent or more severe mood changes than typically developing teenagers,<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> and as this is an open-label study, the mood swings, though considered treatment-related, may in fact be due to the underlying disorder.</p>
              <p id="P50">In the DB period, there were no seizures on PedPRM treatment, and there was 1 new-onset absence seizure on placebo. During the 91-week OL period, 1 participant experienced 2 absence seizures, and 1 participant had a new-onset absence seizure, all considered by the clinicians unlikely to be related to study treatment. There has been only 1 short report in the literature<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> describing changes in seizure frequency with melatonin (the source of the melatonin impurities profile was not disclosed). Seizures were not reported as an adverse effect in a systematic review and meta-analysis on the safety of melatonin in ASD that included 35 published studies<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> or in a retrospective review of melatonin usage in 107 children with ASD, including 21 with seizures.<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> In summary, PedPRM treatment was not associated with new-onset or worsening seizures.</p>
              <p id="P51">It has been suggested that melatonin is involved in the modulation of human sexual maturation,<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> but clinical experience related to this issue has yielded inconclusive and sometimes conflicting results.<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> An association of pineal tumors and precocious puberty was first hypothesized in 1898 when Heubner described the first case, but this has not been unequivocally demonstrated since.<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> Decline in melatonin production after puberty suggested that puberty stage may mediate the decline of melatonin, or the decrease in melatonin amplitude may be an indicator of pubertal progression.<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> However, despite supplemental melatonin use, 30 female participants and 15 male participants with chronic sleep-onset insomnia showed normal onset of puberty.<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> Furthermore, a study of 3- to 10-year-old children<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> receiving supplemental melatonin for 14 weeks showed no alterations in estrogen, testosterone, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, or prolactin with treatment. The results of the present study show no delay in sexual maturation with PedPRM in 31 participants 8 to 17 years of age after 2 years of continuous use, and no child was delayed in sexual maturation.</p>
              <p id="P52">A limitation in this study was the OL design. With respect to growth and pubertal development, we relied on published statistics, which may vary by location and genetic origin. Another limitation was missing data from 13 participants who declined to be assessed. Nevertheless, the fact that the placebo randomized group had 3 months less exposure and did not show more rapid growth or pubertal development than the PedPRM group supports that there were no major effects on child development and sexual maturation.</p>
              <p id="P53">In conclusion, melatonin treatment should be considered only when sleep hygiene (including minimizing blue light in the evening) and behavioral interventions have been tried and were not successful. The long-term safety and unique efficacy profiles indicate that PedPRM provides significant benefits for insomnia in children and adolescents with ASD.</p>
