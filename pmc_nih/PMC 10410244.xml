                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>One-half of all people who undergo lung cancer screening (LCS) currently use tobacco. However, few published studies have explored how to implement effective tobacco use treatment optimally during the LCS encounter.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Research Question</title>
                  <p>Was the Optimizing Lung Screening intervention (OaSiS) effective at reducing tobacco use among patients undergoing LCS in community-based radiology facilities?</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Study Design and Methods</title>
                  <p>The OaSiS study (National Cancer Institute [NCI] Protocol No.: WF-20817CD) is an effectiveness-implementation hybrid type II cluster randomized trial of radiology facilities conducted in partnership with the Wake Forest National Cancer Institute Community Oncology Research Program research base. We randomly assigned 26 radiology facilities in 20 states to the intervention or usual care group. Staff at intervention facilities implemented a variety of strategies targeting the clinic and care team. Eligible patient participants were aged 55 to 77 years undergoing LCS and currently using tobacco. Of 1,094 who completed a baseline survey (523 intervention group, 471 control group) immediately before the LCS appointment, 956 completed the 6-month follow-up (86% retention rate). Fifty-four percent of those who reported not using tobacco at 6 months completed biochemical verification via mailed cotinine assay. Generalized estimating equation marginal models were used in an intention-to-treat analysis to predict 7-day tobacco use abstinence.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>The average self-reported abstinence among participants varied considerably across facilities (0%-27%). Despite a significant increase in average cessation rate over time (0% at baseline to approximately 13% at 6 months; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001), tobacco use did not differ by trial group at 14 days (OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.46-1.99; <italic>P</italic> = .90), 3 months (OR, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.69-1.99; <italic>P</italic> = .56), or 6 months (OR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.65-1.43; <italic>P</italic> = .87).</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Interpretation</title>
                  <p>The OaSiS trial participants showed a significant reduction in tobacco use over time, but no difference by trial arm was found.</p>

For example, adding a cessation intervention of modest effectiveness (15%) to low-dose CT screening results in life-year gains that are comparable with increasing screening uptake from 30% to 100%.</p>
            <p id="p0035">In 2015, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) required that all patients who use tobacco and undergo LCS receive information on the importance of tobacco use cessation and TUT.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> CMS also advised that TUT be offered at a shared decision-making visit to discuss screening and at the time of screening. In 2022, CMS removed the requirement that radiology facilities make tobacco use cessation interventions available to those who use tobacco. Nonetheless, LCS serves as an excellent opportunity to expand reach of TUT, given that one-half of all those who undergo LCS currently use tobacco. Few published studies have explored how to optimize the implementation and effectiveness of cessation support during the LCS encounter.</p>
            <p id="p0040">The Optimizing Lung Screening Intervention (OaSiS) Trial is a cluster randomized trial to reduce tobacco use among participants undergoing LCS at community-based radiology facilities affiliated with the National Cancer Institute Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP).<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> This trial is part of the Smoking Cessation at Lung Examination Collaboration.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> The Smoking Cessation at Lung Examination Collaboration is an effort combining eight federally funded research studies targeting how best to support tobacco use treatment for patients undergoing LCS.</p>

                <p id="p0045">The OaSiS study (Identifier: WF-20817CD) is an effectiveness-implementation hybrid (type II) cluster randomized trial of radiology facilities conducted in partnership with the Wake Forest NCORP Research Base.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> A hybrid type II design was chosen because it places equal value on examining effectiveness and implementation outcomes in a single trial. Given that TUT is an evidence-based strategy that has not yet been tested rigorously and repeatedly in the LCS environment, this design gave us the opportunity to asses whether it works in a new setting and under what conditions.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref></p>
                <p id="p0050">We sent all NCORP community site principal investigators and cancer care delivery research leaders an e-mail outlining eligibility for the trial and soliciting their potential interest. Twenty-eight NCORP community sites with radiology facilities completed a brief survey that assessed LCS volume, the racial and ethnic composition of LCS participants, and availability of tobacco cessation support services within the radiology facility. Cancer care delivery research leaders obtained information from the director of the radiology facility and from health system leaders and data from the electronic health record to complete the survey. To be included in the trial, radiology facilities: (1) had to report an LCS volume of at least 50 screenings within the prior 6 months, (2) had to be willing to be randomized, and (3) had to be able to identify a champion(s) who would serve as the study liaison and organize each facility’s efforts to promote tobacco use cessation. Radiology facilities were not excluded from eligibility based on existing cessation support services. A health system with more than one radiology facility chose one location to participate in this trial. This study was approved by the National Cancer Institute Cancer Prevention and Control CIRB on December 10, 2019.</p>
                <p id="p0055">Within facilities, we included patients who were referred for LCS and: (1) were aged 55 to 77 years per Medicare reimbursement guidelines for LCS at the time the trial was initiated, (2) self-reported as using tobacco every day or some days at baseline, and (3) had not received tobacco dependence treatment within the last 30 days unless using bupropion for depression. We excluded individuals with any of the following criteria: prior 30-day use of a tobacco dependence treatment, (2) use of e-cigarettes only (dual e-cigarette and cigarette users were eligible), (3) presence of a cognitive or physical impairment that would prevent the person from completing surveys, and (4) did not speak English.</p>

Team members from the radiology facilities in the intervention arm participated in all of the intervention activities. We required that a tobacco cessation champion and members of the imaging team participate in strategies 1, 2, 3, and 4. However, other individuals who participated in these strategies varied by site based on personnel and resources at the radiology facility and health system. Other participants included, for example, lung navigators and centralized tobacco cessation, pharmacy, and marketing personnel. Radiology facilities in the usual care arm were offered all implementation activities after data collection was completed. Receipt of the strategies was voluntary for usual care clinics and not an expectation of trial participation.</p>

                <p id="p0075">The primary outcome was self-reported past-7-day tobacco use at the 6-month follow-up survey. Participants who indicated not using tobacco for the past 7 days at the 6-month telephone follow-up were mailed a saliva collection kit (SalivaBio Oral Swab; Salimetrics, Inc.) to validate self-report biochemically. Cotinine levels were determined using the high-sensitivity Salivary Cotinine Quantitative Enzyme Immunoassay kit (item number 1-2002; Salimetrics, Inc.), a competitive immune assay kit with a determination range from 0.8 to 200 ng/mL. Saliva samples were analyzed in duplicate without dilution. Salivary cotinine levels of &lt; 15 ng/mL were deemed consistent with no tobacco use for the prior 7 days. Secondary outcomes included self-reported tobacco use at 14 days and 3 months, quit attempts at 3 and 6 months, and the self-reported number of cessation services received at baseline and 14 days. Participants received $10 gift cards for completion of each survey and a $20 gift card for returning the saliva kit.</p>
                <p id="p0080">Sociodemographic characteristics included sex (male, female, or nonbinary), age (55-64 years, 65-74 years, or ≥ 75 years), race or ethnicity (White/non-Hispanic, Black/non-Hispanic, American Indian/non-Hispanic, or Hispanic/all races), residence (metropolitan or nonmetropolitan according to the Rural-Urban Commuting Area coding system), household income (&lt; $15,000, $15,000-$34,999, $35,000-$64,999, or ≥ $65,000), household income or poverty status (≤ 200% vs &gt; 200% of the 2019 US Department of Health and Human Services poverty guidelines), marital status (married or not married), employment status (working, retired, disabled, or not employed for pay), and health insurance coverage (private, Medicaid, Medicare, dual-enrollment in Medicaid and Medicare, military, or not available).<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref></p>

To allow for 25% loss to follow-up at 6 months, we planned to enroll 1,114 participants.</p>
                <p id="p0095">Sociodemographic, health- and tobacco-related characteristics, and receipt of cessation services were summarized using mean ± SD and No. (%) for continuous and categorical variables, respectively. To account for the nested cluster structure within participants and within facilities, we used generalized estimating equation marginal models in an intention-to-treat analysis as well as sensitivity analyses to predict 7-day tobacco use abstinence. A binomial distribution with logit link was specified with group, time, and the interaction of group by time included as factors while allowing intercept and time to vary by participants within facility with an exchangeable working correlation matrix designation.</p>
                <p id="p0100">Sensitivity analysis assessed robustness to missing responses. Restricted maximum likelihood estimation was used to impute missing responses under a missing-at-random assumption via a data augmentation algorithm combined with Markov chain Monte Carlo method with 500 imputations. The variables group, age, sex, marital status, employment, and time were included. After imputation, generalized estimating equation models were performed as described above in each imputed dataset. Results were pooled to obtain summary estimates.</p>

In a systematic review of randomized controlled trials evaluating tobacco use treatment during LCS, four studies found no significant difference in quit rates among participants in treatment vs usual care arms, whereas one study found a difference among participants who received telephone cessation counseling in the intervention arm.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> Three of these trials had fewer than 100 participants and none were cluster randomized trials. The Smoking Cessation at Lung Examination Collaboration trials, with their dual emphasis on implementation and effectiveness, are intended to close the gap in knowledge about how best to reach patients undergoing LCS with TUT.</p>
              <p id="p0145">Several explanations may apply for the overall significant reduction in tobacco use among study participants, but the lack of differential effect by trial arm. First, intervention radiology facilities were encouraged to adopt strategies that were feasible and sustainable as part of their LCS workflow using existing facility and health system resources. Services were expected to be applied to all patients who use tobacco and undergo LCS, not just those being evaluated as part of the OaSiS trial. No financial or personnel support was provided by the research team. The research team guided the intervention radiology facilities in a strategic planning process to implement cessation support services into the workflow. The research team also provided remote implementation support via performance coaching and audit and feedback to intervention facilities (providing facility staff patient-level data on TUT services that patients reported receiving during the LCS visit). However, it ultimately was the responsibility of the radiology facility staff to choose and implement cessation strategies that were most feasible. Facilities often adopted cessation support services that were minimally disruptive to the LCS workflow and cost neutral, many of which are known to be minimally efficacious (eg, brochures and passive referrals to external cessation support services). Moreover, the most efficacious treatments, including TUT medication and counseling, would not be feasible in imaging facilities without additional or different personnel. Patients undergoing LCS will encounter a CT scan imaging technician or manager who guides them through the LCS process, and that is routinely the only clinical person with whom they interact. Some may have contact with a patient navigator, who can provide brief motivational counseling to support cessation, but rarely has prescribing privileges.</p>
              <p id="p0155">Second, facilities were not excluded from the OaSiS trial if they offered cessation services at baseline. Imaging personnel reported offering some form of cessation support to meet the CMS guidelines for reimbursement at the time the trial was launched. Excluding facilities based on existing offerings would be inconsistent with a trial to implement evidence-based cessation support in real-world settings. Overall, participants in the intervention arm reported receiving a higher number of cessation support services relative to control facilities 14 days after the LCS visit, but the difference was not significant.</p>
              <p id="p0160">A third explanation for the nondifferential treatment effects may be differences in being offered NRT as a part of routine LCS care, which was not measured at baseline. Key informant interviews after the trial was completed elucidated important information about cessation offerings. Three facilities in the control arm showed tobacco use cessation rates ranging from 17% to 21% at 6 months. In two of the three radiology facilities, NRT was offered routinely to patients undergoing LCS as part of routine LCS care. One of the facilities received tobacco Master Settlement Agreement funds and used these funds to purchase NRT, whereas another facility supported all patients undergoing any type of cancer screening with NRT and counseling.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> Although these control facilities did not cross over to the intervention arm of the trial in a traditional sense, they nonetheless were engaged in robust cessation support independent of the OaSiS trial. We did not systematically evaluate cessation support offerings in the radiology facilities of the control arm during the course of the trial, a study limitation. Nor did we differentiate between offering and providing NRT in intervention sites. Importantly, we did not exclude sites based on baseline cessation support offerings. Another important aspect of the OaSiS trial is that NCORP community sites and Cancer Care Delivery Research leaders within these sites had access to the full protocol regardless of trial arm. Implementation strategies and primary and secondary outcomes were known to all sites before study initiation. Participants were not randomized; radiology facilities were. Therefore, facilities were not blind to the study or their trial arm. Although multiple efforts were made to match and randomize clinics appropriately based on LCS volume and patient demographics, pre-existing tobacco cessation practices between the intervention and control clinics may have favored control clinics. We compared NCORP population-level data from the Landscape 2017 survey to determine if any differences in practice characteristics occurred between the sites that participated in the OaSiS trial and nonparticipating sites. The 2017 (NCORP) Landscape Assessment (funding support from National Cancer Institute Grant 2UG1CA189824) provides important information about available services and capacity to engage in cancer care delivery research among the seven research bases and 46 parent NCORPs (accounting for approximately 1,000 discrete oncology practice sites). No significant differences were found in terms of practice characteristics between the different cohorts (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">e-Table 3</xref>), suggesting that the sites were similar at baseline regarding organizational characteristics such as health system ownership and payor mix. However, the Landscape survey measured only three TUT services (eg, group tobacco use cessation and referral to the quit line) (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">e-Table 4</xref>). On these three items, the NCORP sites were no different than the NCORP sites suggesting that practice-level randomization worked.</p>
              <p id="p0165">The absence of masking, a common element of cluster randomized trials, increases the likelihood that control clinics mimic intervention clinics. Known participation in a trial might have created an incentive to engage in cessation support behaviors that otherwise may not have happened. In the future, it would be advantageous to consider matching on baseline cessation offerings, to engage in a high degree of preimplementation planning that allows for tailored and optimized implementation strategies to the radiology facilities context, or both.</p>
              <p id="p0170">Relative to the general population and participants in the NLST, OaSiS trial participants used tobacco more cigarettes per day and were nicotine dependent.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> As observed by Rojewski et al,<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> NLST participants who used tobacco within the first 30 min of waking were significantly less likely to quit compared with those who used tobacco after 60 min (OR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.56-0.78). Seventy-two percent of OaSiS participants fell within the category of people who use tobacco within 30 min of waking up. In the general population, 7.5% of adults who use tobacco successfully quit doing so over the course of 1 year.<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> Among participants in the NLST, abstinence from tobacco use cessation at 6 months was 5.6% among Black participants and 7.2% among White participants undergoing LCS. Thus, a self-reported 13% overall quit rate among OaSiS participants is promising. We performed cotinine validation on one-half of the patient sample and confirmed the overall findings, but we were unable to control for NRT use for most of the respondents and had to rely on mailed saliva kits, which is an additional limitation of the study. Moreover, one-half of study participants did not return saliva kits; however, sensitivity analyses showed that results are robust to missing data. Helping people heavily dependent on using tobacco to quit is critical given that they have higher risk of lung cancer developing with increased mortality rates compared with those who do not use tobacco and lower success in quitting. The LCS setting seems to be a good venue for maximizing reach into this population.</p>

              <title>Interpretation</title>
              <p id="p0175">Important lessons can be learned from the OaSiS trial about the trade-offs of engaging in a cluster randomized trial for tobacco use treatment and support during LCS. Encouraging radiology facilities to adopt locally feasible cessation services for patients undergoing LCS and using existing (rather than extramural, research-funded) resources may lead to the adoption of low-cost, low-yield cessation services for many clinics, as well as a high degree of heterogeneity of cessation support services across radiology facilities. The lack of prescribed, highly efficacious interventions often used in randomized control trials (eg, pharmacotherapy or counseling) decreases the potential impact in the short run, but may have maximized reach and sustainability in the long run. An important next step that optimizes the LCS encounter to promote tobacco use treatment should consider pragmatic trials that allow site-level adaptation of evidence-based cessation support that is tailored to the facility and health system resources. Moreover, a more explicit and deliberative effort is needed to remind clinical partners about trade-offs and health system leaders about the trade-offs in adopting easy-to-implement services (eg, health promotion brochures) vs robust referral processes to high-yield services (eg, pharmacologic support and counseling). Radiology facility staff can be coached on the most efficacious TUT and supported during their implementation.</p>
