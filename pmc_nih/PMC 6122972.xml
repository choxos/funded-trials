                <p>In the setting of a clinical trial evaluating the anti–HIV-1 antibody 3BNC117, Cohen et al. demonstrate that rebound viruses that emerge following interruption of antiretroviral therapy are distinct from circulating latent viruses.

              <abstract>
                <p>A clinical trial was performed to evaluate 3BNC117, a potent anti–HIV-1 antibody, in infected individuals during suppressive antiretroviral therapy and subsequent analytical treatment interruption (ATI). The circulating reservoir was evaluated by quantitative and qualitative viral outgrowth assay (Q<sup>2</sup>VOA) at entry and after 6 mo. There were no significant quantitative changes in the size of the reservoir before ATI, and the composition of circulating reservoir clones varied in a manner that did not correlate with 3BNC117 sensitivity. 3BNC117 binding site amino acid variants found in rebound viruses preexisted in the latent reservoir. However, only 3 of 217 rebound viruses were identical to 868 latent viruses isolated by Q<sup>2</sup>VOA and near full-length sequencing. Instead, 63% of the rebound viruses appeared to be recombinants, even in individuals with 3BNC117-resistant reservoir viruses. In conclusion, viruses emerging during ATI in individuals treated with 3BNC117 are not the dominant species found in the circulating latent reservoir, but frequently appear to represent recombinants of latent viruses.</p>

              <p>Small-molecule antiretroviral drugs are highly effective in suppressing HIV-1 viremia. However, therapy needs to be lifelong because it fails to eliminate a reservoir of latent HIV-1 viruses integrated into the genome of infected cells (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Chun et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Finzi et al., 1997</xref>). Significant efforts are currently focused on therapies, including immunotherapies, to target the reservoir to achieve sustainable antiretroviral therapy (ART)-free remission (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Churchill et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Martin and Siliciano, 2016</xref>).</p>
              <p>The immunotherapeutic agents that are clinically most advanced in this respect are newly discovered broad and potent monoclonal antibodies (broadly neutralizing antibodies [bNAbs]) that recognize the HIV-1 envelope protein expressed on the surface of infected cells and virions (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Halper-Stromberg and Nussenzweig, 2016</xref>). These new antibodies protect against and suppress infection in mice and macaques (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Klein et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Barouch et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Horwitz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">Shingai et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Halper-Stromberg et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Gautam et al., 2016</xref>). In human clinical trials, they suppress viremia and delay viral rebound in the setting of treatment interruption (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Caskey et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Lynch et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Bar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">Scheid et al., 2016</xref>). Most importantly, immunotherapy differs from small-molecule drugs in that antibodies can eliminate circulating virus and infected cells through Fc-mediated effector mechanisms (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Igarashi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Halper-Stromberg et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Horwitz et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, bNAb administration is associated with development of potent antiviral CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell immunity in macaques (<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Nishimura et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
              <p>Infusion of VRC01, an anti–CD4 binding site antibody, in the setting of continued ART did not measurably alter the size of the latent reservoir in six individuals (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Lynch et al., 2015</xref>). However, the sensitivity of circulating reservoir viruses to VRC01 was not determined, and the relationship of latent viruses to plasma viruses that emerge during an analytical treatment interruption (ATI) was not examined.</p>
              <p>Here we evaluate the effects of 3BNC117, a broad and potent anti–CD4 binding site bNAb (<xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">Scheid et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Caskey et al., 2015</xref>), in the setting of continued ART administration and during treatment interruption. We report on the dynamics of resistant and sensitive viruses in the latent HIV reservoir over a 6-mo period before ATI, and the relationship between latent and rebound viruses.</p>

                <p>15 HIV-1–infected participants virologically suppressed on ART were enrolled and underwent ATI (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, Table S1, and Fig. S1). Participants received four intravenous infusions of 3BNC117 at 30 mg/kg at week 0, week 12, week 24, and week 27 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Leukapheresis was performed at week −2 and week 23 to collect peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) for analyses of the latent reservoir. ART was discontinued 2 d after the week 24 infusion. To evaluate the effects of 3BNC117 on viruses with a range of neutralization sensitivities, participants were not screened for 3BNC117 sensitivity before enrollment. All participants had a viral load of less than 50 copies/ml at day 0. The median baseline CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell count was 688 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>, with a range of 391–1,418 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>. Most participants entered the study on a nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based ART regimen. Consistent with prior observations, 10 of the 15 participants (67%) had baseline bulk outgrowth culture viruses with 3BNC117 IC<sub>50</sub> titers &lt;2.0 µg/ml (Table S1; <xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">Scheid et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Cohen et al., 2018</xref>).</p>

                <p>Infusions of 3BNC117 were generally well tolerated. One serious adverse event deemed not related to 3BNC117 occurred in a participant who required hospitalization for a psychotic episode associated with a new diagnosis of bipolar disorder. This participant was subsequently removed from the study before entering the ATI phase. 14 of the 15 participants who completed the study received all four infusions of 3BNC117. One participant received only three infusions because viral load results demonstrating viral rebound were available before the fourth infusion. 29 adverse events were considered at least possibly related to 3BNC117. Among these, three were graded as moderate and one was graded as severe. Complete data on adverse events is provided in Table S2. In many participants, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell counts transiently declined during the ATI period (Table S3). The adverse event profile observed here is similar to what has been reported in prior trials with 3BNC117 (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Caskey et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">Scheid et al., 2016</xref>).

                <p>The quantitative and qualitative viral outgrowth assay (Q<sup>2</sup>VOA) was used to examine the effect of 3BNC117 on the latent reservoir (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Lorenzi et al., 2016</xref>). CD4<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes were collected by leukapheresis at weeks −2 and 23, during which time the participants remained on suppressive ART and received two infusions of 3BNC117 at weeks 0 and 12, maintaining detectable 3BNC117 serum levels for most of the 23-wk period. Q<sup>2</sup>VOA was performed for 10 participants: the first nine to enter the ATI phase of the trial (with the exception of participant 604, whose virus could not be grown in Q<sup>2</sup>VOA) and participant 616. Nine of these participants had samples available from both week −2 and week 23 (participant 609 declined the week 23 leukapheresis).</p>
                <p>The infectious units per million (IUPM) of latently infected CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells among these nine participants at weeks −2 and 23 ranged from 0.33 to 1.9 and 0.47 to 4.0, respectively.

                <title>The latent reservoir is dynamic over a 6-mo period</title>
                <p>To examine the molecular nature of the replication-competent viruses in the latent reservoir, we sequenced <italic>env</italic> from latent viruses isolated by Q<sup>2</sup>VOA at weeks −2 and 23. An average of 1.18 × 10<sup>8</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes were cultured per participant per time point, yielding an average of 40 independent <italic>env</italic> sequences per participant per time point (Table S4). Phylogenetic analysis showed that each participant analyzed was infected with epidemiologically unrelated clade B viruses (Fig. S2). The clonal structure of the latent reservoir differed among the participants analyzed and could be divided into three categories: dominated by a single clone (603, 610, and 616); dominated by multiple clones (601, 602, 605, 611, and 613); or nonclonal (608; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). Overall, 57% of viral sequences in the reservoir were clonal, which is consistent with previous studies (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Lorenzi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Bui et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Hosmane et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
                <p>When comparing the two time points, we observed clonal fluctuations that varied from appearance or disappearance of clones to large alterations in their relative size. For example, a clone from participant 602 comprised 11% of the circulating reservoir at week −2 but 42% of the circulating reservoir at week 23 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). These differences could not be ascribed to variability in the assay, as determined by independently repeating the analysis on samples from five individuals (Fig. S3). Using the Q<sup>2</sup>VOA data and Bayesian inference, we inferred the IUPM of each clone at each time point. In five of the nine participants, there were statistically significant fluctuations within the circulating reservoir, indicating that the observed changes in the composition of the reservoir between the two time points was very unlikely to be the result of finite sampling alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>). However, these fluctuations were not correlated with the sensitivity of the outgrown viruses to 3BNC117, with some resistant clones decreasing in size and some sensitive clones increasing in size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>). We conclude that the size of latent reservoir clones in circulation fluctuates over a 6-mo interval in individuals treated with 3BNC117 while on suppressive ART, and that this effect is independent of bNAb sensitivity.</p>

                <p>To determine whether there was a correlation between the antibody sensitivity of the latent reservoir and time to rebound, we examined the antibody sensitivity of Q<sup>2</sup>VOA-derived viruses. For many participants, latent viruses exhibited a range of sensitivities to 3BNC117 and other bNAbs that target distinct epitopes (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Lorenzi et al., 2016</xref>; Tables S5 and S6). For example, viruses obtained by Q<sup>2</sup>VOA for participant 601 ranged from sensitive (IC<sub>50</sub> = 1.45 µg/ml) to completely resistant to 3BNC117 (IC<sub>50</sub> &gt; 50 µg/ml; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>, blue circles). Participant 616, who demonstrated the longest delay in time to rebound, harbored a reservoir that was both highly sensitive and of restricted neutralization diversity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>). The 3BNC117 IC<sub>50</sub> titer of the most resistant latent virus isolated from each of these participants correlated with time to rebound (P = 0.04, <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.44; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 D</xref>). Overall, individuals with latent viruses that were resistant (IC<sub>50</sub> &gt; 2.0 µg/ml) had an average time to rebound of 3.6 wk, while those with sensitive viruses had an average time to rebound of 9.2 wk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, E and F</xref>). Thus, preexisting resistance within the latent reservoir is predictive of bNAb efficacy.</p>
                <p>To assess the neutralization sensitivity of rebound viruses, single genome analysis (SGA) was performed on plasma, and outgrowth cultures were performed using PBMCs obtained at the time of rebound. For seven participants, outgrown viruses from the time of rebound were identical or highly similar to plasma SGA viruses (Dataset S1). Thus, the viruses isolated from rebounding cells are often similar to those isolated by plasma SGA.</p>
                <p>Neutralization titers were determined for the viruses isolated from PBMC cultures (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Cohen et al., 2018</xref>). Overall, the 3BNC117 IC<sub>50</sub> titers measured on the rebound viruses were similar to those found among the corresponding individual’s latent viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>, red circles). We conclude that the circulating latent viruses isolated by Q<sup>2</sup>VOA are representative of the overall neutralization profile present within the latent reservoir.</p>

Despite the lack of overlap between the rebound and latent viruses noted above, rebound viruses demonstrated nucleotide and corresponding amino acid variants in the 3BNC117 binding site that preexisted in the latent reservoir. These variants were often present at low frequencies in the reservoir and enriched in rebound viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>, red arrows). For example, all rebound sequences from participant 601 contain an isoleucine at position 459, compared with 33% of sequences within the latent reservoir. In participant 609, all rebound sequences at position 371 contain a leucine, which is present in just a small minority of latent reservoir sequences. On the other hand, there were only five cases in which amino acid variants found in the majority of rebound sequences were not detected in the latent reservoir (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>, black arrows). We conclude that while latent and rebound viruses are distinct, 3BNC117 binding site variants present in rebound viruses are frequently preexisting within the observed latent reservoir.</p>

                <p>Despite the fact that 3BNC117 binding site variant amino acids found in rebound sequences were already present within the latent reservoir, identical reservoir and rebound sequences were exceedingly rare. While occasional rebound viruses were very similar to latent viruses, the average Hamming distance between rebound and latent sequences among all participants was 31 nucleotides, excluding insertions and deletions.</p>
                <p>Because Q<sup>2</sup>VOA is limited by its dependence on reactivation of latent viruses in vitro (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Ho et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Bruner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Hosmane et al., 2017</xref>), we also examined latent viruses by a reactivation-independent method. Near full-length HIV genome analysis (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Ho et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Bruner et al., 2016</xref>) was performed on week 23 samples for participants with Q<sup>2</sup>VOA viruses that displayed varying sensitivity, phylogenetic diversity, and clonal structure. Between 9 and 33 near full-length sequences were obtained from each of six participants, for a total of 133 sequences. For participants 603 and 616, whose reservoirs were dominated by a large clone, 85% of near full-length <italic>env</italic> genes were identical to Q<sup>2</sup>VOA-derived viruses. For the other four participants, the identity between near full-length sequences and Q<sup>2</sup>VOA-derived viruses ranged from 8.6% to 47.3% (Table S4). However, we found no instance of identical near full-length HIV sequences and rebound viruses among the five participants for whom rebound SGA sequences were available (Dataset S3). The average Hamming distance between <italic>env</italic> genes from near full-length HIV sequences and rebound viruses was 32 nucleotides, excluding insertions and deletions, which is similar to that for Q<sup>2</sup>VOA-derived sequences. We conclude that intact proviral DNA sequences obtained from circulating CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells overlap with sequences obtained by Q<sup>2</sup>VOA but differ from sequences obtained from rebound plasma SGA.</p>
                <p>To examine the accumulation of mutations during ATI as a potential explanation for the divergence between latent and rebound viruses, we created a mathematical model to simulate this process (Fig. S5).

                <p>To examine the possibility that rebound viruses are related to latent viruses by recombination, we analyzed latent and rebound sequences using the 3SEQ recombination algorithm (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Boni, 2018</xref>). We found statistical evidence of recombination (rejection of the null hypothesis of clonal evolution) among rebound viruses for seven of the nine participants tested (Table S7). In the majority of recombination events, the two “parent” sequences derived from the latent reservoir, and the “child” sequence was a rebound sequence; however, there were instances in which the parents were comprised of either a latent and rebound sequence or two rebound sequences (Table S8). We also found evidence of recombination among latent sequences, as might be expected considering that the reservoir is established during periods of viremia (Table S9). Examples of recombinant rebound viruses are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 B</xref>. Of note, there was only a single instance among the 27 latent parents involved in rebound virus recombination events in which the latent virus was an expanded clone. In this case (participant 613), the rebound virus that derived from this recombination event accounted for only 1 out of the 12 rebound viruses isolated. The other 11 rebound viruses derived from a recombination event between two latent viruses that were “singles” (Dataset S3 and Tables S8 and S10). Taking into account the possibility of recombination, the observed distance between latent and rebound viruses decreases and is often close to the range predicted by the mutation simulation model described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref>, yellow bars). We conclude that in addition to the accumulation of mutations during ATI, recombination may account for the considerable genetic distance between circulating latent and rebound viruses.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>We studied 15 HIV-1–infected individuals who received two doses of monoclonal antibody 3BNC117 over a 23-wk period while on suppressive ART. A third dose was administered 2 d before ART interruption, and a fourth 3 wk after ATI.</p>
              <p>As expected, administration of 3BNC117 did not alter the size of the circulating reservoir in the setting of suppressive ART (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Lynch et al., 2015</xref>). We found that the composition of the circulating latent reservoir varied significantly over the 23-wk period before ATI, and the observed fluctuations were independent of the sensitivity of the latent viruses to 3BNC117. In addition, the neutralization profile obtained from the reservoir by Q<sup>2</sup>VOA is predictive of time to rebound, and rebound virus amino acid variants are frequently preexisting within the latent reservoir. Finally, although the rebounding viruses are typically absent from the circulating latent reservoir, the sequences of rebound viruses frequently correspond to latent virus recombinants.</p>
              <p>Antibody monotherapy in the absence of ART delays viral rebound and selects for antibody-resistant viruses (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Caskey et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; <xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">Scheid et al., 2016</xref>). In a previous study, participants prescreened for 3BNC117 sensitivity by bulk culture who received infusions of 3BNC117 at time 0 and 3 wk demonstrated an average delay in rebound of 6.7 wk (<xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">Scheid et al., 2016</xref>). The same regimen was administered in the setting of the ATI in the current study, but in participants who were not prescreened for sensitivity. Retrospective analysis by Q<sup>2</sup>VOA revealed that resistant participants rebounded after 3.5 wk, which is similar to historical controls. In contrast, rebound was delayed for an average of 9.2 wk in participants whose reservoirs were found to harbor only sensitive viruses. Thus, although the outgrown viruses obtained by Q<sup>2</sup>VOA do not appear in the rebound, their neutralization profile is representative of the clinically relevant latent reservoir.</p>
              <p>The size of the latent reservoir remains relatively constant over time, with a calculated half-life of 3.6 yr (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Finzi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Crooks et al., 2015</xref>). Nevertheless, the reservoir is dynamic, as established by the discovery of clones of T cells bearing replication-competent integrated viruses that expand and contract over a period of years (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Cohn et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib71" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). While bNAbs have been shown to clear infected cells (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Igarashi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Halper-Stromberg et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 2016</xref>), neither 3BNC117 nor VRC01 (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Lynch et al., 2015</xref>) altered the size of the HIV reservoir when administered during suppressive ART, possibly due to the limited expression of viral <italic>env</italic> in this setting. However, there was significant fluctuation in the distribution of circulating clones of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells containing latent viruses over the 6-mo period before ART interruption that was not directly related to 3BNC117 sensitivity. These changes could be due to homeostatic proliferation, stimulation by cognate antigen, or cell death. For example, an influenza-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell clone that harbors a latent virus might expand after vaccination or exposure to the pathogen, and later contract. Alternatively, the observed differences could simply be due to changes in the specific T cell clones that happen to be in circulation at the two time points. Our finding that the distribution of circulating clones of latent cells can change dramatically in a relatively short period of 6 mo indicates that the circulating reservoir is far more dynamic than previously appreciated.</p>
              <p>Viral outgrowth cultures using PBMCs are limited in that they only capture the circulating fraction of the reservoir that can be reactivated in vitro. Nevertheless, even with limited sampling, there was a 48.7% overall overlap between 133 near full-length provirus sequences amplified from DNA and 513 sequences obtained from Q<sup>2</sup>VOA in six participants (Table S4 and Dataset S3). Thus, there is good concordance between the near full-length DNA assay and Q<sup>2</sup>VOA.</p>
              <p>Although we obtained an average of 80 latent HIV-1 sequences for each participant, we found only three instances in which the rebounding virus was identical to a latent virus. However, the neutralization sensitivity of isolated latent viruses correlated with time to rebound, and 3BNC117 binding site nucleotide and amino acid variants found in rebound sequences were frequently preexisting in the latent reservoir. The observations that latent viruses are distinct from rebound viruses, but that latent viruses are phenotypically and genotypically predictive of rebound viruses, appear to be at odds but can be reconciled at least in part if rebound viruses in fact derive from latent viruses as a result of recombination.</p>
              <p>Recombination is a major source of HIV-1 diversity (<xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Robertson et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Burke, 1997</xref>). Recombination occurs when two RNA strands from different viruses coinfect a single cell, or when a virus enters a cell that is transcribing a provirus. Recombinant genomes are generated by reverse transcription template switching. HIV-1 recombination rates have been estimated at ∼1.4 × 10<sup>−5</sup> to 1.38 × 10<sup>−4</sup> events per base per generation (<xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">Shriner et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Neher and Leitner, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Batorsky et al., 2011</xref>). This rate is within range of that of reported HIV mutation rates (<xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Roberts et al., 1988</xref>; <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Ji and Loeb, 1992</xref>; <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Abram et al., 2010</xref>). Recombination has been found to mediate escape from ART (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Kellam and Larder, 1995</xref>; <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Moutouh et al., 1996</xref>), CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">Streeck et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Ritchie et al., 2014</xref>), and autologous neutralizing antibodies (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Chaillon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Moore et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr">Song et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
              <p>By incorporating the possibility of recombination and estimating the number of mutations that might have occurred during the ATI period for each participant, 63% or 137 of 217 rebounding viruses could have derived from the observed latent reservoir. This includes five of nine individuals in which all or nearly all of the rebound viruses could be accounted for by this approach. Thus, in 56% of the individuals studied, latent viruses detected by Q<sup>2</sup>VOA or near full-length genome sequencing appeared to have contributed genetic information to the viruses that emerge at the time of rebound.</p>
              <p>Recombinants were found in 3BNC117-sensitive participants and also in the participant with complete resistance to 3BNC117 (608), and therefore these events do not appear to be dependent on bNAb administration. While expanded clones comprised 57% of all outgrowth sequences, in only a single instance did a parent recombinant sequence come from an expanded latent clone. In all other instances, the parents in the recombination events were viruses that were isolated only once across the two time points.</p>
              <p>The dearth of expanded clones as parents in recombination events might be explained if expanded T cell clones harbor viruses with reduced fitness. Alternatively, there may be differences in reactivation requirements of latent viruses in vivo and in vitro, such that latent viruses in large clones are readily reactivated in vitro but are resistant to reactivation in vivo. The latter would be consistent with the ability of the clones to expand without undergoing apoptosis or pyroptosis, as typically happens during productive infection (<xref rid="bib71" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). Among other possibilities, resistance to reactivation in vivo could be related to provirus integration in a transcriptionally silent site. Differences between in vitro and in vivo reactivation may also partially explain why we did not find any correlation between IUPM values and time to rebound. Other potential explanations for this finding include the limited range of IUPM values observed, and the fact that IUPM values from outgrowth culture are not predictive of the size of the reservoir as determined by the number of intact sequences (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Ho et al., 2013</xref>). Finally, the number of recombination events observed likely represents an underestimate since we only considered recombination events within <italic>env</italic>.</p>
              <p>It has been suggested that recombination may be important for the survival of reactivated latent viruses because latent viruses are simply less fit (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">de Verneuil et al., 2018</xref>) or more sensitive to the host immune responses (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Immonen et al., 2015</xref>). While our findings suggest that recombination does in fact confer a fitness advantage, our data do not allow us to determine when recombination occurred. If the recombinants are preexisting but not detected in circulation before the rebound, it would imply that they are extremely rare in circulation. This remains an important consideration, because although we cultured an average of 2.36 × 10<sup>8</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes per participant, the number of latent cells sampled represents only a small fraction of the total reservoir. Alternatively, rebound viruses may be emerging from a tissue-resident noncirculating cellular compartment such as those described for tissue-resident effector memory T cells in lymphoid or gut tissue (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Mueller and Mackay, 2016</xref>). This might imply that such cells have a unique propensity to reactivate their latent viruses. If, on the other hand, recombination does occur at the time of rebound, it may have significant implications for understanding the emergence of viral rebound and the frequency with which latent viruses are reactivated.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, by examining the effects of antibody therapy on the circulating latent reservoir, we document its dynamic nature and its relationship to viruses that emerge upon interruption of ART in individuals receiving 3BNC117.</p>

All infusions were performed at The Rockefeller University Hospital. Eligible participants were HIV-infected adults on ART aged 18–65 yr with plasma HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 copies/ml for 12 mo before enrollment, &lt;20 copies/ml at the time of screening, and CD4 count &gt;500/µl. Exclusion criteria included hepatitis B or C infection, history of AIDS-defining illness within 1 yr before enrollment, CD4 nadir &lt;200/µl, and significant medical conditions or laboratory abnormalities. Participants on an NNRTI were switched to an integrase inhibitor–based regimen 4 wk before treatment interruption to avoid monotherapy as a result of the prolonged half-life of NNRTIs. Time to viral rebound was compared with a historical cohort of 52 participants who underwent ATI without intervention in trials performed by the AIDS Clinical Trials Group, as previously described (<xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">Scheid et al., 2016</xref>).</p>

                <p>The appropriate volume of 3BNC117 was calculated according to body weight, diluted in sterile normal saline to a total volume of 250 ml, and administered intravenously over 60 min. Study participants received 30 mg/kg of 3BNC117 on weeks 0, 12, 24, and 27 and remained under monitoring at The Rockefeller University Hospital for 4 h after each infusion. Participants returned for frequent follow-up visits for safety assessments, which included physical examination and measurement of clinical laboratory parameters such as hematology, chemistries, urinalysis, and pregnancy tests (for women). Leukapheresis was performed at The Rockefeller University Hospital at week −2 and week 23. ART treatment was interrupted 2 d after the third 3BNC117 infusion (week 24). ART was reinitiated after two consecutive plasma viral load measurements exceeded 200 copies/ml or CD4 counts fell below 350/µl. Plasma HIV-1 RNA levels were monitored weekly during the ATI period, and CD4 counts were measured every other week. Study investigators evaluated and graded adverse events according to the DAIDS AE Grading Table v.2.0 and determined causality. The CTCAE v.4.03 grading scale was used for reporting and grading adverse events related to infusion reactions. Blood samples were collected before and at multiple times after 3BNC117 infusion. Samples were processed within 4 h of collection, and serum and plasma samples were stored at −80°C. PBMCs were isolated by density gradient centrifugation. The absolute number of PBMCs was determined by an automated cell counter (Vi-Cell XR; Beckman Coulter), and cells were cryopreserved in FBS plus 10% DMSO.</p>

Briefly, serum samples were tested using a primary 1:20 dilution with fivefold titration series against HIV-1 Env pseudovirus Q769.d22, which is highly sensitive to neutralization by 3BNC117. Env pseudoviruses were produced using an ART-resistant backbone vector that reduces background inhibitory activity of antiretroviral drugs if present in the serum sample (SG3ΔEnv/K101P.Q148H.Y181C, M.S.

The serum concentration of 3BNC117 for each sample was calculated as follows: serum ID<sub>50</sub> titer (dilution) × 3BNC117 IC<sub>50</sub> titer (μg/ml) = serum concentration of 3BNC117 (μg/ml).

                <title>Simulation of mutation accumulation during rebound</title>
                <p>Rebounding viral sequences were rarely identical to those observed in viral outgrowth assays or by near full-length sequencing. To understand whether the differences between rebound sequences and those in the observed reservoir might be attributed to mutations accumulated during the rebound process, or whether the rebound virus was instead likely to have originated from clones that were not previously observed, we developed a stochastic mutation simulation model.</p>
                <p>The model is based on that of <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Hill et al. (2014)</xref>. We began with a population of 10<sup>6</sup> latently infected cells. Latent viruses can reactivate with rate <italic>A</italic>, in which case the latently infected cell becomes actively infected. The product of these two parameters (the number of latently infected cells and the reactivation rate) gives the approximate number of reactivation events per day. Actively infected cells die with rate <italic>d</italic>, without infecting other cells, or burst with rate <italic>b</italic>. In the latter case, the actively infected cell also dies, but the release of virions results in the active infection of <italic>c</italic> new cells. During each burst event, the number of new infected cells <italic>c</italic> is assumed to follow a Poisson distribution. In principle, latently infected cells could also die or homeostatically expand, but we assumed that such processes typically occur at much slower rates than the fast replication dynamics of actively infected cells. Therefore, they are not expected to contribute substantially to the rebound process, so we did not include these possibilities in our simulation.</p>
                <p>The underlying parameters (reactivation rate, death rate of actively infected cells, etc.) are not perfectly constrained by experiment and may vary between individuals. Following the approach of <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Hill et al. (2014)</xref>, we therefore chose the net growth rate of rebound virus, the ratio of the variance to the mean number of new infected cells during a cell bursting event, and the rate of reactivation of latently infected cells to be random within the bounds of experimental constraints (see <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Hill et al., 2014</xref> for further details). In addition to these parameters, we also allowed the net death rate of actively infected cells to vary, which was not included in the analysis of <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Hill et al. (2014)</xref>. We used the results of <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Markowitz et al. (2003)</xref> to constrain the death rate of infected cells, which was estimated to be ∼1 d<sup>−1</sup> with a standard deviation of 0.3 d<sup>−1</sup>.</p>
                <p>In addition to this simple model tracking the number of latent and actively infected cells, we also considered evolution of the virus at the sequence level. To compare with the data obtained in this study, we assumed a sequence length for <italic>Env</italic> of 2,600 bp. We are specifically interested in the accumulation of de novo mutations during the rebound process. We therefore treated the length 2,600 sequences as binary, where zeros represent nucleotides that are the same as the source sequence from the latent reservoir and ones represent a mutation. This approximation is justified because the number of mutations observed is much smaller than the length of the sequence, and thus the probability of back mutations is very small. We assumed that mutations occur during the reverse transcription process, when new infection events occur after an actively infected cell bursts. The probability of mutation per site per new infection event is 3 × 10<sup>−5</sup> (<xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">Sanjuán et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, we allowed for the possibility of recombination between sequences, with a probability of crossover between strands of 1.4 × 10<sup>−5</sup> per site per new infection event (<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Neher and Leitner, 2010</xref>). This probability also implicitly includes the probability of coinfection of a single host cell.</p>
                <p>For simplicity, we assumed that mutations have no effect on the fitness (or replication rate) of the virus. However, it is known that nonsynonymous mutations are often strongly deleterious, including in HIV (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Loeb et al., 1989</xref>; <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Haddox et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr">Zanini et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Louie et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, our assumption of neutrality likely overestimates the true number of mutations that would be accumulated during the rebound process.</p>
                <p>We simulated this stochastic rebound process until either the number of actively infected cells reaches 3 × 10<sup>5</sup>, corresponding roughly to a threshold of detection for virus in the blood of ∼200 copies ml<sup>−1</sup> (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Hill et al., 2014</xref>), or until the total simulation time reaches 100 d. We repeated these simulations using 10<sup>4</sup> random sets of parameters as described above. Different parameter choices and stochastic effects led to a range of observed rebound times (Fig. S5). At the end of each simulation, we also recorded the distribution of the number of mutations accumulated during the rebound process. As expected, the average number of accumulated mutations in the rebound sequences increased with the rebound time, though there was substantial stochastic variation (Fig. S5).</p>

                <title>Distance, recombination snippet</title>
                <p>To conservatively estimate the true distance (in terms of number of mutations) between rebound sequences and those in the reservoir, we counted each observed variant in rebound sequences as a mutation only if it did not match with any of the nucleotides at that site in the observed reservoir sequences. This prevents us from computing spuriously large mutational distances simply due to recombination between diverse sequences in the reservoir during the rebound process. The estimated rate of recombination in HIV is high, comparable to the mutation rate (<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Neher and Leitner, 2010</xref>), and thus the possibility of recombination cannot be simply neglected. Indeed, tests for signatures of recombination (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Lam et al., 2018</xref>) in the rebound sequences found multiple likely recombination events for all patients in this study except for 603 and 610.</p>
