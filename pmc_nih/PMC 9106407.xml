                <p>Production of affordable coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines in low- and middle-income countries is needed. NDV-HXP-S is an inactivated egg-based Newcastle disease virus (NDV) vaccine expressing the spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Wuhan-Hu-1. The spike protein was stabilized and incorporated into NDV virions by removing the polybasic furin cleavage site, introducing the transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail of the fusion protein of NDV, and introducing six prolines for stabilization in the prefusion state. Vaccine production and clinical development was initiated in Vietnam, Thailand, and Brazil. Here the interim results from the first stage of the randomized, dose-escalation, observer-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1/2 trial conducted at the Hanoi Medical University (Vietnam) are presented. Healthy adults aged 18‚Äì59¬†years, non-pregnant, and with self-reported negative history for SARS-CoV-2 infection were eligible. Participants were randomized to receive one of five treatments by intramuscular injection twice, 28¬†days apart: 1¬†Œºg +/- CpG1018 (a toll-like receptor 9 agonist), 3¬†Œºg alone, 10¬†Œºg alone, or placebo. Participants and personnel assessing outcomes were masked to treatment. The primary outcomes were solicited adverse events (AEs) during 7¬†days and subject-reported AEs during 28¬†days after each vaccination. Investigators further reviewed subject-reported AEs. Secondary outcomes were immunogenicity measures (anti-spike immunoglobulin G [IgG] and pseudotyped virus neutralization). This interim analysis assessed safety 56¬†days after first vaccination (day 57) in treatment-exposed individuals and immunogenicity through 14¬†days after second vaccination (day 43) per protocol. Between March 15 and April 23, 2021, 224 individuals were screened and 120 were enrolled (25 per group for active vaccination and 20 for placebo). All subjects received two doses. The most common solicited AEs among those receiving active vaccine or placebo were all predominantly mild and included injection site pain or tenderness (&lt;58%), fatigue or malaise (&lt;22%), headache (&lt;21%), and myalgia (&lt;14%). No higher proportion of the solicited AEs were observed for any group of active vaccine. The proportion reporting vaccine-related AEs during the 28¬†days after either vaccination ranged from 4% to 8% among vaccine groups and was 5% in controls. No vaccine-related serious adverse event occurred. The immune response in the 10¬†Œºg formulation group was highest, followed by 1¬†Œºg¬†+¬†CpG1018, 3¬†Œºg, and 1¬†Œºg formulations. Fourteen days after the second vaccination, the geometric mean concentrations (GMC) of 50% neutralizing antibody against the homologous Wuhan-Hu-1 pseudovirus ranged from 56.07¬†IU/mL (1¬†Œºg, 95% CI 37.01, 84.94) to 246.19¬†IU/mL (10¬†Œºg, 95% CI 151.97, 398.82), with 84% to 96% of vaccine groups attaining a¬†‚â•¬†4-fold increase over baseline. This was compared to a panel of human convalescent sera (N¬†=¬†29, 72.93 95% CI 33.00‚Äì161.14). Live virus neutralization to the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant of concern was reduced but in line with observations for vaccines currently in use. Since the adjuvant has shown modest benefit, GMC ratio of 2.56 (95% CI, 1.4‚Äì4.6) for 1¬†Œºg +/- CpG1018, a decision was made not to continue studying it with this vaccine. NDV-HXP-S had an acceptable safety profile and potent immunogenicity. The 3¬†Œºg dose was advanced to phase 2 along with a 6¬†Œºg dose. The 10¬†Œºg dose was not selected for evaluation in phase 2 due to potential impact on manufacturing capacity. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04830800.</p>

              <p id="p0005">A considerable imbalance remains in the global distribution of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines, with access in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) considerably lagging behind <xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Control of the COVID-19 pandemic in LMICs, where 75% of the global population resides, will be achieved only when a sustainable supply of affordable vaccines can be secured. The manufacturing capacity for egg-based inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV) is constitutes some of the largest vaccine production capacity in the world. These facilities, some in middle-income countries and operating for less than six months per year, use locally produced embryonated eggs to make more than a billion doses annually of affordable human vaccines <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. To enable these manufacturers to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic by harnessing their experience with IIV and utilizing existing infrastructure, we developed a COVID-19 vaccine for production in eggs, based on a Newcastle disease virus (NDV) expressing the ectodomain of a novel membrane-anchored, prefusion-stabilized severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Wuhan-Hu-1 spike protein construct. This virus (NDV-HXP-S) is purified from allantoic fluid, inactivated by betapropriolactone (BPL), and then formulated <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p>
              <p id="p0010">From September to November 2020, manufacturers in Vietnam, Thailand, and Brazil modified their IIV manufacturing process to optimize production of BPL-inactivated NDV-HXP-S, achieving high yields at pilot scale; the result was three similar processes. Preclinical evaluation of their vaccine candidates, formulated with and without CpG1018 <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, a toll-like receptor 9 (TLR-9) agonist adjuvant (Dynavax Technologies) confirmed that they were highly immunogenic and protective in hamsters <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> with no sign of toxicity in rats at the maximum human doses planned for evaluation (3¬†¬µg spike protein¬†+¬†1¬∑5 mg CpG1018; 10¬†¬µg spike protein) (manuscript in preparation). All three manufacturers initiated clinical development of their vaccine candidates and the interim analysis from Thailand is available <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Herein, we report interim safety and immunogenicity data generated in the phase 1 portion of a phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating the NDV-HXP-S vaccine candidate (COVIVAC) developed by the Vietnam Institute of Vaccines and Medical Biologicals (IVAC). The clinical development program for the NDV-HXP-S vaccine candidate in Vietnam began in March 2021, The Vietnamese government received its first AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccines in February 2021 and then the BBIBP-CorV (Vero Cells) vaccine from Sinopharm in June 2021. These products were authorized for emergency use by the Vietnamese Ministry of Health and administered to health care personnel, older adults, and other high-risk groups. Our aim is to attain authorisation for the NDV-HXP-S vaccine candidate as soon as possible to supply a domestically produced, affordable vaccine for COVID-19 prevention and control.</p>
              <p id="p0015">These results provide additional evidence in humans that the recombinant NDV technology expressing a six-proline prefusion-stabilized spike protein offers a unique platform for affordable manufacturing of a well-tolerated and highly immunogenic COVID-19 vaccine.</p>

                <p id="p0020">The phase 1 portion of a phase 1/2 randomized, observer-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted at Hanoi Medical University (Hanoi, Vietnam). Participants were recruited from individuals known to the university and through advertisements. Healthy adults 18‚Äì59¬†years of age with body mass index 17 to 40¬†kg/m<sup>2</sup>, negative for hepatitis B surface antigen, without known history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, HIV, and hepatitis C, were eligible to participate. A negative urinary pregnancy test was required of women having reproductive capacity prior to administration of each study vaccine dose. Complete eligibility criteria are described in the trial protocol provided in Appendix A. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.

                <p id="p0035">The recombinant NDV-HXP-S vaccine (COVIVAC) was manufactured according to current Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) by IVAC in their Influenza Vaccine Plant (Nha Trang, Vietnam) using locally procured embryonated eggs inoculated with a master virus seed made and extensively tested for adventitious agents by the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (New York, United States). After incubation for 72¬†h at 37¬†¬∞C, eggs were chilled overnight at 4¬†¬∞C, then the allantoic fluids were harvested, clarified, and concentrated. Recombinant virus particles were purified from the concentrated harvest by continuous-flow sucrose-gradient centrifugation, diafiltered against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), inactivated by treatment with 1:4000 BPL for 24¬†h at 4¬†¬∞C, and 0.2-¬µm filter-sterilized. Vaccine potency (i.e., amount of HXP-S antigen per dose) was measured by direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using a human monoclonal antibody (CR3022) <xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> which binds to the receptor binding domain on the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein S1 (LakePharma, Inc.) and an NDV-HXP-S standard that had been calibrated to a purified HXP-S reference <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> by sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) densitometry. Three pilot GMP drug product lots (001-20; 4 ¬µg/mL, 002-20; 12 ¬µg/mL and 003-20; 20 ¬µg/mL), originating from a single drug substance lot (COVID-19/07.20) were used in the clinic. The clinical study product lots were formulated to allow easy preparation on-site of the final investigational product, allowing the administration of 1, 3 and 10 ¬µg/mL per 0.5¬†mL dose.

                <p id="p0040">Blinded staff administered study treatments by intramuscular injection of 0¬∑5 mL on study days 1 and 29. Blood samples were drawn and clinical assessments were done for safety and immunogenicity endpoints before vaccination on days 1 (first dose), 8, 29 (second dose), 36, and 43; a clinical assessment for safety only on day 57 was the last time point considered for this interim analysis of the phase 1 cohort, although there will be additional immunogenicity and safety assessments on study day 197. Subjects were observed in the clinic for 30¬†min after each vaccination and were asked to record any adverse events (AEs) using paper diary cards during the 7¬†days after each vaccination.</p>
                <p id="p0045">Solicited injection site reactions (pain/tenderness, swelling/induration, erythema) and systemic symptoms (headache, fatigue, malaise, myalgia, arthralgia, nausea, vomiting, and fever defined as oral temperature¬†‚â•¬†38¬†¬∞C) were recorded by subjects in a diary card for 7¬†days post vaccination that included intensity, which were then reported by the investigators. These events were not assessed for causality. Subjects also recorded and reported AEs for 28¬†days; the investigator included these in the study database after interviewing the subjects, grading them for intensity and categorizing them as serious or not. The investigators also identified the following AEs of special interest: potential immune-mediated medical conditions and AEs of special interest associated with COVID-19. Intensity of AEs was graded 1‚Äì4 as follows: 1 or mild (minimal interference with daily activities), 2 or moderate (interferes with, but does not prevent, daily activities), 3 or severe (prevents daily activities, intervention required), and 4 or potentially life-threatening (medical intervention required to prevent disability or death). Investigators assessed unsolicited AEs for causality (related to vaccination or not). AEs were graded according to US Department of Health and Human Services severity grading tables (Food and Drug Administration, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research [September 2007] and National Institutes of Health, Division of AIDS [version 2.1, July 2017]). A PSRT regularly reviewed blinded safety data. A Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) monitored unblinded safety data.</p>

                <p id="p0050">Total anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) IgG was measured using a validated indirect ELISA at Nexelis (Laval, Canada). Purified recombinant SARS-CoV-2 pre-fusion spike (Nexelis) at 1¬†¬µg/mL in phosphate buffered saline (PBS, Wisent Bioproducts) was adsorbed to 96 well Nunc Maxisorb microplates (Thermo Fischer Scientific) and blocked with 5% skim milk in PBS, containing 0.05% Tween 20. Serial dilutions of test samples and the assay standard plus controls were added in the plates and incubated for 60¬†min at room temperature (15‚Äì30¬†¬∞C). After washing, horseradish peroxidase (HRP) enzyme-conjugated goat anti-human IgG-Fc (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) was added for 60¬†min at room temperature (15‚Äì30¬†¬∞C), then washed. Bound secondary antibody was reacted with 3,3‚Ä≤,5,5‚Ä≤-tetramethylbenzidine ELISA peroxidase substrate (Bio-Rad Laboratories) and incubated for 30¬†min at room temperature (15‚Äì30¬†¬∞C) before the reaction was stopped with 2¬†N H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. Plates were read at 450¬†nm with a correction at 620¬†nm to assess the level of anti-S IgG bound to the microtiter plate. A reference standard on each plate determined the quantity of anti-S IgG in arbitrary units (AU/mL). Concentrations were transformed to binding antibody units per mL (BAU/mL), based on the World Health Organization (WHO) International Standard for anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> using a conversion factor determined during assay validation (1/7.9815).

Seven two-fold serial dilutions of heat-inactivated serum samples were prepared in 96-well round-bottom transfer plates (Corning). Pseudotyped virus was added to the serum dilutions at a target working dilution (100,000 RLU/well) and incubated at 37¬†¬∞C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 60¬†¬±¬†5¬†min. Serum-virus complexes were then transferred onto 96-well white flat-bottom plates (Corning), previously seeded overnight with Vero E6 cells (Nexelis) and incubated at 37¬†¬∞C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 20¬†¬±¬†2¬†h. Following this incubation, luciferase substrate from ONE GloTM Ex luciferase assay system (Promega) was added to the cells. Plates were then read on a SpectraMax¬Æ i3x plate reader (Molecular Devices) to quantify relative luminescence units (RLU), inversely proportional to the level of neutralizing antibodies present in the serum. The neutralizing titre of a serum sample was calculated as the reciprocal serum dilution corresponding to the 50% neutralization antibody titre (NT50) for that sample; the NT50 titres were transformed to international units per mL (IU/mL), based on the WHO international standard for anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin, using a conversion factor determined during assay validation (1/1.872). The assay‚Äôs cut-off and LLOQ were 5.3¬†IU/mL (10 as NT50) and 5.9¬†IU/mL, respectively.</p>

All safety assessments took place in the treatment-exposed population, according to the treatment received. All group-level percentages were supplemented with two-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs) computed via the Clopper-Pearson method. The analysis of immunogenicity was performed in the per protocol population, which excludes subjects with protocol deviations that would affect the immunogenicity assessment. Immunogenicity data were descriptively analysed. Geometric mean antibody responses were reported by treatment and time point, accompanied by 95% CIs. The analysis of geometric means excluded subjects who were seropositive at baseline (defined by anti-S IgG¬†&gt;¬†LLOQ as measured by ELISA). GMFRs were calculated relative to baseline using the log difference of the paired samples, with corresponding CIs computed via the <italic>t</italic>-distribution, utilizing the antilog transformation to present the ratio. The proportions of subjects with GMFRs of NT<sub>50</sub>¬†‚â•¬†4 and¬†‚â•¬†10 from baseline were summarized with 95% CIs. The analysis of immunogenicity relative to baseline included five subjects who were seropositive at baseline, three of which were in the placebo arm.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="p0115">Current production capacity cannot satisfy the global demand for COVID-19 vaccines and vaccine distribution is inequitable with most vaccines acquired and used by high-income countries while LMICs have limited access <xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Furthermore, vaccines requiring specialized cold supply chain and very low temperature storage, such as mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, may not be well suited for use in many LMICs in the near future. Thus, local production of COVID-19 vaccines in LMICs, compatible with prolonged 2‚Äì8¬†¬∞C storage in LMICs, preferably using existing manufacturing infrastructure and know-how, would increase global availability and reduce dependence of countries producing these vaccines on international vaccine supply. Here we strengthen the evidence <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> that an engineered inactivated NDV-based vaccine (COVIVAC) expressing a 6-proline stabilized SARS-CoV-2 spike protein <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, produced in eggs in an existing influenza virus vaccine production facility at IVAC in Vietnam, shows an acceptable reactogenicity and safety profile in humans and has immunogenicity that suggests its potential clinical benefit. We evaluated a range of vaccine doses (1¬†¬µg, 3¬†¬µg, 10¬†¬µg) having potency quantified as ¬µg of virus envelope-anchored SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Only the low dose (1¬†¬µg) was evaluated in a formulation with and without the TLR-9 agonist CpG1018 as a vaccine adjuvant. The decision to test only the lowest dose with an adjuvant was a result of a mandate by the local health authorities not to exceed 120 subjects in a first-in-human phase 1 clinical study and the need to maintain sufficient group size for the other formulations. Over 28¬†days after each vaccine dose, all formulations were very well tolerated with little solicited reactogenicity aside from mild injection site pain or tenderness. No clinically important treatment-related AE occurred during the 56¬†days of observation following first vaccination with any formulations. Moreover, the vaccine was strongly immunogenic in a formulation and dose-dependent manner, inducing levels of vaccine-homologous anti-S IgG and virus-neutralizing antibodies that exceeded by several fold the levels measured in 14-day convalescent sera from cases of health care workers with mild to moderate COVID-19 illness in 2020.</p>
              <p id="p0120">The adjuvant benefit, as measured by enhanced induction of humoral immunity was low, but the sample size was small and the availability of data from only one dose level with adjuvant limited the precision and breadth of the analysis. The limited benefit of the CpG1018, in the context of this vaccine, was also observed for a higher dose of antigen <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> and is not thought to be antigen-dose dependent.</p>
              <p id="p0125">On the other hand, the vaccine elicited neutralizing antibodies against the Delta variant (B.1.617.2). While neutralizing antibody titres decreased modestly against B.1.617.2, this was expected and in the range observed with sera from recipients of the mRNA vaccines BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 <xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. These data are in line with what was observed in a phase 1/2 study in Thailand with a similar vaccine, manufactured from the same virus seed lot <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Evidence to the neutralization by NDV-HXP-S of the now prevalent Delta (B.1.617.2) variant may indicate clinical benefit. Finally, we have shown a robust correlation between levels of binding IgG antibodies and neutralizing activity, expressed as NT50. Neutralizing activity has been suggested as a surrogate endpoint for clinical efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines. Given that the assessment of binding antibodies by ELISA is more reproducible and affordable than neutralizing assays, this correlation may support using ELISA for future COVID-19 vaccine development (e.g., dose selection or lot-to-lot consistency).</p>
              <p id="p0130">The study has several limitations. The sample size per treatment group was small, limiting precision. Also, assessments were restricted to 43¬†days for immunogenicity and 57¬†days for reactogenicity and safety, narrowing our perspective to acute outcomes only. These are inherent problems of phase 1 trials and interim analyses in a pandemic response setting. Nevertheless, since clinical trials with similar vaccines are underway in Thailand (NCT04764422) and Brazil (NCT04993209), we determined that publication of early data is a priority, with a follow-on publication of the results of the full study. One additional weakness is the absence of Omicron (B.1.1.529) neutralization data, which was not generated for this initial study.</p>
              <p id="p0135">The study had strengths as well. The vaccine construct is a novel platform expressing a second-generation prefusion-stabilized S protein in a membrane-bound trimeric conformation. We hypothesize that these characteristics contribute to the vaccine‚Äôs immunogenicity, even without the CpG1018 adjuvant. The anti-S ELISA and PNA used to assess vaccine-homologous NT50 potency were validated and results are expressed in international units <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> for future comparisons. The induction of anti-S binding and neutralizing antibodies was contrasted with mean levels in human convalescent serum and found to be superior, especially in the mid- and high-dose groups. Furthermore, we have shown with a live neutralization assay that the vaccine candidate elicits neutralizing activity against the Delta variant of concern. The neutralizing capacity of NDV-HXP-S vaccine will be further assessed in the phase 2 stage of this study, using the most relevant variants of concern.</p>
              <p id="p0140">Originally, this study was designed as a phase 1/2 study with two-part selection design with elimination of two candidate groups after the first part (i.e., phase 1). The study was designed to have greater than 90% power to identify the candidate with the highest response as measured by the NT<sub>50</sub> by ranked GMCs, assuming the true GMC is at least 1.5-fold larger than the second highest candidate group and to provide a preliminary safety evaluation of the candidates. After the phase 1 interim analysis, however, proceeding in development with an independent active-controlled phase 2 was deemed more appropriate. Thus, after the interim analysis, one candidate was selected to advance, in addition to a new dose form (6¬†¬µg S), as well as an active comparator (AZD1222, ChAdOx1-S), at which time 375 additional subjects were randomized 1:1:1 to the two candidate groups and the active control, respectively. The decision to select a 6¬†¬µg, was made after observing minimal benefit of the studied adjuvant versus the considerable increase in immune response in an antigen dose-dependent manor. The 6¬†¬µg dose was selected as a middle ground between the desire to increase the immunogenicity of the vaccine while potentially conserving future manufacturing capacity. The 10¬†¬µg dose showed very good safety profile, allowing for the use of the 6¬†¬µg dose without additional animal safety studies. At the time the phase 2 study was in advanced planning, several vaccines, including AZD1222, received emergency use authorization in Vietnam, requiring the selection of an active control in lieu of placebo. AZD1222 was selected under the assumption that this vaccine will be widely used in Vietnam.</p>
              <p id="p0145">In summary, we show that the inactivated NDV-HXP-S vaccine candidate (COVIVAC) has an acceptable safety profile and is highly immunogenic. The technology for this vaccine can be rapidly transferred to and produced at low cost in any facility designed for production of IIV; such facilities are present in a number of LMICs <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. On the basis of these results and acknowledging the need to balance output of vaccine doses from the manufacturing facility with a robust immune response, the phase 2 stage of the ongoing clinical trial uses the 3¬†¬µg unadjuvanted dose together with a 6¬†¬µg dose formulation for further assessment in comparison to AZD1222, which has been authorized for use in Vietnam.</p>
