                <p>Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) release extracellular vesicles (EVs), which shuttle proteins to recipient cells, promoting cellular repair. We hypothesized that cardiovascular risk factors may alter the pattern of proteins packed within MSC‐derived EVs. To test this, we compared the protein cargo of EVs to their parent MSCs in pigs with metabolic syndrome (MetS) and Lean controls. Porcine MSCs were harvested from abdominal fat after 16 weeks of Lean‐ or MetS‐diet (<italic>n</italic> = 5 each), and their EVs isolated. Following liquid chromatography mass spectrometry proteomic analysis, proteins were classified based on cellular component, molecular function, and protein class. Five candidate proteins were validated by Western blot. Clustering analysis was performed to identify primary functional categories of proteins enriched in or excluded from EVs. Proteomics analysis identified 6,690 and 6,790 distinct proteins in Lean‐ and MetS‐EVs, respectively. Differential expression analysis revealed that 146 proteins were upregulated and 273 downregulated in Lean‐EVs versus Lean‐MSCs, whereas 787 proteins were upregulated and 185 downregulated in MetS‐EVs versus MetS‐MSCs. Proteins enriched in both Lean‐ and MetS‐EVs participate in vesicle‐mediated transport and cell‐to‐cell communication. Proteins enriched exclusively in Lean‐EVs modulate pathways related to the MSC reparative capacity, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and activation, as well as transforming growth factor‐β signaling. Contrarily, proteins enriched only in MetS‐EVs are linked to proinflammatory pathways, including acute inflammatory response, leukocyte transendothelial migration, and cytokine production. Coculture with MetS‐EVs increased renal tubular cell inflammation. MetS alters the protein cargo of porcine MSC‐derived EVs, selectively packaging specific proinflammatory signatures that may impair their ability to repair damaged tissues. <sc>stem cells translational medicine</sc>

                <p>This study found that metabolic syndrome (MetS) interferes with the packaging of proteins into porcine mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)‐derived extracellular vesicles (EVs), favoring the inclusion of proinflammatory signatures that may impair the ability of MSCs to repair damaged tissues. These observations mandate caution during administration of autologous MSCs in subjects with MetS, and support development of strategies to improve the efficacy of MSCs and their EVs.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Over the last decade, stem cell therapy has rapidly evolved to become a reality for therapeutic use in patients. There are currently hundreds of registered clinical trials testing the safety and efficacy of stem cells in a myriad of diseases (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicalTrials.gov">clinicalTrials.gov</ext-link>), and the number is expected to increase in the next few years. Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) have been particularly useful, partly because they have potent proangiogenic and immunomodulatory properties, can differentiate into a broad spectrum of cell linages, and can be obtained relatively easily from several tissue sources, including adipose tissue <xref rid="sct312463-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref>.</p>
              <p>One of the primary mechanisms of action of MSCs relies on their ability to release extracellular vesicles (EVs), which include secreted membrane‐enclosed microparticles like exosomes and microvesicles <xref rid="sct312463-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref>. MSC‐derived EVs carry genetic and protein content cargo that instigates a repair program in recipient cells, acting as the intermediary of the MSC paracrine function <xref rid="sct312463-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref>, <xref rid="sct312463-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref>. In line with this, we have previously shown that EVs isolated from porcine adipose tissue‐derived MSCs contain multiple mRNAs, microRNAs, and proteins that participate in several cellular pathways, including angiogenesis, adipogenesis, inflammation, cellular transport, apoptosis, and transforming growth factor (TGF)‐β signaling <xref rid="sct312463-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref>, <xref rid="sct312463-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref>, <xref rid="sct312463-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>.</p>
              <p>In addition to their function as endogenous mediators of intercellular communication, over the past few years experimental studies have uncovered protective roles of exogenously delivered MSC‐derived EVs in multiple conditions, positioning EVs as a safe and effective stem cell‐free alternative therapeutic intervention <xref rid="sct312463-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref>, <xref rid="sct312463-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref>, <xref rid="sct312463-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref>. Hence, clinical trials are currently testing the safety and reparative capacity of autologous MSC‐derived EVs (e.g., NCT02138331). However, many patients undergoing autologous therapy with autologous MSCs or MSC‐derived EVs have coexisting cardiovascular risk factors, including obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia, which may cluster as the metabolic syndrome (MetS). Elucidating the potential impact of MetS on the paracrine function of MSCs may shed light on MSC biology and direct the therapeutic use of their EVs.</p>
              <p>We have recently shown that MetS alters mRNA expression related to insulin signaling in porcine adipose tissue‐derived MSCs <xref rid="sct312463-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref>, and interferes with the microRNA cargo of their EVs, favoring modulation of pathways involved in the development of MetS and its complications <xref rid="sct312463-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref>. Notably, delivery of genetic material to recipient cells may constitute a different mode of regulation compared with protein delivery. However, whether MetS‐induced modulation of protein‐coding genes in MSCs alters the expression of proteins packed within their daughter EVs remains unknown. We hypothesized that MetS alters the protein content of EVs isolated from porcine adipose tissue‐derived MSCs. To test this, we used liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) proteomic analysis to characterize and compare the protein cargo of Lean‐ and MetS‐MSCs to their EVs progeny.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>The current study shows that MetS alters the protein cargo of porcine MSC‐derived EVs. Our analysis demonstrates that proteins enriched in both Lean‐ and MetS‐EVs participate in vesicle‐mediated transport and cell‐to‐cell communication. Proteins enriched exclusively in Lean‐EVs modulate pathways related to the MSC reparative capacity, whereas those enriched only in MetS‐EVs are linked to several proinflammatory pathways. Indeed, tubular cells coincubated with MetS‐EVs showed increased NF‐kB nuclear translocation, reflecting NF‐kB activation. These observations indicate that MetS alters packaging of proteins into porcine MSC‐derived EVs, favoring the inclusion of pro‐inflammatory signatures that may impair the ability of MSCs to repair damaged tissues.</p>
              <p>Endowed with unique self‐renewal and proliferative capacity, and important proangiogenic and immunomodulatory properties, MSCs are currently positioned as the primary stem‐cell option for regenerative therapy <xref rid="sct312463-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref>. In recent years, clinical trials have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of this approach to treat several diseases. Furthermore, preclinical studies have shown that the primary mechanism of action of MSCs is paracrine release of EVs, which transfer genes, proteins, and microRNA to recipient cells, promoting tissue repair <xref rid="sct312463-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref>, <xref rid="sct312463-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref>. However, many patients that might benefit from MSC therapy are exposed to coexisting cardiovascular risk factors, which may potentially alter the protein cargo of EVs. To test this postulation, the current study characterized and compared the protein cargo of EVs harvested from Lean‐ and MetS‐adipose tissue‐derived MSCs.</p>
              <p>Our proteomic analysis identified higher average protein expression in both Lean‐ and MetS‐MSCs than in their respective EVs, consistent with our previous observations <xref rid="sct312463-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref>, <xref rid="sct312463-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>. Although protein expression was higher in MetS‐ compared with Lean‐MSCs, EV protein expression was similar between the groups, suggesting that MetS‐MSCs pack a smaller proportion of proteins into their EVs. Analysis of proteins enriched in Lean‐ and MetS‐EVs relative to their parent MSCs revealed three distinct protein enrichment categories: those enriched in both Lean‐ and MetS‐EVs, exclusively in Lean‐EVs, or only in MetS‐EVs. Interestingly, functional annotation clustering analysis indicates that these protein groups exert disparate functions.</p>
              <p>Proteins enriched both in Lean‐ and MetS‐EVs primarily participate in vesicle‐mediated transport and cell‐to‐cell communication, including modulation of cell secretion, adhesion, and transport, as well as proteins intrinsic to the plasma membrane. We have previously shown that porcine MSC‐derived EVs transport multiple genes and micro‐RNAs that participate in cellular transport <xref rid="sct312463-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref>. The current study extends these observations to demonstrate that proteins enriched both in Lean‐ and MetS‐EVs are also implicated in cellular transport. For example, Lean‐ and MetS‐EVs contain the cell adhesion protein amine oxidase copper‐containing‐3, also known as vascular adhesion protein‐1, which mediates adhesion of lymphocytes to endothelial cells <xref rid="sct312463-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">29</xref>. In addittion, Lean‐ and MetS‐EVs are enriched with several transmembrane transport proteins (e.g., ATPase and H+/K+ exchanging α polypeptide), suggesting that both Lean‐ and MetS‐EVs serve as fundamental vehicles for transfer of genetic and protein content mediating intercellular communication.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, a significant proportion of proteins enriched in Lean‐ and MetS‐EVs contribute to vascular development. This category includes angiopoietin‐like‐4, cysteine‐rich angiogenic inducer‐61, and protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type‐J, a member of the protein tyrosine phosphatase family that acts as an important driver of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)‐dependent angiogenesis <xref rid="sct312463-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">30</xref>. Lean‐ and MetS‐EVs also contain protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor type‐6, a member of the protein tyrosine phosphatase family that functions as an important regulator of angiogenesis through VEGF receptor‐2 signaling pathway <xref rid="sct312463-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">31</xref>. Therefore, despite differences in protein content, our observations suggest that MetS‐MSCs may preserve their proangiogenic capabilities.</p>
              <p>Proteins enriched exclusively in Lean‐EVs modulate pathways related to the MSC reparative capacity, including cell proliferation, differentiation, division, and activation, as well as TGF‐β signaling. Among them are glycoproteins and cyclin‐dependent kinases which function in adhesion, signal transduction and, proliferation of several cell lines, including neurons, erythrocytes, and myeloid cells. For example, the glycoprotein integrin α‐1, highly enriched in Lean‐EVs, heterodimerizes with the β‐1 subunit to form a cell‐surface receptor for collagen and laminin. Likewise, cyclin‐dependent kinase‐2 acts in complex with cyclin‐A2 in the cell cycle to promote cell proliferation <xref rid="sct312463-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">32</xref>. In addition, proteins that modulate the frequency, rate, or extent of cell activation are present in Lean‐EVs, including the type‐II transmembrane glycoprotein CD38. It has been shown that MSCs modulates B‐cell apoptosis by increasing the expression of CD38, associated with activation of signal molecules in MSCs <xref rid="sct312463-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">33</xref>. Therefore, our findings suggest that EVs might mediate the “crosstalk” between MSCs and B‐cells, resulting in activation features for both cell populations.</p>
              <p>Lean‐EVs are also enriched with several proteins that modulate TGF‐β signaling, including TGFBR‐2, TGFBR‐3, and Inhibin β‐A, consistent with our previous finding that EVs contain high levels of genes and protein ligands within the TGF‐β family <xref rid="sct312463-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref>, <xref rid="sct312463-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref>. TGF‐β superfamily has crucial roles in tissue development and differentiation, and modulates proliferation and differentiation of MSCs, acting as autocrine signals to sustain MSC function <xref rid="sct312463-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">34</xref>. TGF‐β signaling also induces regulatory T‐cells and suppresses inflammation <xref rid="sct312463-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">35</xref>. Collectively, these observations suggest that EVs produced by Lean‐MSCs might mitigate cellular injury by modulating multiple reparative pathways. Current evidence suggests that MSC possess potent immunomodulatory properties that are primarily mediated by the release of EVs <xref rid="sct312463-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">36</xref>, which carry anti‐inflammatory elements in the form of genes, proteins, and microRNAs <xref rid="sct312463-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref>, <xref rid="sct312463-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">37</xref>. Furthermore, we have recently shown that knocking down the anti‐inflammatory gene IL‐10 in MSC‐derived EVs blunts their capacity to repair the poststenotic kidney, implying that the salutary effects of EVs are mediated by their anti‐inflammatory cargo <xref rid="sct312463-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref>.</p>
              <p>Contrarily, we found that proteins enriched only in MetS‐EVs are linked to several proinflammatory pathways, including acute inflammatory response, leukocyte transendothelial migration, and cytokine production, including platelet and endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM)‐1, IL‐1α, IL‐6, and several components of the complement system. PECAM‐1 is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily involved in leukocyte migration, and integrin activation, whereas the proinflammatory cytokine IL‐1α is involved in several immune responses, such as inflammatory cell maturation and proliferation. IL‐6 is also implicated in several inflammation‐associated disease states, and its activation is induced by tumor necrosis factor (TNF)‐α <xref rid="sct312463-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">38</xref>. We have previously shown that MetS‐MSCs showed increased senescence compared with Lean‐MSCs, associated with enhanced adipogenic and osteogenic propensity, which were partly mediated by upregulated TNF‐α <xref rid="sct312463-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">28</xref>. Therefore, our observations suggest that MetS may impede the anti‐inflammatory capacity of MSCs and their EVs, blunting their potential to repair damaged tissues.</p>
              <p>We have previously found that nuclear proteins are largely excluded from EV cargo <xref rid="sct312463-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref>. The present study shows that nuclear and nucleolar proteins primarily involved in transcription, RNA binding, and splicing, are also excluded from MetS‐EVs, implying that MetS does not prominently interfere with selective exclusion of proteins from MSC‐derived EVs. Nevertheless, more proteins related to RNA processing, nucleolus, and nuclear transport, were excluded from MetS‐EV compared with Lean‐EV. Future studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the selective exclusion of these proteins into MSC‐derived EVs.</p>
              <p>To determine whether these differences in overall protein cargo between Lean‐ and MetS‐EVs affect their immunomodulatory potential, we compared nuclear and cytoplasmic distribution of NF‐kB in renal tubular epithelial cells untreated or cocultured with Lean‐ or MetS‐EVs. This transcription factor regulates several aspects of innate and adaptive immunity, and its nuclear translocation is a key step for triggering a proinflammatory response <xref rid="sct312463-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">39</xref>. in vitro studies have shown that MSCs obtained from healthy donor bone marrow secrete anti‐inflammatory proteins, which attenuate inflammation by preventing NFkB nuclear translocation <xref rid="sct312463-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">40</xref>. In the current study, we found that similar to untreated cells, NFkB was distributed predominantly in the cytoplasm of tubular cells cocultured with Lean‐EVs. Contrarily, coculture with MetS‐EVs induced NFkB nuclear translocation, reflecting NF‐kB activation. This may in turn induce expression of genes encoding for several pro‐inflammatory cytokines, impairing the immunomodulatory potential of MSCs in subjects with MetS. Indeed, we found that expression of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF‐α, MCP‐1 IL‐6, and IL‐1β was higher in renal tubular cells cocultured with MetS‐EVs compared with cells untreated or cocultured with Lean‐EVs, extending our previous observations <xref rid="sct312463-bib-0041" ref-type="ref">41</xref>. Nevertheless, proliferation capacity of PK1 cells was unaltered following coincubation with either Lean‐ or MetS‐EVs, arguing against major effect of these inflammatory pathways on proliferation of renal tubular cells.</p>
              <p>Our study is limited by a small sample size (<italic>n</italic> = 5 each) and short duration of MetS compared with the human disease. In addition, our model does not allow identifying the impact of each independent component of MetS on the protein cargo of MSC‐derived EVs. Nevertheless, a high‐cholesterol/carbohydrate diet for 16 weeks sufficed to achieve several features of human MetS and alter the protein content of MSC‐derived EVs. Future studies are needed to explore whether these changes compromise the in vivo reparative capacity of MSCs and their daughter EVs.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>We found that MetS modifies the protein cargo of porcine MSC‐derived EVs. Some proteins enriched in both Lean‐ and MetS‐EVs participate in fundamental vesicle‐mediated transport and cell‐to‐cell communication, whereas a number of proteins are selectively enriched exclusively in either Lean‐ or MetS‐EVs and modulate distinct cellular functions. Lean‐EVs proteins modulate pathways related to the MSC reparative capacity, whereas those enriched only in MetS‐EVs are linked to several proinflammatory pathways. Therefore, MetS alters the protein content of porcine MSC‐derived EVs, preferentially packing proinflammatory proteins, which may compromise the reparative capacity of MSCs and their EVs both in the endogenous microenvironment and after autologous transplantation.</p>
