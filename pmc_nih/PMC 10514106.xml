                <title>Abstract</title>
                <p>The tremendous success of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells in children and young adults (CAYAs) with relapsed/refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia is tempered by toxicities such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS). Despite expansive information about CRS, profiling of specific end-organ toxicities secondary to CAR T-cell therapy in CAYAs is limited. This retrospective, single-center study sought to characterize end-organ specific adverse events (AEs) experienced by CAYAs during the first 30 days after CAR T-cell infusion. AEs graded using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events were retrospectively analyzed for 134 patients enrolled in 1 of 3 phase 1 CAR T-cell trials (NCT01593696, NCT02315612, and NCT03448393), targeting CD19 and/or CD22. A total of 133 patients (99.3%) experienced at least 1 grade ≥3 (≥Gr3) AE across 17 organ systems, of which 75 (4.4%) were considered dose- or treatment-limiting toxicities. Excluding cytopenias, 109 patients (81.3%) experienced a median of 3 ≥Gr3 noncytopenia (NC) AEs. The incidence of ≥Gr3 NC AEs was associated with the development and severity of CRS as well as preinfusion disease burden (≥ 25% marrow blasts). Although those with complete remission trended toward experiencing more ≥Gr3 NC AEs than nonresponders (median, 4 vs 3), nonresponders experiencing CRS (n = 17; 37.8%) had the highest degree of NC AEs across all patients (median, 7 vs 4 in responders experiencing CRS). Greater understanding of these toxicities and the ability to predict which patients may experience more toxicities is critical as the array of CAR T-cell therapies expand. This retrospective study was registered at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov" id="intref0020">www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> as NCT03827343.</p>

              <p id="p0020">Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have revolutionized the field of cancer therapy, especially for B-cell malignancies. With the remarkable ability to overcome chemotherapeutic resistance in patients with relapsed refractory (r/r) disease, this potent immunotherapy bestows cytotoxic T cells with major histocompatibility complex–independent recognition of target antigens. Because of the extraordinary early success, a growing number of CAR T-cell products are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, with CD19-targeted tisagenlecleucel available for children and adolescent young adults (CAYAs) and brexucabtagene autoleucel for those aged ≥18 years after the promising outcomes of the ELIANA and ZUMA-3 trials respectively.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> Numerous other CAR T-cell constructs for pediatric patients with hematologic and solid malignancies are currently in clinical trials.</p>
              <p id="p0025">As novel immunotherapeutic agents, CAR T cells can lead to disease eradication in the most challenging of cases but are marred by considerable toxicities.

After categorization of individual ≥Gr3 AEs based on CTCAE and/or clinically relevant categories (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">supplemental Table 2</xref>), the number of ≥Gr3 AEs were analyzed overall and by protocol to determine the fraction of AEs attributed to each organ system, with a focus on NC events (excluding neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia), given a degree of expected cytopenias due to underlying disease and effects of LD chemotherapy. After initial descriptive statistics, the median ≥Gr3 NC AEs were characterized across preinfusion characteristics (eg, disease burden, prior therapies, and demographics) and postinfusion outcome measures (eg, CRS development, CRS severity, and response).

Although the difference in ≥Gr3 NC AEs was minimal between patients with M1 (&lt; 5% disease burden) and those with M2 (5%-25%) marrows (median, 1 vs 2, respectively; <italic>P</italic> = .21), patients with an M3 (&gt;25% disease burden) marrow did develop significantly more NC AEs (median, 5.5; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001). Additionally, in patients with +CR/+CRS, disease burden influenced the median number of ≥Gr3 NC AEs (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001). For patients with CRS without response (–CR/+CRS) (n = 17), because only 2 patients had low-disease burden, assessing the impact of disease on toxicity was limited. Lastly, in those without CRS or response (–CR/–CRS) (n = 28), baseline disease burden did not substantially affect the number of ≥Gr3 NC AEs (<italic>P</italic> = .82). Interestingly, the 2 responding patients without CRS (+CR/–CRS) both had an M1 marrow, and only 1 had a single ≥Gr3 NC AE. Collectively, although disease burden positively correlated with greater ≥Gr3 NC AEs overall and in those with +CR/+CRS, the relationship of disease burden and toxicity in nonresponders warrants further study. The influence of disease burden on ≥Gr3 NC AEs did not extend to the presence of non–central nervous system (CNS) extramedullary disease (EMD) or CNS disease, as neither had a statistical association with development of ≥Gr3 NC AEs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>A,B).<fig id="fig4"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>Incidence of ≥Gr3 NC AEs in patients based on pre-CAR factors.</bold> (A) Dot plot of ≥Gr3 NC AEs in patients based on the presence of EM (extramedullary) disease.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="p0150">With the advent of CAR T-cell therapies, CAYAs with r/r B-ALL are subject to a new set of inflammatory toxicities not previously associated with standard chemotherapy-based treatments. Particularly counterintuitive to chemotherapy-related toxicities, in which AEs are not generally associated with response, experiencing some inflammatory toxicities after CAR T cells is often desired and frequently associates with efficacy. However, with early-phase studies in which efficacy may be unknown and in patients with multiply r/r disease who may be more prone to complications, delineating the full spectrum of toxicities is imperative to understand what patients may experience, especially as novel CAR T-cell constructs are being developed. Although the capture, reporting, and interpretation of AEs are imperfect and newer more subjective tools such as patient reported outcomes (PROs) are rapidly becoming the standard of care, AEs serve as a useful objective measure of the degree of end-organ toxicity and morbidity experienced in clinical trials.<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Accordingly, our study provides a comprehensive characterization of end-organ toxicities experienced by CAYAs with r/r B-ALL in the first 30 days after CAR T-cell therapy.</p>
              <p id="p0155">Among 134 CAYAs with r/r B-ALL receiving a phase 1 CAR T-cell construct, we found that most patients (n = 109; 81.3%) experienced at least 1 ≥Gr3 NC AE, with a median of 3 ≥Gr3 NC AEs across 14 unique categories of toxicity. In comparison with an adult study of 60 patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma treated with CD19 CAR T cells, Wudhikarn et al identified 289 cumulative toxicities ≥Gr3 up to 1 year after infusion experienced by 53 patients (88.3%) patients, which, if equally distributed, would amount to greater than 5 ≥Gr3 AEs per patient, establishing an important foundation to understand the full spectrum of CAR T-cell toxicities.<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> Similarly, in the pediatric setting, a safety analysis of 137 patients receiving tisagenlecleucel in 2 phase 2 trials similarly showed that the majority (77%) experienced at least 1 ≥Gr3 AE, inclusive of cytopenias; whereas a study of a dual specificity CAR with humanized anti-CD19 and anti-CD22 CAR in Europe demonstrated that 60% of children (9 of 15) experienced grade 3 or 4 toxicity by day 30.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="p0160">Understanding how CAR T-cell toxicities compare with standard chemotherapy and/or alternative immunotherapy associated toxicities remains of great interest and an important benchmark for comparison of the toxicities that emerge from novel CAR T-cell trials. Incorporation of AE reporting, primarily based on CTCAE, across all clinical trials helps facilitate intertrial comparisons. For example, in the phase 3 Children’s Oncology Group trial AALL1331 (NCT02101853), which randomly assigned patients with B-ALL to blinatumomab or standard chemotherapy after induction for first relapse, the majority of CAYA patients (&gt;80% receiving blinatumomab and &gt;90% receiving chemotherapy) experienced at least 1 ≥Gr3 AE,<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> suggesting a high incidence of high-grade toxicities with standard regimens. Although individual patient data were not provided, the majority of ≥Gr3 AEs were cytopenias, with high rates of febrile neutropenia (58%), transaminitis (alanine aminotransferase elevated; 41%), mucositis (28%), and sepsis (27%) in the chemotherapy arm.</p>
              <p id="p0165">Although most data regarding CAR T-cell toxicities in CAYA have emerged from experiences with CD19 targeting, recognizing that toxicities may differ across constructs will be particularly critical as the field expands. Accordingly, we identified that the degree of toxicity differed based on the trials analyzed in our study, with higher ≥Gr3 AEs and NC AEs in patients who received CD22 CAR T cells. With both higher incidence of CRS in the CD22 CAR T-cell trial than in the 2 CD19-based trials and the predilection of the CD22 CAR–treated population to have been more heavily pretreated, multiple factors likely contributed to this finding.<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> Patients receiving CD22 CAR T cells also experienced a greater incidence of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocystosis–like toxicities (recently defined as immune effector cell–associated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis–like syndrome),<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> likely accounting for the higher number of hepatic and coagulopathic AEs in this trial.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="p0170">Not surprisingly, patients with CRS experienced more ≥Gr3 AEs than those without CRS; the majority of ≥Gr3 NC AEs occurred after CRS onset, suggesting that toxicities are highly associated with cytokine driven inflammation. However, separating out which end-organ toxicities occur as a direct sequela of CRS vs an independent coexisting pathologic process remains challenging. Because ≥Gr3 AEs also occurred in all 30 patients without CRS, additional factors such as LD chemotherapy and progression of underlying disease may contribute to the toxicity profile.</p>
              <p id="p0175">Aligned with the association of disease burden and CRS severity,<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> we found that leukemia involvement also influenced development of ≥Gr3 AEs, with disease burden as the only consistent predictor of ≥Gr3 NC AEs across all 3 trials, upon multivariable analysis performed using both cumulative and focused data sets. Although CNS disease and EMD did not generally associate with an increase in ≥Gr3 NC AEs, we have shown that site-specific involvement of EMD can be associated directly with CAR T-cell toxicity.<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref> Although the focused multivariable analysis showed some correlation of EMD with toxicity after CD19 CAR, among patients with EMD across trials, the overall degree of CRS was mild (only 3 of 24 had CRS grade ≥3), explaining fewer high-grade NC AEs overall. Thus, individual patient considerations and experiences remain critical, even when not captured as a factor in a larger analysis.</p>
              <p id="p0180">Although the successes of CAR T cells have been widely acknowledged, the experience of nonresponders has been critically limited in CAR T-cell literature. Given the poor overall survival in nonresponders to tisagenlecleucel or alternative CD19 CAR T cells, the degree of toxicities experienced without the benefit of response has yet to be described.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr"><sup>37</sup></xref> Unfortunately, our data indicated that those who developed CRS in the absence of clinical response had the highest degree of ≥Gr3 NC AEs. This finding suggests that early disease assessment in patients with severe CRS may be warranted to evaluate for disease progression as a contributor to toxicity severity.<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr"><sup>38</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr"><sup>39</sup></xref> Notably, the majority (–CR, +CRS) had low grade (1-2) CRS, suggesting that higher toxicity was not driven by CRS alone. Furthermore, when evaluating toxicities in all patients attributable to underlying disease and not CAR T cells, metabolic, febrile neutropenia, hepatic and cardiovascular events comprised the majority of ≥Gr 3 NC AEs identified. This suggests that patients with underlying r/r B-ALL may experience toxicity due to the natural progression of their disease process, independent of CAR T-cell infusion. Moreover, it is important to acknowledge that in these early-phase dose-escalation trials, rates of nonresponse were low because of the remarkable efficacy of CAR T cells in B-cell malignancies; however, such responses may not be assured with alternative CAR T-cell trials for other diseases, highlighting the critical need to capture the experience of nonresponders.</p>
              <p id="p0185">The granularity of this data begins to illustrate the full profile of toxicities that CAYA patients experience after CAR T-cell therapy, regardless of whether they experience CRS or have a clinically meaningful response. Importantly, we show that toxicity profiles may differ across constructs, which may link directly to both incidence of CRS and characteristics of each unique CAR, an important consideration as novel CAR T cells are tested in the clinic. Understanding how CAR-associated toxicities compare with those caused by standard chemotherapy (which has not worked in our patients) is imperative, given the clear association of inflammatory toxicities with response, which is an entirely different approach to chemotherapy-based strategies.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> This is a particularly critical consideration when developing new CAR T-cell trials in which the use of preemptive strategies for toxicity mitigation, which is largely derived from experience with CD19 CAR T cells, may have uncertain implications on the efficacy of novel CAR T-cell constructs.</p>
              <p id="p0190">Because our analysis was limited to those toxicities experienced in the first 30 days after CAR T-cell infusion, this study does not provide insight into protracted findings or late onset toxicities, both of which need to be studied in more detail. Furthermore, as a referral center with variability in documentation of prior patient histories, it was not feasible to analyze prior toxicities in relation to post-CAR toxicities. Additionally, although age showed some correlation in predicting NC AEs upon multivariable analysis, the exclusion of infants and toddlers aged &lt;3 years per the inclusion criteria of our center likely skews this analysis. Future analyses of toxicity based on age as well as cytogenetics are needed. Additionally, although inclusion of recurrent events in the cumulative analysis, which was meant to provide a full picture of ≥Gr3 AEs, might have inflated the degree of toxicity experienced, the focused analysis resulted in the same median number of events per patient, with similar findings upon both univariate and multivariable analyses. Given the limitations of CTCAE reporting (recall bias, chart abstraction errors, and over- and/or under-reporting)<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr"><sup>40</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr"><sup>41</sup></xref> alongside increasing data supporting the incorporation of PRO measures into pediatric oncology trials, the importance of incorporating the patient voice into toxicity assessments cannot be overemphasized.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> Accordingly, our center, along with others, have recently begun to incorporate PROs into novel CAR T-cell trials for CAYAs. Indeed, given the improvements in quality-of-life scores seen across CAYA receiving tisagenlecleucel, these assessments will be critical in further analyzing the risk-benefit ratios of these novel therapies.<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr"><sup>42</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="p0195">Although our data provide a much-needed benchmark for end-organ specific toxicities experienced by CAYAs in phase 1 CAR T-cell trials for B-ALL, a critical next step is to develop a predictive tool to determine which patients may be at highest risk of severe end-organ toxicities after CAR T-cell therapy. Although our initial multivariable analysis of pre-CAR characteristics suggests that high disease burden predicts ≥Gr3 NC toxicities, incorporating additional biologic correlatives (eg, endothelial markers) warrants further study. Recently developed risk-scores in adults receiving CAR T cells (eg, Modified EASIX and CAR-HEMATOTOX) incorporate biomarker-based models and need to be validated in children.<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr"><sup>43</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr"><sup>44</sup></xref> Understanding the impact of baseline comorbidities on outcomes is similarly imperative, particularly given the extensive prior therapy our patients might have received.<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> Considering the limited treatment options for patients seeking CAR T cells and acknowledging that toxicities may be associated with clinical response, it is essential to optimize strategies to reduce CAR T-cell–associated toxicities in patients at high risk to improve overall outcomes in responders and nonresponders alike.</p>
