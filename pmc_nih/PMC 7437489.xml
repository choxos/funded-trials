                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>The Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) reported that intensive blood pressure (BP) treatment reduced cardiovascular disease and mortality compared to standard BP treatment in hypertension patients. The next important question is how to implement more intensive BP treatment in real-world clinical practice. We designed an effectiveness-implementation hybrid trial to simultaneously test the effectiveness of a multifaceted intervention for intensive BP treatment and its feasibility, fidelity, and sustainability in underserved hypertension patients.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Implementation of Multifaceted Patient-Centered Treatment Strategies for Intensive Blood Pressure Control (IMPACTS) is a cluster randomized trial conducted in 36 Federally Qualified Health Center clinics in Louisiana and Mississippi. Federally Qualified Health Center clinics were randomized to either a multifaceted intervention for intensive BP treatment, including protocol-based treatment using the SPRINT intensive BP management algorithm, dissemination of SPRINT findings, BP audit and feedback, home BP monitoring, and health coaching, or enhanced usual care. Difference in mean systolic BP change from baseline to 18 months is the primary clinical effectiveness outcome, and intervention fidelity, measured by treatment intensification and medication adherence, is the primary implementation outcome. The planned sample size of 1,260 participants (36 clinics with 35 participants each) has 90% power to detect a 5.0–mm Hg difference in systolic BP at a .05 significance level and 80% follow-up rate.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>IMPACTS will generate critical data on the effectiveness and implementation of a multifaceted intervention for intensive BP treatment in real-world clinical practice and could directly impact the BP-related disease burden in minority and low-income populations in the United States.</p>

                  <p id="p0075">The IMPACTS study uses a combination of proven-effective strategies to implement the core intervention. In preparation for implementation, we have assessed each FQHC’s readiness for implementing the multifaceted intervention using the organizational readiness for implementing change scale.<xref rid="bb5000" ref-type="bibr"><sup>44</sup></xref> Findings from organizational readiness for implementing change and initial conversations with clinic administrators and staff were used to identify barriers to intervention adoption and tailor implementation strategies. All providers were trained to follow ACC/AHA hypertension clinical guideline for BP management. In addition, providers in the intervention clinics received additional interactive training on the SPRINT intensive BP intervention protocol. Any concerns about the intensive BP target were addressed during the training.</p>
                  <p id="p0080">Implementation strategies include dissemination of the SPRINT study findings, team-based collaborative care, BP audit and feedback, home BP monitoring, and health coaching. We disseminate the SPRINT study findings to provider teams, patients, and administrators in the intervention clinics using interactive in-person and online workshops and printed training materials. Training (initial and ongoing) includes SPRINT study findings and the intensive BP management strategy using SPRINT treatment protocols including medication selection and algorithms. Providers and staff were also trained in proper BP measurement technique. To encourage stepped-care treatment, providers received a laminated pocket card containing the treatment algorithm; in addition, the provider visit form includes recommended treatment information. Further, IMPACTS participants have been flagged in the electronic health record systems at each FQHC to remind staff to follow the intervention with those patients. In clinics with busy schedules, standing spaces are reserved on provider schedules for IMPACTS patients so that they can be seen according to the intervention schedule. All provider and health coaching visits were scheduled by FQHC clinic staff.</p>
                  <p id="p0085">We have worked with each FQHC to develop a feasible and sustainable collaborative care team. Based on availability of in-house nurses and pharmacists, we use a nurse-provider or pharmacist-provider combination. Providers conduct a clinical evaluation of patients, prescribe initial antihypertensive medications based on a treatment protocol, prescribe medication changes based on patients’ responses, and supervise nurses/pharmacists. Nurses/pharmacists function as case managers to coordinate patient care and regularly and systematically review patients’ clinic and home BP. In circumstances where a nurse or pharmacist is not available, study staff have assumed the backup role of health coaching. Teams are encouraged to regularly meet and stay in constant communication regarding patient care. Health coaches or in-house quality improvement staff provide audit and feedback to providers by tracking patients’ BP readings over time and informing providers of those whose BP is not at target. In addition, study staff provide a list of patients whose BP was not controlled at study visits to each FQHC regularly. Mean BP of IMPACTS participants for each provider in their FQHC is also provided for comparison.</p>
                  <p id="p0090">Nurses, pharmacists, or clinic medical assistants provide health coaching to patients including discussion of the SPRINT findings and intensive BP treatment with patients. They emphasize lifestyle modification and medication adherence and suggest strategies for overcoming treatment adverse effects and poor adherence during patients’ clinic visits or by phone. Each intervention clinic patient receives a home BP monitor and instruction on its use from the health coach. Patients are instructed to take at least 6 BP measurements per week (1 in the morning and 1 in the evening on each of 3 days). At each health coaching visit, health coaches measure each participant’s clinic BP and average home BP values over the previous 2 weeks. This information is recorded on a form that is given to the provider for the patient’s appointment along with the treatment algorithm. The provider records any treatment changes or reasons for not adjusting treatment on the form. The health coach then follows up with the patient as needed after the provider visit.</p>
                  <p id="p0095">Implementation strategies have been adapted based on patient characteristics and clinic personnel and practices for each participating FQHC during the adaptation phase. These include adapting the make-up of teams for intervention delivery and dividing up other responsibilities for care coordination and health coaching depending on what clinic staff is available. Furthermore, in most clinics, patients keep track of their home BP monitoring values in a paper log and bring it to their health coaching appointments, but in some clinics with telemonitoring capacity, we have purchased monitors that allow for electronic transmission of BP values. During the COVID-19 state-at-home orders, we have further adapted intervention delivery to allow for telehealth visits with providers and health coaching by phone and video.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p id="p0165">The IMPACTS study is novel in several respects. First, it is the first study to disseminate and implement the SPRINT study findings in real-world clinical practice and to study whether a SPRINT-like BP treatment target can be achieved in predominantly low-income patients with hypertension. Second, the effectiveness-implementation hybrid design blends clinical effectiveness and implementation trials to support more rapid translation into clinical practice. Third, because the study addresses patient-centered issues and is implemented within the resource-limited FQHC setting, the study findings could be readily scaled up to other primary care settings. Fourth, team-based collaborative care includes an increased role for nurses and pharmacists with appropriate supervision from primary care providers. This health care delivery model will increase efficiency and reduce costs, thus improving the likelihood of adoptability and sustainability over time.</p>
              <p id="p0170">The IMPACTS study is very timely and has important public health and clinical implications. It will provide crucial information on developing multifaceted implementation strategies to achieve more intensive BP control in populations with health disparities. If proven effective, the multifaceted intervention strategies can be adopted by other low-resource primary care settings for more intensive BP control, eliminating health disparities and reducing the BP-related disease burden in ethnic minority and low-income populations in the United States and around the world.</p>
