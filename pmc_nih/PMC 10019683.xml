                  <p>Weight loss through lifestyle modification can produce health benefits and may reduce cancer risk. The goal of this study was to examine the feasibility of and adherence to a 15-week telephone-based weight loss intervention in rural Ohio, an area with high rates of obesity.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>This pilot 2-arm randomized controlled study was designed for rural Ohio residents who were overweight or obese. Eligible participants were 2:1 randomly assigned to either a 15-week weight loss intervention group or active control group. The weight loss intervention group received weekly telephone sessions to improve healthy diet and increase physical activity. The active control group received education brochures with information on physical activity and dietary guidelines. Feasibility was defined as at least 80% of participants completing the follow-up surveys, and acceptable adherence was defined as the percentage of participants in the weight loss group who attend ≥75% of weekly telephone sessions.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>A total of 423 individuals entered the online screening survey, 215 (50.8%) completed the survey, and 98 (45.6%) of those were eligible. Forty eligible individuals were enrolled and randomly assigned to the weight loss group (n = 27) or active control group (n = 13). The average age of the weight loss group was 49 (SD = 10) years, and 89% were female. The average age of the active control group was 51 (SD = 9) years, and 92% were female. Feasibility was demonstrated: 90% of participants completed the online follow-up surveys at 15-weeks. Among participants in the weight loss group, 22 out of 27 (81.5%) completed the 15-week intervention, the average number of sessions attended was 9.7 (64.9%). Adherence to the intervention was rated as acceptable among almost half of the group (48.1%).</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Health disparities in rural populations are significant. About 97% of the land mass of the United States (US) is located in rural counties, and 60 million Americans (about 19%) live in these areas [<xref rid="pone.0282719.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Residents in rural areas experience higher rates of obesity, obesity-related comorbidities and mortality, and higher cancer incidence and mortality than residents in urban areas [<xref rid="pone.0282719.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0282719.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Although socioeconomic and environmental disadvantages, including lower incomes, limited resources and availability related to health and health care, transportation barriers, geographic isolation, and lack of awareness, are linked to health disparities, obesity and poor health behaviors are the major modifiable contributors to health disparities in rural populations [<xref rid="pone.0282719.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0282719.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p>
              <p>Obesity is the leading preventable cause of cancer [<xref rid="pone.0282719.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. About 40% of cancer cases and 14–20% of cancer-specific deaths are attributed to overweight and obesity [<xref rid="pone.0282719.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Obesity leads to abnormal and excessive adiposity accumulation, which negatively impacts metabolic and inflammatory processes that promote cell growth, carcinogenesis, and tumor promotion [<xref rid="pone.0282719.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0282719.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Additionally, the dysfunctional adipose tissue promotes tumor progression and metastasis [<xref rid="pone.0282719.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0282719.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Due to these unfavorable physiological modifications, obesity is known to elevate the risk of 13 cancers [<xref rid="pone.0282719.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0282719.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0282719.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p>
              <p>Lifestyle weight management interventions have demonstrated metabolic benefits on insulin, lipid profiles, and improvements in body composition [<xref rid="pone.0282719.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0282719.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. These outcomes are consistent with the hypotheses that weight loss, physical activity, and a healthy diet may potentially attenuate the negative effects of obesity and reduce cancer risk and premature mortality [<xref rid="pone.0282719.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0282719.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Evidence-based lifestyle weight loss interventions have been implemented in clinical settings; however, they have primarily focused on and utilized resources in urban areas [<xref rid="pone.0282719.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0282719.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Replicating intervention strategies from these programs may not be feasible or effective for rural populations [<xref rid="pone.0282719.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0282719.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Indeed, it is likely that extant weight management approaches would need to be significantly redesigned to address the needs of rural-dwelling communities, while also exploring alternative delivery modalities for increasing accessibility and scalability of interventions [<xref rid="pone.0282719.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0282719.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p>
              <p>Moreover, rural residents reliably exhibit lower self-efficacy in managing healthy diet and exercise (i.e., one’s belief in their capability to execute healthy eating/exercise behavior); especially when there are barriers and minimal social support from family and friends to promote a healthy lifestyle [<xref rid="pone.0282719.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0282719.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Self-efficacy and social support are critical theory-based determinants of successful weight loss efforts, given their role in supporting expectations, setting and achieving goals, increasing daily physical activity, establishing healthy dietary habits, and promoting persistence in managing barriers [<xref rid="pone.0282719.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0282719.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. However, theory-driven behavioral interventions integrating tailored strategies to improve self-efficacy for lifestyle change and social support for rural populations are understudied [<xref rid="pone.0282719.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0282719.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0282719.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Furthermore, critical feasibility and implementation variables, such as adherence and behavior change techniques have been infrequently reported. Therefore, this study examined the feasibility of a telephone-based weight loss intervention integrating tailored strategies to improve self-efficacy and increase social support among rural Ohio residents to improve healthy diet and physical activity and maintain a healthy weight.</p>

                <p>This was a single-blind, 2-arm randomized controlled pilot study designed to determine the feasibility of a 15-week telephone-based weight loss in rural populations with overweight/obesity. Briefly, feasibility in this study was defined as ≥80% of the participants completing the online follow-up surveys, and acceptable adherence was defined as the percentage of participants in the weight loss intervention group engaged in ≥75% of the weekly sessions.

                <title>Study population and recruitment</title>
                <p>Participants were recruited through Facebook advertising, flyers, a list of participants from a previous study, family/friends referral, and ResearchMatch or StudySearch. Individuals who were interested in the study were consented and then completed eligibility screening by phone or online survey using the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) web application. Participants meeting the following criteria were eligible for the study: 1) lived in a rural Ohio county (according to the Rural-Urban Continuum Codes); 2) BMI ≥ 25kg/m<sup>2</sup>; 3) 20–64 years old; 4) not currently participating in any weight loss intervention; 5) not meeting the 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans (150 min/week of moderate-intensity exercise or 75 min/week of vigorous exercise); 6) able to walk two city blocks (about 400 steps); and 7) able to speak and read English. Individuals who: 1) had a prior cancer diagnosis (except non-melanoma skin cancer) or severe medical conditions such as unstable cardiovascular disease or digestive disorders that would preclude physical activity and dietary interventions; 2) were pregnant or nursing; and 3) were unable to give informed consent were excluded from the study.</p>
                <p>Eligible participants were grouped by their county of residency locations and scheduled an initial in-person visit at either Pike County YMCA (Waverly, OH), Jackson County Health Department (Jackson, OH), or Hardin County YMCA (Kenton, OH). For individuals who self-reported to have pre-existing health conditions (e.g., heart problems, insulin-dependent diabetes, poorly controlled blood pressure, other severe diseases), medical clearance from their respective physicians was obtained before the initial in-person visit.</p>

                <title>Telephone-based health counseling group</title>
                <p>The 15-week telephone-based, multi-component approach to weight loss intervention was adapted from the Look AHEAD study and Healthy Living and Eating Program [<xref rid="pone.0282719.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0282719.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. We modified the in-person sessions to be delivered as a remotely accessible, telephone-based intervention, thus reducing the burden of travel and tailored the program to the rural population. <xref rid="pone.0282719.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref> includes intervention components and supplementary resources provided to the weight loss intervention group. Participants from the weight loss intervention group received weekly telephone-based health counseling sessions (30–45 minute) led by health coaches with a background in exercise physiology and behavioral weight loss interventions for 15 weeks with the goal of each participant to achieve an approximately 7% weight loss from baseline. The dietary, physical activity, and behavioral support domains were all addressed during each of the counseling sessions. The weekly telephone sessions followed standardized lesson plans, while critically incorporating the necessary flexibility for tailoring and responding to more immediate participant needs. During each session, instructions on and recommendations for independent dietary and physical activity were made, along with instruction on the use of complementary self-regulation strategies.</p>
                <p>The Behavior Change Technique Taxonomy version 1 (BCTTv1) was created to address the need for standardizing behavior change intervention methods and was used to code behavior change techniques (BCTs) [<xref rid="pone.0282719.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Recent advances in linking BCTs with theories of behavior change have allowed for the investigation of possible mechanisms of action (MoAs) [<xref rid="pone.0282719.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Therefore, to facilitate replicability and enhance reporting precision of both study arms, <xref rid="pone.0282719.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref> provides the unique applications, BCTs and proposed MoAs targeted by the weekly telephone health counseling. No BCTs were coded for resources that were provided without additional advice, instruction, or demonstration from health coaches.</p>
                <p>The targeted behavioral modifications for weight loss included 1) a modest restriction in caloric intake (500–1000 kcal/day) that gradually progressed towards a personalized, target daily caloric intake goal (1200–1800 kcal/day); and 2) a concomitant increase in energy expenditure via physical activity (including aerobic exercise and resistance training) (<xref rid="pone.0282719.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). To tailor the intervention to address the specific needs of rural participants, the health coach focused on building healthy behaviors using local resources available to each participant, suggesting behavioral techniques to overcome individual barriers, and encouraging the establishment of a support system with family and friends. Participants in the telephone-based weight loss intervention group received a Fitbit and a weight scale to track their physical activity and body weight, respectively, and were asked to self-monitor dietary intake through MyFitnessPal during the 15-week intervention period. They also received a lifestyle modification manual to guide behavioral changes with weekly goals.</p>

                  <title>Dietary component</title>
                  <p>During the weekly telephone sessions, participants received dietary recommendations tailored to their current weight and weight loss target. The specific dietary objectives were consistent with recommendations from the American Institute of Cancer Research (AICR) [<xref rid="pone.0282719.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The AICR nutrition guidelines were selected to be implemented in the dietary portion of the intervention because they are the most comprehensive, scientifically based cancer prevention guidelines available, and the education materials available from AICR in support of their guidelines are clear, easy-to-follow, and very consumer-friendly.</p>
                  <p>The dietary intervention encouraged reductions in portion size and caloric and fat consumption together with a gradual transition from an animal-based diet to a more plant-rich diet while still incorporating animal foods, including milk and meat, with an emphasis on monitoring food proportion and portion size. Specifically, the dietary component included: 1) reduction in energy intake by 500–1000 kcal per day; 2) reduction in total fats to 25–30%, saturated fats to 7%, and protein to 15% of total calories; 3) increase in fruit and vegetable consumption to 5 servings per day; and 4) intake of 3 or more servings per day of whole grains and a gradual increase to at least 25 grams of dietary fiber per day.</p>
                  <p>The weekly sessions on dietary intake used a motivational interviewing approach [<xref rid="pone.0282719.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. This technique has been extensively used in substance abuse and lifestyle behavioral counseling and has been applied to exercise and diet-related behavior change interventions [<xref rid="pone.0282719.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0282719.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Motivational interviewing has been demonstrated to be an effective method to promote behavior change and enhance weight management in various populations [<xref rid="pone.0282719.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0282719.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Additionally, participants received tailored dietary strategies built upon many of the cognitive-behavioral self-management techniques utilized in the behavioral exercise counseling component, including self-monitoring, building self-efficacy, goal-setting, and anticipating and managing barriers to dietary behavior change. Dietary consultations were provided by a registered dietitian to participants as needed, in addition to the weekly sessions.</p>

                  <title>Physical activity component</title>
                  <p>An evidence-based physical activity plan, consisting of a combination of home-based aerobic and resistance exercises was described through a lifestyle modification manual and promoted during the telephone counseling sessions. The study goals for physical activity were to achieve 150–200 min/week of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity and 2–3 sessions/week of resistance training, according to physical activity guidelines [<xref rid="pone.0282719.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The aerobic physical activity recommendation consisted of gradually progressing from 10–30 minutes of exercise on most, if not all days of the week, with a primary focus placed upon brisk walking as the primary accessible mode of aerobic exercise for each participant. However, participants were encouraged to engage in their preferred choice of exercise mode that they were able and willing to perform, including brisk walking, running, or cycling. The home-based progressive resistance exercise involved performing 1–3 sets of 8RM-12RM repetitions of various exercises (e.g., sit-to-stand, standing leg curl, seated leg extension, chest press, lateral raise, bent-over row, straight-arm pulldown, arm curl, triceps pushdown, and chair abdominal curls) using body weight and resistance bands. All exercise prescriptions were appropriately modified for safe and effective home-based exercise. For example, for participants who were not familiar with aerobic or resistance exercises, the health coach prescribed a relatively low dose and intensity of exercise in the first few weeks, with the intention to allow participants to gain confidence in exercising, promote gradual integrating of exercise into their schedule, and encourage them to set practical and achievable intermediate exercise goals that would not be overwhelming. For participants who had certain health conditions (e.g., knee osteoarthritis, back pain), the health coach would modify the resistance exercises to accommodate participants’ needs.</p>
                  <p>During the telephone counseling in the first two weeks, health coaches went through the exercises described in the lifestyle modification manual with each participant, and if needed, modifications of the exercises were provided. Online <italic toggle="yes">YouTube</italic> videos were available to participants demonstrating safe and effective techniques for each of the prescribed exercises, providing examples for alternative exercise options, and providing tips for proper exercise form. These videos have been successfully implemented to facilitate home-based exercise in prior lifestyle interventions [<xref rid="pone.0282719.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In order to maintain a safe and gradual progression in exercise stimulus, each week, participants were encouraged to increase their exercise frequency, duration, and/or intensity until successfully attaining the target physical activity volume goal.</p>

                  <title>Behavioral component</title>
                  <p>The behavioral support portion of each telephone counseling session centered on promoting self-management strategies tailored to rural populations using theory-informed and contemporary principles of the cultural-tailoring approach [<xref rid="pone.0282719.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], focused on motivation, relapse prevention, emotional distress, time management, and overcoming barriers. Each session included a review of the previous week’s activity, planned weekly lessons, dietary and exercise goals for the subsequent week, and strategies tailored to each participant to improve self-efficacy, social support, and barrier management. Additionally, group-mediated activity through group messages, following the weekly telephone counseling, was integrated with the behavioral component to promote independent adherence to lifestyle modification. The group messaging was supervised by the health coaches and primarily used as a means of communication between participants. This ancillary supportive approach was used to facilitate group-mediated barrier problem solving and as a means for participants to share successes and challenges and provide encouraging feedback to their peers.</p>
                  <p>The objective of the behavioral component was to promote motivation, self-efficacy and social support for adopting lifestyle modifications, while gradually facilitating participants’ transition towards successful independent self-regulation of a healthy diet and physical activity. The behavioral component focused on the acquisition and practice of self-regulatory skills, in conjunction with a continuous problem-solving model of behavior change, to empower participants to exert greater control over their behavior, cognition, and environment. The behavioral component was designed to a) increase health knowledge of the benefits of physical activity and dietary modifications; b) enhance self-efficacy and positive outcome expectancies through the promotion of a series of successful experiences in changing exercise and eating behavior; and c) improve self-regulation of exercise and eating behaviors through the use of goal-setting, self-monitoring, stimulus control, cognitive restructuring, and barrier problem-solving strategies. The efficacy of this approach for promoting the adoption and maintenance to exercise and dietary behavior change has been demonstrated in prior randomized controlled trials [<xref rid="pone.0282719.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0282719.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p>

At the initial in-person visit, participants who were randomized to the active control group received education brochures describing the AICR physical activity and dietary guidelines. Participants were asked to meet the 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans (150 min/week of moderate-intensity exercise or 75 min/week of vigorous exercise), increase fruit and vegetable intake, reduce fat intake, reduce sugary drinks, increase consumption of whole grains, and increase water intake. An exercise manual with access to online <italic toggle="yes">YouTube</italic> videos was available with examples of proper exercise forms for strength training. Participants were provided with self-monitoring resources for body weight, dietary intake, and physical activity through MyFitnessPal or a paper log. To increase retention and provide motivation and strategies for behavioral change in the active control group, participants received a Fitbit and the lifestyle modification manual at the end of the study.</p>

                  <p>Body weight (kg) and height (cm) were assessed by research staff using a digital scale and scale-mounted stadiometer to calculate BMI (kg/m<sup>2</sup>). Body composition, including fat mass (kg), percent fat, lean mass (kg), and percent lean mass were measured using a three-dimension (3D) body scanner, Styku S100 (Styku L.L.C., Los Angeles, CA). The Styku S100 scanner uses an infrared camera built into a tower and a rotating platform to capture body circumference and volumes. Participants stood on the platform with their arms positioned in the A-pose, and then the platform rotated clockwise. The Styku S100 scanner uses Microsoft Kinect Fusion software to recognize body landmarks and calculate and visualize various body measurements [<xref rid="pone.0282719.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The Styku S100 scanner is portable to use in rural community-setting and produces reliable measures of body composition compared with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry [<xref rid="pone.0282719.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p>

All individuals were recruited from Facebook (n = 384), flyers (n = 9), postcards to participants from a previous study (n = 23), family/friends (n = 3), and ResearchMatch or StudySearch (n = 4). Among them, 215 (50.8%) individuals completed the eligibility survey, 111 were ineligible, five refused to participate, and one individual provided an incorrect contact number (<xref rid="pone.0282719.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). Among the 98 (23.2%) individuals who met eligibility criteria, 24 individuals were unable to be contacted (average contact attempt = 5), three were not interested at this time, and 11 were not contacted as the study accrual was met. Among those who were eligible, 60 (61.2%) individuals were scheduled for in-person consent and baseline assessment. However, we had 19 (31.7%) no show at the scheduled baseline visit (n = 5 sick/medical reason; n = 3 COVID or COVID-related; n = 1 family emergency; n = 2 vehicle issues; n = 2 no time; n = 6 unable to contact). Among the 41 participants who consented, one was not eligible after weight assessment and was excluded from the study. A total of 40 participants enrolled in the study, 27 (67.5%) were randomized to the weight loss intervention, and 13 (32.5%) were randomized to the active control group.</p>

              <p>In terms of feasibility, 35 out of 40 participants (88%, 95% CI = 0.78–0.98) completed the follow-up online surveys at Week 15. Among participants in the weight loss group, 22 out of 27 (82%) completed the 15-week intervention, and the average number of sessions attended was 10 (67%). Specifically, 5 participants attended the full 15 sessions, 8 attended 12–14 sessions, 5 attended 8–11 sessions, and 9 attended less than 8 sessions. Among the 14 participants who attended less than 12 weekly sessions, the common reasons for missed sessions included increased caregiver responsibility due to COVID, being too busy, work conflict (due to COVID), and illness. Adherence to the weight loss intervention was 48% (13 out of 27 participants attended at least 12 sessions). Among participants who dropped out of the weight loss intervention (n = 5, 19%), three were due to a COVID-19-related workload increase, one was due to a family loss, and one preferred a non-telephone-based approach. Among the 13 participants in the active control group, 2 (15%) were lost to follow-up.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Our results indicate that it was feasible to conduct a 15-week randomized controlled weight loss study among rural residents who were overweight/obese. We also found that it was feasible for rural residents to participate in a 15-week telephone-based weight loss intervention. Although efforts were taken to retain participants (e.g., in-person assessment at a community center close to participants, gift card incentives, and offering the active control group the same lifestyle manual and Fitbit as the weight loss group at the end of the study), we observed some dropouts in both groups. However, the dropout rate of our study was less than 20%, indicating that this study design is feasible for this population [<xref rid="pone.0282719.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>].</p>
              <p>Rural residents, who experience disparities in obesity and cancer incidence and mortality, are a vulnerable population that can benefit from weight loss interventions. Most weight loss programs have focused on health-promoting resources available in urban areas [<xref rid="pone.0282719.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0282719.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0282719.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Our study integrated a multi-component, evidence-based lifestyle behavioral change intervention, delivered by experienced health coaches, through telephone-based cognitive-behavioral counseling. By tailoring the intervention strategies to the rural-dwelling population, we were able to provide a remotely accessible telephone-based weight loss program for rural residents to address their unique needs [<xref rid="pone.0282719.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0282719.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0282719.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0282719.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Among recently completed weight loss interventions that targeted rural populations, few reported feasibility (83%) and acceptability (77–90%) [<xref rid="pone.0282719.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0282719.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Furthermore, their study populations and intervention delivery approaches were different from our study. One study targeted older adults (&gt;65 years old) and utilized video conferencing for weight loss counseling [<xref rid="pone.0282719.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Another pilot study recruited participants from a Weight and Wellness Center [<xref rid="pone.0282719.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Participants from those studies may have a more flexible schedule that allows them to attend assigned sessions. They may also prioritize losing weight more than our population. In our study, participants had an average age of 50 years, with most still retaining daytime jobs. Although efforts were made to extend the flexibility of weekly telephone sessions and improve the communication between the health coach and each participant, the adherence of the telephone-based intervention was only 48.1%.</p>
              <p>The disruption in daily life during the pandemic may have contributed to the low adherence to the weight loss intervention. Since the pandemic started, loss of daily routine, lack of access to groceries, stockpiling with highly processed foods, irregular eating due to stress, and financial burden related to unemployment from COVID-19 had negative impacts on health behaviors [<xref rid="pone.0282719.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0282719.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Increased anxiety and depression due to COVID, decreased physical activity, reduced fruit and vegetable intake, increased alcohol consumption, and increased tobacco intake have all been reported since the pandemic started [<xref rid="pone.0282719.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0282719.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. During the study period, we noticed these negative impacts on each participant, and we understood that the priorities for our participants might shift to other aspects. Our health coaches provided strategies, including practicing mindfulness and offering resources for relaxation and guided meditation, to overcome COVID-related challenges. Future interventions should consider incorporating structured mindfulness practices to improve resilience and mental health for this population.</p>
              <p>Due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we encountered some challenges in recruitment and retention, in addition to delays in receiving equipment and supplies. As we were unable to attend community events, our recruitment solely depended on Facebook advertising, flyers, and mailed postcards to participants from a previous study. Among individuals who met the eligibility criteria and were interested in the study, there was a two-week waiting period before the scheduled baseline in-person sessions. The two-week period allowed us to obtain medical clearance for those with medical conditions, however, it resulted in a high no-show rate of 31.7%. Common reasons for no-shows included sick/medical-issue, COVID or COVID-related issues, or family emergencies, all of which were reasonable due to the unprecedented pandemic disruption. Future studies may consider kick-off sessions to engage and motivate individuals, improve connections with potential participants and the community centers, and reduce the no-show rate.</p>
              <p>This study has several limitations. It was a relatively small, homogenous sample of 40 participants who were all White and mostly women, in rural Ohio. Our findings may not generalize to more diverse populations in different geographic areas. Additionally, we found individuals who enrolled in our study had a lower BMI compared to individuals who were interested but not enrolled. Therefore, our study sample may not represent the general populations in rural areas. Moreover, some participants experienced cellphone reception issues that impeded them from receiving phone calls or group messages. With the new federal infrastructure investment in the next few years, especially the improvement of internet services, future studies may consider utilizing video-conferencing or other telehealth approaches to deliver remotely accessible weight loss programs for this population.</p>
              <p>Our study has several strengths. First, to tailor the weight loss intervention to rural populations, the weekly sessions specifically focused on optimizing accessible resources, improving self-efficacy, and promoting social support to help rural populations overcome barriers, with the goal of increasing physical activity, improving healthy diet, and maintaining a healthy weight. Most of the participants lived in rural areas inundated by quick-service restaurants. Consequently, health coaches routinely provided strategic guidance to help participants successfully manage their dietary behavior and environment. For example, one participant reported that she had to frequently resort to fast-food restaurants, simply because there was no other option. As a substitution for the typical high-calorically dense meal choices, the coach suggested ordering a side salad and a 4-piece chicken nugget (about 500 kcal total) when necessary and combining this with the mindful eating and planning skills developed through the counseling sessions.</p>
              <p>The importance of identifying the ‘active ingredients’ within behavior change interventions, is critical to advancing their dissemination and implementation. BCTs are the “observable, replicable, and irreducible components of interventions designed to alter or redirect causal processes that regulate behavior” [<xref rid="pone.0282719.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In the weight loss intervention group, approximately, 33 of the 93 BCTs were used in the multi-component weekly sessions to promote adherence to dietary and physical activity recommendations and encourage active self-regulation (<xref rid="pone.0282719.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>). These sessions were delivered by trained health coaches experienced in lifestyle behavior change processes who possessed the capacity to adapt the intervention to participant need. BCTs provided as part of the weekly telephone counseling sessions represented 14 of the 16 BCT clusters from the BCTTv1 [<xref rid="pone.0282719.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p>
              <p>Additionally, our study included an in-house registered dietitian available to provide valuable guidance for the weight loss intervention group upon request on an as-needed basis. We noticed that many participants were not familiar with macronutrients. Besides individual nutrition counseling, the dietitian offered supplementary educational and visual aids to illustrate the macronutrient content of commonly consumed foods and to facilitate improvement in dietary decision-making. This was crucial for the rural population to improve their awareness, self-efficacy, and planning for healthy diet. We also provided the active control group with AICR physical activity and dietary guidelines, as well as the exercise manual and online exercise videos (<xref rid="pone.0282719.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). Some of the individuals from the active control group were inspired by these materials and made behavioral changes, which showed the potential benefits of the dissemination of behavioral guidelines to rural populations.</p>
              <p>Lastly, we were, to date, the first study to use a novel, portable 3D body scanner, Styku S100 (Styku LLC, Los Angeles, CA), to assess body composition, including fat mass and fat percentage, in rural community settings. Measures of body composition, especially body fat, are relevant to assessing cancer risk, as adiposity deposition is associated with inflammation and carcinogenesis [<xref rid="pone.0282719.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0282719.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Among the handful of completed or recently awarded lifestyle weight loss trials in rural populations, none measured body composition [<xref rid="pone.0282719.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0282719.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. This might be due to the access burden of standard body composition measurement tools (e.g., DXA) in rural community settings. We also used a finger stick to measure lipid profile, which provided the results to each participant on site. This might be a potential point-of-care approach to assess disease risk factors in rural populations for future studies.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, our pilot study provided important data and valuable experiences in conducting a telephone-based weight loss intervention among rural populations with overweight/obesity. In our study, a 15-week study to promote physical activity, healthy eating, we demonstrated that conducting a study to promote a healthy diet is feasible among rural Ohio residents. We also demonstrated that it was feasible for rural adults with overweight/obesity to participate in a 15-week telephone-based weight loss intervention. Further studies should refine strategies to improve the uptake of the weight loss intervention, as well as evaluate the effect size of the telephone-based intervention to serve as preliminary data for a large-scale, randomized controlled trial to quantify the therapeutic effect of weight loss interventions and cancer risk in rural populations.</p>

              <p>Dear Dr. Zhang,</p>
              <p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE’s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.</p>
              <p>Please submit your revised manuscript by Dec 19 2022 11:59PM. If you will need more time than this to complete your revisions, please reply to this message or contact the journal office at <email>plosone@plos.org</email>. When you're ready to submit your revision, log on to <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/</ext-link> and select the 'Submissions Needing Revision' folder to locate your manuscript file.</p>
              <p>Please include the following items when submitting your revised manuscript:<!-- </div> --><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>A rebuttal letter that responds to each point raised by the academic editor and reviewer(s). You should upload this letter as a separate file labeled 'Response to Reviewers'.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A marked-up copy of your manuscript that highlights changes made to the original version. You should upload this as a separate file labeled 'Revised Manuscript with Track Changes'.</p></list-item><list-item><p>An unmarked version of your revised paper without tracked changes. You should upload this as a separate file labeled 'Manuscript'.</p></list-item></list></p>
              <p>If you would like to make changes to your financial disclosure, please include your updated statement in your cover letter. Guidelines for resubmitting your figure files are available below the reviewer comments at the end of this letter.</p>
              <p>If applicable, we recommend that you deposit your laboratory protocols in protocols.io to enhance the reproducibility of your results. Protocols.io assigns your protocol its own identifier (DOI) so that it can be cited independently in the future. For instructions see: <ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-laboratory-protocols" ext-link-type="uri">https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-laboratory-protocols</ext-link>. Additionally, PLOS ONE offers an option for publishing peer-reviewed Lab Protocol articles, which describe protocols hosted on protocols.io. Read more information on sharing protocols at <ext-link xlink:href="https://plos.org/protocols?utm_medium=editorial-email&amp;utm_source=authorletters&amp;utm_campaign=protocols" ext-link-type="uri">https://plos.org/protocols?utm_medium=editorial-email&amp;utm_source=authorletters&amp;utm_campaign=protocols</ext-link>.</p>
              <p>We look forward to receiving your revised manuscript.</p>
              <p>Kind regards,</p>

              <p>Reviewer #1: This is an interesting feasibility study looking at provision of weight management support in a rural setting. A key strength of the study is the objective assessment of weight change and physiological outcomes. However, in my opinion there are two weaknesses to the study, which both look to be resolvable: Firstly this is in how the study is described. For reasons articulated in my more detailed comments, I don’t believe this is an acceptability study, or at least the outcomes reported and relied on here do not relate to frameworks of acceptability. So this would need to be acknowledged and adapted. Secondly, the behavioural support is not described to the level currently required - a clearer articulation of the specific behaviour change techniques that have been implemented is needed, mapping these to the intended mediators of behaviour change (e.g., self-efficacy). It looks like a large number of these have been provided - including some in the control group - but unless they are more systematically set out it is hard to work out what the logic model/mechanism of action is for the study, which can then be measured against when it comes to trial.</p>
              <p>Abstract:</p>
              <p>- I would reframe the 1st sentence - this is contingent on interventions working in the long term which has yet to be established. It’s more accurate to say that weight loss itself does confer the benefits refer to.</p>
              <p>- The Method and Results sections were somewhat confusing; the methods talk about 40 people, but the results refer to 423 - what was the sample pool? The Methods should contain a clear account of how you intend to measure feasibility and acceptability (how, and what criteria would constitute a decision either way), and then in the Results report whether these were met.</p>
              <p>Method</p>
              <p>- Study design; please provide the rationale and justification of the criteria set for feasibility and acceptability. The measure of acceptability in particular is unusual so needs some supporting - for example see the Theoretical framework of Acceptability (Sekhon et al., 2017). This sets out a systematically developed multi-dimensional framework, but it does not include the measure you had (i.e., attendance). To me it therefore comes across that both of the outcomes you report are feasibility, and you haven’t reported a measure of acceptability in this paper.</p>
              <p>- P7, sentence that starts “The weight loss was achieved……” - take care not to infer things that you could not control. This was the intention, you can’t claim that this was actually how the weight loss was achieved until you have tested this (i.e., ppts could just reduce calories and not increase PA and still achieve weight loss, etc).</p>
              <p>- P7: you refer to providing behavioural techniques. These need to be fully described, I am guessing both in relation to what the telephone counsellor did, and what was provided through the manual. Some elements are referred to later - but it’s hard to follow when definitions, clarifications or signposting to where this is covered in more detail are not provided when first introduced. The full detail then appears in P10. While there is lots of detail here, and it looks like you have linked strategies and techniques to your intended outcomes, it is not presented in a way that is easy to reference for the reader. I would consider finding a way to list/map the intended mediators you want to influence (e.g., self-efficacy) to evidence-based or theoretically informed techniques you have chosen to tackle them. Moving away from description to mapping this more clearly would also help when it comes to assessing mechanisms of action (i.e., whether elements were sufficient to bring about hypothesised changes). Similarly, while you describe familiar approaches to behavioural support, you have not specified the behaviour change techniques used - which is now expected practice for any published intervention. This could be done using the Michie et al Taxonomy of Behaviour Change techniques, which is well developed and implemented in research and practice (a recent review is referred to below for reference).</p>
              <p>- P8 - motivational interviewing is introduced as a technique, but the most recent evidence in relation to its efficacy for weight loss is not referenced.</p>
              <p>- P9 - you state that “exercise prescriptions were appropriately modified….” (P9).What did this mean? This issue (i.e., stating something before defining it) was evidence throughout and made it quite hard to follow - for example, this was also the case for describing how</p>
              <p>- P11 - given recent discussion about the importance of specifying what is in a control group, you could also use the behaviour change taxonomy to indicate what is in the control group (i.e., there seems to be quite a lot they are also receiving). This may help to make it clearer what differs between the two groups.</p>
              <p>-</p>
              <p>Results</p>
              <p>- It would be useful to make some comment on the reasons for ineligibility (which appear in the figure, but aren’t referred to in the text). For e.g., it would be useful to know this for others aiming to recruit this way, in terms of whether the reasons would have been known to potential participants (e.g., different advertising might make a difference) or if the reasons were unknown to those applying.</p>
              <p>- I was surprised to see data reported for participants who had not consented to be part of the study (i.e., Table 1).</p>
              <p>- The text in the main paragraph of P16 (describing Table 2) is largely repeating the table - only a brief sentence of two is needed to flag the key points to the reader.</p>
              <p>Discussion</p>
              <p>- P20 - when you refer to strengths, the first paragraph of this did not seem to be supported by any external evidence or what is reported for your study. A lot of claims are made in the first sentence alone - for example you state that you established social support - but this is not something you have assessed. The reference to participant feedback would be fine if this had been systematically collected and reported, but this comes across as a single anecdote.</p>
              <p>- Paragraph 2 on P20 is similarly based on feedback from participants that you have not reported - so again, does not provide a convincing case. If you have this qualitative data, then it should be presented as part of the Results before you can refer to it.</p>
              <p>- P21 you refer to a pilot study, but this is a feasibility study.</p>

              <p>Reviewer #2: Abstract</p>
              <p>- Results describes the sampling and drop out too extensively. In my view this can just be described in the body of the paper</p>
              <p>Introduction</p>
              <p>- Line 3 – ‘lower access and fewer resources to healthcare’ clarity needs improving</p>
              <p>- The authors make a good case for the project, with strong rationale given for need for WL programme specific to rural settings and the need to increase self-efficacy and social support in rural populations. However, there was limited review of the current literature and other similar studies. The paper would benefit from this as it would provide context for the current study</p>
              <p>Methods</p>
              <p>Methods were thorough and would enable replication. However, there are some areas that require more clarity:</p>
              <p>- Were dietary consultations from the registered dietitian provided in addition to the weekly motivational interviewing approach?</p>
              <p>- It is unclear to me whether the behavioural, dietary and physical activity components of the intervention were separately delivered i.e. in separate phone calls, or whether the health coach delivered all elements within one 30-45 minute call.</p>
              <p>- Similarly, the group-mediated activity following the weekly telephone counselling that was integrated into the behavioural component – does this not apply to the physical activity and dietary element too?</p>
              <p>- Greater clarity would be appreciated here. Perhaps within the first paragraph of the ‘Telephone-based Health Counselling’ section it might be useful to explain the overall intervention in more detail and then use the individual sections to go into the specifics of the dietary/PA requirements.</p>
              <p>- The feasibility was determined by participants completing online surveys. Given that this is a rural population, who may have limited access to the internet, were other methods for completing the surveys provided (i.e. pen and paper, or over the telephone)?</p>
              <p>Results</p>
              <p>- The data presented in Table 2 is presented in the text. You can just refer to the table without repeating the results. It would also be useful to know whether there were any significant differences between groups on these baseline characteristics</p>
              <p>- I appreciate the inclusion of reasons for drop out – this provides important context</p>
              <p>- Per Table 1 there was a significant difference in BMI between participants who were excluded and consented – some comment or reflection on this in the discussion would be welcomed.</p>
              <p>Discussion</p>
              <p>- Previous research was mentioned in the discussion, but this had not been previously covered in the introduction. Agree that it is important to contextualise the findings but the paper would benefit from a more thorough literature review in the introduction, which can then be referred to in the discussion.</p>
              <p>- Reflection on the impact of COVID was useful and provided additional context to the results</p>
              <p>Other comments</p>
              <p>- This is a clear and thorough paper. I look forward to reading the results of the intervention.</p>

              <p>Review Comments to the Author</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: This is an interesting feasibility study looking at provision of weight management support in a rural setting. A key strength of the study is the objective assessment of weight change and physiological outcomes. However, in my opinion there are two weaknesses to the study, which both look to be resolvable: Firstly this is in how the study is described. For reasons articulated in my more detailed comments, I don’t believe this is an acceptability study, or at least the outcomes reported and relied on here do not relate to frameworks of acceptability.

It looks like a large number of these have been provided - including some in the control group - but unless they are more systematically set out it is hard to work out what the logic model/mechanism of action is for the study, which can then be measured against when it comes to trial.</p>
              <p>RESPONSE: Thank you for your comments. We have revised the manuscript to address your concerns regarding the acceptability and behavioral support content. Please see the individual responses below.</p>
              <p>Abstract:</p>
              <p>- I would reframe the 1st sentence - this is contingent on interventions working in the long term which has yet to be established. It’s more accurate to say that weight loss itself does confer the benefits refer to.</p>
              <p>RESPONSE: We revised the abstract as requested. We specified that weight loss through lifestyle modification can produce health benefits to align with the scope of this study.</p>
              <p>- The Method and Results sections were somewhat confusing; the methods talk about 40 people, but the results refer to 423 - what was the sample pool? The Methods should contain a clear account of how you intend to measure feasibility and acceptability (how, and what criteria would constitute a decision either way), and then in the Results report whether these were met.</p>
              <p>RESPONSE: We clarified the methods and results sections as requested. We had 423 individuals enter the online screening survey providing consent upon doing so. Of these, 98 were determined to be eligible based on screening procedures. Ultimately, 40 subjects were enrolled in the study and randomized to one of the two conditions. </p>
              <p>Thank you for the suggestions regarding the framework of acceptability. Given what was measured and reported in this study, we have reviewed all uses of the term “acceptability” and changed text to more appropriate term of “adherence”. </p>
              <p>In the methods section, we defined the feasibility “at least 80% participants completing the follow-up surveys”. The acceptable adherence target to the weight loss intervention was defined as, “Percentage of participants in the weight loss group who attend ≥75% of weekly telephone sessions.” The results section states, “Feasibility was demonstrated,” which refers to the feasibility target being met. We also reported that “the adherence of the intervention was acceptable among half of the group”.</p>
              <p>Methods</p>
              <p>- Study design; please provide the rationale and justification of the criteria set for feasibility and acceptability. The measure of acceptability in particular is unusual so needs some supporting - for example see the Theoretical framework of Acceptability (Sekhon et al., 2017). This sets out a systematically developed multi-dimensional framework, but it does not include the measure you had (i.e., attendance). To me it therefore comes across that both of the outcomes you report are feasibility, and you haven’t reported a measure of acceptability in this paper.</p>
              <p>RESPONSE: Thank you for the suggestions. Please refer to our previous response regarding changes made to better reflect appropriate terminology and domains of intervention adherence and feasibility. We revised the methods section to reflect the changes (page 7, page 18)</p>
              <p>- P7, sentence that starts “The weight loss was achieved……” - take care not to infer things that you could not control. This was the intention, you can’t claim that this was actually how the weight loss was achieved until you have tested this (i.e., ppts could just reduce calories and not increase PA and still achieve weight loss, etc).</p>
              <p>RESPONSE: We revised the sentence as, “The targeted behavioral modifications for weight loss included…”(page 9, last paragraph)</p>
              <p>- P7: you refer to providing behavioural techniques. These need to be fully described, I am guessing both in relation to what the telephone counsellor did, and what was provided through the manual. Some elements are referred to later - but it’s hard to follow when definitions, clarifications or signposting to where this is covered in more detail are not provided when first introduced. The full detail then appears in P10. While there is lots of detail here, and it looks like you have linked strategies and techniques to your intended outcomes, it is not presented in a way that is easy to reference for the reader. I would consider finding a way to list/map the intended mediators you want to influence (e.g., self-efficacy) to evidence-based or theoretically informed techniques you have chosen to tackle them. Moving away from description to mapping this more clearly would also help when it comes to assessing mechanisms of action (i.e., whether elements were sufficient to bring about hypothesised changes). Similarly, while you describe familiar approaches to behavioural support, you have not specified the behaviour change techniques used - which is now expected practice for any published intervention. This could be done using the Michie et al Taxonomy of Behaviour Change techniques, which is well developed and implemented in research and practice (a recent review is referred to below for reference).</p>
              <p>RESPONSE: We appreciate your suggestions regarding more contemporary and precise reporting of the active elements of intervention and hypothesized mechanisms of action. We have now included a BCT-MoA (Behavior Change Techniques-Mechanisms of Action) table including intervention applications, behavior change techniques used, and links to hypothesized mechanisms of action for the telephone-based health counseling group (Supplementary Table 2). In addition to the BCT-MoA table, we revised the intervention approach substantially (P8-10, P11-14). </p>
              <p>- P8 - motivational interviewing is introduced as a technique, but the most recent evidence in relation to its efficacy for weight loss is not referenced.</p>
              <p>RESPONSE: This is a good point. We’ve added references demonstrating the efficacy of motivational interviewing in weight management studies (see page 11, first paragraph), and also cited a recent large-scale weight loss intervention trial that applied motivational interviewing (Page 11, Reference 34). </p>
              <p>- P9 - you state that “exercise prescriptions were appropriately modified….” (P9). What did this mean? This issue (i.e., stating something before defining it) was evidence throughout and made it quite hard to follow - for example, this was also the case for describing how</p>
              <p>RESPONSE: Thank you for the comment. We understand the importance of specifying “modifications” and “individualized approach” throughout the manuscript. We added examples of how and why the exercise prescription was modified (page 11-12). Since the weight loss intervention was a translational, telephone-based, one-on-one intervention, and health coaches individualized physical activity, diet, and behavioral components based on the specific needs for each participant, while gradually progressing towards the specified global volume goals, we are not able to provide a more general exercise prescription than has been described. We content this personalization process represents a strength of the intervention as it is well-established “one-size fits all” prescriptions are not efficacious. For the behavioral support component, along with utilizing individualized counseling, we did specify that the weekly telephone session was primarily focused on the planned lessons and followed a standard session agenda from the lifestyle modification manual. Thus, the intervention for the weight loss group was structured, evidence-based, and included the implementation of strategies used to tailor content/interactions to participant needs; a particularly unique aspect of this study.</p>
              <p>- P11 - given recent discussion about the importance of specifying what is in a control group, you could also use the behaviour change taxonomy to indicate what is in the control group (i.e., there seems to be quite a lot they are also receiving). This may help to make it clearer what differs between the two groups.</p>
              <p>RESPONSE: Thank you for the comment. To clarify the difference between the two groups, we added the table below as a supplementary table (Supplementary Table 1). However, we did not map BCTs for the control group since those were resources provided without additional advice, instruction, or demonstration from health coaches (Michie et. al., 2013). </p>

              <p>- It would be useful to make some comment on the reasons for ineligibility (which appear in the figure, but aren’t referred to in the text). For e.g., it would be useful to know this for others aiming to recruit this way, in terms of whether the reasons would have been known to potential participants (e.g., different advertising might make a difference) or if the reasons were unknown to those applying.</p>
              <p>RESPONSE: Thank you for the comment. We opted not to include the details of ineligibility in the text since that was not the focus of this manuscript. As you mentioned, we have detailed information in the figure for readers who were interested in the recruitment. As mentioned in the text, most individuals were recruited through Facebook (n= (384/423)). Due to the small proportion of individuals recruited by other methods, we were not able to compare the differences in the ineligibility across recruitment approach. </p>
              <p>- I was surprised to see data reported for participants who had not consented to be part of the study (i.e., Table 1).</p>
              <p>RESPONSE: We revised the process of recruitment in the methods section, “Individuals who were interested in the study were consented to complete an eligibility screening,” to clarify that all individuals who entered the survey consented to the online survey. We revised the title of Table 1 to “Characteristics of Individuals Who Completed the Online Screening Survey, Overall and Those Who Were Consented to the Study vs. Those Were Screened But Excluded from the Study”. Table 1 is critical to include to show the differences between those who consented and were subsequently enrolled and randomized, versus those who were excluded from the weight loss study. We revised the results section (P17) to reflect the changes. This is an important aspect to illustrate the generalizability of the study sample, and also crucial for comparison with other studies. </p>
              <p>- The text in the main paragraph of P16 (describing Table 2) is largely repeating the table - only a brief sentence or two is needed to flag the key points to the reader.</p>
              <p>RESPONSE: We revised as requested.</p>
              <p>Discussion</p>
              <p>- P20 - when you refer to strengths, the first paragraph of this did not seem to be supported by any external evidence or what is reported for your study. A lot of claims are made in the first sentence alone - for example you state that you established social support - but this is not something you have assessed. The reference to participant feedback would be fine if this had been systematically collected and reported, but this comes across as a single anecdote.</p>
              <p>RESPONSE: In this paragraph, we intended to highlight what was unique about our study, which was tailoring the intervention to a rural population. We have edited certain language (i.e., “establishing”) in this section to reflect the change to “promoting” as part of the intervention. Given the focus of this study was on the feasibility of providing individualized counseling to participants and collecting data in the community setting, we believe the slight modification to this language now accurately reflects procedures while avoiding making any unjustified claims. </p>
              <p>We did provide behavioral support with the intention of influencing theoretical determinants of behavior change (e.g., social support). However, formal analysis of potential mediators of behavioral changes was beyond the scope of the current study. We acknowledge that participant feedback was not systematically assessed. Thus, we did not include their feedback in the results section. We mentioned the anecdotal feedback in the discussion section to provide an example of how counseling was utilized in the intervention to tailor recommendations to address individual barriers. </p>
              <p>- Paragraph 2 on P20 is similarly based on feedback from participants that you have not reported - so again, does not provide a convincing case. If you have this qualitative data, then it should be presented as part of the Results before you can refer to it.</p>
              <p>RESPONSE: We agree that this was not a qualitative study, therefore, we did not include participant feedback in the results section. These anecdotal examples from participants outline the importance of our tailored approach to address the unique needs of a rural population and provide meaningful context.</p>
              <p>- P21 you refer to a pilot study, but this is a feasibility study.</p>
              <p>RESPONSE: This was a feasibility study, and based-on the sample size, this was also a pilot study. We did not intend to interchange feasibility with pilot. But in this paragraph, we used “pilot study” to refer our small sample size and indicate that a large-scale study is needed. A pilot study is defined as “A small-scale test of the methods and procedures to be used on a larger scale” (Porta, Dictionary of Epidemiology, 5th edition, 2008). Pilot studies should assess the feasibility/acceptability of the approach to be used in the larger study (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.nccih.nih.gov/grants/pilot-studies-common-uses-and-misuses" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.nccih.nih.gov/grants/pilot-studies-common-uses-and-misuses</ext-link>).</p>

              <p>Reviewer #2: Abstract</p>
              <p>- Results describes the sampling and drop out too extensively. In my view this can just be described in the body of the paper</p>
              <p>RESPONSE: We revised as requested on page 3, results paragraph.</p>
              <p>Introduction</p>
              <p>- Line 3 – ‘lower access and fewer resources to healthcare’ clarity needs improving</p>
              <p>RESPONSE: We revised the introduction as requested. We restructured the first paragraph to point out the obesity-related disparities in rural residents, and then clarified the socioeconomic and environmental disadvantages that are linked with health disparities in this population (see page 5, first paragraph). </p>
              <p>- The authors make a good case for the project, with strong rationale given for need for WL program specific to rural settings and the need to increase self-efficacy and social support in rural populations. However, there was limited review of the current literature and other similar studies. The paper would benefit from this as it would provide context for the current study.</p>
              <p>RESPONSE: Thank you for the comment and suggestion for a more substantive review of contemporary literature. The Introduction section has been revised to provide more review of the salient research beginning on page 6, first paragraph.</p>
              <p>Methods</p>
              <p>Methods were thorough and would enable replication. However, there are some areas that require more clarity:</p>
              <p>- Were dietary consultations from the registered dietitian provided in addition to the weekly motivational interviewing approach?</p>
              <p>RESPONSE: Yes. We clarified this in the methods and discussion sections (see page 11, second paragraph and page 26, second paragraph), referring to consultations being provided upon request on an as needed basis.</p>
              <p>- It is unclear to me whether the behavioural, dietary and physical activity components of the intervention were separately delivered i.e. in separate phone calls, or whether the health coach delivered all elements within one 30-45 minute call.</p>
              <p>RESPONSE: The behavioral, dietary and physical activity counseling addressed each of these domains during the weekly telephone sessions. During these sessions, instructions on and recommendations for independent dietary and physical activity were made along with instruction on complementary self-regulation strategies. We revised the methods section to clarify this information (Page 8-9). To improve clarity, we have included a supplementary table defining all applications for the health counseling group, behavior change techniques (according to the BCTTv1), and linking BCTs to hypothesized mechanisms of action. We revised the methods section to reflect this change (Page 12).</p>
              <p>- Similarly, the group-mediated activity following the weekly telephone counselling that was integrated into the behavioural component – does this not apply to the physical activity and dietary element too?</p>
              <p>RESPONSE: The group chat was provided as an ancillary supportive piece of the telephone-based health counseling intervention and available for participants in that arm of the study. The chat was supervised by the health coaches and primarily used as a means of communication between participants. Additionally, it was used to facilitate group-mediated barrier problem solving and as a means for participants to share successes and challenges and provide encouraging feedback to their peers. We revised the methods section to reflect this change (Page 13, second paragraph).</p>
              <p>- Greater clarity would be appreciated here. Perhaps within the first paragraph of the ‘Telephone-based Health Counselling’ section it might be useful to explain the overall intervention in more detail and then use the individual sections to go into the specifics of the dietary/PA requirements.</p>
              <p>RESPONSE: Thank you for the suggestion to elaborate on the intervention components. To improve clarity, we have included additional details in the first paragraph of the Telephone-based health counseling section, as well as included a supplementary table describing the intervention applications by component with the relevant behavior change techniques and hypothesized mechanisms of action (Page 8-9). We hope this clarifies now the dietary, physical activity, and behavioral support components of the counseling sessions were addressed.</p>
              <p>- The feasibility was determined by participants completing online surveys. Given that this is a rural population, who may have limited access to the internet, were other methods for completing the surveys provided (i.e. pen and paper, or over the telephone)?</p>
              <p>RESPONSE: We understand your concern regarding accessibility of internet in rural populations. Because most participants were recruited through social media, and all individuals went through online screening surveys before enrolling in the study, participants who enrolled in the study would have internet access to the online survey. We did offer the eligibility screening through telephone, but no one requested a telephone screening due to lack of access to internet. Thus, we did not offer any follow up surveys through paper copies or telephone. </p>
              <p>Results</p>
              <p>- The data presented in Table 2 is presented in the text. You can just refer to the table without repeating the results. It would also be useful to know whether there were any significant differences between groups on these baseline characteristics</p>
              <p>RESPONSE: We shortened the text describing results in Table 2. We decided to not compare baseline characteristics between group. Since this was a randomized controlled study, the study design ensures that the two groups are balanced in respect of baseline characteristics and unmeasured confounders. </p>
              <p>- I appreciate the inclusion of reasons for drop out – this provides important context</p>
              <p>RESPONSE: Thank you.</p>
              <p>- Per Table 1 there was a significant difference in BMI between participants who were excluded and consented – some comment or reflection on this in the discussion would be welcomed.</p>
              <p>RESPONSE: Thank you for the comment. Although the magnitude of the BMI differed between the 2 groups, the difference did not reach the statistical significance. However, we revised the discussion section to reflect individuals who enrolled in the study may not represent the general population in rural areas (page 24, last paragraph).</p>
              <p>Discussion</p>
              <p>- Previous research was mentioned in the discussion, but this had not been previously covered in the introduction. Agree that it is important to contextualise the findings but the paper would benefit from a more thorough literature review in the introduction, which can then be referred to in the discussion.</p>
              <p>RESPONSE: Thank you for the comment and suggestion for a more substantive review of contemporary literature. The Discussion section has been revised.</p>
              <p>- Reflection on the impact of COVID was useful and provided additional context to the results</p>
              <p>RESPONSE: Thank you. We wanted to acknowledge the challenges of COVID-19 and share our experience with all readers.</p>
              <p>Other comments</p>
              <p>- This is a clear and thorough paper. I look forward to reading the results of the intervention.</p>
              <p>RESPONSE: We appreciate your inputs for this paper. We are currently in the process of drafting another manuscript to show the changes in weight, body composition, and disease biomarkers.</p>
