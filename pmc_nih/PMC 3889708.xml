                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV3) is a common cause of upper and lower respiratory tract illness in infants and young children. Live-attenuated cold-adapted HPIV3 vaccines have been evaluated in infants but a suitable interval for administration of a second dose of vaccine has not been defined.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>HPIV3-seronegative children between the ages of 6 and 36 months were randomized 2:1 in a blinded study to receive two doses of 10<sup>5</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub> (50% tissue culture infectious dose) of live-attenuated, recombinant cold-passaged human PIV3 vaccine (rHPIV3cp45) or placebo 6 months apart. Serum antibody levels were assessed prior to and approximately 4–6 weeks after each dose. Vaccine virus infectivity, defined as detection of vaccine-HPIV3 in nasal wash and/or a ≥ 4-fold rise in serum antibody titer, and reactogenicity were assessed on days 3, 7, and 14 following immunization.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Forty HPIV3-seronegative children (median age 13 months; range 6–35 months) were enrolled; 27 (68%) received vaccine and 13 (32%) received placebo. Infectivity was detected in 25 (96%) of 26 evaluable vaccinees following doses 1 and 9 of 26 subject (35%) following dose 2. Among those who shed virus, the median duration of viral shedding was 12 days (range 6–15 days) after dose 1 and 6 days (range 3–8 days) after dose 2, with a mean peak log<sub>10</sub> viral titer of 3.4 PFU/mL (SD: 1.0) after dose 1 compared to 1.5 PFU/mL (SD: 0.92) after dose 2. Overall, reactogenicity was mild, with no difference in rates of fever and upper respiratory infection symptoms between vaccine and placebo groups.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="par0025">Human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV3) is an important cause of respiratory disease in infants and young children, responsible for both upper respiratory disease as well as lower respiratory tract disease including bronchiolitis and pneumonia <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Human parainfluenza viruses (HPIV) types 1–4 are associated with a substantial burden of disease in children overall, resulting in frequent medical care and hospitalization for pediatric respiratory disease <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>; HPIV3 alone is second only to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) for causing bronchiolitis and pneumonia in infants less than 6 months of age <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Patients of all ages with underlying pulmonary disease or immunocompromising conditions may have serious disease related to HPIVs, with HPIV3 being the most important among these viruses <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. There is currently no licensed vaccine or antiviral therapy available for the prevention or treatment of HPIV disease.</p>
              <p id="par0030">Live-attenuated HPIV3 vaccines have been developed and undergone clinical testing over the past several decades <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. The use of the intranasal route for administration of live-attenuated viral vaccines may offer advantages for immunization against HPIV in young children, including the potential for induction of both mucosal and systemic immunity against infection <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. As with live-attenuated influenza virus vaccines, more than one dose of these live-attenuated vaccines may be needed to induce sustained protection in infants and young children <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p>
              <p id="par0035">Two approaches to development of live-attenuated HPIV3 vaccines have been taken. The related animal virus bovine PIV3 was used to create chimeric human bovine PIV3 vaccines <xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. In addition, live-attenuated vaccine candidates from human HPIV3 strains were derived via repeated passages at low temperature <xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. The most attenuated of these, designated cp45, was extensively evaluated in phase I and II clinical trials in children and infants as young as one month of age <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.</p>
              <p id="par0040">More recently, a cDNA-derived recombinant version of this biologically derived vaccine was developed, designated rHPIV3cp45. The rHPIV3cp45 vaccine contains the 15 known attenuating mutations present in the biologically derived virus <xref rid="bib0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. The use of a cDNA approach has the advantage of using a virus with a short, well-characterized passage history as well as the ability to readily regenerate and modify the virus as needed <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. The rHPIV3cp45 vaccine was recently evaluated in a phase I trial in which infants ages 6–12 months were randomized to receive two doses of rHPIV3cp45 vaccine or placebo, administered 4–10 weeks apart <xref rid="bib0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. While the safety profile and the infectivity of the first dose of rHPIV3cp45 were similar to that previously observed with the biologically derived virus, the second dose of vaccine was highly restricted in replication and did not boost serum antibody responses <xref rid="bib0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. For this reason, we explored whether extending the interval between doses might enhance the infectivity and immunogenicity of a second dose of vaccine. The purpose of this study was to determine the tolerability, infectivity, and immunogenicity of two 10<sup>5</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub> doses of rHPIV3cp45 administered 6 months apart to HPIV3 seronegative infants and children.</p>

The seed virus for the production of this experimental vaccine was generated at the Laboratory of Infectious Diseases (LID), National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, MD. The clinical lot of vaccine virus was prepared at Charles River Laboratories (Malvern, PA). The rHPIV3cp45 clinical lot (Lot PIV3#102A) was tested for sterility, infectivity, sequence identity, safety in animals, and the presence of adventitious agents. The lot passed all tests satisfactorily. Vaccine virus was stored frozen at −70 °C and had a mean infectivity titer of 10<sup>7</sup> tissue culture infectious doses (TCID<sub>50</sub>) per mL. Final vial content was diluted to dose on-site.</p>

Viral RNA was extracted using QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kits (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and cDNA was generated using Superscript First-Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). For each sample, cDNA was amplified with the Clontech Advantage HF 2 PCR Kit (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) to generate a PCR product covering a segment of the F gene (nucleotides 5000-7251) that contains two attenuating mutations in rHPIV3cp45 (encoding Ile-420 to Val and Ala-450 to Thr).

The median duration of viral shedding in those infected with vaccine virus was 12 days (range 6–15 days) following the first dose compared with 6 days (range 3–8 days) following the second dose of vaccine, with the peak mean log<sub>10</sub> titer following the first dose of 3.4 PFU/mL (SD 1.0) compared to 1.5 PFU/mL (SD 0.92) following the second dose (<italic>P</italic>

A 4-fold or greater increase in serum antibody was documented in 23 of 26 (88%) evaluable children following the first dose of vaccine, with a mean log<sub>2</sub> HAI antibody titer of 5.3 ± 1.8, and in six of 26 (23%) children following the second dose, with a mean log<sub>2</sub> antibody titer of 6.2 ± 1.5. At the time of the first dose of vaccine, the age of vaccine recipients who were infected after dose 1 [13.9 months (SD: 1.53)] was significantly older than those who were infected after dose 2 [9.1 months (SD 0.61)] (<italic>P</italic>
 = 0.007). Among vaccine recipients (<italic>n</italic>

                <p id="par0125">HPIV3 was detected in one placebo recipient beginning on day 0 of the study, prior to vaccination. This isolate was confirmed by RT-PCR amplification and sequence analysis to be wild type HPIV3 and not vaccine virus. In addition, vaccine virus was isolated from nasal wash samples of each vaccinee that shed (<italic>n</italic>
 = 33; 24 after does 1, 9 after dose 2) and confirmed to be vaccine virus by RT-PCR and sequencing. Isolates from all of the vaccinees contained the expected rHPIV3cp45 mutations (data not shown), thus confirming that the virus was vaccine derived, and that the attenuating mutations were maintained during vaccine virus replication.</p>

. The majority of study participants (23/26, 88%) had a 4-fold or greater antibody rise following the first dose of vaccine. No subject had a 4-fold rise in titers to indicate natural infection between dose 1 and dose 2. While the mean log<sub>2</sub> antibody titer did not increase significantly for the entire group of vaccinees after the second vaccine dose, ≥4-fold increases in titer were observed for 4 of the 5 children who had a log<sub>2</sub> antibody titer of ≤4 following the first dose of vaccine. Thus, the net effect of the second dose was to increase the proportion of subjects achieving relatively high HAI antibody titers: whereas only 15 children achieved post-vaccination log<sub>2</sub> titers &gt;6 observed following the first dose of vaccine, 21 achieved log<sub>2</sub> titers &gt;6 following the second dose. Only one evaluable vaccine recipient had neither seroconversion nor viral shedding documented. Overall infectivity, defined as either viral shedding or a ≥4-fold rise in antibody titer, was observed in 25 of 27 (93%) of vaccinated children following the first dose and 9 of 26 (35%) following the second dose of vaccine. Three (23%) placebo recipients had a ≥ 4-fold rise in HAI antibody titers four to six weeks following the first dose of vaccine, including the child who shed wt HPIV3.<fig id="fig0015"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Reciprocal HAI antibody levels before and after dose 1 and dose 2 for all individual vaccine recipients.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr3"/></fig></p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="par0135">The purpose of this study was to determine whether increasing the interval between doses was able to enhance the infectivity of a second dose of rHPIV3cp45. The results of this study confirmed our initial experience with rHPIV3cp45 <xref rid="bib0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>: the vaccine was safe and well-tolerated with good rates of infectivity and antibody response following a single dose of vaccine. We demonstrated that children with a substantial antibody response following the first dose of vaccine did not seem able to be either infected or boosted when a second dose was administered approximately 6 months after the first dose. In contrast, the second dose of vaccine given six months later appeared to boost antibody titers in those with a suboptimal response following the first dose, and it was associated with lower amounts of detectable virus in the nasal wash. Of interest, children who required a second dose of vaccine to achieve an antibody response were significantly younger than those who did not. Overall, this study demonstrated that two doses separated by 6 months are able to infect children under three years of age who were not infected with a single dose of vaccine.</p>
              <p id="par0140">As expected for a pediatric trial, high rates of infections and symptoms with other viruses were common, but rates and types of viruses and symptoms were similar between placebo and vaccine groups, emphasizing the need for placebo-controlled trials. The detection of adventitious agents using molecular diagnostic techniques was helpful in assessing potential causality of fever in subjects in this trial, since many of both placebo and vaccine recipients had fever associated with infection with other viruses during the trial. Since HPIV3 typically circulates during the spring and summer months when these trials are conducted, sequence analysis proved a useful tool for differentiating between infection with wt and vaccine virus. This technology is important in assessing the safety and reactogenicity of vaccines and the conduct of clinical trials: illness in a placebo recipient was able to be directly related to infection with wtHPIV3 and not to potential spread of vaccine virus in the clinic setting.</p>
              <p id="par0145">Previous clinical studies with similar HPIV 3 vaccines have shown good immunogenicity. For example, the 2003 study by Karron et al. in adults, children, and infants revealed 82–100% infectivity of a single dose in seronegative children between the ages of 6–36 months using a dose of either 10<sup>4</sup> or 10<sup>5</sup>
<xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. A later study by Bernstein et al. studied the recombinant HPIV3 vaccine utilized in our clinical trial, rHPIV3cp45, in infants 6 to less than 12 months of age with 3 doses of vaccine at a dose of 10<sup>5</sup>
<xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. In this younger population, viral shedding after dose 1 was documented in 85% of recipients compared with 89% in our older population. After 3 doses in the Bernstein trial, either seroresponse or shedding occurred in 95% of vaccine recipients compared with our rate of infectivity (seroresponse or shedding) in 96% after dose 1 and 93% after dose 2.</p>
              <p id="par0150">Future use of this vaccine may include immunization of young infants, potentially with repeated dosing to ensure optimal immunogenicity. Since the youngest children are at highest risk for hospitalization or receiving medical care, this group would be the natural targets for immunization to provide the most protection against disease. In addition, use of rHPIV3cp45 in combination with live-attenuated RSV and human metapneumovirus (HMPV) vaccines can be envisioned as a strategy to provide broad protection against important respiratory viral pathogens of infancy and early childhood <xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. A dosing schedule for this type of vaccine would need to be harmonized with current pediatric vaccination schedules.</p>
