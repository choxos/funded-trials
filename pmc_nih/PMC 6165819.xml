                <p>Targeted therapies against <italic>FLT3</italic>-mutated acute myeloid leukemias have shown limited clinical efficacy primarily because of the acquisition of secondary mutations in <italic>FLT3</italic> and persistent activation of downstream pro-survival pathways such as MEK/ERK, PI3K/AKT, and STAT5. Activation of these additional kinases may also result in phosphorylation of tumor suppressor proteins promoting their nuclear export. Thus, co-targeting nuclear export proteins (e.g., XPO1) and FLT3 concomitantly may be therapeutically effective. Here we report on the combinatorial inhibition of XPO1 using selinexor and FLT3 using sorafenib. Selinexor exerted marked cell killing of human and murine <italic>FLT3</italic>-mutant acute myeloid leukemia cells, including those harboring internal tandem duplication and/or tyrosine kinase domain point mutations. Interestingly, selinexor treatment of murine <italic>FLT3</italic>-mutant acute myeloid leukemia cells activated FLT3 and its downstream MAPK or AKT signaling pathways. When combined with sorafenib, selinexor triggered marked synergistic pro-apoptotic effects. This was preceded by elevated nuclear levels of ERK, AKT, NFκB, and FOXO3a. Five days of <italic>in vitro</italic> combination treatment using low doses (i.e., 5 to 10 nM) of each agent promoted early myeloid differentiation of MOLM13 and MOLM14 cells without noticeable cell killing. The combinatorial therapy demonstrated profound <italic>in vivo</italic> anti-leukemia efficacy in a human <italic>FLT3</italic>-mutated xenograft model. In an ongoing phase IB clinical trial the selinexor/sorafenib combination induced complete/partial remissions in six of 14 patients with refractory acute myeloid leukemia, who had received a median of three prior therapies (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link>: NCT02530476). These results provide pre-clinical and clinical evidence for an effective combinatorial treatment strategy targeting XPO1 and FLT3 in <italic>FLT3</italic>- mutated acute myeloid leukemias.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a molecularly heterogeneous hematologic disease defined by the accumulation of immature myeloid cells in blood and bone marrow, which results from a dysregulation of normal proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis in these cells.<sup><xref rid="b1-1031642" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Mutations of the fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 (<italic>FLT3</italic>) gene, including internal tandem duplication (ITD) and the tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) mutations, are common in patients with AML with approximately one-third of newly diagnosed AML patients carrying these mutations. These gain-of-function mutations constitutively activate FLT3 and its downstream effectors MEK/ERK, PI3K/AKT, and STAT5 by phosphorylation. The latter effectors also activate target genes such as p21, p53, and cyclin D1.<sup><xref rid="b2-1031642" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b3-1031642" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Thus, aberrant FLT3-mediated activation of effector proteins leads to uncontrolled proliferation, inhibition of differentiation and reduction of apoptosis in transformed hematopoietic blasts, and is also associated with poor prognosis in AML.<sup><xref rid="b4-1031642" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Targeted therapies against FLT3 in <italic>FLT3</italic>-mutated AML using small molecule inhibitors such as sorafenib, quizartinib, midostaurin, crenolenib, and gilteritinib have shown clinical activity by reducing circulating leukemic blasts, and achieving temporary remission. However, these effects are apparently ineffective against leukemic stem cells in the bone marrow microenvironment and therefore the basis for temporary remission.<sup><xref rid="b5-1031642" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>–<xref rid="b10-1031642" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> In fact, we have reported marked upregulation of MAPK signaling following treatment with FLT3 inhibitors in AML/stroma co-culture, hypoxia, and in clinical samples <italic>ex vivo</italic>; this upregulation could be partially overcome by the novel dual <italic>FLT3</italic>-ITD/MAPK inhibitor E6201.<sup><xref rid="b11-1031642" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> However, recent studies indicate that mutations of FLT3 are late events in leukemogenesis, suggesting that they are acquired rather than founder mutations in leukemia-initiating cells.<sup><xref rid="b12-1031642" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Targeting FLT3 alone is, therefore, unlikely to be sufficient to eradicate leukemia-initiating cells.</p>
              <p>Recently, exportin 1 (XPO1), also known as the nuclear export protein (CRM1), has been identified.<sup><xref rid="b13-1031642" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> XPO1 is a nuclear receptor involved in the active transport of a large number of cargo proteins, including Foxo3A, p53, p21 and NPM1, across the nuclear membrane<sup><xref rid="b14-1031642" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> along with microRNAs.<sup><xref rid="b15-1031642" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="b16-1031642" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> XPO1 overexpression is common in hematologic malignancies including AML, and it was reported by us to be associated with poor disease prognosis.<sup><xref rid="b17-1031642" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Leukemic cells depend on the continuous nuclear export of one or more oncoproteins, and the removal of tumor suppressor proteins, which require nuclear localization for their functions.<sup><xref rid="b18-1031642" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Targeting nuclear membrane proteins such as XPO1 could, therefore, restore tumor suppressor function in AML. The small molecule XPO1 inhibitor, selinexor (KPT-330) is a first–in-class, orally bioavailable selective inhibitor of nuclear export compound that has shown promising anti-leukemia activity <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>.<sup><xref rid="b19-1031642" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="b20-1031642" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Selinexor was effective in inducing apoptosis in cells from established AML cell lines that are in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle,<sup><xref rid="b21-1031642" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> and targeting it also abrogated hypoxia-induced drug resistance in multiple myeloma cells.<sup><xref rid="b22-1031642" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> These results suggest that targeting XPO1 with selinexor may have potent anti-proliferative effects against non-proliferating or slowly proliferating leukemia-initiating cells in primary AML unlike the limitation observed when using FLT3 inhibitors.<sup><xref rid="b19-1031642" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> In addition, the recent results of phase I/II trials using selinexor as monotherapy (e.g. NCT02091245 and NCT02088541) or in combinations with conventional chemotherapeutic drugs (e.g. NCT02249091), have shown promising anti-leukemia activity with a high rate of blast clearance and complete remissions.<sup><xref rid="b20-1031642" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="b23-1031642" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>–<xref rid="b28-1031642" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> Initial problems with gastrointestinal toxicities and anorexia have largely been overcome by dose reduction without loss of clinical efficacy.<sup><xref rid="b23-1031642" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="b24-1031642" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> However, the anti-leukemia activity of selinexor in AML patients with FLT3 mutations, including those with acquired secondary mutations found in relapsed/refractory disease following FLT3-targeted therapy, has not been established.</p>
              <p>In this study, we report that selinexor has marked pro-apoptotic effects against AML cells harboring <italic>FLT3</italic>-ITD and/or TKD mutations. However, compensatory upregulation of phosphorylated FLT3 and its downstream signaling pathways was observed in most of the FLT3-mutated cell lines tested <italic>in vitro</italic>. We, therefore, combined selinexor with sorafenib. This combinatorial drug regimen achieved markedly synergistic leukemia cell killing in cells harboring ITD and/or TKD mutations, which usually show resistance to FLT3-targeted therapy.<sup><xref rid="b29-1031642" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="b30-1031642" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> Of note, the combinatorial regimen also achieved encouraging clinical efficacy including molecular complete responses in an ongoing phase IB/II clinical trial of selinexor plus sorafenib in patients who were refractory to FLT3 inhibitor therapy. Thus, this combinatorial approach may abrogate selinexor-mediated FLT3 activation, resulting in abrogation of resistance to FLT3 inhibitors and induction of durable remissions in patients with additional acquired FLT3 mutations.</p>

                <p>We first investigated anti-leukemia effects of selinexor on AML cells with different <italic>FLT3</italic> mutational status. Selinexor triggered profound induction of apoptosis and inhibition of cell growth, at sub-micromolar concentrations, in all human and murine AML cell lines that harbor ITD, TKD, or dual mutations of <italic>FLT3</italic>. The agent was much less effective in this regard in <italic>FLT3</italic> wildtype Baf3/FLT3, THP-1, and Kasumi-1 cell lines (FLT3 mutant cells, regardless of whether they had single or dual mutations of ITD and TKD, showed 5- to 10-fold lower EC<sub>50</sub> values than those of FLT3-wildtype ones) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-1031642">Figure 1A–C</xref>, <xref rid="t1-1031642" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and <italic>Online Supplementary Figures S2</italic> and <italic>S3</italic>).</p>

                <p>We next evaluated effects of selinexor on protein expression using immunoblot analysis after 24 h of exposure to selinexor. Selinexor inhibited expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1 and upregulated the pro-apoptotic protein Bim. The tumor suppressor proteins p53, p21, and p27 were upregulated as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-1031642">Figure 1D</xref>). Unexpectedly, activations of FLT3 and its downstream signaling pathways were upregulated, as evidenced by increasing levels of phosphorylated FLT3, -ERK, and -AKT after exposure to selinexor for 24 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-1031642">Figure 1E</xref>), which were observed only in the <italic>FLT3</italic>-mutated cells. In addition, total FLT3 levels were also upregulated in <italic>FLT3</italic>-ITD and -ITD plus Y842 mutated cells, but not in ITD plus D835Y cells: this was true for both protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-1031642">Figure 1E</xref>) and mRNA transcriptional levels (<italic>Online Supplementary Figure S4</italic>). Kinetic analysis revealed that the upregulation of phospho-FLT3 was observable at 1 h, and phospho-ERK and -AKT at 6 h, after selinexor treatment (<italic>Online Supplementary Figure S5</italic>). These findings suggest that co-targeting FLT3 signaling, to suppress its downstream signaling pathways, simultaneously with nuclear export may potentially trigger synergistic cytotoxic effects in these cells.</p>
                <p>We tested this hypothesis using combinatorial treatment with selinexor and sorafenib. The combinatorial regimen did indeed trigger synergistic pro-apoptotic effects in murine <italic>FLT3</italic>-ITD mutated, ITD plus Y842C and ITD plus D835Y mutated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-1031642">Figure 2A</xref>) and triggered additive pro-apoptotic effects in human FLT3-ITD-mutated MOLM13 and MV4-11 cells (<italic>Online Supplementary Figure S5</italic>). Of note, the combination regimen also demonstrated a synergistic pro-apoptotic effect in a primary AML sample with FLT3-ITD plus D839G dual mutations (<italic>Online Supplementary Figure S6</italic>). Immunoblot analysis showed that the combinatorial treatment markedly abrogated the upregulation of phospho-FLT3, -ERK and -AKT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-1031642">Figure 2B</xref>) that was observed in the experiments of selinexor treatment alone. In fact, all phospho-proteins were suppressed far below basal levels by the combination treatment. Interestingly, we also observed that ERK, AKT, FOXO3a, NF-kB, p53, p27, and p21 were preferentially retained in the AML cell nuclei after 16 h of treatment with selinexor and sorafenib. This treatment also completely abrogated anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 expression and decreased c-Myc levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-1031642">Figure 2C</xref>), suggesting greater AML cell sensitivity to apoptosis.</p>

                <title>The selinexor and sorafenib combination exerted anti-leukemia effects in patients with <italic>FLT3</italic>-mutated acute myeloid leukemia in a phase IB clinical trial</title>
                <p>The preclinical synergy of selinexor and sorafenib led to the initiation of a phase IB/II study of the combination in relapsed/refractory patients harboring FLT3 mutations. Fourteen patients enrolled in this clinical trial were eligible for analysis. Remarkably, four of the 14 patients (29%) achieved a sustained CRp/CRi and two others (14%) had &gt;50% blast reduction (<xref rid="t2-1031642" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Six of the 11 (55%) patients treated previously with FLT3 inhibitors achieved responses. These patients comprised: (i) two <italic>FLT3</italic>-ITD mutated patients, previously treated with sorafenib, who achieved CRp with molecular CR with selinexor plus sorafenib; (ii) one <italic>FLT3</italic>-ITD and FLT3-D835 dual mutated patient, previously treated with quizartinib and idarubicin with cyatarabine plus crenolanib, who achieved CRi with molecular CR for both <italic>FLT3</italic>-ITD and <italic>FLT3</italic>-D835 with selinexor plus sorafenib; (iii) a FLT3-mutated patient previously treated with crenolanib, sorafenib and allogeneic stem cell transplantation who achieved CRi without molecular CR with selinexor plus sorafenib; and (iv) two <italic>FLT3</italic>-ITD and <italic>FLT3</italic>-D835 dual mutated patients who had received prior sorafenib therapy and achieved PR + &gt;50% blast reduction with selinexor plus sorafenib (Daver <italic>et al</italic>., ASH annual meeting, 2017, Abstract #1344). We have no information regarding differentiation induction in these patients at this time.</p>

              <p>A previous study using the XPO1 inhibitor KPT-185 demonstrated strong post-transcriptional downregulation of total FLT3 protein expression in AML cell lines and primary AML samples, which was associated with anti-leukemia efficacy.<sup><xref rid="b21-1031642" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> We confirmed the suppression of phospho-FLT3 and accompanying downregulation of total FLT3 protein in human MOLM13 and MV4-11 cells after 24 h of selinexor treatment (<italic>Online Supplementary Figure S9</italic>). Unexpectedly, however, we observed marked upregulation of phospho-FLT3 in murine AML cells, including those harboring ITD, ITD plus D835Y or Y842C dual mutations, after exposure to the same concentrations of selinexor. Furthermore, total FLT3 protein and mRNA levels were upregulated in addition to the upregulation of FLT3 downstream phospho-ERK and -AKT levels in cells with these mutations, but not in the ITD plus D835Y mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-1031642">Figure 1E</xref>, <italic>Online Supplementary Figure S4</italic>), suggesting that a possible transcriptional mechanism was involved in FLT3 upregulation in these murine cells. The modulation profiling suggests that selinexor-induced apoptosis is independent of the suppression of FLT3 and its downstream pathways. In fact, cells with the dual Baf3/ITD+D835 mutation showed greater sensitivity to selinexor-induced apoptosis compared with other dual-mutated cells, Baf3/ITD+Y842 and Baf3/ITD+F691 (EC<sub>50</sub> values were 0.2 and 0.3 mM <italic>versus</italic> 0.56 and 0.6 mM, respectively, Baf3/ITD+D835H and Baf3/ITD+D835Y <italic>versus</italic> Baf3/ITD+Y842 and Baf3/ITD+F691 cells), and suppressed phospho-ERK and –AKT, but upregulated phospho-FLT3 levels. These results strongly support that selinexor induces apoptosis in an FLT3-independent manner in <italic>FLT3</italic>-mutated AML cells. In addition, we observed upregulation of XPO1 cargo proteins p53, p21 and p27, as well as downregulation of pro-survival Mcl-1 after 24 h of selinexor treatment in both human and murine FLT3-mutated AML cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-1031642">Figures 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-1031642">2C</xref>). We, therefore, postulated that the modulation of pro- and anti-apoptotic regulators was the driving force behind selinexor-triggered apoptosis in the <italic>FLT3</italic>-mutated AML cells. These results extend our previous observations in wildtype <italic>FLT3</italic> AML cells, which are likely also dependent on p53.<sup><xref rid="b17-1031642" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup></p>
              <p>We further postulated that the selinexor-induced upregulation of phospho-FLT3 and its downstream components may provide a rationale for the combinatorial treatment with FLT3 inhibitors. Concomitantly targeting XPO1 and FLT3 triggered profound synergistic pro-apoptotic effects in murine <italic>FLT3</italic>-mutated AML cells. However, only additive induction of apoptosis was observed in human <italic>FLT3</italic>-mutated AML cells (<italic>Online Supplementary Figure S5</italic>). Of note, we have reported that FLT3-targeted therapy upregulates FLT3 and its downstream proteins in human clinical samples and in most sorafenib-resistant AML cells <italic>in vitro</italic>.<sup><xref rid="b5-1031642" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b11-1031642" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="b30-1031642" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> Thus, it is reasonable to speculate that co-targeting FLT3 and XPO1 could achieve synergistic efficacy by overcoming the resistance to FLT3-targeted therapy. Our data demonstrate a synergistic anti-leukemia efficacy of the drug combination <italic>in vivo</italic>. In addition, the combination regimen produced a profound reduction of CXCR4 and HIF1α levels in hypoxia <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-1031642">Figure 3C</xref>), and also marked elimination of leukemic cells in a bone marrow <italic>in vivo</italic> murine AML model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6-1031642">Figure 6B</xref>), suggesting a potential benefit for overcoming resist ance provided by the microenvironment. Remarkably, the combination regimen has achieved complete remissions, including ongoing complete molecular remissions, in 30% (3 of the first 10) relapsed/refractory AML patients in our on-going phase IB/II clinical trial of combinatorial therapy of selinexor and sorafenib. Of note, the three patients with CRp/CRi, who were previously clinically refractory to quizartinib/sorafenib monotherapy or to combinations with conventional chemotherapeutic drugs, achieved <italic>FLT3</italic>-ITD negativity as determined by the real-time polymerase chain reaction assay.</p>
              <p>One hallmark of AML is the differentiation arrest of leukemic blasts. Promoting differentiation may therefore be beneficial for achieving and maintaining remissions in leukemias. Targeting <italic>FLT3</italic>-mutated AML cells with FLT3 inhibitors has been reported to induce cell-cycle arrest and differentiation, rather than apoptosis, which is reportedly driven by overexpression of <italic>C/EBPα</italic> and PU.1.<sup><xref rid="b36-1031642" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="b38-1031642" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> Schepers <italic>et al</italic>. described that upregulation of <italic>C/EBPα</italic> led to growth arrest of CD34<sup>+</sup> leukemia cells, which impaired the self-renewal capacity of the leukemic CD34<sup>+</sup> cells, and corresponded with enhanced myeloid differentiation as well.<sup><xref rid="b39-1031642" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> Also, KPT-185 induced cell-cycle arrest and myeloid differentiation in AML cells, including patients’ samples, which increased <italic>C/EBPα</italic>.<sup><xref rid="b21-1031642" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> In fact, <italic>C/EBPα</italic> is a p53-regulated DNA damage-inducible gene,<sup><xref rid="b40-1031642" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> and p53 induction is involved in myeloid differentiation.<sup><xref rid="b41-1031642" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> Our data indicate that selinexor deactivated the nuclear export of a number of cargo proteins including p53. Furthermore, sorafenib mediated the upregulation of p21, and its combination with selinexor markedly enhanced levels of p53, p21, and <italic>C/EBPα</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-1031642">Figure 4D</xref>) as noted above, the last being one of the key hematopoietic-specific transcription factors mediating myeloid differentiation of leukemia cells. However, we did not observe an increase in another transcription factor, PU.1, which is reportedly an upregulated effector of <italic>C/EBPα</italic>. The precise function of PU.1 is still unclear. Dahl <italic>et al</italic>. suggested that lower levels of PU.1 direct granulocyte differentiation, whereas higher levels are required for macrophage differentiation.<sup><xref rid="b37-1031642" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> Nevertheless, our data imply that an increase of C/EBPα levels was sufficient to induce myeloid differentiation of <italic>FLT3</italic>-ITD-mutated leukemic cells and decrease the CD34<sup>+</sup> population, especially for the combination of sorafenib and selinexor. This treatment restores nuclear p53 level by blocking XPO1, and then upregulates C/EBPα to enhance <italic>C/EBPα/PU-1</italic> and granulocyte differentiation as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-1031642">Figure 4</xref> and <italic>Online Supplementary Figure S8</italic>.</p>
              <p>Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) family proteins are reportedly involved in regulation of myeloid progenitor cell differentiation.<sup><xref rid="b42-1031642" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> In fact, STAT5 plays an important role in early myeloid differentiation, and lacking expression of STAT5 reduced lymphomyeloid repopulating activity from adult bone marrow and fetal liver of mice.<sup><xref rid="b43-1031642" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> STAT3 activation has also been reported to be a critical step in terminal differentiation of myeloid cells.<sup><xref rid="b44-1031642" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> On the other hand, upregulation of MAPK has also shown to be critical in both monocytic and granulocytic differentiation of myeloid cell lines, which can be abrogated by using the MEK inhibitor U0126.<sup><xref rid="b45-1031642" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> All of these lines of evidence imply that high activation of these proteins may contribute to myeloid differentiation of leukemia cells. Of note, we observed profound upregulation of phosphorylated STAT3, STAT5 and ERK levels after combination treatment with low doses of sorafenib and selinexor in FLT3-mutated MOLM13 and MOLM14 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-1031642">Figure 4D</xref>), suggesting that upregulation of STATs and/or MAPK signaling pathways may also contribute to differentiation induction of the combination regimen in FLT3 mutated AML cells.</p>
              <p>In summary, our combinatorial strategy targeting FLT3 and XPO1 showed synergistic anti-leukemia effects in FLT3 inhibitor-resistant cells <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. The combination of XPO1 and FLT3 inhibitors may also be able to eliminate leukemia-initiating cells by arresting cell growth and impairing the self-renewal capacity of leukemic CD34<sup>+</sup> cells. These results should provide a solid basis for examining these agents further in patients with FLT3-mutated AML, including those who have acquired resistance to FLT3-targeted therapy.</p>
