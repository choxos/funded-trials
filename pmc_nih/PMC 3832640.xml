                  <p>Our knowledge about the neural code in the auditory nerve is based to a large extent on experiments on cats. Several anatomical differences between auditory neurons in human and cat are expected to lead to functional differences in speed and safety of spike conduction.</p>

                  <title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title>
                  <p>Confocal microscopy was used to systematically evaluate peripheral and central process diameters, commonness of myelination and morphology of spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) along the cochlea of three human and three cats. Based on these morphometric data, model analysis reveales that spike conduction in SGNs is characterized by four phases: a postsynaptic delay, constant velocity in the peripheral process, a presomatic delay and constant velocity in the central process. The majority of SGNs are type I, connecting the inner hair cells with the brainstem. In contrast to those of humans, type I neurons of the cat are entirely myelinated. Biophysical model evaluation showed delayed and weak spikes in the human soma region as a consequence of a lack of myelin. The simulated spike conduction times are in accordance with normal interwave latencies from auditory brainstem response recordings from man and cat. Simulated 400 pA postsynaptic currents from inner hair cell ribbon synapses were 15 times above threshold. They enforced quick and synchronous spiking. Both of these properties were not present in type II cells as they receive fewer and much weaker (<sup>∼</sup>26 pA) synaptic stimuli.</p>

                  <p>Wasting synaptic energy boosts spike initiation, which guarantees the rapid transmission of temporal fine structure of auditory signals. However, a lack of myelin in the soma regions of human type I neurons causes a large delay in spike conduction in comparison with cat neurons. The absent myelin, in combination with a longer peripheral process, causes quantitative differences of temporal parameters in the electrically stimulated human cochlea compared to the cat cochlea.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>The temporal characteristics of the spiking patterns of the auditory nerve are crucial in natural hearing <xref rid="pone.0079256-Rattay1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0079256-Young1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> and in its neuroprosthetic counterpart when action potentials (APs) are initiated via cochlear implants <xref rid="pone.0079256-Javel1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0079256-vandenHonert1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Most of our knowledge on spike coding in the auditory nerve is based on single cell recordings in cats. As such recordings are not possible in man, findings from cats are often generalized to human due anatomical similarities. However, shorter total lengths of SGNs in cat, thinner processes, smaller cell bodies and fundamental differences in myelination are obvious reasons not to rely on a cat model when signaling in human auditory nerve is discussed as these differences between the species may lead to important differences in auditory nerve function.</p>
              <p>In the cochlea, sensory hair cells convert sound into neural signals. These afferent signals are conducted along the auditory nerve by two types of SGNs. The vast majority of SGNs are bipolar type I cells with large cell bodies connecting inner hair cells (IHCs) with the cochlear nuclei, whereas smaller type II neurons transmit APs from the outer hair cells (OHCs) <xref rid="pone.0079256-Spoendlin1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079256-Spoendlin2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Both types of cochlear neurons constitute the primary afferent input to the cochlear nucleus <xref rid="pone.0079256-Osen1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079256-Young2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> in the brainstem which represents the first central relay station in the ascending auditory pathway <xref rid="pone.0079256-Kandler1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Type II neurons are usually completely unmyelinated and have similar physiological properties in man and cat. However, standard type I cochlear neurons in humans are crucially different compared to that of other mammalians as their cell bodies as well as the pre- and post somatic segments lack myelin <xref rid="pone.0079256-Ota1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0079256-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079256-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). These human differences, together with varying diameters of the peripheral- and central processes <xref rid="pone.0079256-Felix1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079256-Liberman1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, which determine AP velocities, suggest a diversity in auditory signal conduction times along SGNs between man and cat.</p>

                  <p>(A) Type I cells, rectified: Myelinated segments are shown in gray. Excitable (active) membranes with high ion channel densities (red segments) in the peripheral terminal and in the nodes of Ranvier are needed for spike amplification. In contrast to feline cells, in man the pre- and postsomatic compartments are longer, the soma is larger and not myelinated and the peripheral as well as the central axons are longer. (B) According to Ohm's law the sum of all currents to the center of a compartment is zero. The currents are defined by extracellular potential V<sub>e</sub>, intracellular potential V<sub>i</sub>, membrane capacitance C<sub>m</sub>, membrane conductance G<sub>m</sub> and intracellular resistance R. Natural excitation by synaptic current from a hair cell ribbon synapse is simulated as current injection into the first compartment (peripheral terminal). In this case extracellular potentials V<sub>e</sub> are assumed to be zero. For nonmyelinated type II cells the same modeling approach was used with uniform ion channel densities as in the original Hodgkin-Huxley model and with constant compartment lengths in the axons. (C) The same neural pathway of a human type I cell model as used in <xref rid="pone.0079256-Rattay3" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> is placed over a cross section of a feline cochlea demonstrating a possible position of a scala tympani electrode relative to a target cell. The length relations are the same as in the rectified versions in A. Extracellular potentials are calculated for a homogeneous infinite medium which causes spherical isopotentials, indicated by dashed lines. Note that the cat soma is much closer to the electrode than the human one.</p>

              <p>The high conduction velocities of myelinated axons are based on the electrical properties of the internode, which is the part between two nodes of Ranvier. Assuming a conducted AP in an idealized internode (membrane capacity C = 0, membrane conductance Gm = 0) would cause the same temporal characteristics in the transmembrane voltage profile at both ends, i.e. the conducted AP is reduced in amplitude by intracellular resistance but the maxima at the beginning and end of the internode appear at the same time. This phenomenon, known as saltatory conduction <xref rid="pone.0079256-HUXLEY1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, requires only a very small capacitance. This is reached by many circumjacent myelin layers as C is inversely proportional to the number of myelin sheets covering the cells membranes <xref rid="pone.0079256-Rattay4" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. A spike propagation problem may arise in SGNs when the small inneraxonal current of the thin peripheral process has to load the large capacitance of an unmyelinated soma <xref rid="pone.0079256-Rattay3" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079256-Hossain1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, which represents the main barrier for an AP along the neural tract.</p>
              <p>A previously presented compartment model for cochlear neurons <xref rid="pone.0079256-Rattay3" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> was evaluated in this study in order to analyze the impact of myelination and morphometry on temporal features of signal conduction in cat and man. Important parameters for the velocity of spike conduction are the AP duration and its rise time. Different types of voltage-gated ion channels have been identified in SGN membranes based on rat and mouse data <xref rid="pone.0079256-Hossain1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079256-Yi1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, some with impact on the falling part of the spike or on accommodation and refractoriness <xref rid="pone.0079256-Negm1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. However most ion channel models for non-myelinated neural membrane segments in warm blooded animals, including one of SGN type II of mouse <xref rid="pone.0079256-Hossain1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, show AP durations longer than 1 ms <xref rid="pone.0079256-Hu1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079256-Rattay5" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. An example for shorter APs is the octopus cell in the cochlear nucleus <xref rid="pone.0079256-Golding1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> whose spikes are still of double duration of a SGN.</p>
              <p>In contrast to such membrane models, the original Hodgkin-Huxley model with a temperature fit to 27°C resulted in APs with a duration of 330 µs and a short rise time that was consistent with intracochlearly recorded SGN spikes of cats <xref rid="pone.0079256-Rattay3" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079256-Hartmann1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079256-Motz1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. In this paper we present the first modeling study that analyzes the temporal features of spike conduction along afferent SGNs of man and cat. Immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy imaging was performed to distinguish type I and II neurons and quantify process diameters of bipolar SGNs as well as myelination in cat and human cochleae. Major differences concerning the extent of myelination, morphometric characteristics and the length of the neural path between these two species were incorporated in our SGN model. In addition, computer simulation enables the analysis of functional effects of synaptic current strengths that differ essentially between type I and II neurons <xref rid="pone.0079256-Grant1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079256-Weisz1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.</p>

The emitted blue-green light was used to leverage the autofluorescence of the hematoxylin and eosin stained SGNs. Pixels sizes of the 3D-stacks were selected according to the Nyquist theorem resulting in the following resolution: x = 43 nm, y = 43 nm, z = 130 nm. In order to reduce the distortion created by the microscope and increase the quality of the quantitative analysis of the 3D-stacks, a theoretical point spread function was calculated for each image channel. These point spread functions were subsequently used to deconvolute the acquired image stacks using a non-blind maximum-likelihood image restoration algorithm <xref rid="pone.0079256-Holmes1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> over 40 iterations.</p>

Accordingly, each neuron was split up into compartments, either with an active membrane with original Hodgkin Huxley ion channel kinetics at 27°C, or as passive internodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079256-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Transmembrane resistances r<sub>m</sub> of internodes and myelinated somas were assumed to be constant and proportional to the number N of myelin layers (r<sub>m</sub> = N*1 kOhm/cm<sup>2</sup>) <xref rid="pone.0079256-Rattay3" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. The spiking of a target neuron was simulated by an electrical network, where the currents to the center of each compartment consist of a resistive and a capacitive current across the membrane as well as intracellular currents to the neighboring compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079256-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). The temporal profile of the transmembrane voltage of each compartment was computed by solving a system of four differential equations for compartments with an active membrane and by a single differential equation for the internode.

                <p>The standard model for a human type I SGN consisted of a myelinated somatic region with few membrane layers that separate the heavily myelinated peripheral and central processes. This structure was modeled as the following sequence of compartments: an unmyelinated distal terminal, followed by an internode and 5 node-internode combinations, a presomatic region (segmented into three compartments for computational accuracy), soma, postsomatic region, internode-node combinations of the central process and finally an unmyelinated central terminal. The standard value used for the inner diameter of the peripheral process was 1 µm. According to our morphometric findings, the central process diameter was always of double size. Soma was assumed as a sphere with 20 µm in diameter, all other parameters as in <xref rid="pone.0079256-Rattay3" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. The somatic region was assumed to be covered by three membrane layers. The standard model for a cat type I cell differed from the human case in relation to fewer and shorter internodes, lack of pre- and postsomatic unmyelinated segments, smaller soma diameter (15 µm) with 13 shielding myelin sheets covering the soma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079256-g001">Figure 1A</xref>).

                  <p>Type II cochlear neurons were identified using an anti-peripherin antibody. This neuron-specific intermediate filament protein is well known to be expressed in mammalian (including human) type II SGNs <xref rid="pone.0079256-Berglund1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0079256-Liu3" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref> enabling the identification of these small cochlear neurons using confocal microscopy. The middle cochlear regions showed highest density of peripherin positive type II neurons (5.53% of n = 995 analyzed neurons) followed by the apical (4.2% of n = 1000) and basal (4.05% of n = 1234 cells) regions. A total number of 147 cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0079256-t002">Table 2</xref>) were identified in cat cochleae as type II neurons, being positive for the peripherin protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079256-g002">Figure 2A &amp; B</xref>). This value represents 4.55% of all analyzed cat neurons. Moreover, type I and type II neurons of cats stained positive for TuJ1 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079256-g002">Figure 2</xref> A, B, TuJ1).</p>
                  <p>Four type II SGNs (2.72%, n = 147) were found to have fully myelinated cell bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079256-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). However, the vast majority of peripherin protein positive type II cells (97.28%) feature unmyelinated cell bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079256-g002">Figure 2B</xref>) as well as unmyelinated peripheral and central processes. One 3D-image stack of such a standard type II neuron was acquired during data analysis. The measured peripheral- and central process diameter of this neuron was d1 = 0.73 µm and d2 = 1.3 µm respectively, and was subsequently used in our computational model for further analysis.</p>
                  <p>The diameters of peripherin positive type II neurons were measured from deconvoluted 3D image stacks. Scrolling through the z-stack enabled the detection of the maximum diameter of the evaluated cell bodies, which was measured and used for statistical analysis. Type II neurons had a uniform soma diameter across all cochlear regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079256-g003">Figure 3A</xref>) with a maximum in the basal region (median (M)  = 10.29 µm), the smallest values with the largest variance (M = 9.68 µm) in the middle turn and M = 9.92 µm in the apical region.</p>

                  <p>All three analyzed cat specimens showed the highest proportion of SGNs that are type II neurons within the middle turn region reaching 5.44% (n = 515) in specimen 1, 6.61% (n = 121) in specimen 2 and 5.29% (n = 359) in specimen 3. The smallest percentages of type II cells were identified in the apical regions of specimen 1 and 3 (3.85%, n = 182; 4.2%, n = 262) whereas the minimum appeared in the basal region of specimen 2 (3.73%, n = 322). Notable is the size distribution of type II SGNs, where the largest cell bodies were found in the high frequency region in all analyzed specimens.</p>
                  <p>The largest type I SGNs were identified in the basal regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079256-g003">Figure 3C</xref>) of the analyzed cat specimens with a mean soma diameter of 15.81±2.03 µm (n = 537). Type I SGNs located in the middle turn reached a mean diameter of 13.74±3.25 µm (n = 284). The apical regions of the investigated cat cochleae contained the smallest type I neurons with a measured mean diameter of 13.41±2.29 µm (n = 427). Cell bodies of type I neurons located in the apical- and middle turn were found to be significantly smaller (p&lt;0.01, power = 1) compared to those from the basal region. We used an average diameter of 15 µm of these types of SGNs in our computer simulations since the mean diameter of all analyzed somas was determined to be 14.52±2.69 µm (n = 1248).</p>

                  <p>Analyzing data from three individual human cochleae, we found that 3.65% of n = 2983 type I neurons (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0079256-t002">Table 2</xref>) were surrounded by myelinating SGCs strongly positive for MBP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079256-g002">Figure 2</xref> C, D). The acquired confocal stacks revealed that the isolating myelin layers fully wrap around the cell somas without any gaps. Furthermore, the pre- and postsomatic segments of SGNs were similarly surrounded by myelin comparable to these neuronal units of other mammalians. The white arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079256-g002">Figure 2C</xref> highlight the MBP positive myelin layers of human type I SGNs. The merged image illustrates the myelinated cell bodies of human type I SGNs (TuJ1 positive) in contrast to the majority of unmyelinated SGNs.</p>
                  <p>The highest density of myelinated somas of n = 981 type I SGNs (4.28%) were identified in the middle turn, the minimum in the basal turns (3.25% of n = 1109 type I cells) and 3.47% of all analyzed cochlear type I neurons (n = 893) in the low frequency regions. The standard case of a human type II neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079256-g002">Figure 2C</xref>) has a fully unmyelinated cell body. Confocal 3D-stacks also showed the complete absence of myelin at the peripheral and central neurite (data not shown). In contrast to type II cells of cat, human type II SGNs were not positive for TuJ1 – protein. Solely type I - SGNs are strongly positive for this neuron-specific class III beta-tubulin.</p>
                  <p>A total number of 60 peripherin positive SGNs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0079256-t002">Table 2</xref>) were identified representing 2.01% of all analyzed human neurons (n = 2983). The highest incidence of type II cells was found in the middle turn (2.96%), followed by apical turns (1.68%) and the high frequency basal regions (1.44%). Interestingly, two type II neurons representing 3.34% (n = 60) were found to be surrounded by myelinating SGCs (strongly MBP positive) wrapping myelin around the cell body as well as their processes. Again, the white arrow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079256-g002">Figure 2D</xref>) depicts a type II cell body positive for the peripherin protein. The merged image illustrates this cell and its surrounding myelin (red color). Additionally, white arrow heads point to myelinated type I cell bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079256-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). However, the standard type II neuron in the human inner ear completely lacks myelin. 3D image acquisition was performed on one type II cell with an unmyelinated cell body and processes. The evaluated process diameters used in our computational model are d1 = 0.65 µm and d2 = 1.4 µm. The median diameters of human type II somata from all specimens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079256-g003">Figure 3B</xref>) were relatively constant with a maximum (M = 9.55 µm) found in the high frequency basal region, M = 9.39 µm in the middle turn and the smallest value (M = 9.13 µm) in the apical region. The calculated mean values in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0079256-t002">table 2</xref> identifies the largest diameters of type II cells in the middle turns, a region of prime importance for speech recognition <xref rid="pone.0079256-Hollien1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>.

The part of the central neurite that connects directly to the cell body totally lacks myelin. Myelination of the neurite starts here after approximately 7 µm (highlighted by the white arrow head) away from the soma.</p>

                  <p>Individual differences in incidence, myelination, soma- and neurite diameter in type II neurons are summarized as followed (data not shown). The middle turn of specimen 1 and specimen 2 contained the highest densities of type II neurons (1.96% of n = 255 and 1.46% of n = 274 analyzed cells respectively) as well as myelinated SGNs (4.71% and 5.11% respectively). In specimen 3, the maximum density of type II cells (5.41% of n = 148 evaluated neurons) and myelinated cells (5.41%) were both located within the apical regions. A surprising observation was the complete absence of type II neurons in the basal region of specimen 2 (n = 351 cochlear neurons) and its rare appearance in the basal (0.77% of n = 260 cells) and apical region (0.69% of n = 433 analyzed bipolar neurons) of specimen 1.</p>

By analyzing clinical computer tomography data (one example is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079256-g005">Figure 5A</xref>) of three human individuals (n = 6; right and left ear), we determined an average SGN length of 32.35±1.45 mm. Evaluation of manually segmented right and left auditory nerves of three domestic cats (n = 6) resulted in an average length of 15.81±0.39 mm, which is half the length compared to human cochlear neurons. For better comparison of spike conduction times, the lengths of type I and II cochlear neurons were assumed to be the same.</p>

                <p>The first characteristic phase, denoted as postsynaptic delay t1, is crucially influenced by the amplitude of an injected current pulse appropriate to simulate the synaptic SGN excitation by an IHC. For a 1 µm diameter myelinated peripheral process, a 100 pA square pulse caused a postsynaptic delay t1 = 133 µs for model data as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079256-g008">Figure 8A</xref>. Using a stimulus intensity comparable to recorded synaptic currents in rat, our simulations proposed a shorter postsynaptic delay in the order of 100 µs. The delay t1 does not include the neurotransmitter release from the hair cell and the diffusion across the synaptic cleft. In man and cat simulations demonstrated nearly the same short postsynaptic delays for type I SGNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079256-g008">Figure 8A, B</xref>). In contrast to the assumptions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079256-g008">Figure 8C</xref> essentially longer postsynaptic delays are expected in type II cells. This phenomenon is analyzed below.</p>
                <p>The second and fourth phases denote the spike conduction times t2 and t4 in either the peripheral or the central process. A linear distance-time relationship is shown by each of the blue velocity vectors of the propagating APs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079256-g008">Figure 8</xref>, demonstrating constant propagation velocities v1 and v2 in the peripheral and central axons, respectively. By evaluation of the shifted blue velocity vectors in the left graph in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079256-g008">Figure 8A</xref> we found that the AP requires 156 µs to travel 1 mm in the 1 µm thick peripheral process and almost half of this time, 75 µs, in the central axon that has double the diameter. Using the computed data of the longer central process of the human type I cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079256-g008">Fig. 8A</xref>, d2 = 2 µm, v2 = 13.33 mm/ms), this quite linear velocity-diameter relationship for the well wrapped myelinated fibers is fitted by<disp-formula id="pone.0079256.e001"><graphic xlink:href="pone.0079256.e001.jpg" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula>wherein the factor 6.66 has the dimension <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0079256.e002.jpg"/></inline-formula> to match dimensional correctness.</p>
                <p>The third phase, denoted by the presomatic delay t3, essentially depends on the axial current flow from the peripheral process required to load the somatic capacitance. Thus t3 is influenced by the size and degree of myelination at the somatic region. Reducing the soma diameter in 5 µm steps resulted in a decreased delay of 22 µs per step.</p>

                <p>The presomatic delay of 212 µs in human (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079256-g008">Figure 8A</xref>) is shorter than previously reported by Rattay et al. <xref rid="pone.0079256-Rattay3" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. The reason is a reduction of surface and capacity at the soma by a factor 4/9 when the diameter is decreased from 30 µm <xref rid="pone.0079256-Rattay3" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> to an average value of 20 µm which is close to the average size of our morphometric data <xref rid="pone.0079256-Potrusil1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. The same effect occurs when the soma is further reduced to 15 µm which is the average value of cat type I cells. The higher number of myelin layers is even more influential since the somatic capacity decreases inversely with the number of covering membrane/myelin sheets. The human soma was simulated with 3 layers, and that of the cat with 13 layers. Thus the capacity of the myelinated cat soma is reduced by the factor (3/13)*(9/16)  = 0.13. Further arguments for the vastly short 52 µs presomatic delay in cat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079256-g008">Figure 8B</xref>) are given below.</p>
                <p>Simulated spike propagation along a type I SGN is shown for man and cat in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079256-g008">Figure 8A and B</xref>. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079256-g008">Figure 8B</xref> the vertical distances of the voltage profiles are markedly shorter since the internodes are assumed to be shorter in cat than in man, although the model fiber diameters are the same. In spite of shortening the internodal lengths, the calculated conduction velocities are almost the same in both cases. Reduction of the internodal length of the central process from 500 µm in man to 350 µm in cat causes a v2 increase &lt;1% from 13.33 to 13.44 mm/ms. Such small influences of the internodal length on the AP conduction velocity in homogeneous myelinated axons are also expected in other modeling work <xref rid="pone.0079256-Moore1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>.</p>
                <p>The velocities v1 and v2 are diameter dependent, and they are evaluated with the same <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0079256.e001">equation (1</xref>) for cat and man. However, the cat peripheral process has only 3 nodes of Ranvier and evaluation of the velocity/diameter ratio is less precise in comparison to human because uniformity of signal conduction is disturbed at both ends of this short axonal segment.</p>
                <p>Spike conduction times for several diameters and different numbers of myelin layers enwrapping the somatic region (nmsoma) are listed in the upper part of <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0079256-t004">Table 4</xref>. Note that for the postsynaptic delay a constant value of 100 µs is assumed for all cases. The presented values of the presomatic delay t3 are computed for a soma diameter of 20 µm in man. When the number of membrane layers is increased to 11 we calculated a 0.12 ms reduction of this delay compared to the unmyelinated situation with 1 layer. Since this delay t3 is also dependent on the diameter of the soma, the rising ratio of presomatic delay has been calculated for increasing the soma diameter with 1 µm steps. For standard type I neuron with 3 membrane layers around the soma (plasma membrane of SGN and 2 membranes of SGC) increasing the diameter to 21 µm resulted in a 4.3 µs increase of t3 (compare right column in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0079256-t004">Table 4</xref>). These linear relations hold for human soma diameters ranging from 10 to 30 µm when the soma is connected with a peripheral myelinated process with d1 = 1 µm in diameter. Doubled diameter d1 = 2 µm causes stronger axial currents and the presomatic delay decreases from 211+4.3 µs to 125+3.2 µs for the 20 µm standard soma with 3 layers (t3 column in the upper part of <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0079256-t004">Table 4</xref>).</p>

                    <p>The diagram summarizes results from <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0079256-t004">Table 4</xref>, indicating the impact of axon diameters, soma size and myelin on the arrival time under the assumption d2 = 2*d1 (central axon has doubled diameter of the peripheral process). The spike arrival time scale at the right side shows the total signal conduction time of type I cells for different axon diameters (marked by colors) for small somas (d = 20 µm, thick vectors) and large somas (d = 25 µm, thin vectors). All these cases are simulated with 3 sheets of membranes around the soma (nmsoma = 3) with the exception of the gray vectors (nmsoma = 1) which represent the slowest cases of type I cells. The fastest signal conduction in man (1.522 ms; d1 = 2 µm, dsoma = 20 µm; purple thick vector) is toped by the shorter cat type I cell (green vector). The main part of the figure shows the four phases in SGN signal transduction as distance – time diagrams. All vectors for type I cells start with the same synaptic delay of 100 µs. The lowest vector (purple, d1 = 2 µm) is shifted vertically (according to the presomatic delay) and flattened (because velocity v2 = 2*v1) when the spike arrives at the soma (black vertical arrow). All other vectors have the same characteristic shapes with individual slopes and individual shifts at soma. Note that the vertical time shift at the soma increases when axon diameter decreases. Increase of soma diameter causes an additional delay indicated by the vertical distance between corresponding thin and thick vectors. The slow AP conductance of unmyelinated type II cells (green dashed vector) is obvious: the short presomatic delay (beyond graphical resolution) cannot compensate the 800 µs lasting synaptic delay. The process diameter enlargement at the soma position (d2 = 2*d1) is not as effective as in the myelinated cases. Angles between v2 and v1 slopes (green circle arrows) point out small velocity changes (small velocity ratio v2/v1) in unmyelinated type II neurons (upper green circle) compared to type I ganglion cells (lower green circle arrows).</p>

                <p>Therefore the greatest advantage of fast signaling in myelinated cat SGNs (in comparison to the human case) results from the shorter auditory nerve (15.81 mm in cat vs. 32.35 mm in man), followed by a smaller presomatic delay due to myelinization and smaller soma surfaces. Another anatomical difference in typical type I SGN favors the fast signaling in cat. The pre- as well as the postsomatic region in human are unmyelinated segments whereas in cat the soma is assumed to be between two nodes of Ranvier <xref rid="pone.0079256-Rattay3" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079256-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Spike conductance in the rather long unmyelinated presomatic segment in human is slow and causes an additional delay which is shown in t3 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0079256-t004">Table 4</xref>). This reduced velocity in unmyelinated axons explains why the 52 µs t3 delay for cat (last row in upper part of <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0079256-t004">Table 4</xref> for d1 = 1 µm, nmsoma = 13, dsoma = 15) is much shorter as expected by extrapolation of the 166 µs t3 value for man (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0079256-t004">Table 4</xref>, row 4 for d1 = 1 µm, nmsoma = 11, dsoma = 20) since a reduced soma diameter of 15 µm only causes a delay reduction of 5*2.2 = 11 µs.</p>

                <p>Spike conduction in unmyelinated fibers requires larger intracellular current flow because of missing the isolating internodal segments of myelinated axons. The lack of myelin sheets causes vastly larger capacities of the fiber resulting in essentially slower conduction velocities. Comparing myelinated and unmyelinated SGNs in cat, the greater somatic capacity in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079256-g008">Figure 8B</xref> is more than compensated by the much stronger axial current flow supplied by presomatic regions. This current increase results from the uniform active membrane of the peripheral unmyelinated process which is more efficient for loading the soma capacity compared to the contribution from sparsely distributed active nodes of Ranvier in myelinated fibers. Consequently a negligibly small presomatic delay of 18 µs is predicted by our model evaluations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079256-g008">Figure 8C</xref>).</p>
                <p>Still, in comparison with myelinated axons, conduction velocity is vastly slower. Spike conduction requires 456 µs and 719 µs for 1 mm in the peripheral and central process, respectively, resulting in v1 = 1.4 mm/ms and v2 = 2.19 mm/ms (blue vectors in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079256-g008">Figure 8C</xref>, bottom).

This may be explained by irregularities in spike initiation at the beginning of each axonal section. Spike conduction times for the same process and soma diameters in cat and man are expected to differ only because of different process lengths (lower part of <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0079256-t004">Table 4</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0079256-t004">Table 4</xref> demonstrates that the slow afferent signaling from OHCs is based on a lack of myelin and, second, on an extreme long postsynaptic delay t1.

In man, the corresponding neuronal structure transmits the electrical signal 4.5 times faster from the hair cell to the cochlear nucleus.</p>

The spatial distribution of synaptic contacts within the terminal causes an additional irregular delay component in t1 for the signal propagation within this segment.

              <p>A vast majority of human SGNs (96.35%) are embedded in a continuous, honeycomb structure formed by satellite glial cells <xref rid="pone.0079256-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> representing the standard case of type I cells. Thus, each unmyelinated type I cell body is encapsulated by at least one cellular layer of a satellite glial cell <xref rid="pone.0079256-Ota1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> resulting in two additional membranes. This micro-anatomical peculiarity is interpreted as nmsoma = 3 for our standard cochlear type I neuron. The assumed nmsoma = 11 for the myelinated case is based on 4 and 17 (mean = 10.5) myelin layers enwrapping the cell bodies <xref rid="pone.0079256-Ota1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. This group and Arnold <xref rid="pone.0079256-Arnold1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref> report that the myelin sheaths were observed to be compact, loose or semicompact, although the loose form was most common.</p>

This relationship may also be valid for type II neurons even though the respective diameters (of only one cell) were determined to be half the size compared to type I neurons.

Shorter spikes are reported from octopus cells in the ventral cochlear nucleus <xref rid="pone.0079256-Golding1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, but the SGN spikes are even shorter. The time to peak and the duration of an AP depend on the types of ion channels, their kinetics and densities, the membrane capacitance and other parameters. Although many relevant details are known for mammalian SGN membranes, as yet there is no accurate cable model available which matches the AP shape of type I cells. In our model we fitted temporal spike characteristics by changing two parameters of the original HH model, temperature and ion channel density. Another approach for a HH type model is to assume that channels expressed on soma are identical, but differ in density in the processes. The channel densities can be fitted to <italic>in vivo</italic> recordings <xref rid="pone.0079256-Michel1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>. An appropriate short and rapidly increasing AP as simulated with our model is a key element for the quick signal conduction in the afferent part of the auditory nerve. The short spikes and the fit of the formula for axon conduction velocity of type I cells (Eq. 1) to experimental findings on peripheral myelinated axons (see below) underlines closer electrophysiological affinity of SGNs to the peripheral nerve system than to the central one.</p>

                <title>Simulated conduction times correlate with ABR</title>
                <p>The simulated spike conduction times for afferent signal transmission can be evaluated with auditory brainstem response (ABR) data as time difference between the peaks of wave I and wave III. Esteves et al. <xref rid="pone.0079256-Esteves1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref> reported corresponding ABR interpeak times of 2.13±0.14 ms (n = 120 ears) in normal hearing human subjects. Van den Honert and Stypulkowski <xref rid="pone.0079256-vandenHonert2" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref> analyzed ABR recordings of 10 normal hearing cats and reported a mean signal latency between waves I and III of 1.41±0.1 ms. According to our model, the corresponding values in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0079256-t004">Table 4</xref> are 2.13 ms for a peripheral process diameter d1 = 1.4 µm (man) and 1.40 ms for d1 = 1 µm (cat). Whereas the cat data match almost perfectly, our systematic morphometric evaluation from human specimens rely on the d1 = 1.3 µm case which predicts a 150 µs longer conduction time of 2.28 ms.</p>
                <p>Closer examination of the cat data (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0079256-t003">Table 3</xref>) shows that the systematic diameter evaluation in cat deviates from the d2/d1 = 2 relation used in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0079256-t004">Table 4</xref>. Reducing d2 from 2 µm to 1.8 µm demands for a 10% reduction of velocity v2 (Eq. 2) and a 10% increase of t4 according to <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0079256-t004">Table 4</xref>, leading to an additional delay of 112 µs. A possible explanation for this discrepancy between spike conduction times and ABR interpeak times may be found with the help of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079256-g007">Figure 7</xref> where the conducted spike is recorded within the cochlea. Although the recording electrode is close to the thin peripheral process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079256-g001">Figure 1C</xref>) the main contribution in the recorded signal appears when the spike passes the soma region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079256-g007">Figure 7</xref>). This activity should contribute more to the peak I in ABR recordings than the excitation of the peripheral axon. ABR peak III should be generated when the spike arrives at the increased surface of excited membranes in the branching central SGN terminals causing synaptic activation in the cochlear nuclei.</p>
                <p>Electrically evoked ABRs from cochlear implantees were analyzed recently <xref rid="pone.0079256-Undurraga1" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>. Poststimulus latencies of peak III were shorter for anodic pulses and they clustered at about 2 ms. In most of the reported cases spike initiation can be assumed within the central axon at a site close to the soma. This 2 ms delay which is similar to the interpeak time III - I recorded in healthy people <xref rid="pone.0079256-Esteves1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref> supports a hypothesis derived from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079256-g007">Figure 7D</xref> where it is seen that the second peak exceeds the contribution of the thin peripheral process. This effect is assumed to be more pronounced in human type I cells because of the higher current flux across the active membrane in the larger presomatic compartment. Therefore, peak I in healthy people may represent the large sodium current influx when the spike enters the nonmyelinated presomatic region.</p>

                <title>How myelin accelerates signaling</title>
                <p>The examples in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079256-g008">Figure 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0079256-t004">Table 4</xref> suggest two types of acceleration of signal conduction by myelin, namely at the axons and in the soma region. The values t2 and t4 in the upper and lower part of <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0079256-t004">Table 4</xref> demonstrate the rapid conduction of myelinated fibers compared to the non-myelinated. The factor 6.66 for the linear relation between axon diameter and simulated velocity (Eq. 1) is quite close to 6.57, which is the corresponding scaling factor for small diameter myelinated axons as reported by Boyd and Kalu <xref rid="pone.0079256-Boyd1" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>, who found an average value of 4.6 for v/D. Incorporating an inner/outer fiber diameter ratio d/D = 0.7, the equivalent scaling factor is 4.6/0.7 = 6.57.</p>
                <p>Reduction of myelin layers and the markedly bigger diameter of the soma are the reason for a notable capacity enlargement resulting in a distinct presomatic delay for bipolar cochlear neurons in man. This delay is smallest for non-myelinated cells with a small diameter ratio of soma / peripheral process, e.g. 18 µs for type II cells (t3 in the lower part of <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0079256-t004">Table 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079256-g008">Figure 8C</xref>) but increases for human type I cells to 286 µs (d1 = 1 µm, dsoma = 20 µm, nmsoma = 1; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0079256-t004">Table 4</xref>) and even higher delays are expected for large somata (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079256-g009">Figure 9</xref>)<xref rid="pone.0079256-Rattay3" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. According to observations of Spoendlin <xref rid="pone.0079256-Spoendlin2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> there is a single node of Ranvier in the vicinity of the cat soma. Biophysical modeling demonstrates the need for a considerably longer active membrane length of the presomatic segment in cases of poorly myelinated somata (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079256-g004">Figure 4B</xref>) in order to provide enough inneraxonal current to load the capacity of the cell membrane. The length of this presomatic nonmyelinated segment was not systematically determined, but it is always considerably longer than a node of Ranvier, e.g. Ota and Kimura <xref rid="pone.0079256-Ota1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> measured 5–26 µm long presomatic segments in human type I cells.</p>
                <p>Our auditory nerve model confirmed that the conduction velocity of a uniformly myelinated axon is proportional to the diameter but it is rather independent from the internodal length <xref rid="pone.0079256-Moore1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. However, signal amplitude is smaller in the internode than in the voltage amplifying node. This phenomenon is especially evident in human type I cells at the last internode before the presomatic section. In contrast to the myelinated cat soma, the weak inneraxonal current causes a remarkable presomatic delay and endangers signal propagation. Two or more cell bodies of human SGNs sometimes comprise a common insulation by glial cells. Within such a cluster a close contact of somatic cell membranes is evident. Tylstedt and Rask-Andersen <xref rid="pone.0079256-Tylstedt1" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref> speculate whether unique formations between such human SGCs may constitute interactive electrotonic or ephaptic transmission pathways. These may increase neural synchrony and signal acuity related to the coding of speech. This hypothesis will be tested in a forthcoming paper as well as our suggestion that clusters could also work as filters in order to suppress spontaneous spikes without acoustic signal information.</p>

Contrary to natural hearing, cochlea implants initiate spikes at different sites along SGNs <xref rid="pone.0079256-Javel1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0079256-Rattay3" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> which depends on the degree of preservation of cochlear neurons <xref rid="pone.0079256-Nadol2" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0079256-Glueckert1" ref-type="bibr">[70]</xref>. The resulting temporal mismatch within a population of excited cells is mainly caused by simultaneous AP initiations in peripheral and central axons. As an example, the presented biophysical model predicts the lower threshold in cat for cathodic pulses but in man for anodic ones <xref rid="pone.0079256-Rattay3" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, which was assumed to be the same in both species but model results have been confirmed by implantees <xref rid="pone.0079256-Macherey1" ref-type="bibr">[71]</xref>. This study has shown that the differences between the cat and human SGNs, for example a considerably longer human presomatic delay, should be incorporated into auditory nerve models that rely on the data from the cat when investigating speech processing strategies for cochlea implant recipients.</p>
