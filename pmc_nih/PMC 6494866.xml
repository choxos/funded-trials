                <p id="Par1">Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) has been implicated in symptoms associated with functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs), though mechanisms remain poorly defined and treatment involves non-specific antibiotics. Here we show that SIBO based on duodenal aspirate culture reflects an overgrowth of anaerobes, does not correspond with patient symptoms, and may be a result of dietary preferences. Small intestinal microbial composition, on the other hand, is significantly altered in symptomatic patients and does not correspond with aspirate culture results. In a pilot interventional study we found that switching from a high fiber diet to a low fiber, high simple sugar diet triggered FGID-related symptoms and decreased small intestinal microbial diversity while increasing small intestinal permeability. Our findings demonstrate that characterizing small intestinal microbiomes in patients with gastrointestinal symptoms may allow a more targeted antibacterial or a diet-based approach to treatment.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="Par3">The human gut microbiome has emerged as an important factor in the pathogenesis of functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorders (FGIDs). Its role in modulating important physiological processes such as GI motility and secretion, maintenance of epithelial barrier integrity, and its role in communication between the gut and the central nervous system may underlie its contribution to symptoms associated with FGIDs such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. The majority of microbiome studies focus on stool, which is broadly reflective of the GI microbiome, and the colonic mucosa, where microbes may play a role in triggering inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. The small intestinal microbiome, however, remains relatively unexplored in most GI disorders including FGIDs. This is relevant, as a quantitative increase in the small intestinal bacteria, characterized as small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), has been implicated in symptoms associated with FGIDs, though mechanisms underlying this effect remain poorly defined.</p>
              <p id="Par4">Few studies have attempted to characterize the small intestinal microbiota, primarily owing to the difficulty in accessing the small intestine and lower microbial density that makes it difficult to obtain sufficient bacterial DNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Recent studies comparing small bowel mucosal microbiota (obtained via either Watson capsule biopsy or enteroscopy with biopsy) in IBS patients and healthy volunteers in Sweden and in Taiwan found either no changes or IBS-associated increases in <italic>Prevotella spp</italic>., respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. There are additional small studies that have characterized the small intestinal microbial composition using ileostomy effluent samples that allow for easier collection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, but are not necessarily reflective of normal small intestinal microbiota. The ileum primarily serves as a reservoir<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> and exhibits significant differences in motor function when compared with the upper small intestine, which acts as a conduit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> with little stasis and lower bacterial counts. The bolus transport in the duodenum, however, may be decreased or associated with retrograde bolus transfer events in diabetic gastroparesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par5">SIBO is implicated in driving GI symptoms such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, and bloating; the gold standard test for SIBO is a duodenal aspirate culture to measure microbial density in the duodenum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. SIBO is currently defined as ≥ 10<sup>5</sup> CFU/mL (colony-forming units per ml) on aspirate culture, based on the initial description in Billroth II anatomy patients with stagnant loop syndrome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. This has been extrapolated for the diagnosis of SIBO in other conditions. This approach to diagnosis is limited by the inability to differentiate disease-promoting microbes from potentially beneficial microbes and the inability to sample microbes in different regions of the small intestine. There is wide variability in antibiotic treatment response among patients diagnosed with SIBO, a potential worsening of GI symptoms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> with antibiotics, and though some data do exist<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, there are few robust randomized controlled trials assessing the efficacy of specific antibiotics for SIBO<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par6">Recent advances in next-generation sequencing have significantly improved our ability to characterize complex microbial communities and determine changes in microbiota composition and function that may contribute to disease states such as IBS where microbiota changes are associated with symptoms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Diet is a key driver of gut microbial composition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> and is also thought to have a role in FGIDs like IBS. A high-fiber diet has been associated with improvement in symptoms in IBS, based on systematic review and meta-analyses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. However, dietary influence, such as with fiber supplementation, on the small intestinal microbiome has not been studied.</p>
              <p id="Par7">In this work, we characterized the small intestinal microbiota of patients with GI symptoms undergoing testing for SIBO. We found significant alteration in the small intestinal microbial composition especially in a subset of symptomatic patients. The alteration indicated potential consequences for the functional capacity of the small intestinal microbiome specifically with regard to processing of dietary carbohydrate and fiber. SIBO, however, did not correlate with patient symptoms and was also seen in healthy individuals consuming a high-fiber diet. In a pilot intervention study performed subsequently in healthy individuals consuming a high fiber diet, we found a short-term switch to low-fiber diet leads to change in intestinal permeability and appearance of GI symptoms associated with a change in microbial diversity. Our findings suggest that characterizing the small intestinal microbial composition is important as it may allow a more-targeted antibiotic approach in symptomatic patients. At the same time, relying on quantitative culture of small intestinal aspirates alone may not be sufficient as these results may be influenced by diet.</p>

                <title>Duodenal aspirate cultures do not correlate with patient symptoms</title>
                <p id="Par8">We evaluated 126 symptomatic (21% male; age 15–89 years, median 55 years) patients who underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with duodenal aspirate collection; the major symptoms that led to investigation of small bowel bacterial counts included diarrhea (45%), abdominal pain (28%), and bloating (13%). A concomitant organic diagnosis was only noted in a minority of patients and included celiac disease (<italic>n</italic> <italic>=</italic> 14), microscopic colitis (<italic>n</italic> <italic>=</italic> 6), ulcerative colitis (<italic>n</italic> <italic>=</italic> 5), and pancreatic insufficiency (<italic>n</italic> <italic>=</italic> 5). In total, 27 (21.4%) patients underwent some form of GI surgery. These surgeries included Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (<italic>n</italic> <italic>=</italic> 4), ileocolonic valve resection (<italic>n</italic> <italic>=</italic> 5), small or large bowel resection (<italic>n</italic> <italic>=</italic> 11), pancreatectomy (<italic>n</italic> <italic>=</italic> 3), or partial or full gastrectomy (<italic>n</italic> <italic>=</italic> 2). The surgeries were not mutually exclusive.</p>
                <p id="Par9">Of the 126 patients, 66 (52%) tested positive for SIBO, whereas 60 patients (48%) tested negative for SIBO. Among the 66 who tested positive, 49 were positive for anaerobic bacterial overgrowth and 17 were positive for mixed anaerobic and aerobic overgrowth. None were positive for aerobic bacterial overgrowth alone. All healthy individuals tested negative for SIBO.</p>
                <p id="Par10">Interestingly, there was a positive correlation between SIBO and recent antibiotic exposure (odds ratio of 4.2; 95% CI: 1.05–24.3; <italic>p</italic> = 0.028, Fisher’s exact test). There was no correlation between SIBO and any indication for testing (<italic>p</italic> = 0.19, Fisher’s exact test with Monte Carlo simulation, 10,000 replicates), age, GI surgery, or proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) use (all <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.1, Fisher’s exact test).</p>

                <title>Duodenal aspirate microbiome is altered in symptomatic patients</title>
                <p id="Par11">We determined the 16 S rRNA-based microbial community composition in duodenal aspirates from the patients with GI symptoms (<italic>n</italic> = 126; Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">1</xref>) and compared them with the microbial compositions of similarly collected duodenal aspirates from healthy volunteers (<italic>n</italic> = 38; 30% male; age 19–60 years, median 43 years).</p>
                <p id="Par12">Significant differences were observed in phylogenetic unweighted UniFrac-based (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA); Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>) and non-phylogenetic Bray–Curtis-based (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, PERMANOVA; Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>) beta diversity between small intestinal microbial communities from symptomatic patients and healthy volunteers.

                <p id="Par13">Next, the primary microbial determinants responsible for the difference in small intestinal microbial composition in symptomatic patients were identified. We used Random Forest classification on the operational taxonomic unit (OTU)-level abundances to develop a symptom index (SI) model for microbial differences associated with symptomatic patients. The resulting index is the out-of-bag (OOB) predicted probability of symptomatic patient group membership; i.e., on a scale of 0 to 1, scores approaching 1 indicate high probability of a microbial community associated with GI symptoms. The SI differentiates symptomatic patients from healthy individuals (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>), supported by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis (area under the curve = 0.896, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; 95% C.I.: 0.844–0.949, DeLong). Boruta selection yields 26 OTUs that significantly contribute to the classification (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). To determine whether patient characteristics contribute to changes in microbial composition we examined the clinical metadata obtained from patient medical health records. Advanced age, antibiotic use, history of GI surgery, and PPI use were found to be significantly associated with the SI (false discovery rate (FDR) <italic>q</italic> &lt; 0.1, linear regression) and these four clinical factors together explain ~12.7% of variance (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>) in the SI across all samples (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c–f</xref>), whereas sex, body mass index (BMI), and SIBO were not significantly associated with SI.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Symptom index differentiates healthy controls from patients with GI symptoms. <bold>a</bold> Symptom index indicating the probability (0–1) of being classified in the symptomatic patient group determined using Random Forests classification based on the individuals’ OTU profiles. <bold>b</bold> Tukey boxplots show differences in relative abundance of the 26 OTUs among symptomatic patients (<italic>n</italic> = 126, blue) and healthy controls (<italic>n</italic> = 38, red) that significantly contribute to the Random Forest classification performance based on Boruta feature selection (boxplots show the median with IQR and 1.5 IQR whiskers).

                <title>A subset of symptomatic patients have small intestinal microbial dysbiosis</title>
                <p id="Par14">We found notable heterogeneity in the small intestinal microbial composition of symptomatic patients and a subset of patients appear compositionally distinct from healthy individuals in beta diversity plots (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a, b</xref>). To further explore this observation, we re-classified samples from symptomatic patients as being healthy-like or dysbiotic based on their Aitchison distance to healthy small intestinal microbial communities using the CLOUD neighborhood method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. This classification scheme identified 37/38 (97%) healthy volunteers as “healthy-like”, whereas 89 (71%) symptomatic patient communities were found to be healthy-like and 37 (29%) were found to be dysbiotic (based on distance from healthy, Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). These groupings were comparable to those achieved by spectral clustering (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). The log-transformed CLOUD statistic for each sample defines the sample’s “dysbiosis index” (DI) score (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). Boruta feature selection identified 23 genus-level taxa that contribute significantly to the DI, mostly by their relative absence from dysbiotic communities (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). We also found a significantly higher DI score in patients &gt; 50 years old and those with history of antibiotic use, PPI use, or GI surgery (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, <italic>t-</italic> test; Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2A–D</xref>), consistent with factors that contributed to the SI. In addition, there was a significant negative correlation between DI score and phylogenetic diversity, richness, and evenness (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001, Pearson correlation; Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d–f</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Dysbiosis index identifies a subset of symptomatic patients with altered microbial communities. <bold>a</bold> Classification of healthy and symptomatic patients as dysbiotic or healthy-like based on the CLOUD test, which evaluates each sample by its distance to healthy controls’ microbiome distribution. <bold>b</bold> The log-transformed CLOUD statistic for samples (or dysbiosis index (DI)) from healthy controls (<italic>n</italic> = 38, red) and symptomatic patients (<italic>n</italic> = 126, blue).

                <p id="Par15">We compared the microbial composition of symptomatic patients with and without SIBO and found that SIBO does not correlate with small intestinal dysbiosis (<italic>p</italic> = 0.33, Fisher’s exact test of culture result vs. dysbiosis classification; Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). This suggests that some symptomatic patients diagnosed with SIBO in fact have an overabundance of bacteria normally found in healthy microbial communities, whereas others who do not have SIBO based on quantitative assessment have dysbiosis as defined here. There are no significant differences in alpha or beta diversity among symptomatic patients with and without reported SIBO (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3A–D</xref>).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Quantitative small bowel culture does not reflect small bowel microbial composition.

                <title>Imputed microbial functional pathways suggest differences in diet</title>
                <p id="Par16">To determine the functional changes associated with differences in microbial composition, gut microbial function was imputed from the 16 S rRNA-based microbial composition using PICRUSt and pathway analysis. Differential predicted genes/pathways were determined using LEfSe (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4A, B</xref>). Pathways reflective of oxidative stress such as ascorbate and aldarate metabolism and biosynthesis of siderophores were enriched in symptomatic patients, consistent with previous reports in dysbiosis. Interestingly, pathways associated with simple sugar metabolism were enriched in symptomatic patients, whereas complex carbohydrate degradation pathways were more prevalent in healthy individuals. Patients’ dietary histories were not available as these samples were obtained directly from the clinical microbiology laboratory but the increased prevalence of <italic>Prevotella</italic> and the enrichment of complex carbohydrate degradation pathways are suggestive of a higher fiber intake in healthy individuals while simple sugar metabolism pathways found in symptomatic patients may reflect a higher dietary intake of simple sugars. These data alone do not provide sufficient evidence to support the role of diet-related changes in small intestinal microbiome in causing GI symptoms, but do support this hypothesis. To better address this, a pilot dietary intervention study was performed.</p>

                <p id="Par17">As GI symptoms were associated with decreased prevalence of <italic>Prevotella</italic> and potentially increased consumption of simple sugars, we next tested if a dietary change from a high-fiber diet to a high simple-sugar diet can trigger symptoms in a microbiota-dependent manner. Healthy individuals consuming baseline high fiber diets ( &gt; 11 g/1000 cal; Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>) were identified and duodenal aspirates were obtained for quantitative culture and small intestinal microbial community profiling using 16 S rRNA gene sequencing. Despite being asymptomatic, 8/16 (50%) subjects on a baseline high-fiber diet tested positive for SIBO by the standard culture criteria described above. Microbial community profiles were obtained from only 15 of the 16 participants after quality control and filtering of sequencing data. All subjects had a microbial community composition representative of a “healthy-like” community (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). The small bowel microbial communities of these high fiber-consuming healthy individuals clustered with the healthy individuals previously tested (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>) based on the Aitchison beta diversity for each sample regardless of presence or absence of SIBO. The symptomatic patient microbiomes show wider distribution as noted previously. Accompanying boxplots show the distribution of principal coordinate 1, which accounts for 46% of the variance in data, further supporting the conclusion that duodenal microbiome significantly distinguishes healthy and symptomatic individuals (<italic>q</italic> &lt; 0.0001, pairwise <italic>t</italic> test with FDR correction; Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>), but does not distinguish presence or absence of SIBO among healthy or symptomatic individuals (<italic>q</italic> &gt; 0.25, pairwise <italic>t-</italic> test with FDR correction; Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>). This suggests that healthy individuals can have SIBO without any symptoms or alterations in microbial composition. There are no significant differences in small intestinal microbial alpha or beta diversity or microbial taxa among the healthy subjects with and without SIBO. Therefore, SIBO as currently defined may also result from dietary preferences, such as high fiber consumption, as shown here.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>A subset of healthy individuals consuming high-fiber diet have SIBO. <bold>a</bold> DI and <bold>b</bold> distribution based on Aitchison distance of healthy controls without SIBO (green), symptomatic patients with (red) and without (orange) SIBO, and healthy individuals consuming a high fiber diet with (blue) and without (green) SIBO. ****, <italic>q</italic> &lt; 0.0001; n.s., <italic>q</italic> &gt; 0.05; pairwise <italic>t-</italic> test with FDR correction</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41467_2019_9964_Fig5_HTML" id="d29e1112"/></fig></p>

                <title>Short-term diet change alters microbial diversity and triggers GI symptoms</title>
                <p id="Par18">We then addressed whether diet-related changes in small intestinal microbiota composition and function might be responsible, in part, for alterations in epithelial barrier function, and symptoms often associated with FGIDs. To investigate this, a pilot short-term dietary intervention study was performed limiting the consumption of fiber in the 16 healthy individuals consuming baseline high fiber diet ( &gt; 11 g/1000 cal) identified above. All subjects were placed on a low fiber ( &lt; 10 g/day), high simple sugar (accounting for &gt; 50% daily carbohydrate) diet for 7 days under the direction of a dietitian (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5A</xref>). All food was provided to the subjects for the course of the study. We recorded the appearance of new symptoms following intervention and profiled microbial community diversity before and after intervention in duodenal aspirates and stool using 16 S rRNA marker-based sequencing. In addition, we measured changes in epithelial barrier function by fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)–dextran (4 kDa; measure of paracellular transport) flux across duodenal biopsies using an Ussing chamber.</p>
                <p id="Par19">As expected, the dietary intervention led to a decrease in fiber intake (25 ± 1.8 g/day before; 9 ± 0.18 g/day after; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001, paired <italic>t</italic> test). All patients developed new symptoms with 80% developing GI symptoms during the dietary intervention and the symptoms resolved within a week of discontinuing the diet (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Three subjects with baseline SIBO tested negative after the intervention, whereas five continued to have SIBO, and two subjects developed SIBO. SIBO resolution or new SIBO diagnosis following the intervention was not specifically associated with symptoms.</p>

                <p id="Par21">To determine functional changes in the microbial communities following diet change, the metabolic content of duodenal aspirates and fecal samples collected before and after intervention was measured using <sup>1</sup>H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Principal components analysis (PCA) was performed on these spectral profiles to identify biochemical variation associated with the intervention. Clustering was observed in the scores plot (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6A</xref>) from the PCA model comparing the pre- and post-intervention fecal profiles. This occurred along the first principal component (PC1) with the short chain fatty acids acetate, propionate and butyrate, the amino acids alanine and lysine, and succinate and glucose varying between the pre and post-intervention samples. The peak integrals for these metabolites were extracted from the NMR spectra (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6C</xref>) of fecal samples and acetate, butyrate, and lysine were found to be significantly decreased in feces following the intervention (FDR <italic>q</italic> &lt; 0.05, Wilcoxon signed rank test, Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6e</xref>). Although no intervention-related clustering was apparent in the PCA model constructed on the duodenal aspirate profiles (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6B</xref>), a decrease was observed in acetate in duodenal aspirates (FDR <italic>q</italic> = 0.13, Wilcoxon signed rank test, Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6d</xref>). These changes are consistent with alterations in microbial energy processing and a loss of fermentable fiber sources from the diet. Changes in duodenal mucosal gene expression are described in supplementary <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">information</xref> (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8</xref>).</p>

Post intervention (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7B</xref>), fecal bacterial diversity defined by the Simpson metric was negatively correlated with acetate in both the feces and aspirate samples while diversity measured by the Chao1 metric was positively correlated with duodenal glucose.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par23">Here we show that SIBO based on quantitative duodenal aspirate culture usually reflects an overgrowth of anaerobes, does not correspond with patient symptoms, and can be a result of dietary preferences. Small intestinal microbial composition, however, is significantly altered in symptomatic patients when compared with healthy controls and the microbial composition does not correspond with SIBO. The differences in imputed microbial function in symptomatic patients and healthy controls suggest potential differences in dietary carbohydrate intake among the two groups. In our pilot dietary intervention study, we found switching from a high-fiber diet to low fiber, high simple-sugar diet triggered GI symptoms that may also be seen in FGIDs. There was an inverse correlation between small intestinal microbial diversity and small intestinal permeability and an association between decreased microbial diversity and appearance of specific GI symptoms following dietary intervention.</p>
              <p id="Par24">Our findings are consistent with previous reports that found the presence of SIBO did not correlate with symptoms such as diarrhea or abdominal distention, pain threshold of the colon or increases in phasic contractions in colon in response to intraluminal distension<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. There is also a lack of data to support increased prevalence of SIBO in FGIDs like IBS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. The absence of correlation between SIBO and GI symptoms or microbial composition and the presence of SIBO in healthy individuals raises the question if SIBO is a primary driver of symptoms in FGIDs or represents an environmental influence. It will be important to make this distinction, as patients are currently treated with subtherapeutic doses of non-targeted antibiotics on a recurrent basis based on the diagnosis of SIBO; these treatments have the potential for long-term collateral harm to the gut microbiome and are particularly concerning with the increasing rates of antibiotic resistance.</p>
              <p id="Par25">We found that small intestinal microbial composition was significantly altered in patients with GI symptoms, including significant decreases in members of genus <italic>Prevotella</italic> and enrichment of microbial ascorbate and aldarate metabolism. Ascorbic acid can act as an antioxidant and levels of total ascorbic acid in the blood decrease, whereas the oxidized form of ascorbic acid (dehydroascorbic acid) increases in cases of acute oxidative stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Prolonged oxidative stress has been associated with increased ascorbate catabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. There were several associated pathways that also showed higher expression in symptomatic patients, such as phosphotransferase systems required for microbial <sc>l</sc>-ascorbate import, gluconeogenesis, and the pentose phosphate pathway that have a role in ascorbate metabolism, and siderophore biosynthesis, which chelates iron. Together, these suggest a potential role for increased luminal oxidative stress in symptomatic patients, though this would need to be confirmed in a prospective study.</p>
              <p id="Par26">Host factors such as advanced age, PPI, antibiotic use, and prior GI surgery explain ~ 12% of variance in healthy and symptomatic patient microbial communities, suggesting there are other extrinsic or intrinsic factors at play. Diet has a significant influence on microbial composition and the enrichment of pathways linked to mono- and disaccharide metabolism in symptomatic patients supports this notion. Our pilot dietary intervention study showed that switching to a low fiber, high simple-sugar diet for a short period can trigger GI and systemic symptoms that improve upon resuming baseline diet. The correlation of decreased microbial diversity with increased duodenal permeability and appearance of symptoms suggests that this effect may be driven at least in part via gut microbiota. The deleterious effect of a low-fiber diet on microbial diversity and host function has been well described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> and our findings support that notion. We found acetate and butyrate to be reduced with the low fiber, high simple-sugar diet. These microbial fermentation products are a key energy source for intestinal epithelial cells and play an important role in epithelial barrier integrity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>and enteropathogen exclusion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par27">We acknowledge that there are limitations that need to be addressed in future studies. The clinical metadata was obtained by retrospective chart review, limiting our ability to have complete follow-up and assess specific therapies instituted, the treatment response in all patients, and to obtain additional data such as diet history at the time of collection. The duodenal aspirates were collected using an aspiration catheter to reduce chances of contamination, however in spite of this; there is a chance for oropharyngeal contamination. The sample size of our pilot study was small, symptom questionnaire was not previously validated, and the duration of the intervention was short; but, our data provide a rationale for a controlled dietary intervention study in larger cohort with a longer intervention as well as post-intervention follow-up using standardized questionnaires. Despite the limitations, our findings provide a new avenue to pursue for patients with GI symptoms attributed to FGIDs including dietary modification and potentially the use of targeted microbiota-directed therapies in patients with dysbiosis, which has the potential to improve our treatment outcomes.</p>
              <p id="Par28">In summary, our findings highlight the potential clinical benefit of characterizing the small intestinal microbiome. There are several mechanisms underlying the common GI symptoms such as diarrhea, bloating and abdominal pain, and gut microbiota is likely one such factor. Small intestinal microbial compositional analysis can help identify individuals in whom the microbiome is altered and may be contributing to symptoms as well as delineate individuals with healthy small intestinal microbiome where other factors may be at play. We also provide preliminary evidence supporting the interaction of diet with small intestinal microbiota in the development of GI symptoms commonly associated with FGIDs.</p>

This CLOUD dysbiosis score was then validated using an orthogonal approach based on the SI scores: we fit the healthy SI scores to a logit scale distribution (healthy control SI values are approximately normal on logit scale; <italic>p</italic> = 0.41, Shapiro–Wilk normality test). We again applied the 2 SD rule, classifying samples greater than 2 SD from the mean of the healthy distribution as “dysbiotic” and those within 2 SD as “healthy-like”.

In brief, duodenal biopsies were mounted in 4 ml Ussing chambers (Physiologic Instruments, San Diego, CA) exposing 0.031 cm<sup>2</sup> area, within 45 min of collection. Chambers were filled with Krebs with 10 m<sc>m</sc> mannitol (mucosal side) and Krebs with 10 m<sc>m</sc> glucose (submucosal side). Baseline transepithelial resistance and short circuit current of each tissue was measured using a pair of Ag/AgCl electrodes with agar-salt bridges and a pair of current-giving platinum electrodes to maintain voltage clamp conditions. Paracellular flux across biopsies was measured using 4 kDa FITC–dextran administered on the mucosal side (1 mg/ml chamber concentration). Sampling was done from the submucosal side every 30 min for a total of 3 h and cumulative fluorescence was measured using a Synergy Multi-Mode Microplate Reader (BioTek, VT) and converted to concentration using standard curves. Cumulative flux at the end of 3 h was calculated for FITC–dextran. Spearman correlations (nonparametric) were used to test for a relationship between the microbiome diversity and FITC–dextran flux.</p>
