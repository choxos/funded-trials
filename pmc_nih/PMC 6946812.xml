                <p id="Par1">Bone remodeling consists of resorption by osteoclasts followed by formation by osteoblasts, and osteoclasts are a source of bone formation-stimulating factors. Here we utilize osteoclast ablation by denosumab (DMAb) and RNA-sequencing of bone biopsies from postmenopausal women to identify osteoclast-secreted factors suppressed by DMAb. Based on these analyses, <italic>LIF, CREG2, CST3, CCBE1</italic>, and <italic>DPP4</italic> are likely osteoclast-derived coupling factors in humans. Given the role of Dipeptidyl Peptidase-4 (DPP4) in glucose homeostasis, we further demonstrate that DMAb-treated participants have a significant reduction in circulating DPP4 and increase in Glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 levels as compared to the placebo-treated group, and also that type 2 diabetic patients treated with DMAb show significant reductions in HbA1c as compared to patients treated either with bisphosphonates or calcium and vitamin D. Thus, our results identify several coupling factors in humans and uncover osteoclast-derived DPP4 as a potential link between bone remodeling and energy metabolism.</p>

                <p id="Par2">Anti-resorptive bone therapies also inhibit bone formation, as osteoclasts secrete factors that stimulate bone formation by osteoblasts. Here, the authors identify osteoclast-secreted factors that couple bone resorption to bone formation in healthy subjects, and show that osteoclast-derived DPP4 may be a factor coupling bone resorption to energy metabolism.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="Par3">During bone remodeling, bone resorption by osteoclasts is followed by bone formation by osteoblasts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. These processes are balanced through coupling to ensure the precise formation of new bone at sites of resorption to maintain skeletal mass and strength throughout the lifespan; however, with aging and certain diseases, resorption exceeds bone formation, leading to bone loss and increased risk for osteoporotic fractures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par4">Because of the excess bone resorption contributing to bone loss in these conditions, anti-resorptive therapies, for example, bisphosphonates and denosumab (DMAb), have become the first-line treatments for osteoporosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. While these agents effectively reduce resorption and limit further bone loss, the resultant decrease in osteoclasts is associated with a coupling-related decrease in osteoblast number and bone formation rate, thus limiting the efficacy of anti-resorptive therapies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. In addition, bone anabolic therapies, such as teriparatide, have a significantly blunted effect to stimulate bone formation when given following treatment with anti-resorptive drugs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, suggesting that the presence of osteoclasts is necessary for certain bone anabolic therapies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par5">The effect of osteoclasts to promote osteoblast-mediated bone formation is also evidenced in the human genetic disease, osteopetrosis. Osteopetrosis is a condition of high bone mass caused by mutations in genes involved in osteoclast differentiation or function, and patients exhibit increased bone mass that is brittle due to impaired removal of old bone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. There are several forms of osteopetrosis, which are classified by mutations, inheritance pattern, and effects on either osteoclast differentiation or function. Osteopetrosis caused by mutations in genes necessary for osteoclast differentiation is characterized by decreased osteoclast numbers. Similar to patients on traditional anti-resorptive therapy, osteopetrosis patients with decreased osteoclast numbers also exhibit decreased osteoblast numbers and bone formation rates. In contrast, osteopetrosis patients with mutations affecting osteoclast resorptive activity, rather than differentiation, such as mutations in <italic>CLCN7</italic> or <italic>TCIRG1</italic>, exhibit normal or increased osteoclast numbers and maintained/increased bone formation rates, leading to more severe, debilitating forms of osteopetrosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par6">In contrast to traditional anti-resorptive therapies, odanacatib, a small-molecule inhibitor of cathepsin K (CTSK), blocks bone resorption without reducing osteoclast numbers. Similar to osteopetrosis patients with impaired osteoclast resorptive activity, clinical trials of odanacatib showed promise to reduce resorption with minimal decreases in bone formation rate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. However, further development of this therapy was impeded by an off-target increase in cerebrovascular accident incidence in odanacatib-treated patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. While this particular therapy did not progress, the data provide proof of concept that pharmacological approaches designed to inhibit osteoclast activity, rather than osteoclast numbers, is a viable approach to prevent bone loss without reducing bone formation. In addition, further elucidation of mechanisms by which osteoclasts promote bone formation may yield additional therapeutic targets to stimulate bone formation even in the absence of osteoclasts.</p>
              <p id="Par7">In the present study, we utilized a single DMAb treatment as a biological probe to pharmacologically ablate osteoclasts in postmenopausal women in order to identify potential osteoclast-derived factors that contribute to the coupling of bone resorption and bone formation in humans. Our findings independently confirm leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) as a coupling factor in human bone remodeling. In addition, we identify dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) as an osteoclast-derived factor that may link bone remodeling and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa b ligand (RANKL) signaling to energy metabolism, and provide a mechanism for a possible improvement in glycemic control in diabetic individuals following treatment with anti-RANKL therapies.</p>

                <title>Effect of DMAb on serum markers of resorption and formation</title>
                <p id="Par8">A total of 56 postmenopausal women were assessed for eligibility (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Fifty-two of these women were randomly assigned to a one-time treatment of placebo or DMAb. Of the 26 participants assigned to placebo, 25 received the intervention. All 26 participants assigned to DMAb received the intervention. One participant in the placebo arm, and two participants in the DMAb arm, withdrew following intervention. Thus, final biopsy, serum/plasma collection, and analysis were performed on 24 participants per group.</p>
                <p id="Par9">Participants were well matched for baseline clinical characteristics (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). As demonstrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>, participant baseline C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX), a serum marker of bone resorption, correlated significantly with the serum markers of bone formation, procollagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide (P1NP, <italic>R</italic> = 0.72, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; Spearman’s rank correlation) and osteocalcin (OCN, <italic>R</italic> = 0.72, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; Spearman’s rank correlation). Participant baseline serum tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b (TRAP5b), a marker of osteoclast number, also significantly correlated with P1NP and OCN levels (<italic>R</italic> = 0.43, <italic>p</italic> = 0.002; <italic>R</italic> = 0.31, <italic>p</italic> = 0.031, respectively; Spearman’s rank correlation), although to a lesser degree than CTX. Three months post treatment, peripheral blood serum, bone marrow plasma, and needle bone biopsies were collected, as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. As expected, participants treated with DMAb exhibited a significant reduction in serum markers of bone resorption (CTX and TRAP5b), as well as a coupling-related decrease in bone formation markers (P1NP and OCN; Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Baseline participant characteristics and effects of DMAb on bone metabolism.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Baseline clinical and biochemical data in the study participants. <bold>b</bold> Correlations at baseline between markers of bone formation (PINP, μg/L; OCN, ng/mL) and resorption (CTX, ng/mL; TRAP5b, U/L) demonstrating coupling of bone formation and resorption at the systemic level (<italic>N</italic> = 48 participants); Spearman’s correlation coefficient was used to determine strength of relationships. <bold>c</bold> Changes in markers of bone resorption (top panels) and bone formation (bottom panels) over 3 months (% change from baseline, <italic>N</italic> = 24 participants per group).

                <title>Identification of osteoclast and osteoblast gene signatures</title>
                <p id="Par10">The bone was centrifuged to remove loosely adherent marrow; the remaining bone sample (bone and cells on the bone surface, e.g., osteoclasts, osteoblasts, lining cells, etc.) was homogenized for RNA isolation. RNA samples with the highest yield and quality were then submitted for RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) (<italic>N</italic> = 15 per group; thus, analyses utilizing sequencing data are limited to <italic>N</italic> = 15, and sample sizes for other analyses are specified as appropriate). Sequencing data was then used to determine genes that were significantly altered in DMAb-treated participants. Nine hundred forty-eight genes were significantly changed by DMAb in the centrifuged bone (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05; R package edgeR), with 128 exhibiting a false discovery rate below 0.10.</p>
                <p id="Par11">A comprehensive list of bone-related genes was compiled from the Gene Ontology (GO) Biological Processes Database, with processes including Bone Development, Bone Mineralization, Bone Morphogenesis, Bone Remodeling, Bone Resorption, Bone Trabecula Formation, Ossification, Osteoblast Differentiation, and Osteoclast Differentiation Biological Processes (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">1</xref>). These processes represented a total of 555 bone-related genes with overlap between multiple gene sets; of these genes, 481 were represented in the centrifuged bone biopsy RNA-seq results, with 48 genes significantly altered in centrifuged bone samples from the DMAb-treated participants. Of these, 40 genes were significantly decreased in bone samples from the DMAb-treated participants, whereas 8 genes were significantly upregulated (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>).</p>
                <p id="Par12">Eight of the DMAb-downregulated genes were selected as accepted markers of osteoclasts (<italic>CTSK</italic>, <italic>CALCR</italic>, <italic>SIGLEC15</italic>, <italic>ACP5</italic>, <italic>DCSTAMP</italic>, <italic>OCSTAMP</italic>, <italic>TNFRSF11A</italic>, and <italic>MMP9</italic>), and eight as accepted markers of the osteoblast lineage (<italic>COL1A1</italic>, <italic>SPARC</italic>, <italic>SP7</italic>, <italic>SPP1</italic>, <italic>BGLAP</italic>, <italic>IBSP</italic>, <italic>ALPL</italic>, and <italic>GJA1</italic>). In assessing a heat map of these significantly decreased osteoclast and osteoblast genes in placebo vs. DMAb-treated participants, it was clear that placebo participants exhibiting high or low expression of osteoclast genes exhibited a correlative expression pattern of osteoblast genes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). Thus, in the next set of analyses, we reasoned that the DMAb-suppressed osteoclast and osteoblast genes represented genes that may be biologically coupled even in the untreated (placebo) group. Consistent with this, plotting the rank means of DMAb-suppressed osteoclast and osteoblast genes in the placebo group demonstrated a clear, strong correlation of the coupling of osteoclasts and osteoblasts at the gene expression level (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>, <italic>R</italic> = 0.75, <italic>p</italic> = 0.002; Spearman’s rank correlation). Thus, using DMAb as a biological probe, we found that DMAb-suppressed osteoclast and osteoblast genes are biologically coupled in normal physiological conditions. In order to confirm the importance of these DMAb-suppressed osteoclast and osteoblast genes for coupling, we tested the correlation of these genes in a second independent dataset of whole, non-centrifuged bone from an entirely different cohort of participants, specifically untreated postmenopausal women (<italic>n</italic> = 19)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. <italic>DCSTAMP</italic> and <italic>OCSTAMP</italic> did not pass the limit of detection in this RNA-seq dataset, possibly because osteoclast genes could be underrepresented in the absence of centrifugation to remove marrow elements. However, similar to the centrifuged bone, the whole bone gene analysis showed a significant correlation between DMAb-suppressed osteoblast and osteoclast genes in untreated postmenopausal women (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>), providing further confirmation of the validity of these findings.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>Correlation of osteoclast and osteoblast genes and secreted factors altered by DMAb.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Heat maps showing the osteoclast and osteoblast normalized gene expression in placebo and DMAb-treated participant bone biopsies.

                <title>Correlations of gene sets with functional bone data</title>
                <p id="Par13">To further validate the biological importance of the DMAb-suppressed osteoblast and osteoclast gene sets, we next correlated these results with functional bone data from the placebo participants. We first correlated the serum bone remodeling measures in the placebo participants against the DMAb-suppressed osteoclast and osteoblast rank mean gene sets. Osteoblast genes downregulated by DMAb correlated positively with CTX and P1NP in the placebo participants (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">3A</xref>), showing a functional link between these osteoblast genes and systemic markers of bone remodeling. There was no correlation with serum TRAP5b or OCN. Using a segment of the bone biopsy preserved in paraformaldehyde prior to centrifugation, we next performed micro-computed tomography (µCT) to assess for bone geometric parameters in the placebo participant samples. Osteoclast genes downregulated by DMAb correlated negatively with Conn.Dens, Tb.N, and positively with Tb.Sp in the placebo participants, consistent with increased remodeling being associated with impaired bone microarchitecture (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">3B</xref>). In contrast to the serum markers of bone remodeling, correlation of osteoblast genes suppressed by DMAb did not reach significance with µCT parameters (BV/TV, Conn.Dens, SMI, Tb.N, Tb.Th, Tb.Sp). However, correlations trended in a similar direction to osteoclast genes downregulated by DMAb. Therefore, both DMAb-suppressed osteoblast and osteoclast gene sets correlate with functional bone parameters in postmenopausal placebo participants and further validate the use of DMAb as a biological probe to identify genes relevant for the coupling of bone resorption and bone formation in humans.</p>

                <title>DMAb-suppressed secreted factors correlate with gene sets</title>
                <p id="Par14">Having validated the gene sets regulated by DMAb as biologically relevant to osteoclast–osteoblast coupling, we next sought to identify potential secreted factors involved in this coupling in vivo in humans. For this, we used Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) to identify secreted factors significantly altered by DMAb in the centrifuged bone. We identified 55 suppressed secreted genes (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">3</xref>), and 51 upregulated secreted genes (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">4</xref>). Of interest, in the placebo participants, the rank means of DMAb-suppressed secreted factor genes significantly correlated with rank means for DMAb-suppressed osteoblast and osteoclast marker genes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). In contrast, the DMAb-upregulated secreted factor genes did not correlate with either DMAb-suppressed osteoblast or osteoclast marker genes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>) in the placebo participants. These findings thus indicate that the DMAb-suppressed secreted factor genes may identify secreted factors necessary for coupling of osteoclasts and osteoblasts.</p>

                <title>Identification of osteoclast-derived coupling factors</title>
                <p id="Par15">In order to identify which of the downregulated secreted factors may be osteoclast-derived, we assessed three additional human biopsy populations (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>): osteocyte-enriched (serially digested bone fragments), osteoblast-enriched (alkaline phosphatase-positive (AP+) digest cells obtained through serial digest of flushed human bone biopsies), and bone marrow-derived osteoclasts. RNA-seq of the osteocyte-enriched fractions revealed that of the 55 secreted factors downregulated by DMAb in the centrifuged bone, 17 were also significantly decreased in the osteocyte-enriched bone (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). Three genes did not pass the limit for detection in osteocyte-enriched bone (<italic>IMPG1</italic>, <italic>SERPINA12</italic>, <italic>SCGN</italic>). This suggests that these three genes and the remaining 35 genes differentially regulated in the centrifuged bone, but not in the osteocyte-enriched bone, and may be genes that are differentially regulated in osteoclasts, osteoblasts, and bone lining cells, rather than osteocytes. Second, we compared gene expression of DMAb-suppressed secreted factors in bone marrow-derived osteoclast vs. osteoblast-enriched cultures by real-time quantitative PCR. Of the 55 secreted genes suppressed by DMAb, 10 genes were expressed at significantly higher levels in the osteoclast cultures compared to osteoblast-enriched fractions (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>), including <italic>LIF</italic>, which has previously been identified as an osteoclast-derived coupling factor that stimulates bone formation in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Taken together with factors differentially regulated in centrifuged bone vs. osteocyte-enriched bone, <italic>LIF</italic>, <italic>CREG2</italic>, <italic>CST3, CCBE1</italic>, and <italic>DPP4</italic> are most likely to be osteoclast-specific factors downregulated by DMAb, and to be potentially involved in coupling osteoclasts and bone resorption to bone formation in humans.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><title>Identification of osteoclast-derived secreted factors involved in coupling.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Flow chart describing processing of the bone biopsy samples to select for osteocyte- and osteoblast-enriched fractions. <bold>b</bold> Overlap of DMAb-suppressed secreted factor genes in centrifuged bone vs. the osteocyte-enriched fraction (<italic>N</italic> = 15 participant biopsies/group).

                <p id="Par16">As a secondary approach to identify potential coupling factors linking osteoclasts and bone resorption to osteoblasts and bone formation, we utilized a high-multiplex proteomics approach (Olink Proteomics®; see Methods) to screen bone marrow plasma from placebo- and DMAb-treated women (<italic>N</italic> = 24/group). Forty-eight proteins were significantly altered in DMAb participant bone marrow plasma (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">4A</xref>). Of the osteoclast-derived secreted factors downregulated by DMAb at the RNA level, CST3 protein was significantly decreased in bone marrow plasma, and DPP4 protein levels trended lower (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>, <italic>p</italic> = 0.056; Kruskal–Wallis). We next assessed correlation of the DMAb-suppressed osteoclast and osteoblast gene sets against the secretome data in the placebo patients for which we had RNA-seq and Olinks data (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">3B</xref>, <italic>N</italic> = 15/group).

While the decrease in bone marrow plasma DPP4 using the Olink Proteomics® assay did not reach significance (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>), analysis of the percent change in peripheral serum DPP4 levels revealed a significant decrease in serum DPP4 following treatment in the DMAb vs. placebo participants (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>, <italic>p</italic> = 0.008; Mann–Whitney).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><title>Bone marrow plasma DPP4 protein linked to bone remodeling.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Bone marrow plasma DPP4 levels in the placebo- vs. DMAb-treated participants as measured by Olink Proteomics (<italic>N</italic> = 24 participant samples/group).

                <p id="Par17">DPP4 is the target of the gliptin therapies for diabetes; inhibition of DPP4 prevents the proteolytic inactivation of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Thus, DPP4 inhibitors, such as sitagliptin, increase GLP-1 levels, leading to increased insulin synthesis and secretion, decreased glucagon release, and decreased plasma glucose. DPP4 has previously been shown to be increased in postmenopausal women and correlates with increased rates of bone turnover<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Since our mRNA expression analysis revealed DPP4 as an osteoclast-derived factor, we used in situ hybridization to assess for localization of <italic>DPP4</italic> mRNA expression in bone. Consistent with our mRNA expression approach, <italic>DPP4</italic> transcript was evident in osteoclasts on the bone surface, but not in lining cells, osteoblasts, or osteocytes in human cancellous and cortical bone (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>). We next sought to determine if the reduction in DPP4 by DMAb (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>) had a functional effect to increase GLP-1 levels and impact glucose homeostasis. Plasma taken before and after treatment revealed a significant increase in total GLP-1 in DMAb participants (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref>). However, DMAb did not significantly alter plasma glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">5</xref>), glucose, or insulin levels in this healthy (non-diabetic) cohort of postmenopausal women (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref>).

                <p id="Par18">Because the noted lack of effect on glucose homeostasis may reflect a lack of impaired glucose metabolism (i.e., lack of metabolic syndrome or diabetes) in these healthy participants, we next assessed a group of diabetic patients treated clinically with DMAb vs. bisphosphonate or calcium plus vitamin D for 1 year. Baseline characteristics of the subjects are presented in Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">6</xref>. By design, sex, body mass index (BMI), and type 2 diabetes or prediabetes duration did not differ among treatment groups. However, subjects in the DMAb group were slightly older than subjects in the other groups. In addition, more participants in the DMAb group were in the lifestyle-alone treatment for diabetes than in the other groups.

As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>, these differences were due to a greater decrease in HbA1c in the DMAb group relative to the bisphosphonate group in the first 6 months (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) and a greater decrease in the DMAb group relative to both the bisphosphonate (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.00001) and to the calcium plus vitamin D-alone group over 12 months (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01; ANCOVA and Bonferonni). Although the change in FPG did not differ among the three groups during the first 6 months or over 12 months (<italic>p</italic> = 0.07, <italic>p</italic> = 0.14, respectively; ANCOVA and Bonferonni), the decrease was numerically greater in the DMAb group (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>).

Importantly, the change in HbA1c levels in DMAb-treated patients remained significant after adjustment for changes in BMI (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">7</xref>). Thus, this clinical study demonstrated an improvement in glycemic control in type 2 diabetic or prediabetic patients with osteoporosis who were treated with DMAb.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par20">In this study, we utilized DMAb as a biological probe to pharmacologically ablate osteoclasts in postmenopausal women in order to identify potential secreted factors coupling bone resorption to bone formation. Using RNA-seq of centrifuged bone biopsies, we were able to identify DMAb-suppressed osteoblast and osteoclast gene signatures, and revealed the coupling of these sets at the gene expression level in untreated placebo participants. Importantly, this coupling of osteoblast and osteoclast gene sets was confirmed in a second, independent sample of whole bone biopsies. Second, we identified secreted factors suppressed in centrifuged bone samples from DMAb-treated participants. Expression of these secreted factors strongly correlated with DMAb-suppressed osteoblast and osteoclast gene signatures in untreated placebo participants. By assessing additional cell populations from study participants, five of these genes were demonstrated to be osteoclast-derived secreted factors. Of significant interest, DPP4 was identified from this group as not only an osteoclast-derived protein with a possible role in osteoclast–osteoblast coupling but also a potential link between RANKL/bone remodeling and energy metabolism. Support for this conclusion was provided by our prospective finding that DMAb-treated participants had a significant reduction in circulating DPP4 levels and increase in GLP-1 levels as compared to the placebo-treated group, as well as a complementary analysis of type 2 diabetes patients, who were treated with DMAb vs. bisphosphonates or calcium plus vitamin D, in which DMAb-treated patients showed a significant improvement in HbA1c of a magnitude (relative to placebo or no treatment) comparable to commonly used anti-diabetic medications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par21">DMAb-suppressed secreted factors correlated strongly with both the osteoclast and osteoblast markers, whereas there was no correlation with DMAb-upregulated secreted factors. We used two strategies to identify factors potentially secreted by osteoclasts to stimulate bone formation. By assessing osteocyte-enriched fractions from placebo vs. DMAb participants, in which centrifuged bone was enzymatically stripped of lining cells such as osteoclasts and osteoblasts, we found that 17 of the genes were similarly reduced in osteocytes as compared to the centrifuged bone. This would then imply that the 38 secreted genes only downregulated in centrifuged bone are regulated in cells lining the bone surface, but not in osteocytes. Secondly, comparison of AP+ digested cells from the bone cores to bone marrow-derived osteoclasts revealed secreted genes that were expressed at significantly higher levels in osteoclasts vs. osteoblasts. Of the genes with higher expression in osteoclasts that were suppressed in response to DMAb only in the centrifuged bone, we identified five genes: <italic>LIF</italic>, <italic>CREG2</italic>, <italic>CST3</italic>, <italic>CCBE1</italic>, and <italic>DPP4</italic>. Of interest, <italic>LIF</italic> has previously been identified as an osteoclast-derived factor, which promotes coupling of bone resorption to bone formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Thus, the identification of <italic>LIF</italic> through our independent analysis validates this approach to identify osteoclast-derived coupling factors. In addition, <italic>CST3</italic> has also been shown to induce osteoblast differentiation <italic>in vitro</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. <italic>CREG2</italic> and <italic>CCBE1</italic> have yet to be assessed for potential roles in bone metabolism. Of these secreted factors, bone marrow concentrations of DPP4 and CST3 were found to be decreased in bone marrow plasma of DMAb-treated women (<italic>p</italic> = 0.056 and <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, respectively; Kruskal–Wallis), and serum DPP4 levels were significantly reduced following treatment with DMAb. Moreover, the bone marrow (and peripheral blood) concentrations of DPP4 correlated significantly with both osteoclast and osteoblast gene sets in placebo patients, consistent with previous reports that DPP4 correlates with increased bone remodeling in postmenopusal women<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par22">DPP4 is a highly conserved peptidase found mostly on the surface of endothelial, epithelial, and immune cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. It is found both on membranes as well as in soluble form. DPP4 has many substrates, with the best characterized targets being the incretin hormones, GIP, and GLP-1, both of which have anti-diabetogenic actions—most prominently stimulating β-cell secretion of insulin and suppression of glucagon secretion by α-cells. These actions are mediated in a glucose-dependent fashion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Thus, DPP4 inhibitors have been developed and are clinically available for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Soluble DPP4 levels have previously been demonstrated to be increased in postmenopausal women, consistent temporally with the higher rates of bone remodeling that occur following menopause<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. In agreement with our findings, a previous report demonstrated expression of the membrane-bound form of DPP4, CD26, on osteoclasts in human bone in normal and pathological conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. As DPP4 is a peptidase targeting glycine/proline sequences, it is possible that osteoclast-derived DPP4 contributes to the degradation of collagen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. However, inhibition of the membrane-bound form of DPP4 appeared to inhibit osteoclast differentiation in vitro without affecting osteoclast resorptive activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Treatment of osteoblast cultures or mice with DPP4 inhibitors improved osteogenic differentiation and fracture healing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. In addition to likely direct effects of DPP4, the incretins targeted by DPP4 may have effects on both osteoblast<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> and osteoclast differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Other substrates for DPP4 that may be regulated within the bone microenvironment include stromal cell-derived factor-1, neuropeptide Y, peptide tyrosine tyrosine, insulin-like growth factor-1, vasoactive intestinal peptide, pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide, and substance P<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Theoretically, the effects of the inactivation of various peptides might lead to differential effects on bone formation. While our findings are consistent with a correlation between DPP4 and rates of bone remodeling, questions still remain about DPP4 in relation to bone mineral density (BMD) and fracture incidence. Thus, the Cardiovascular Health Study found no association between serum DPP4 and BMD/fracture incidence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. In addition, Notsu et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> also found no correlation between serum DPP4 levels and BMD in men with type 2 diabetes mellitus; however, a correlation of serum DPP4 with vertebral fracture incidence and bone turnover markers was present. Thus, further studies of DPP4 levels in relation to BMD and fracture incidence in healthy and diabetic patients are needed to understand the contribution of DPP4 to bone metabolism.</p>
              <p id="Par23">Consistent with the important role of DPP4 in regulating incretins, the decrease in circulating DPP4 in our study was associated with a significant increase in total GLP-1 in DMAb vs. placebo participants. Although glucose and insulin levels were not affected in these participants, this is to be expected in a non-diabetic, healthy cohort, given the glucose dependency of GLP-1 actions on islet cell function. Similar results of a lack of an effect of DMAb on insulin resistance or lipid profiles in otherwise healthy, osteoporotic women was reported by Lasco et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. However, our analysis showing improved glycemic control in DMAb-treated diabetic patients indicates that the reduction in DPP4 levels and increase in GLP-1 levels do lead to a functional improvement in glucose homeostasis in individuals with abnormal glucose metabolism. Consistent with our findings, an analysis of the FREEDOM Trial did show a significant reduction in FPG in DMAb-treated women with diabetes or prediabetes not being pharmacologically treated for diabetes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. Nonetheless, we recognize that our case–control study in diabetic patients has inherent limitations, specifically lack of blinding and potential confounders, and a rigorous randomized controlled trial examining the effects of DMAb on glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and osteoporosis is clearly warranted. In addition, we should note that we do not have data on the effect of DMAb on postprandial glucose metabolism, including insulin secretion and action. Evidence to date suggests that DPP4 inhibitors have effects on both fasting and postprandial glucose metabolism and that the effects are, in fact, more marked in the postprandial period<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Thus, a prospective study that measures postprandial β- and α-cell function together with glucose disposal is needed to further evaluate the mechanisms of the effects of DMAb on glucose homeostasis.</p>
              <p id="Par24">It will also be important to confirm our finding that DMAb treatment is associated with weight loss in a well-powered, randomized, placebo-controlled prospective study. That said, it is well established that DPP4 inhibitors may raise GLP-1 concentrations, but decrease net GLP-1 secretion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. This may limit the therapeutic efficacy of DPP4 inhibitors and prevent the degree of GLP-1 elevation necessary to modulate satiety and induce weight loss as observed with GLP-1 infusion or GLP-1 receptor agonist therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Thus, it will be of interest to evaluate whether postprandial elevation of GLP-1 with DMAb exceeds that observed with DPP4 inhibitor treatment, thereby providing a potential explanation for the weight loss we noted following DMAb treatment.</p>
              <p id="Par25">Our finding that patients treated with DMAb had significant reductions in HbA1c levels as compared to bisphosphonate-treated patients suggests important differences between effects of these anti-resorptive drugs on glucose homeostasis. These differences may arise from differing effects of these two drugs on osteoclasts. Thus, although both drugs inhibit bone resorption, long-term bisphosphonate therapy is associated with little or no reduction in the number of osteoclasts, but with abnormal appearing osteoclasts that include giant, hypernucleated, detached osteoclasts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. By contrast, DMAb markedly reduces osteoclast numbers on all bone surfaces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. As such, bisphosphonates and DMAb may have differing effects on osteoclast DPP4 production, and this possibility warrants further investigation. In addition, as noted below, DMAb may have different effects on osteoblasts than bisphopshonates. Finally, DMAb likely modulates effects of RANKL on glucose homeostasis involving the pancreatic islets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup> or liver<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>, thereby exerting more beneficial effects on glucose metabolism as compared to bisphosphonates.</p>
              <p id="Par26">Although we focused our analysis on osteoclast-derived secreted factors as candidate coupling factors, we should note an important osteoblast-derived gene, <italic>Wnt16</italic>, that was significantly upregulated (2.23-fold, <italic>P</italic> = 0.008; Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>) in the DMAb relative to placebo bone biopsies. Previous work by the Ohlsson group has shown that osteoblast-derived Wnt16 inhibits osteoclastogenesis and prevents cortical bone fragility in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>, and SNPs in the <italic>Wnt16</italic> gene have been associated with cortical bone thickness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> and fracture risk<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup> in humans. The observed upregulation of Wnt16 expression by DMAb may provide an explanation for the finding from clinical trials that DMAb not only inhibits bone resorption, but enables continued bone mineral accrual following therapeutic intervention for up to 10 years of therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. This occurs even though markers of bone collagen synthesis remain suppressed, likely reflecting a consolidation of matrix mineralization enabled by DMAb, but not bisphosphonates.</p>
              <p id="Par27">Figure <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> provides a working model, based on our data, of the relationships between RANKL signaling in the osteoclast, release of osteoclast-derived coupling factors, including DPP4, and systemic glucose homeostasis. In this model, RANKL signaling in osteoclasts induces (directly or indirectly) the expression of key coupling factors, identified in our human study as <italic>LIF</italic>, <italic>CREG2</italic>, <italic>CST3</italic>, <italic>CCBE1</italic>, and <italic>DPP4</italic> (note that we can attribute induction of these factors to RANKL signaling as they were suppressed by DMAb treatment in our study). In addition to a potential role in coupling bone resorption to bone formation, DPP4 also has effects on systemic energy metabolism. Specifically, increases in circulating DPP4 would lead to a decrease in GLP-1, leading to reduced insulin and increased glucagon secretion, resulting in hyperglycemia. These actions of RANKL-induced DPP4 appear to be synergistic with other effects of RANKL on glucose metabolism, which are to induce insulin resistance and increase circulating glucose levels. Previous reports have shown that both liver and pancreatic β cells express the RANKL receptor <italic>TNFRSF11A</italic>. Activation of nuclear factor-κB-inducible kinase, downstream of RANKL, has been shown as a potential mechanism for obesity-induced β-cell failure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. In addition, inhibition of RANKL via DMAb or osteoprotegerin (OPG) stimulates β-cell proliferation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. In the liver, it was found that hepatocyte-specific knockout of TNFRSF11A protected against insulin resistance in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. Finally, OPG-knockout mice show a significant increase in fasting glucose<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. These previously defined actions of RANKL on inducing insulin resistance may be linked to our finding that DMAb reduced circulating DPP4 and increased GLP-1 levels, in that both DPP4 inhibitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup> and GLP-1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup> may also reduce insulin resistance. Thus, considerable evidence now indicates that the net effect of RANKL signaling is to impair insulin secretion, induce insulin resistance, and increase circulating glucose levels (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). These findings may be of particular interest in the context of previous findings demonstrating that Wnt signaling in osteoblasts favors glycolysis over oxidative phosphorylation (Warburg effect) and that glycolytic intermediates may be particularly important for the process of osteoblast differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. As such, in addition to RANKLinducing osteoclast differentiation and osteoclast-derived osteoblast-coupling factors, the ability to make glucose available to differentiating osteoblasts may also be a key component of RANKL-induced energy coupling at a systemic level. Indeed, consistent with this hypothesis, Bonnet et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup> recently demonstrated that transgenic mice overexpressing RANKL have systemic insulin resistance and reduced glucose uptake in non-skeletal tissues (muscle, brain), but increased glucose update in bone (femur). Although evident in the adult, as in our study, these effects of RANKL may be particularly important during rapid growth and development, when the energy needs of the skeleton are substantial. Overall, our data indicate that RANKL-induced DPP4 may be part of this process linking bone to energy metabolism.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><title>Proposed mechanism for coupling of bone remodeling to energy metabolism.</title><p>RANKL signaling in osteoclasts induces (directly or indirectly) the expression of key coupling factors, identified in our human study as <italic>LIF</italic>, <italic>CREG2</italic>, <italic>CST3</italic>, <italic>CCBE1</italic>, and <italic>DPP4</italic> (note that <italic>LIF</italic> and <italic>CST3</italic> are known to have effects on osteoblasts and thus are likely osteoclast–osteoblast-coupling factors (solid arrows)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, whereas <italic>DPP4</italic>, <italic>CREG2</italic>, and <italic>CCBE1</italic> are potential coupling factors identified by our study that require further characterization (dashed arrows)). Increases in circulating DPP4 lead to a decrease in GLP-1 levels, leading in turn to reduced insulin and increased glucagon secretion, resulting in hyperglycemia. These actions of RANKL-induced DPP4 appear to be synergistic with other effects of RANKL (denoted by red arrows and text) on glucose metabolism, which are to induce insulin resistance and increase circulating glucose levels. These findings may be of particular interest in the context of previous findings from the Long laboratory demonstrating that Wnt signaling in osteoblasts favors glycolysis over oxidative phosphorylation (Warburg effect) and that glycolytic intermediates may be particularly important for the process of osteoblast differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. As such, in addition to RANKLinducing osteoclast differentiation and osteoclast-derived osteoblast-coupling factors, the ability to make glucose available to differentiating osteoblasts may also be a key component of RANKL-induced energy coupling at a systemic level. We should note that this is a working model and, for example, it remains to be shown that antagonism of RANKL by DMAb regulates the insulin/glucagon ratio in humans, not only under fasting but also postprandial conditions, given what is known about the mechanisms of action of DPP4 inhibitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41467_2019_14003_Fig6_HTML" id="d29e1370"/></fig></p>
              <p id="Par28">In summary, our study is the first to independently verify LIF as a coupling factor in human bone remodeling, identify several additional coupling factors in humans, and uncover osteoclast-derived DPP4 as a potential link between bone remodeling and energy metabolism. Our finding that DMAb suppression of DPP4 may contribute to improved glucose homeostasis in patients with type 2 diabetes also provides a strong rationale for future studies examining the role of RANKL inhibition in simultaneously treating osteoporosis and diabetes, two common age-related co-morbidities.</p>

Because clinical trials and studies in osteoporosis do not generally exclude patients with type 2 diabetes, we continued to include this subject in the gene expression analyses, although we would note that excluding this subject did not change the results of that analysis. However, for the analyses specific to glucose metabolism (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c, e</xref>, Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">5</xref>), we excluded this subject due to her abnormal glucose values, and restricted the glucose homeostasis analysis to a non-diabetic cohort. This allows for a cleaner analysis of this cohort, and the possible effects of denosumab in patients with type 2 diabetes is specifically addressed in the subsequent clinical study (see below).</p>

Because this would alter all of the parameters related to changes in glucose homeostasis with denosumab (but not her gene expression data, as that was obtained at the 3-month visit, when she did fast), we have also excluded her from the glucose homeostasis analysis in this cohort (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c, e</xref>, Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">5</xref>).</p>

The double-stranded products then underwent blunt-end repair. Adapter molecules were ligated to the 5′ and 3′ ends of each fragment to facilitate PCR amplification of the fragments to produce the final library.

The gene counts were generated by FeatureCounts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref></sup> using Ensembl’s hg19 gene definition file.

Relationships between the osteoblast and osteoclast genes involved taking all the 28,402 genes for a given subject and ranking their CQN normalized values from high to low, then taking the mean values of the ranks for the osteoblast genes and for the osteoclast genes. The Spearman’s correlation coefficient was used to summarize the relationship between the mean osteoblast and osteoclast ranks. A randomization test was used to assess the significance of this correlation, using randomly created sets of genes and assessing the correlation between them. This process was carried out 5000 times and the correlation of the osteoblasts/osteoclasts was compared to these other 5000 correlations.

              <p>S.K. and M.J.O. conceived the idea for study A. Study A recruitment was performed by A.J.T. and L.K.M. Biopsy collections were performed by L.K.M. and M.T.D. Samples were processed and cell isolations were carried out by M.M.W., D.G.M., J.N.F., J.R.G., B.E., B.T., and M.R. RNA isolations and cDNA library prep were performed by B.E., D.G.M., and M.R. ELISAs of bone serum markers was performed by B.T. RNA-seq data was analyzed for differential expression by E.J.A. Analysis of differentially expressed genes was performed by M.M.W. leading to the observation of gene set correlations. After discussion with S.K., M.J.O., and D.G.M., further correlation analysis was initiated by M.M.W. Validation of statistical significance of correlations across gene sets was performed by M.M.W. and E.J.A. Analysis of Olink proteomic data was performed by M.M.W. and E.J.A. Statistical analysis of metabolic serum parameters was carried out by E.J.A. In situ staining was performed by T.L.A. and M.K. Discussion of data was performed with M.M.W., D.G.M., J.N.F., R.A.R., A.V., A.M., B.L.C., M.J.O., and S.K. Study B was performed by C.K.C. and B.L.C. Statistical analysis for Study B was performed by E.J.A. The manuscript was written by M.M.W., C.K.C, and S.K. with input from all authors, and revised by M.M.W. and S.K. with input from all authors.</p>
