                <sec id="abs1">
                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>In a randomized trial of DHA supplementation to lactating mothers who delivered preterm, there were significant increases in DHA status in the mother and her infant.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="abs2">
                  <title>Objectives</title>
                  <p>Our objective here was to characterize the mammary gland transcriptomes from the above study. We hypothesized that proinflammatory gene expression would be attenuated in the increased DHA group compared with the standard DHA group.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="abs3">
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>In the original trial, mothers delivering at &lt;29 wk gestation at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center and intending to express their milk were randomly assigned to supplementation with 200 mg/d DHA (standard group: STD) or 1000 mg/d DHA (experimental group: EXP) within 7 d of delivery. Here, we conducted RNA-seq transcriptome analysis of <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 5 EXP and <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 4 STD extracellular mammary mRNA samples extracted from the fat layer of milk samples obtained 4 wk postenrollment. Transcripts were assessed for differential expression (false discovery rate adjusted <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> value &lt;0.05) and clustering between EXP compared with STD groups. Ontological analysis of all differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was performed with Toppcluster.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="abs4">
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>There were 409 DEGs. We observed 5 main groups of biological processes that were upregulated, including those associated with improved immune regulation and management of oxidative stress; and 3 main groups of biological processes that were downregulated, including 1 associated with immune dysregulation. For example, we observed upregulation of inflammation-inhibiting genes including NFKB inhibitor alpha (<italic toggle="yes">NFKBIA</italic>; fold-change (FC), adjusted <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> value: FC = 1.70, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.007) and interleukin-18 binding protein (<italic toggle="yes">IL18BP</italic>: FC = 2.2, adjusted <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.02); and downregulation of proinflammatory genes including interleukin 7 receptor (<italic toggle="yes">IL7R</italic>: FC = –1.9, adjusted <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.02) and interleukin 1 receptor like 1 (<italic toggle="yes">IL1RL1</italic>: FC = –13.0, adjusted <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.02).</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="abs5">
                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>Increased DHA supplementation during lactation can modulate the expression of inflammation-related genes within the mammary gland. This might translate to milk composition with a more optimal inflammasome profile. Future research with a larger clinical trial and greater interrogation of clinical outcomes is warranted.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>According to the CDC, 1 in 10 births occurred prematurely in the United States in 2019 (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Compared with term infants, preterm infants rely heavily on the nonspecific, innate immune system and consequently have a significantly higher risk of developing infection (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Regulatory T-cells are often less functional in preterm infants compared with full-term infants, and it is hypothesized that this sustained inflammatory state increases the infant's susceptibility to numerous inflammatory morbidities during infancy and later in life (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p>
              <p>Human milk is known to contain anti-inflammatory components (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) that can reduce the risk of mortality and inflammation-associated morbidity in the preterm infant (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). One component of human milk known to possess anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties is the long-chain omega-3 PUFA, DHA (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). DHA is an important component in the lipid raft of the phospholipid membrane, where it modulates cytokine expression and downstream signaling that influences PG production and associated metabolites (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). More specifically, DHA metabolites can serve as ligands for receptors that inhibit the transcription of proinflammatory nuclear factor kappa B (<italic toggle="yes">NFKB</italic>) and activate anti-inflammatory transcription factors such as peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor γ (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). In preterm infants specifically, enteral DHA supplementation decreases the risk of severe retinopathy (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), and whole blood DHA concentrations are predictive of chronic lung disease and late-onset sepsis (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p>
              <p>Intake of DHA from the diet or as a supplement is essential during pregnancy and lactation due to its limited ability to be adequately synthesized in the body from α-linoleic acid (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). It is also important to ensure adequate DHA concentrations in the appropriate ratio with arachidonic acid (ARA) (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). In the United States, in human milk of donating mothers (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) and mothers who delivered preterm (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), the ARA:DHA ratio exceeds the recommended range of 1:1 to 2:1 (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). For this reason, it is recommended that lactating mothers who deliver preterm are prescribed supplemental DHA (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). The Institute of Medicine (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) does not set a DRI for DHA in pregnancy or lactation, but the range of intake suggested by experts varies from 200 mg/d to 1000 mg/d during pregnancy and lactation (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Maternal supplementation at the higher end of the recommendation has been shown to increase DHA concentrations in human milk, spurring further questions regarding its ability to decrease inflammation in the preterm infant (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p>
              <p>In a randomized trial involving DHA supplementation in mothers who delivered preterm, investigators from our research group found that DHA supplementation strategies using 1000 mg/d compared with 200 mg/d can increase DHA concentrations in maternal milk and infant plasma (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). As part of the same randomized trial, our research group obtained extracellular mammary epithelial cell mRNA (lactocyte mRNA) of enrolled mothers. By interrogating the intersection of differentially expressed genes with known inflammation and cytokine signaling pathways, it might be possible to understand the influence of DHA on cytokine gene expression in the lactocyte. This will help us determine whether there is a broader effect of maternal DHA supplementation on mammary gland health and breast milk quality, aside from increasing human milk DHA concentrations. We hypothesized that inflammation-associated gene expression in the lactocytes of mothers who delivered preterm would be significantly attenuated in the group randomly assigned to an increased DHA supplement (1000 mg/d) compared with the group randomly assigned to receive the standard DHA supplement amount (200 mg/d).</p>

                <p>We conducted transcriptome analysis of extracellular mammary mRNA that was extracted from human milk as part of a randomized controlled trial that took place between July 2013 and August 2014 (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). The original trial was conducted at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center (Cincinnati, OH), where mothers were recruited in the postpartum unit after delivery of an infant &lt;29 completed gestational weeks of age with no congenital abnormalities that could interfere with study outcomes. All mothers recruited intended to provide their expressed milk to their infant. Mothers enrolled in the original trial were randomly assigned to begin supplementation with either 200 mg/d DHA [standard (STD) group] or 1000 mg/d DHA [experimental (EXP) group] within 7 d of delivery. As part of the original trial, mothers provided spot samples of expressed milk at 4 wk postenrollment, without controlling for the time of day or timing since the previous breast emptying. Milk DHA concentration was assayed as part of the original trial as previously described (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Of the 18 lactating mothers who completed the original trial, 14 provided a milk sample at 4 wk postpartum at a time when a study investigator (MM) was available to process the freshly expressed sample for RNA stabilization and extraction. The details on deriving the final sample sizes used in bioinformatic analysis are described below and summarized in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>. The study was approved by the University of Cincinnati Institutional Review Board.</p>

                <p>Fresh human milk fat globules contain crescents of mammary epithelial cell cytoplasm, including mRNA, which is what allowed us to utilize freshly expressed milk samples for extracellular mammary RNA extraction, as described previously (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Briefly, after centrifuging the fresh milk sample at 15,000 g x 10 minutes at room temperature, the milk fat layer was dispersed in TRIzol LS solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to stabilize the mRNA. The samples were either processed to extract mRNA immediately or stored at −80°C until mRNA extraction using chloroform, and then isolated and purified using the PROMEGA Maxwell 16 integrated system (Promega Corp). Once isolated, the samples were screened for quality and quantity using the Nanodrop 1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Ten samples (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 6 EXP and <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 4 STD) met initial quality control and were stored at −80°C until sequencing. Just prior to sequencing, the 10 samples were sent to the Gene Expression Core at Cincinnati Children's Medical Center to confirm adequate RNA purity (rRNA 28S:18S),  quality (RNA integrity number), and quantity using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. All 10 samples submitted scored in the range of 8.4 to 9.4 for RNA integrity, had an rRNA ratio (28S:18S) between 1.3 and 2.6, and RNA quantity &gt;1 μg, and thus were suitable for next-generation RNA sequencing.</p>

                <p>The 10 high-quality samples were sent to the Genomics, Epigenomics, and Sequencing Core at the University of Cincinnati for library preparation and sequencing. NEBNext Poly(A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation Module (New England BioLabs) was used to isolate poly(A) mRNA from 1 μg total RNA. Then, the SMARTer Apollo automated NGS library prep system (Takara Bio USA) was used to enrich the poly(A) RNA and the NEBNext Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep kit (New England BioLabs) was used to prepare the library for sequencing through 8 cycles of PCR. Next, library quality control and quantification were performed using NEBNext Library Quant Kit (New England BioLabs) together with QuantStudio 5 Real-Time PCR Systems (Thermo Fisher). Individually indexed libraries were proportionally pooled and directional polyA RNA-seq was performed in August 2020, using the Illumina NextSeq 550 sequencer (Illumina, Inc) with the sequence setting of single read 1 × 85 bp to generate ∼30 million reads per sample using standard Illumina protocols. Fastq files for downstream data analysis were automatically generated via Illumina BaseSpace Sequence Hub v2.02 (Illumina, Inc). Reads were mapped to the reference human genome GRCh38.p13 [GRCh38.p13-Genome-Assembly-NCBI (nih.gov)] using STAR (Illumina, Inc) under the first strand setting. The aligned reads were quantified and converted to relative gene expression level represented by transcripts per million using Salmon (Illumina, Inc).</p>

In this package, counts are modeled following a negative binomial distribution and fit by a generalized linear model for each gene.

It does not appear that the outlier is due to lack of compliance with the DHA supplementation protocol because milk DHA response in this outlier was centered within the range observed for the other EXP samples (see footnote to <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>); alternatively, outlier status could be due to the sample being from the mother with the earliest gestational age (24<sup>5/7</sup> wk), or possibly having a nonresponder phenotype as described for triacylglycerol response to DHA (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). To avoid having 1 outlier unduly distort the results in this small exploratory analysis (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), the outlier was removed and a second principal component analysis confirmed separation of samples according to randomization groups (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Figure 1B</xref>).

In <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table"><bold>Table 3</bold></xref>, we summarize functions of key differentially expressed genes within the 4 biological process themes most relevant to inflammation: improved oxidative stress response, normalized immune response, improved bioenergetics, and downregulation of immune dysregulation. <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> also includes the log2 FC ± SE, FC, and adjusted <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> value for DEGs in each theme. In <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Figure 2A–D</xref>, we present heat maps to contrast gene expression across individual samples according to key genes from the 4 biological process themes listed above. For all 4 themes, the heat maps confirm primary-level clustering of gene expression levels by DHA group.

              <p>Although there is evidence supporting DHA's ability to alter inflammatory pathways in human adipose tissue (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), this is the first report to our knowledge examining inflammation-associated gene expression in the mammary gland. Our findings show that increased DHA supplementation during lactation resulted in the differential expression of 409 genes, many of which are significantly enriched in key ontological functions associated with immune modulation.</p>
              <p>In examination of the top 20 significantly upregulated genes, transcripts include inflammatory regulators such as <italic toggle="yes">TMEM176B</italic> (FC = 9.7, adjusted <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.02) and <italic toggle="yes">TSPAN18</italic> (FC = 110, adjusted <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.0005). <italic toggle="yes">TMEM176B</italic> is part of the significantly enriched ontology label “immune system development,” and is defined as a negative regulator of inflammasome activation (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Research shows that <italic toggle="yes">TMEM176B</italic> inhibits proinflammatory actions of <italic toggle="yes">NLRP3</italic> (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">TSPAN18</italic> was the most upregulated gene among the EXP group. This gene is a member of the tetraspanin superfamily and is involved in the regulation of inflammatory responses stimulated by wounds (thromboinflammation) (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Upregulation of <italic toggle="yes">TSPAN18</italic> could prevent inflammatory signaling in endothelial cells that disrupts the endothelial barrier and allows extravasation of inflammatory cells into surrounding tissues (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). The remaining highly upregulated genes are predominantly involved in biological processes that support cell development and stability (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Table 1</xref>).</p>
              <p>The 2 most highly downregulated genes in the EXP group were <italic toggle="yes">SNORA105A</italic> (FC = –261, adjusted <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.049), which encodes a small nucleolar RNA of the H/ACA box class and is involved in posttranscriptional regulation of RNA, and <italic toggle="yes">SLX1B-SULT1A4</italic> (FC = –39, adjusted <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.0004), which is involved in genome stability. More research is needed to elucidate these novel results. However, the list of the top 20 genes downregulated in the EXP group is dominated by downregulation of proinflammatory cell responses to stimuli, specifically helper T-cells, macrophages, and mast cells (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Although all these cells are important to innate immunity, we could speculate that DHA prevents an exaggerated response and promotes a healthy immune response. Further, the proapoptotic gene <italic toggle="yes">PMAIP1</italic> is suppressed as well as <italic toggle="yes">NPR2</italic>, which is a gene responsible for regulating guanylyl cyclase activity and potentially development of hypotensive responses to inflammation (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Collectively, the top differentially expressed genes listed in <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Tables 1</xref> and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">2</xref> support the role of DHA in modulating healthy immune response and promoting healthy cell development and stability.</p>
              <p>A key gene involved in the “improved oxidative stress response” theme is NFKB inhibitor alpha (<italic toggle="yes">NFKBIA</italic>; FC = 1.7, adjusted <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.007; <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), with uniform upregulation across all samples in the EXP group as shown in the heatmap for this theme (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Figure 2A</xref>). This gene encodes a protein that inhibits NF-κB, which is a transcription factor responsible for inducing the production of various cytokines and other amplifiers of the inflammatory response (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Upregulation of <italic toggle="yes">NFKBIA</italic> could help prevent exaggerated NF-κB–induced activation and prevent an excessive proinflammatory cytokine response (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>).</p>
              <p>Within the “immune dysregulation” theme, interleukin 7 receptor (<italic toggle="yes">IL7R</italic>; FC = −1.9, adjusted <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.02) and interleukin 1 receptor like 1 (<italic toggle="yes">IL1RL1</italic>; FC = –13.0, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.01) were significantly downregulated in the EXP group, with the latter among the top 20 most significant downregulated genes. <italic toggle="yes">IL7R</italic> is a receptor for the potent proinflammatory cytokine IL7, meaning that downregulation in <italic toggle="yes">IL7R</italic> would result in reduced activation of IL7. Recent studies conducted in nonhuman primate models show that suppression of <italic toggle="yes">IL7R</italic> can suppress chronic inflammation by controlling antigen-specific memory T-cells (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">IL1RL1</italic> binds IL33, which has been implicated in a variety of inflammation-associated disease states (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Well-designed animal studies investigating <italic toggle="yes">IL1RL1</italic> have consistently displayed its upregulation in several inflammatory conditions leading to it becoming a target gene in therapeutic efforts related to inflammatory disorders (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>).</p>
              <p>Cytokine inducible SH2 containing protein (<italic toggle="yes">CISH</italic>) was significantly upregulated (FC = 1.8, adjusted <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.03) and is included in the “improved response to oxidative stress” and “improved bioenergetics” themes. The product of this gene is involved in the suppression of cytokine signaling via a negative feedback system that regulates cytokine signal transduction. It negatively regulates IL3, a cytokine that has been shown to fuel cytokine storms and bolster inflammation, especially in the development of sepsis (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Due to its ability to negatively regulate IL3, upregulation of <italic toggle="yes">CISH</italic> could provide an anti-inflammatory effect, and if biologically active in the infant, could have the potential to aid in the prevention of neonatal sepsis.</p>
              <p>Lipids supply nearly 50% of the energy in human milk (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>), and the fatty acid composition of these lipids is responsible for both the nutritional and physicochemical properties of the fat component of human milk (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Among these fatty acids, increased concentration of the SCFA butyrate in human milk has been found to potentially reduce excessive inflammation and increase the functionality of the immature mucosal barrier in the digestive tract of premature infants (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Within the improved oxidative stress theme, upregulation of genes involved in butyrate metabolism were seen in the EXP group. Specifically, acyl-CoA synthetase medium chain family member 1 (<italic toggle="yes">ACSM1</italic>) was upregulated in the EXP group (FC = 3.6, adjusted <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.03). The product of this gene is responsible for catalyzing the production of acyl-CoA, via enzymes such as butyrate-CoA ligase, which is the first step of fatty acid metabolism. Another gene involved in butyrate metabolism, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase (<italic toggle="yes">HMGCL</italic>), was also upregulated in the EXP group (FC = 1.4, adjusted <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.03). Another enriched gene in the improved oxidative stress theme, acetyl-CoA carboxylase alpha (<italic toggle="yes">ACACA</italic>), was significantly upregulated in the EXP group (FC = 1.7, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.004). This gene is responsible for catalyzing the carboxylation of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA, which is the rate-limiting step in fatty acid synthesis. Upregulation of genes involved in fatty acid synthesis and butyrate metabolism could result in an increase in the SCFA content of milk; however, further research is needed with a broader interrogation of milk sample composition to confirm this hypothesis. Overall, an increase in human milk metabolites, such as the SCFA butyrate, could have anti-inflammatory effects and stimulate an increase in the mucosal barrier of the infant.</p>
              <p>Human milk contains numerous biologically active components that can aid in the prevention of infection within the immature gastrointestinal tract of premature infants (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). One of these components is lactoperoxidase, a product of the lactoperoxidase <italic toggle="yes">(LPO</italic>) gene, which plays a crucial role in protecting the gastrointestinal tract of the infant from harmful pathogens (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">LPO</italic> was enriched in the improved oxidative stress cluster, because it was upregulated in the EXP group (FC = 3.8, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.03). Upregulation of <italic toggle="yes">LPO</italic> in milk could indicate increased protection against gastrointestinal infection in the infant.</p>
              <p>Platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha (<italic toggle="yes">PDGFRA</italic>) was enriched in the improved bioenergetics cluster, because it was upregulated in the EXP group (FC = 2.7, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.007). The <italic toggle="yes">PDGFRA</italic> gene is crucial in the development of the mucosal lining of the intestines by driving the proliferation of mesenchymal cells (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). In a study conducted in rats, it was suggested that dysregulation of platelet-derived growth factor and its receptors could contribute to necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) development during intestinal maturation. Therefore, upregulation of <italic toggle="yes">PDGFRA</italic> could potentially increase the integrity and development of the mucosal lining in the preterm infant, which could aid in protection against gastrointestinal infection and development of NEC.</p>
              <p><italic toggle="yes">LALBA</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">CSN2</italic> are the most highly expressed genes in the lactating mammary gland, making up ∼45% of total mRNA in mature lactation; consequently, these are the most abundant proteins in human milk as well (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). However, overall protein concentration in human milk is not sufficient for the preterm infant, meaning that fortification is needed to ensure optimal nutrition (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). In addition to being the top 2 genes expressed in both the STD and EXP groups, both <italic toggle="yes">LALBA</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">CSN2</italic> were significantly upregulated in the EXP group, which could translate to DHA improving protein concentration in human milk. However, these results should be interpreted with caution because upon inspection of the heat map for the primary milk protein genes (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Figure 2E</xref>), upregulation was driven primarily by 2 EXP participants, and the primary hierarchical cluster for the major milk protein heat map did not align with DHA group (in strong contrast to DHA group being the primary hierarchy for all of the heat maps generated for the key genes in each of the 4 biological process themes). Combined with the small sample sizes in this study, further research is warranted, including an in-depth examination of milk composition and volume, to confirm if DHA influences upregulation of these major milk protein genes and if this translates to higher concentrations of protein in milk.</p>
              <p>The primary limitations of our analysis include a small sample size along with the exclusion of a sample that was likely a technical outlier, although the possibility of this sample representing a nonresponder phenotype, as described for triacylglycerol response to DHA (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), cannot be ruled out. All samples with adequate mRNA quality and quantity were included in sequencing (representing 50% of participants who completed the pilot trial). However, a larger study sample would have increased the power to detect differences in a larger number of genes, and enable detection of differential response by responder phenotype, if such a phenomenon exists in the mammary gland as seen for plasma triglyceride response in nonlactating individuals (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Another limitation was that we were not able to corroborate the gene expression results with corresponding changes in serum biomarkers and in milk composition and volume between baseline and 4 wk postenrollment. However, as the first study to examine gene expression response to DHA supplementation, our transcriptome analysis illuminates bioactives to target in future DHA trials in lactating women.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, our findings suggest that DHA supplementation of 1000 mg/d can modulate the expression of inflammation-associated genes within the mammary gland and also genes involved in oxidative stress response and bioenergetics that could support improved breast milk quality and mammary gland function. The results of this study could have important clinical implications if further research shows that improving the inflammasome profile of human milk through increasing DHA supplementation translates to improved clinical outcomes. However, larger clinical trials are warranted to confirm if a 1000-mg/d DHA supplement during lactation will reduce the risk of inflammation-driven morbidity in premature infants of breastfeeding mothers, and to determine if this response is uniform across participants.</p>
