                  <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
                  <p>Nutrition therapy for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) has conventionally focused on carbohydrate restriction. In a randomized controlled trial (RCT), we tested the hypothesis that a diet (all meals provided) with liberalized complex carbohydrate (60%) and lower fat (25%) (CHOICE diet) could improve maternal insulin resistance and 24-h glycemia, resulting in reduced newborn adiposity (NB%fat; powered outcome) versus a conventional lower-carbohydrate (40%) and higher-fat (45%) (LC/CONV) diet.</p>

                <sec id="s2">
                  <title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title>
                  <p>After diagnosis (at âˆ¼28â€“30 weeksâ€™ gestation), 59 women with diet-controlled GDM (mean Â± SEM; BMI 32 Â± 1 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) were randomized to a provided LC/CONV or CHOICE diet (BMI-matched calories) through delivery. At 30â€“31 and 36â€“37 weeks of gestation, a 2-h, 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed and a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) was worn for 72 h. Cord blood samples were collected at delivery. NB%fat was measured by air displacement plethysmography (13.4 Â± 0.4 days).</p>

                <sec id="s3">
                  <title>RESULTS</title>
                  <p>There were 23 women per group (LC/CONV [214 g/day carbohydrate] and CHOICE [316 g/day carbohydrate]). For LC/CONV and CHOICE, respectively (mean Â± SEM), NB%fat (10.1 Â± 1 vs. 10.5 Â± 1), birth weight (3,303 Â± 98 vs. 3,293 Â± 81 g), and cord C-peptide levels were not different. Weight gain, physical activity, and gestational age at delivery were similar. At 36â€“37 weeks of gestation, CGM fasting (86 Â± 3 vs. 90 Â± 3 mg/dL), 1-h postprandial (119 Â± 3 vs. 117 Â± 3 mg/dL), 2-h postprandial (106 Â± 3 vs. 108 Â± 3 mg/dL), percent time in range (%TIR; 92 Â± 1 vs. 91 Â± 1), and 24-h glucose area under the curve values were similar between diets. The %time &gt;120 mg/dL was statistically higher (8%) in CHOICE, as was the nocturnal glucose AUC; however, nocturnal %TIR (63â€“100 mg/dL) was not different. There were no between-group differences in OGTT glucose and insulin levels at 36â€“37 weeks of gestation.</p>

                  <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
                  <p>A âˆ¼100 g/day difference in carbohydrate intake did not result in between-group differences in NB%fat, cord C-peptide level, maternal 24-h glycemia, %TIR, or insulin resistance indices in diet-controlled GDM.</p>

              <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
              <p>There remains an absence of international consensus on evidence-based diet recommendations for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), but it is widely accepted that nutrition therapy is first-line treatment. As prepregnancy BMI has rapidly increased, the global GDM prevalence is estimated at 14%, with some high-risk populations exceeding 20% (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The United States has reported a 20% increase in GDM cases between 2016 and 2020 alone, with Asian, Native American, and Hispanic/Latina women disproportionately affected (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>).</p>
              <p>Nutrition during pregnancy creates an early-life exposure that sets the stage for pediatric metabolic health (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). This influence was first described in the hyperglycemia-hyperinsulinemia hypothesis, then by Freinkel (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) as an exacerbation of overall maternal fuel exposure, not only related to glucose, and linked to altered insulin secretion and/or action. In 1990, Jovanovic and Peterson (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) recommended primary treatment of GDM with diet, specifically with energy intake sufficient to avoid ketosis, and total carbohydrate (CHO) restriction to 30â€“40% of calories to prevent excessive postprandial glucose excursions. In 2005, concerns were raised about exacerbation of maternal insulin resistance (IR) by saturated fat intake and free fatty acid (FFA) exposure (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), and we and others have shown that increased triglyceride (TG) levels contribute to fetal growth in obesity (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Anthropologists have demonstrated that protein intake is fairly constant; thus, CHO restriction may unintentionally promote an increase in dietary fat due to the abundance of animal fats and inexpensive processed foods (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p>
              <p>Current evidence-based GDM nutrition guidelines from multiple sources (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) recommend intake of â‰¥175 g/day CHO (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) and an individualized nutrition prescription that limits excessive maternal weight gain (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) without specifying macronutrient composition. Although numerous comparative studies of dietary advice for GDM have been undertaken, CHO restriction as the primary approach to treatment lacks rigorous evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Across dietary management approaches, the evidence is insufficient and of low quality, and randomized trials are few, with none providing meals to match calories and optimize compliance (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). As a result, nutrition guidelines for GDM remain inconsistent worldwide.</p>
              <p>We developed a diet, called CHOICE (Choosing Healthy Options in Carbohydrate Energy), to directly challenge the lower-CHO diet for GDM (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) and promote the inclusion of higher-quality CHOs. Previous data from a randomized crossover trial suggested our CHOICE diet (60% mostly complex CHO, 25% fat) reduced fasting glucose and FFA levels in the short term and reduced newborn adiposity (NB%fat) in those who followed the CHOICE diet (versus lower CHO and higher fat) from âˆ¼33 weeks of gestation through delivery (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). In this parallel RCT where all meals were provided, powered for NB%fat as the primary outcome, we tested the hypothesis that compared to a conventional lower-carbohydrate (40%)/higher fat (45%) diet (LC/CONV), 7â€“8 weeks of CHOICE would improve maternal IR and 24-hour glycemia, resulting in less NB%fat.</p>

                <p>Pregnant women were identified just after GDM diagnosis (âˆ¼28â€“30 weeksâ€™ gestation) at University of Colorado Health and private community obstetric clinics. At 30â€“31 weeks of gestation, women were provided a washout diet for 2 days (day 1), then were randomly assigned to either the LC/CONV (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) or CHOICE diet (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). On day 3, women reported to the Colorado Clinical Translational Research Center (CTRC) after an 8- to 10-h fast. After collection of fasting blood, a 75-g, 2-h oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed and a blinded continuous glucose monitor (CGM) was attached for 72 h. Women began the random diet assignment on day 3, and this was followed until delivery. All meals were provided 3 days at a time, and women were contacted regularly for monitoring (1â€“2 times per week). After 7â€“8 weeks (week 36â€“37), women again wore a CGM for 72 h and a second 75-g, 2-h OGTT was performed.</p>

                  <title>Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria</title>
                  <p>Including English-speaking pregnant women with singleton pregnancies, who were between 20 and 39 years old, and had BMI of 26â€“42 kg/m<sup>2</sup> at the time of diagnosis (expanded from the original BMI range of 26â€“39 kg/m<sup>2</sup> after âˆ¼1 year) allowed greater participation in this study. Women with GDM meeting criteria by a 50-g glucose challenge followed by a 3-h 100-g OGTT according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), supported by the American Diabetes Association (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) and not requiring medication, were randomized. Women with fasting TG level â‰¥400 mg/dL, who smoked, had preexisting diabetes, or had suspected preexisting diabetes (A1C â‰¥6.5%, fasting glucose level &gt;125 mg/dL, or random glucose level &gt;200 mg/dL) or women unlikely to achieve glycemic control with diet alone (fasting glucose level &gt;105 mg/dL) were not enrolled. Women with risk factors for placental insufficiency, including hypertension, renal disease, thrombophilias, rheumatologic disease, a history of preeclampsia, or fetal growth restriction were excluded, as were those with a history of preterm labor, and those who used Î²-blockers or glucocorticoids. Women requiring insulin, oral hypoglycemic agents, or delivery at &lt;36 weeksâ€™ gestation were removed from the study.</p>

                <title>Diet Protocol</title>
                <p>Women were randomized to eat either the LC/CONV or CHOICE diet (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>); the food was prepared in the CTRC Metabolic Kitchen (<ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.2337/figshare.23905920" ext-link-type="uri">Supplementary Table 2</ext-link>). Food preferences were assessed by an on-line survey to avoid unliked foods and food allergies and to optimize adherence. After randomization, 100% of estimated energy requirement calories were provided during metabolic testing weeks. All three meals were provided through delivery. Snacks (âˆ¼20% of total calories) were chosen by participants according to provided snack lists consistent with the randomized diet. Women recorded their meal intake and snacks and self-monitored blood glucose levels four times per day (standard of care) using provided glucometers (Bayer Contour Next; Ascensia Diabetes Care, Parsippany, NJ) and kept a log.</p>
                <p>The initial 2-day washout diet was 50% CHO, 35% fat, and 15% protein. The LC/CONV diet comprised 40% CHO, 45% fat, and 15% protein (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) and the CHOICE comprised 60% CHO, 25% fat, and 15% protein, consistent with the American Heart Association guideline to reduce cardiovascular disease risk. Protein, fat, and sugars in both diets were as follows: 15% protein provided â‰¥71 g/day, which met Institute of Medicine (IOM) guidelines (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>); daily fat was âˆ¼35% saturated fatty acid, âˆ¼45% monounsaturated fatty acid, and âˆ¼20% polyunsaturated fatty acid; and simple sugars were fixed at 70 Â± 5 g/day (absolute grams) in both diets. Daily calories were partitioned as 25% (breakfast), 25% (lunch), and 30% (dinner), and the remaining 20% was divided into snacks (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Both diets consisted of mainly low (â‰¤55) to moderate (56â€“69) glycemic index foods (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).</p>
                <p>Diets were matched in kilocalories per day on the basis of IOM recommendations to support weight gain of 7â€“11.5 kg for overweight women and 5â€“9 kg for women with obesity (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Weight was measured at each visit. The estimated energy requirement was revisited at 34 weeksâ€™ gestation on the basis of weight gain (<ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.2337/figshare.23905920" ext-link-type="uri">Supplementary Table 3</ext-link>).</p>
                <p>Prepregnancy weight was self-reported and verified at the first-trimester prenatal visit. Perinatal outcomes were recorded from the electronic health record. Small for gestational age (â‰¤10th percentile) and large for gestational age (â‰¥90th percentile) conditions were calculated using local and international (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) standards; rates were identical using both methods.</p>
                <p>Diet logs were collected and analyzed weekly (Nutrition Data System for Research, University of Minnesota, 2010) to assess adherence. Compliance was calculated by the percentage of provided meals consumed per day. Participants reported any meal deviation; &gt;90% of meals provided were consumed, confirmed by record review.</p>

                <p>On day 1 and at 36â€“37 weeksâ€™ gestation, a fasting (8â€“10 h) blood sample was collected to measure hemoglobin A<sub>1c</sub> (30â€“31 weeksâ€™ gestation only) glucose, insulin, TG, and FFA levels. Each woman wore a blinded Dexcom G4 Platinum CGM (Dexcom, Inc.). Glucose variables were defined and data were collected, handled, and analyzed as we have published (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Venous blood samples were obtained at âˆ’15, 0, then at 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after a 75-g glucose load for glucose and insulin. Total area under the curve (AUC) values for glucose and insulin were calculated by the trapezoidal method. Whole-body insulin sensitivity was calculated using the Matsuda Index (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) as was the liver IR index. Fasting IR was estimated by the HOMA-IR, calculated as (fasting insulin [mU/L] â‹… fasting glucose [mmol/L])/22.5.</p>
                <p>A cord blood sample was collected at delivery to measure C-peptide, glucose, and insulin levels. Samples were available for âˆ¼60% of newborns.</p>

                <title>Statistical Analyses</title>
                <p>The primary end point for this study was the difference in NB%fat between diet groups. A priori, power was based on our preliminary data (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) and other published data to support a clinically significant difference in NB%fat. To detect a 3.4% difference in NB%fat by PEA POD (SD, 4%), 46 participants (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 23/group) would be required. Power calculations were derived using a two-sided two-sample <italic toggle="yes">t</italic> test assuming Î± = 0.05 and 1 âˆ’ Î² = 0.8. Data are reported as mean Â± SEM.

                <p>To confirm balanced groups after randomization, two-sample <italic toggle="yes">t</italic> tests were performed on baseline measures for the 46 women who completed the study, and differences between post-diet measures between groups were assessed with two-sample <italic toggle="yes">t</italic> tests at Î± = 0.05. Multiple imputation (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) was performed for four missing PEA POD measures using predictive mean matching as implemented in the R package <italic toggle="yes">mice</italic> (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), with infant sex, %FM by the Slaughter etÂ al. equation (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), %FM by the Catalano etÂ al.

We created, analyzed, and combined 100 data sets to obtain group mean PEA POD measures and test for differences between the groups. As a sensitivity analysis, Bayesian linear-regression multiple imputation was also performed. For OGTT and CGM measures, point estimates of the between-group differences at 36â€“37 weeksâ€™ gestation (CHOICE âˆ’ LC/CONV), and within-group changes (36â€“37 âˆ’ 30â€“31 weeksâ€™ gestation) are presented, along with corresponding 95% CIs.</p>

              <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
              <p>In this controlled, prospective RCT of a conventional lower-CHO diet compared with the CHOICE diet in the setting of GDM, we did not find an effect on NB% fat, the primary outcome, contrary to our hypothesis. We have further demonstrated that randomization to a conventional lower-CHO diet compared with CHOICE led to no difference in maternal 24-h glycemia or IR indices. The trial was designed to overcome three of the biggest limitations in nutrition studies within diabetes in pregnancy (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>): <italic toggle="yes">1</italic>) low adherence due to the lack of provided diets; <italic toggle="yes">2</italic>) differences in dietary simple sugars, protein, fiber, total energy, and GWG; and <italic toggle="yes">3</italic>) the confounding effect of treatment with insulin or a hypoglycemic agent. While both diets controlled maternal glucose within conventional targets (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic toggle="yes">Bâ€“D</italic></xref>), those in the LC/CONV group had lower %time &gt;120 mg/dL (8%) and lower nocturnal AUC, although the nocturnal %TIR was not different. The 24-h glucose AUC and %TIR (nocturnal, 24 h) were no different between groups, nor were fasting, 1-h, and 2-h postprandial glucose levels by CGM. Notably, only two women in the LC/CONV arm and one in the CHOICE arm required pharmacologic treatment.</p>
              <p>Grounded in the principle that some polysaccharides and starches (i.e., whole grains, legumes) tend to mitigate a sharp increase in postprandial glucose (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), we powered this study to detect a between-group difference in NB%fat. This was based on the hypothesis that CHOICE could blunt postprandial glucose and the increase of IR in pregnancy by decreasing total and saturated fats, and might, thereby, reduce fetal-placental glycemia and FFA and TG exposure over 24 h (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), resulting in lower NB%fat. The lack of difference in NB%fat between groups was somewhat surprising to us but is likely supported by the fact that despite the 20% difference in CHO and fat content, other known drivers of fetal overgrowth were similar between groups: maternal glycemic control was excellent; 24-h CGM, a surrogate for total potential fetal glucose exposure (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), was not different; there were no between-diet differences in simple sugars; and saturated fat was limited to 35% in both groups. This may partially explain the lack of statistical difference in FFA and TG levels and estimates of IR between diet groups at 36â€“37 weeks of gestation. Importantly, total GWG and weight gain during the intervention were similar (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), the diets were eucaloric, and women were highly adherent (&gt;90%) to the treatment.</p>
              <p>Although these diets targeted a lower CHO (40%), higher fat (45%) percentage of total calories in the LC/CONV diet versus the CHOICE diet (60% CHO and 25% fat), higher BMI in these participants required higher total calories, which resulted in total CHO intake above the â‰¥175 g/day IOM threshold (214 g/day in the LC/CONV diet compared with 316 g/day CHO in the CHOICE diet), with a total fat difference of âˆ¼47 g/day (<ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.2337/figshare.23905920" ext-link-type="uri">Supplementary Table 2</ext-link>). Despite an âˆ¼100 g/day difference of mainly complex CHO, women in both diet arms achieved similar glycemic control within conventional targets of fasting glucose &lt;95 mg/dL and 1- and 2-h postprandial concentrations of 140 and 120 mg/dL, respectively (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). The 72-h CGM data demonstrated no differences in fasting, postprandial, and 24-h glycemia between groups at 30â€“31 and 36â€“37 weeksâ€™ gestation. Although women in both groups lowered their 1-h postprandial and 24-h glucose AUC, those in the CHOICE group statistically lowered their 1-h postprandial glucose over time (âˆ’10 mg/dL), and women in the LC/CONV group lowered their 24-h AUC. We have previously suggested lower glycemic targets (1-h, 122 mg/dL; 2-h postprandial, 110 mg/dL) based on patterns of glycemia in normal pregnancy (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>); in this study, women in both diet arms met those targets (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic toggle="yes">Bâ€“D</italic></xref>).</p>
              <p>We believed it important to separate nocturnal %TIR and define it as lower (63â€“100 mg/dL) than 24-h %TIR (63â€“140 mg/dL). The hours of 2330â€“0630 h were chosen to represent the nocturnal period, when women were most likely to be fasting. If a participant had breakfast before 0630, the nocturnal period was adjusted. Although the nocturnal AUC was lower between groups at 36â€“37 weeksâ€™ gestation in the LC/CONV group, the nocturnal %TIR was not different. We recognize challenges in accurately defining a nocturnal period, which may change from day to day. Interestingly, when defining the nocturnal targets as 63â€“100 mg/dL, women in both diet arms had similar but poorer nocturnal %TIR compared with the 24-h %TIR (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic toggle="yes">D</italic></xref>). Nocturnal %TIR is not a standard clinical metric, but %TIR over 24-h, when defined as 63â€“140 mg/dL, may dismiss nocturnal hyperglycemia up to 140 mg/dL. This may be critically important to fetal overgrowth, because the Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes study (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) demonstrated that fasting hyperglycemia appears to drive large for gestational age more than a postâ€“oral glucose load. Future research tied to maternalâ€“fetal outcomes in which nocturnal versus daytime %TIR at trimester-specific time periods is indicated.</p>
              <p>In adapting a nutrition pattern more liberal in complex CHO for GDM, several considerations bear mention. Fears that a diet of 50â€“60% CHO might result in excessive weight gain, postprandial hyperglycemia (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), fetal hyperinsulinemia, and excess fetal fat accretion have been raised. Three previous nutrition RCTs in the setting of GDM reported no difference in weight gain between a lower versus a higher CHO diet during the intervention period (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Of note, in the present study, women in the LC/CONV group gained 2 kg over the IOM guideline (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) for total GWG, and in the CHOICE group, women gained 1 kg above that guideline weight, explained by weight gained before the GDM diagnosis. Once enrolled, weight gain was nearly identical (1.8â€“1.9 kg) given the diets were matched in calories based on BMI, simple sugars were fixed, and CHOs were low-medium in glycemic index. Studies of low glycemic index diets in pregnancy outside of GDM support less GWG from reduced energy intake (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>), probably linked to increased satiety. A heightened insulin response to higher simple CHOs may further tax the Î²-cells in women already at risk for later type 2 diabetes (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). It is also possible that higher dietary CHO from simple sugars or higher fat could result in higher plasma TG levels (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), an increasingly recognized driver of fetal overgrowth in pregnant women with obesity (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). In this study, where simple sugars were fixed and saturated fats were limited, IR indices were not different; fasting TG increased similarly, likely under the influence of rising placental estrogen.</p>
              <p>In both diet groups, the data generated in this RCT demonstrate that nutrition therapy alone was successful when weight gain, saturated fats, and simple sugars were limited. A recent systematic review of 18 RCTs (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = &gt;1,000 women) revealed that any improvement in dietary pattern (versus the control) after GDM diagnosis was associated with lower fasting and postprandial glucose levels, less need for insulin, and lower infant birth weight (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Although women in the CHOICE group demonstrated a within-group improved glucose response to a 75-g OGTT, we acknowledge that recent data suggest the higher CHO intake, particularly within 24 h preceding the OGTT, may partially explain this finding (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Women in the CHOICE group demonstrated a within-group, reduced basal IR by HOMA-IR, whereas those in the LC/CONV group demonstrated a within-group decrease in 24-h glucose AUC by CGM. Of concern with CHO restriction is increased fat intake that exacerbates IR, particularly if calories are not limited, promoting overnutrition and driving fetal overgrowth. This concern was not validated here; fasting FFA and TG levels were not different between groups, but women randomized to the LC/CONV diet demonstrated a within-group reduced fasting FFA level. We speculate that by limiting simple sugars to 68â€“70 g/day in both diets and restricting saturated fats to 35% of total fat (34 g/day in LC/CONV vs. 18 g/day in CHOICE; <ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.2337/figshare.23905920" ext-link-type="uri">Supplementary Table 2</ext-link>), both diets would be considered heart healthy, which is important because women with GDM have an increased risk for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.</p>
              <p>One of the biggest barriers to successful nutrition therapy in GDM is diet adherence. Rigid CHO restriction has been described as confining and arduous, infringes on cultural food patterns, and may contribute to depression and anxiety in GDM (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). In the only RCT to date in which women with GDM were randomized to 135 g vs. 180â€“200 g/day of CHO, only 20% and 65%, respectively, met the intervention target (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). The striking increase in GDM among multiracial women demands that customizable options for nutrition therapy be identified. We have identified by systematic review that a range of 47â€“70% dietary CHO content supports normal fetal growth patterns (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>), which is further suggested by the present study findings. We have published adaptability of the CHOICE diet to multicultural diet patterns (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) and suggest that substituting some calories from fat and liberalizing complex CHOs may present new alternatives for personalized nutrition therapy in GDM that promote adherence and food enjoyment in a culturally acceptable way.</p>
              <p>This study has some limitations. The study was highly controlled, all foods were provided, and energy intake was controlled, underscoring that the data demonstrate dietary efficacy but possibly not effectiveness in a free-living population. Furthermore, both diets were healthy in that simple sugars and saturated fats were not in excess. The study diets were designed to meet targets as percentages of total energy intake, not grams of CHO per day. Because of this, in the context of higher BMI, the CHO intake in both diets exceeded 200 g/day; by some GDM nutrition guidelines that define a low CHO diet by absolute grams/day, the conventional diet here might not be considered low CHO. The NB%fat measures were taken at âˆ¼13 days of life in both groups rather than at 48 h, due to some deliveries at other hospitals. Breastfed newborns lose some adiposity during the first days of life and regain it by 5 days according to a study by Roggero et al. (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>); notably, 80% of our participants exclusively breastfed. Furthermore, it has been shown that NB%fat by PEA POD at 1â€“2 weeks for girls and boys are within 1â€“2% of 48-h measures (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). We were not powered to detect sex differences in our primary outcome, although sex was balanced between groups. Heterogeneity in the response to diet therapy is likely and high-quality, real-world comparative-effectiveness trials during pregnancy across women are needed. Although our confidence in the lack of NB%fat difference is high, we acknowledge that this does not demonstrate noninferiority, because we were not powered to address this question.</p>
              <p>In this prospective RCT during which all meals were provided, our a priori hypotheses that the two diets would result in different maternal and infant outcomes were not supported by the data. Although the %time &gt;120 mg/dL was statistically higher (8%) in the CHOICE group, as was the nocturnal glucose AUC, we demonstrated no between-group differences in NB%fat (primary outcome), %TIR, or 24-h glycemia after 7â€“8 weeks of nutrition therapy with a conventional lower-CHO or a higher-complex-CHO CHOICE diet. Despite an âˆ¼100 g/day difference in CHO intake, glycemia was well controlled in both arms. These data suggest that flexibility in dietary CHO is possible while limiting simple sugars, saturated fats, and excess calories, paving the way for expanded and personalized options for nutrition therapy in GDM.</p>
