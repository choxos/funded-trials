              <abstract>
                <p>Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is characterized by the accumulation of malignant blasts with impaired differentiation programs caused by recurrent mutations, such as the isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutations found in 15% of AML patients. These mutations result in the production of the oncometabolite (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), leading to a hypermethylation phenotype that dysregulates hematopoietic differentiation. In this study, we identified mutant R132H IDH1-specific gene signatures regulated by key transcription factors, particularly CEBPα, involved in myeloid differentiation and retinoid responsiveness. We show that treatment with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) at clinically achievable doses markedly enhanced terminal granulocytic differentiation in AML cell lines, primary patient samples, and a xenograft mouse model carrying mutant IDH1. Moreover, treatment with a cell-permeable form of 2-HG sensitized wild-type IDH1 AML cells to ATRA-induced myeloid differentiation, whereas inhibition of 2-HG production significantly reduced ATRA effects in mutant IDH1 cells. ATRA treatment specifically decreased cell viability and induced apoptosis of mutant IDH1 blasts in vitro. ATRA also reduced tumor burden of mutant IDH1 AML cells xenografted in NOD–Scid–IL2rγ<sup>null</sup> mice and markedly increased overall survival, revealing a potent antileukemic effect of ATRA in the presence of IDH1 mutation. This therapeutic strategy holds promise for this AML patient subgroup in future clinical studies.</p>

            <p>Despite progress in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) therapy, most patients relapse and die from the disease as a result of residual chemoresistant blasts. Thus, targeting this population is a mandatory requirement for effective AML therapy. In this context, mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) or IDH2 represent a promising therapeutic target. These mutations, originally identified in glioma (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Dang et al., 2009</xref>), were then discovered in 15% of AML patients (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Mardis et al., 2009</xref>) and have been found in an increasingly diverse set of other neoplasms, including hematological malignancies of both lymphoid and myeloid lineages (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Fathi et al., 2014</xref>). Importantly, IDH mutations, which lead to the production of the oncometabolite (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), have been detected in preleukemic hematopoietic stem and multipotent progenitor cells as a persistent reservoir of surviving chemotherapeutic-resistant cells at remission (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Shlush et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, targeting IDH mutant cells might be essential to achieving long-term remission in the AML subgroup with IDH mutation.</p>
            <p>An increasing number of studies have demonstrated that IDH1/2 mutations disrupt differentiation programs in nontransformed cells (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 2012</xref>), as well as in hematopoietic and leukemic cells (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Figueroa et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Sasaki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Losman et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, tumors with IDH1/2 mutations exhibit a distinctive profile of 2-HG–dependent DNA and histone hypermethylation that alters gene expression (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Figueroa et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Turcan et al., 2012</xref>), particularly for several genes involved in retinoic acid (RA) metabolism and signaling pathways (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Chou et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Guilhamon et al., 2013</xref>). Because RA is involved in granulocytic differentiation, we sought to specifically investigate the effects of all-trans-RA (ATRA) in the presence of the IDH1–R132H mutation in AML.</p>
            <p>Our gene expression analyses demonstrate that IDH1–R132H mutation primes AML blasts to the granulomonocytic differentiation pathway compared with WT IDH1 AML cells and increases both H3K4me3 occupancy in the <italic>CEPBα</italic> gene promoter and expression of CEBPα, as well as downstream CEBPα target genes. Furthermore, we show a significant deregulation of RA-responsive target genes by IDH1–R132H mutation. Collectively, these observations suggest that 2-HG production resulting from IDH1 mutation biases hematopoietic differentiation toward the granulocytic lineage and further sensitizes mutant cells to ATRA-induced differentiation. Finally, we showed that the prodifferentiating effects of ATRA observed in the presence of IDH1 mutation at clinically achievable concentrations lead to a potent antileukemic response in AML cell lines and primary patient samples both in vitro and in vivo.</p>

              <title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>As IDH mutations induce the production of neomorphic metabolite 2-HG, recent reports of 2-HG–dependent epigenetic programs (especially in genes involved in retinoid signaling pathways) are intriguing (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Chou et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Guilhamon et al., 2013</xref>). Seeking to determine whether AML cell lines engineered to express either the WT or mutant form of IDH1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>) and controlled for their production of 2-HG and α-ketoglutarate (α-KG; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, B and C</xref>) have a specific gene signature, the gene expression profile of HL60 cells expressing the mutant IDH1–R132H was compared with WT cells by microarrays covering 23,924 human genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>). Computational analyses of these datasets identified two subsets of down- and up-regulated genes in mutant IDH1–R132H cells (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20150736/DC1" id="supp1">Table S1</ext-link>) and their Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) revealed significant enrichment of these signatures in published transcriptomes of 417 AML patients (cohort data available under Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) accession no. <ext-link ext-link-type="NCBI:geo" xlink:href="GSE6891">GSE6891</ext-link>; <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Verhaak et al., 2009</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20150736/DC1" id="supp2">Fig. S1, A and B</ext-link>), which validated our gene profiles specific to AML cells expressing mutant IDH1. Classification of biological processes down- or up-regulated by IDH1–R132H mutation particularly highlighted its role in immune responses, signaling pathways, metabolic processes, and cell differentiation (Table S1 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>).</p>

              <p>Furthermore, functional annotation of IDH1–R132H target genes revealed an enrichment of genes previously described as responsive to or regulated by several key transcription factors (TFs) essential for myelopoiesis, such as PU.1, RUNX1, GATA1, MECOM, MNDA, CEBPβ, and CEBPε (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20150736/DC1" id="supp3">Table S2</ext-link> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>), and required for commitment to the monocytic and granulocytic lineages, such as CEBPα (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>). IDH1–R132H mutation also led to an increase in CEBPα expression at the RNA and protein level in both primary AML specimens (323 WT vs. 68 mutant IDH patients, respectively; GEO accession no. <ext-link ext-link-type="NCBI:geo" xlink:href="GSE6891">GSE6891</ext-link>; <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Verhaak et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>) and two AML cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, C and D</xref>).

Because a peak of CEBPα expression occurred at the granulocyte-monocytic progenitor step of normal myelopoiesis (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Radomska et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Bagger et al., 2013</xref>; HemaExplorer database; Fig. S1 C), it is likely that IDH1–R132H mutation can drive AML blasts to this differentiation pathway through increased CEBPα expression. RT-PCR and immunophenotypical flow analyses indicated a significant increase in CEBPα-target genes RXRα, EMILIN, and CD11b (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Laiosa et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Hasemann et al., 2014</xref>) in the presence of mutant IDH1–R132H compared with WT IDH1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, F–I</xref>). Quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation (qChIP) experiments showed that mutant IDH1–R132H influences the recruitment of endogenous CEBPα to several of these target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 H</xref>). Moreover, IDH1–R132H mutation also modulated other myeloid differentiation-associated TFs (CEBPβ, PU.1, and RUNX1) and genes involved in the differentiation-related MAPK signaling pathway and associated metabolic processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>; Table S1 and S2), thus inducing a myeloid differentiation bias in these cells. Our results are consistent with recently published data demonstrating that IDH mutations favor differentiation toward the granulomonocytic lineage (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Sasaki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Kats et al., 2014</xref>), while blocking erythroid differentiation (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Losman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2013a</xref>). It is noteworthy that the reintroduction of the CEBPα TF in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells has the same effects as IDH1–R132H mutation in biasing differentiation toward the granulomonocytic lineage, while blocking the erythroid differentiation (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Schepers et al., 2007</xref>). Finally, the overexpression of CEBPα sensitizes cells to differentiation into the granulocytic lineage with various agents (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Ferrari-Amorotti et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
              <p>Interestingly, gene expression analyses also revealed that the IDH1–R132H mutation gene signature is highly enriched in genes responsive to treatment with small molecules such as retinoids (e.g., ATRA or RA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 J</xref>), especially in promyelocytic leukemia (PML)/RA receptor α–driven acute promyelocytic leukemic (APL) cell lines and patients (Fig. S1 D) or, in some cases, of non-APL primary cells (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Altucci et al., 2005</xref>). These observations corroborate a recently published metaanalysis showing a dysregulation of several genes involved in RA-related pathways in other cancers with IDH1–R132 (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Guilhamon et al., 2013</xref>). Collectively, our gene expression analyses indicate that IDH1–R132H mutation can prime AML blasts toward granulomonocytic differentiation through the activation of the CEBPα pathway and could sensitize cells to ATRA-induced differentiation through the regulation of ATRA-responsive gene expression.</p>
              <p>We tested this hypothesis using 25 primary AML patient specimens screened for their IDH1/2 mutational status in our cohort of 384 AML patients from Toulouse Hospital, which exhibit similar clinical features and distribution as those previously described in the literature (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Abbas et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Green et al., 2011</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20150736/DC1" id="supp4">Table S3</ext-link> and<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20150736/DC1" id="supp5"> S4</ext-link>). We found that a clinically relevant concentration (1 µM) of ATRA induced the nuclear lobulation specifically associated with neutrophilic differentiation in eight primary AML patient samples harboring the IDH1–R132H mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>) and producing 2-HG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>). Moreover, treatment with ATRA was sufficient to increase the percentage of AML blasts expressing granulomonocytic differentiation markers (e.g., CD11b, CD15, and CD14) in 11 primary mutant IDH1–R132H AML samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>). Similar results were obtained for clinically ATRA-responsive APL samples used as a positive control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, A and C</xref>). In contrast, no increase in morphological changes and the CD14 marker, and only very modest decrease or increase in CD11b and CD15, respectively, were observed at any time point after ATRA treatment of primary AML blasts expressing WT IDH1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, A and C</xref>). Consistent with data in primary AML cells, we observed significantly higher ATRA-induced increase of the CD11b myeloid differentiation marker in two cell lines with the IDH1–R132H mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>). These results were reproduced in two independent clones of each category (CTL, IDH1–WT, and IDH1–R132H; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>) in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>). Consistent with well-described works in the literature (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Radomska et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Altucci et al., 2005</xref>), our control and WT IDH1 AML cell lines respond to ATRA but at a much lower level than IDH1–R132H AML cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, A–C</xref>). ATRA also triggered granulocytic differentiation of mutant IDH1–R132H cells, as indicated by increased granulocytic enzyme activity measured with the nitrotetrazolium blue (NBT) reduction assay after 12 d (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 D</xref>). Furthermore, gene expression profiling identified a 2-HG– and mutant IDH1–specific subset of 61 and 104 ATRA differentially expressed genes, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 E</xref>). This gene signature is enriched in several TFs (e.g., RUNX1, PU.1, and CEBPε) modulating myeloid differentiation genes (e.g., IER3, PRAM1, and vimentin) and TFs (e.g., IRF1/7, STAT1, and PML) linked to IFN signaling (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20150736/DC1" id="supp6">Table S5</ext-link>). Interestingly, ATRA-induced genes under PU.1 or CEBPε do not fully overlap with those induced by IDH1–R132H mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 E</xref> vs. Table S2), and IFN-stimulated genes are activated by RA (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Chelbi-Alix and Pelicano, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Shen et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting that cross talk may occur between these two distinct transcriptional programs.</p>

              <p>Because ATRA-induced CD11b expression correlates with the expression of IDH1–R132H protein and with the level of 2-HG production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, A–C</xref> compared with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>), we asked whether exogenous 2-HG would sensitize AML cells to ATRA-induced differentiation. Pretreatment with a cell-permeable form of 2-HG (1-octyl-[R]-2-HG) increased the intracellular 2-HG concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 F</xref>) and sensitized NB4, HL60, and MOLM14 cells to ATRA-induced differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 G</xref>). In contrast, the inhibition of IDH1–R132H activity using a mutant IDH1–specific inhibitor AGI-5198 significantly reduced both the production of 2-HG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 H</xref>) and the sensitivity of mutant IDH1–R132H cells to ATRA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 I</xref>). This confirms that 2-HG production is, at least in part, responsible for the enhanced sensitivity of IDH1–R132H expressing cells to ATRA-induced differentiation.</p>
              <p>We also tested whether ATRA-induced terminal differentiation would preferentially lead to the reduction of cell proliferation and to cell death of mutant IDH1–R132H AML cells in vitro<italic>.</italic> As expected, 10-d treatment with ATRA induced a significant decrease in cell viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref>) in mutant IDH1–R132H cells without affecting WT or control IDH1 cells. Moreover, ATRA treatment induced a mutant IDH1–specific apoptotic cell death, as shown by the increase of the Annexin V marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, B and C</xref>) and cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase and caspase-3, specifically in mutant IDH1–R132H AML cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 D</xref>). This correlated with a marked decrease of antiapoptotic B cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 D</xref>) in mutant IDH1–R132H cells. It is notable that it has been recently demonstrated that mutant IDH1/2 AML cells exhibited BCL2 dependency (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Chan et al., 2015</xref>). Altogether, the reduction of cell viability and the induction of apoptosis led to a specific and marked reduction in the size and number of L-CFUs after ATRA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, E and F</xref>).</p>

              <p>In summary, IDH1 mutation and its (R)-2-HG dysregulate downstream target pathways of myeloid-specific TFs, especially CEBPα, priming mutant IDH1–R132H AML blasts to the granulomonocytic lineage. Moreover, ATRA treatment down-regulates the expression of the protooncogenic protein BCL2, followed by the reduction of cell viability through the induction of apoptotic cell death in vitro. ATRA also has an in vivo antileukemic effect, specifically in mutant IDH1–R132H AML cells. These data suggest that IDH1–R132H mutation could be a valuable biomarker to select AML patients for ATRA treatment. Results from clinical trials with ATRA have been conflicting (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Schlenk et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Burnett et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Nazha et al., 2013</xref>), but because IDH1 mutational status of those patients was not monitored in these studies, it would also be enlightening to reanalyze results of clinical trials conducted in non-APL patients to address the impact of IDH mutations on ATRA therapy. Interestingly, high serum 2-HG levels represented a negative prognostic factor independent of other clinical and molecular features in AML patients (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">DiNardo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Janin et al., 2014</xref>). Our observation that 2-HG levels correlate with the ability of ATRA to induce terminal differentiation further support the contention that this therapeutic strategy is likely to be most relevant for the category of AML patients producing highest levels of 2-HG and would be an alternative therapeutic strategy for AML patients developing resistance to mutant IDH inhibitors. It is noteworthy that this therapeutic approach may also be relevant and of benefit for AML patients harboring IDH2 mutations. Because IDH1 mutations are present in preleukemic hematopoietic stem cells and systematically conserved at relapse, this therapeutic strategy holds promise to specifically achieve a long-term remission for this AML patient subgroup.</p>

In accordance with French law, HIMIP collection has been declared to the Ministry of Higher Education and Research (CD 2008–307 collection 1) and a transfer agreement was obtained (AC 2008–129) after approbation by ethical committees (Comité de Protection des Personnes Sud-ouest et Oustremer II). Clinical and biological annotations of the samples have been declared to the Comité National Informatique et Libertés (i.e., Data Processing and Liberties National Committee). All patients were diagnosed at the Department of Hematology (CHU, Toulouse, France). Their characteristics are summarized in Table S3. Samples containing at least 80% blasts were grown in H4230 methylcellulose medium (STEMCELL Technologies) and ATRA or the control. Primary patient AML cells were plated in 35-mm Petri dishes in duplicate with or without ATRA at 1 µM. After 12-d incubation in a humidified CO<sub>2</sub> incubator, cells were washed three times with PBS at 37°C. If the patient blasts were known to not grow in methyl cellulose medium (assessed routinely at diagnosis in our center), they were co-cultured with human mesenchymal stem cells in IMDM (Life Technologies) supplemented with 15% bovine serum albumin, insulin, and transferrin (STEMCELL Technologies), 100 U/ml of penicillin and streptomycin (Invitrogen), 5 µM β-mercaptoethanol (Invitrogen), 1 mM pyruvate (Sigma-Aldrich), MEM 1X (Sigma-Aldrich), 100 ng/ml DNase (MP Biomedicals), 10 ng/ml hIL3, 100 ng/ml hSCF, and 10 ng/ml human thrombopoietin (all from R&amp;D Systems) at 10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml. All the samples were then processed for treatment with different reagents.</p>

                  <p>Targeted HPLC-MS/MS experiments were performed using an Acquity HPLC system coupled to a triple-quadrupole Xevo TQ MS (Waters Corp.). The software interface was MassLynx (version 4.1). Chromatographic separation was performed on Sequant ZICpHILIC 5 µm, 2.1 × 150 mm at 15°C (Merck). Mobile phase A consisted of an aqueous buffer of 10 mM of ammonium carbonate in water with ammonium hydroxide to adjust basicity to pH 10.5, and mobile phase B of 100% AcN. Chromatographic elution was achieved with a flow rate of 200 µl/min. After injection of 10 µl sample, elution started with an isocratic step of 1 min at 80% B, followed by a linear gradient from 80 to 40% of phase B from 1 to 6 min. The chromatographic system was then rinsed for 5 min at 0% phase B, and the run was ended with an equilibration step of 9 min. The column effluent was directly introduced into the electrospray source of the mass spectrometer, and analyses were performed in the negative ion mode. Source parameters were as follows: droplet evaporation temperature, 350°C; desolvation and cone gas flow rates, (L/h) 650 and 30; capillary voltage, −2.5 kV. Mass resolution parameters LM 1 and HM 1 were fixed at 3 and 15, respectively. MRM transitions were optimized for 2-HG and α-KG detection. For 2-HG, the MRM transition m/z 147 to 129 was monitored with a collision energy of 12 eV and a cone voltage of 15 V. For α-KG the MRM transition m/z 144 to 101 was monitored with a collision energy of 10 eV and a cone voltage of 12 V. MassLynx software was used for peak detection and integration.</p>

Glycine was added at 125 mM final for 5 min to stop the cross-linking. Cells were then rinsed with cold PBS. Cell nuclei were isolated after incubation for 5 min on ice in buffer A (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.8, 10 mM KCl, 0.25% Triton X-100, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.5 mM EGTA, supplemented with protease inhibitors). After centrifugation, nuclei were resuspended in buffer B (10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, and protease inhibitors) for 10 min on ice. Nuclei were lysed and chromatin extracted with lysis buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 8.1, 40 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.05% NaDoc, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, and protease inhibitors) at a final concentration corresponding to 10 million cells/ml. Chromatin sonication was achieved with a sonicator (epishear; Active Motif). MDM2 ChIP was performed by incubating 500 µl (prepared from 5 million cells) of chromatin prepared from H1299 cells with 20 µl of protein G-Dynabeads (Life Technologies) and 5 mg of CEBPα (C-18; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) goat polyclonal antibody, or an irrelevant antibody.

Input and immunoprecipitated DNA were decrosslinked overnight at 65°C, diluted in TE, and incubated first with RNaseA (37°C, 45 min), and then with proteinase K (55°C, 45 min). Proteins were removed with phenol-chloroform-isomalylic-alcohol extraction and DNA was recovered by chromatography (nucleospin extract II columns; Macherey-Nagel). For ChIP-qPCR, 1/100 (0.5 µl) of input or immunoprecipitated DNA was analyzed by qPCR with SYBR green (Takara Bio Inc.) on a LightCycler 480 apparatus (Roche). Results are represented as the mean value of at least three independent experiments of immunoprecipitated chromatin (percentage of input) with the indicated antibodies after normalization using a control ChIP performed with an irrelevant antibody.

                  <p>CEL files generated after upon array scanning were imported into the Partek Genomics Suite (GS) 6.6 for further analysis. For this purpose, Partek options were set up for GC-content adjustment, robust multiarray background correction, quantile normalization, log<sub>2</sub> transformation, and mean summarization. Data were first preprocessed to estimate transcript cluster expression levels from raw probe signal intensities. Resulting expression data were then imported into R statistical environment for further processing. First, nonspecific filtering was applied to keep only transcript clusters, which belong to the main category. Next, quality of the dataset was assessed through box plots, relative log expressions, and pairwise sample correlations. Principal variance component analysis (PVCA) was also applied to the data. This method estimates the percentage of variability relative to each experimental parameter. As principal variance component analysis revealed a batch effect, the removebatcheffect method of LIMMA package (R/Bioconductor) was used to correct for this effect. Finally, the Rank Product algorithm was used to estimate the statistical significance of the difference in gene expression between different conditions. Genes with pfp &lt;0.05 and absolute fold change ≥1.5 were considered to be differentially expressed.</p>

The significance of the association between each list and functions or canonical pathways was measured by Fisher’s exact test. As a result, a p-value was obtained, determining the probability that the association between the genes in our dataset and a function or canonical pathway can be explained by chance alone. Transcriptional gene regulatory networks were built based on the molecular relationship repertoire referenced in the Genomatix library. The Genomatix Upstream Regulators analytic was also used to identify the transcriptional regulators that could explain the experimental gene expression patterns, predict their activation state, and determine the biological functions affected by the regulatory cascade.
