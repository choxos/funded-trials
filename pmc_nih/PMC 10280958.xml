                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Gonorrhea and chlamydia are the most common sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) among men who have sex with men (MSM) in China. Previous studies have shown pay-it-forward (PIF) interventions to be associated with a substantial increase in gonorrhea and chlamydia test uptake compared to standard-of-care. We propose a 'pay-it-forward' gonorrhea and chlamydia testing randomized controlled trial (PIONEER). The trial would evaluate the effectiveness of two pay-it-forward strategies in promoting testing uptake compared to the standard of care (in which men pay for their tests out-of-pocket) among MSM and male STD patients in China.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">PIONEER will be a three-armed, pragmatic cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT), conducted across 12 clinics (six MSM-led and six public STD clinics) to compare the effectiveness of three implementation strategies. Each facility will be randomized to a standard pay-it-forward intervention of gonorrhea/ chlamydia testing with minimal encouragement for testing, a community-engaged pay-it-forward arm, or a control arm where men pay for their tests out-of-pockets. The primary outcome will be dual gonorrhea/chlamydia test uptake. Secondary outcomes will include syphilis testing, amount donated in pay-it-forward, number of positive gonorrhea and chlamydia tests, and measures of antimicrobial resistance. A sequential transformative mixed methods design will be used to evaluate the implementation process in type 2 effectiveness-implementation hybrid design. Data sources will include survey on acceptability, and feelings and attitudes towards the interventions among participants; testing and treatment uptake data from clinic records, WeChat records, and qualitative data to gain insights into men's perceptions and attitudes towards the pay-it-forward, mechanisms driving uptake, and donating behaviors. Implementers and organizers will be interviewed about fidelity and adherence to protocol, sustainability of pay-it-forward intervention, and barriers and facilitators of implementing the intervention.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">PIONEER will substantially increase gonorrhea/chlamydia testing among MSM in China, providing an innovative and new financial mechanism to sustain STD screening among sexual minorities in low- and middle-income countries. This study will answer compelling scientific questions about how best to implement pay-it-forward and the individual and organizational characteristics that moderate it.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par21">Gonorrhea and chlamydia are among the four most common sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) worldwide and in China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The World Health Organization estimated 87 million new cases of gonorrhea and 127 million cases of chlamydia among people 15–49 years old based on a global systematic review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The prevalence of gonorrhea and chlamydia among men who have sex with men (MSM) in southern China has been reported as high as 12.5% and 18.2% respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par22">Gonorrhea and chlamydia infection are often asymptomatic at extragenital sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Hence, testing rates remain low among most high-risk populations, including MSM. These low testing rates pose a public health concern since gonorrhea and chlamydia infection are known to increase the risk of HIV acquisition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] recommend routine gonorrhea and chlamydia testing for sexually active MSM. Studies in different provinces of China consistently report that less than half of MSM have ever been tested for gonorrhea and chlamydia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Low testing rates are problematic because this allows onward gonorrhea and chlamydia transmission.</p>
              <p id="Par23">Low testing rates are likely related to fees and minimal community engagement. User fees are common in many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) for STD testing and discourage test uptake, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] decreasing opportunities for prompt treatment and public health interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Gonorrhea and chlamydia testing in China are expensive relative to local incomes (approximately USD 20 per test) and not covered by health insurance or other social support systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. This decreases access to and uptake of routine gonorrhea and chlamydia testing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Community engagement strategies have been an effective tool to increase access in other settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], yet community engagement in STD testing in China is weak [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Many MSM-focused campaigns for STD testing are driven by public health authorities and have limited authentic input from local end-users [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. This limited participation may then diminish STD test uptake. In response to these financial and community barriers to STD testing, our team developed a pay-it-forward approach to gonorrhea and chlamydia testing for MSM. Additionally, gonococcal antimicrobial resistance in China is a major problem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], with a national surveillance study among 3,849 isolates showing that 18.6% of isolates were resistant to azithromycin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Expanding gonorrhea screening among MSM could prevent onward transmission, delaying the development of antibiotic resistance. However, several ecological studies have suggested widespread gonorrhea testing may lead to more antibiotic use and increased antibiotic resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Expanding gonorrhea testing within the high intensification arm of the trial will provide a unique environment for early gonorrhea detection and treatment.</p>
              <p id="Par24">Pay-it-forward is a strategy to increase uptake based on a social innovation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In pay-it-forward, a person receives a free STD test that is donated by the local community and is offered a chance to donate money to support testing for someone else in the future (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Overview of pay-it-forward. The figure summarizes the process underlying the concept of the pay-it-forward concept to be adapted in PIONEER</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12889_2023_16095_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>
              <p id="Par25">Pay-it-forward chains of giving are sometimes driven by unconnected generous individuals, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] but more often organized by a group with a common purpose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Studies have shown that pay-it-forward can be sustainable and promote generosity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par26">Our previous pay-it-forward research showed that the intervention was associated with a substantial increase in gonorrhea and chlamydia test uptake compared to standard-of-care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. However, there have been several limitations. First, past projects were mostly implemented only at MSM-led clinics and not public STD clinics. While MSM-led clinics are better positioned to organize MSM community engagement activities, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] this approach may miss out on MSM who prefer to attend public STD clinics. Second, MSM included in these studies were recruited from clinics in a central urban location [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The pay-it-forward intervention needs to be evaluated in additional cities and different types of clinics (i.e., both MSM-led and public STD clinics).</p>
              <p id="Par27">Given that our previous pay-it-forward research focused on the efficacy of pay-it-forward, more implementation research is needed to ensure the impact of this innovation. Lack of implementation evaluation limits our understanding of the implementation process, and community-engaged strategies are needed to maximize efficiency and effectiveness. These underscore the importance of implementation research to inform contextually appropriate strategies to implement pay-it-forward most effectively.</p>
              <p id="Par28">We propose the 'pay-it-forward gonorrhea and chlamydia testing pragmatic, cluster randomized controlled trial (PIONEER)' to examine the effectiveness of two intervention strategies involving different levels of community engagement. That is to translate the generosity created by the pay-it-forward approach into test-taking action and voluntary donations. In the standard approach, men receive the gift of a test and view messages promoting testing. In the community-engaged approach, men receive gifts, view tailored messages, are encouraged to create tailored messages of their own, and are invited to become part of a community of collaborators engaged in promoting gonorrhea/chlamydia testing. Community-engaged approaches are important for enhancing the contextual appropriateness of public health interventions and the possibility of success [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par29">This study is a Type 2 effectiveness-implementation hybrid design with two coprimary aims of determining the effectiveness of clinical interventions and the feasibility and potential utility of an implementation intervention or strategy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The co-primary aims are as follows:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par30">To compare the primary outcome of gonorrhea/chlamydia test uptake and secondary outcomes like amount donated (among those in the pay-it-forward arms), antimicrobial resistance measures, positive tests for gonorrhea and chlamydia, gratitude measures, and community solidarity measures in a standard pay-it-forward arm, a community-engaged pay-it-forward arm and a control arm using a three-arm cluster randomized controlled trial.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par31">To determine how pay-it-forward motivates testing and donations across the two intervention arms and how individual and organizational characteristics moderate these.</p></list-item></list></p>

                <title>Theories informing the PIONEER intervention</title>
                <p id="Par32">Our trial design and pay-it-forward strategies were informed by two theories related to gift giving and social reciprocity. First, Marcel Mauss and others have developed substantial theoretical and empirical literature describing gift-giving's expressive and instrumental function in specific social contexts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Second, the pay-it-forward intervention is a novel concept embedded in the upstream reciprocity theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Social reciprocity provides a framework to understand how STD testing could be normalized within local social relationships. The idea is that if someone is generous to you, it generates a 'recipient glow' that encourages you to be generous to others. In the context of pay-it-forward, the hypothesis is that someone receiving a gift feels obligated to be generous to the community by getting tested and contributing a gift in return.</p>

                <title>Principles guiding the design of community engagement elements</title>
                <p id="Par33">Our implementation strategies were developed based on co-creation approaches that engaged members of the target population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Community participation is essential to an intervention's acceptance and contextual appropriateness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. This is especially important for hard-to-reach sexual minority groups. Co-creation approaches involve collaboration between researchers and community members that involve joint decision-making on research goals, processes, and outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Evidence has shown that community engagement in developing intervention strategies is associated with better acceptance, adherence, and effectiveness of the interventions in changing behaviors in a good way [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. We have adopted co-creation approaches to guide the following activities: 1) organizing a co-creation group to co-create the community-engaged pay-it-forward strategy and forming shared leadership; 2) guiding the design of community engagement elements of the community-engaged strategy; 3) involving key stakeholders in various stages of the project to enhance appropriateness, acceptability, and feasibility.</p>

                <title>Design overview</title>
                <p id="Par34">Our trial will use a type 2 effectiveness-implementation hybrid study design that values intervention effectiveness and implementation process. Specifically, the PIONEER trial will be a three-arm, cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT), followed by a mixed-methods implementation evaluation study. The cluster RCT aims to compare the effectiveness of the three implementation strategies, and the implementation evaluation will investigate other domains of the implementation process guided by the RE-AIM framework. The study has been registered on clinicaltrials.gov with identification number: NCT05723263.</p>
                <p id="Par35">The cluster RCT will enroll 12 diverse clinics (i.e., six MSM-led and six public STD clinics) and stratify the randomization by clinic type. The clinics will be assigned to one of the three study arms: a standard pay-it-forward arm with minimal encouragement to get tested, a community-engaged pay-it-forward strategy, and a control arm in which men pay for their tests out-of-pocket. The standard pay-it-forward strategy, developed through our previous pay-it-forward research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], will have men who enter the clinic receive a free gonorrhea/chlamydia test alongside handwritten postcards from other MSM in the local community. The community-engaged strategy will include all the standard pay-it-forward components with additional community engagement activities. The gift recipients will be invited to submit handwritten postcards of their own, print images from instant cameras, or create videos promoting gonorrhea/chlamydia testing (to be viewed at the same clinic). Men who agree to participate will be invited to a hybrid digital and in-person pay-it-forward event where they meet other people who have donated and to related participatory activities organized by the local clinic to promote gonorrhea and chlamydia testing.</p>
                <p id="Par36">Mixed methods will be used to evaluate the implementation process with project implementers, organizers, and participants. Data will be obtained from multiple sources, including an online survey on participants' acceptability, appropriateness, feelings, and attitudes towards pay-it-forward as an intervention. We will also collate administrative data about test uptake, treatment rate, and qualitative data to gain insights into men's perceptions and attitudes towards the pay-it-forward strategies and the mechanisms driving uptake. Surveys and qualitative interviews will be conducted with implementers and organizers about fidelity and adherence to protocol, intention to continue and maintain a pay-it-forward intervention, and barriers and facilitators of implementation.</p>

                <title>Study setting and population</title>
                <p id="Par37">We will implement the study in the following Guangdong cities: Zhuhai, Foshan, Jiangmen Shenzhen, Zhanjiang, Dongguan, and Yunfu. These clinics were chosen because their respective cities have a higher burden of STDs, and findings would be potentially relevant in many cities.</p>
                <p id="Par38">The study settings between public STD clinics and MSM-led clinics would be different. One key obstacle to recruiting MSM in public STD clinics is that MSM is the risk of unintentional sexual identity disclosure due to justifiable fears about risks of stigma and discrimination from other men and health workers. Recruitment in public STD clinics will be extended to include all men visiting the public STD clinic regardless of sexual orientation to avoid the risk of unintentional disclosure. This will also lower the risk of MSM patients feeling and being unnecessarily 'targeted.'</p>
                <p id="Par39">Eligibility criteria for recruitment at public STD clinics include all men (regardless of sexual orientation) that are 1) 18 years and above; 2) have had sex over the past year; 3) have not tested for gonorrhea and chlamydia in the past year; 4) resided in the city in the past three months; 5) speak Mandarin or Cantonese, and 6) mentally capable of providing informed consent for gonorrhea and chlamydia testing. Only MSM recruited through this method will be included in the analytic sample. Data from non-MSM participants will be analyzed in a separate sub-study.</p>
                <p id="Par40">Inclusion criteria for recruitment at MSM-led clinics include all men who had anal sex with other men that are 1) at least 18 years old; 2) have had anal sex over the past year; 3) have not been tested for gonorrhea and chlamydia in the past year; 4) have resided in the city in the past three months; 5) speak Mandarin Chinese or Cantonese, and 6) mentally capable of providing informed consent to test for gonorrhea and chlamydia.</p>

                  <title>Approach and study team</title>
                  <p id="Par41">A key innovation of this trial study, relative to past pay-it-forward research, is developing and evaluating the community-engaged approach as an additional intervention arm. While upstream reciprocity is hypothesized to promote the pay-it-forward mechanism, simulation models of the process show that the "warm glow" does not guarantee sustainability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. In contrast, evidence shows that when combined with network reciprocity, where acts of altruism are reinforced by a community of collaborators, the probability of cooperation increases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. The two arms of our trial are designed to test these two hypotheses.</p>
                  <p id="Par42">The study will be managed through a consortium involving two academic centers (the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill and the Southern Medical University Dermatology Hospital in Guangzhou). The study implementation will be undertaken in partnership with a non-profit CBO that will organize community engagement activities (the Social Entrepreneurship to Spur Health 'SESH'). The SESH team has a strong track record of community engagement and organizing research studies on sexual health, including pay-it-forward programs in Beijing and Guangzhou. The study team would comprise academic and SESH staff with expertise in community mobilization, epidemiology, implementation science, health economics, health statistics, and social science.</p>
                  <p id="Par43">A co-creation group will be appointed and would comprise MSM representatives, clinicians, and nurses, a communication officer co-chaired by members of SESH, and a local MSM community-based organization. Co-creation groups serve as a source of shared leadership in community-led research, and their members typically reflect the community of interest. The co-creation group will be consulted quarterly to provide input on the study design, implementation, and dissemination activities.</p>

                  <p id="Par44">We will implement the study in Guangdong cities with MSM-led clinics: Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Jiangmen, Foshan, and Dongguan. These clinics were chosen because respective cities have a higher burden of STDs, they include the two major service delivery approaches (MSM-led clinics and public STD clinics) in China, and findings would be potentially relevant in many cities. Each selected clinic has a dual chlamydia/gonorrhea point-of-care testing service and a stable supply chain of ceftriaxone and azithromycin. Each site will receive Good Clinical Practice (GCP) training for new personnel, regulatory assessment, and related trial requirements. A representative from each participating clinic will be invited to attend a single training workshop in Guangzhou to introduce the study protocol, local implementation workflows, gonorrhea and chlamydia treatment, and resistance testing processes. We will register the RCT on ClinicalTrials.gov prior to the commencement of the trial.</p>

                  <p id="Par46">In the standard pay-it-forward arm, all recruited participants in the MSM-led and public STD clinics will be given a donated free test alongside handwritten postcards from other participants in the local community. Standard operating procedures, survey instruments, and educational materials developed in our previous RCT will guide this approach. The postcards will be generated through an open call for suggestions about tailored, hand-written messages that are clinic specific and locally appropriate. We will use standardized methods developed by the World Health Organization to design the open call [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. This will involve creating a steering committee, promoting the open call, judging submissions, recognizing excellent submissions, and implementing selected ideas.</p>
                  <p id="Par47">The community-engaged arm will include the standard pay-it-forward strategy with key community-engagement activities. Gift recipients will be invited to submit handwritten postcards or create videos promoting gonorrhea and chlamydia testing (to be viewed at the same clinic). Men who agree to participate will be invited to a pay-it-forward event to meet other people who have donated. They will also be invited to related activities organized by the local clinic to promote gonorrhea and chlamydia testing.</p>
                  <p id="Par48">In the control arm, participants will be informed about the importance of gonorrhea and chlamydia testing but will not receive handwritten postcards or other community engagement activities. Among men who choose to receive gonorrhea and chlamydia testing, they will have access to the same diagnostics, treatment, and follow-up provided in the other two arms. Donations in the two pay-it-forward arms would be received and tracked using WeChat, a hybrid social media app in China that allows micro-payments. Each clinic will have its own WeChat account for donations.</p>

In order to achieve a 90% power and allow for a 0.05 type-I error, 12 overall clusters (4 in each arm) are needed. Thus, the sample size includes 12 clusters and 1200 participants (100 per cluster), estimated based on the sample size calculation principles for cluster randomized trials. We expect this study will have a 90% power to detect a 10% difference in azithromycin resistance between intervention arms and routine gonorrhea and chlamydia antibiotic surveillance data from other cities in the same province. Nevertheless, further calculations will be made following formative research endeavors that will estimate the prevalence of these outcomes. The calculation would be performed using the software PASS (version 15) with the formulas developed by Hussey and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>].</p>

The turnaround time for test results will depend on the local clinic. Surveys will be self-administered online to facilitate implementation. All participants diagnosed with gonorrhea or chlamydia will receive antibiotic treatment per the clinical protocol in China.</p>

The RE-AIM framework is one of the most commonly used frameworks to evaluate the implementation of an intervention. It guides the development of implementation-focused outcomes to understand better mechanisms and factors influencing behavioral changes due to interventions. Evaluation of the five key domains of the implementation process will provide evidence to ensure impact of the intervention and facilitate evidence-based practices.</p>
                <p id="Par58">We will evaluate the other dimensions of implementing the standard pay-it-forward and the community-engaged pay-it-forward strategies to understand the factors influencing men to get tested and motivating their donations. Given the novelty of pay-it-forward to raise funds, its sustainability partly depends on a willingness to donate. Understanding the drivers of financial sustainability across individuals and clinics may help inform policymakers and interested researchers in resource-limited settings about the potential of using the strategy to promote underfunded public health services.</p>

Programs to ensure accuracy, completeness, and internal consistency are automated. Data can be readily downloaded and converted to commercially available statistical software format. During the collection of the online portion of the study, all data will be transmitted securely using SSL (TLS) 128-bit encryption across the Internet (HTTP). SSL assures users access to a valid, "non-spoofed" site and prevents data interception or tampering with sensitive information. The SSL certificate that will be used for this project will use 128-bit encryption, the preferred security level of government and financial institutions. 128-bit encryption offers virtually unbreakable protection. For example, if a hacker could crack a standard 40-bit SSL session in a day, it is estimated that it would take well beyond a trillion years to accomplish the same against a 128-bit SSL session. A dedicated server, which eliminates security issues involved with shared hosting environments where hundreds of websites and users reside on one shared web server and ensures both physical and network security, will be used to house the data. Data will then be stored in a secured server at Dermatology Hospital, Southern Medical University. The server will be configured with a redundant hard drive array to ensure reliability. Access to the data will be password protected within the server's firewall. Only the PI and a designated senior staff member will have the password to access the "key" that links the non-descript identifier to personally identifiable information. IP addresses of participants' computers will not be collected at any time. Cookies will not be used in any way to track participant activity.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par73">Pay-it-forward is a novel behavioral and financial model. Our previous studies showed that it is cost-effective compared to standard service delivery. However, the study findings have limited representativeness due to the primary involvement of MSM-led clinics but excluding public STD clinics that are major providers for STD testing in the Chinese setting. There is also a lack of understanding of the implementation process and a missed opportunity of optimizing the implementation strategy. By enhancing the community engagement components of the strategy, our trial aims to test the effectiveness of an enhanced pay-it-forward implementation strategy compared to the standard pay-it-forward approach and a control arm. We propose a programmatic cluster RCT to document high-quality evidence on the effectiveness of different pay-it-forward implementation strategies and better understand real-world practices. The proposed study will provide evidence on whether community-engaged pay-it-forward strategies can strengthen the effectiveness of pay-it-forward interventions. This would inform future expansion of pay-it-forward intervention strategies to improve gonorrhea and chlamydia testing and treatment for MSM in diverse clinic settings in China.</p>
              <p id="Par74">This study has important implications for evidence-based practices for delivering important but underfunded public health services in a novel and efficient way. Hybrid implementation study designs focus on effectiveness and assessing implementation outcomes. Generating evidence on the implementation will inform evidence-based practices and enable us to tap into the potential of normalizing or integrating the pay-it-forward interventions into existing programs to promote gonorrhea/chlamydia testing among a key community. Our hybrid type 2 study design tests two pay-it-forward implementation strategies and evaluates other domains, including reach, adoption, implementation, and maintenance. These will help inform what is possible in routine practices, translate researching findings into practices and assess the strategy in gonorrhea/chlamydia testing service delivery.</p>
              <p id="Par75">Our trial will also add value to the current literature on generosity and reciprocity and how they may change behaviors. Our implementation evaluation will underscore the individual and organizational-level mechanisms affecting test uptake and donating behaviors in the pay-it-forward arms. We will test against the upstream reciprocity theory and measure whether generosity is associated with uptake and donating behaviors. This evidence will be relevant to interested health researchers, program implementers, and public health authorities to leverage human kindness and a 'warm glow' to promote healthy behaviors and engage key stakeholders.</p>
              <p id="Par76">We anticipate that this novel financing model may also have policy implications for transitioning fee-based to subsidized health services in China and beyond. Pay-it-forward is effective in pooling small funds for essential services to support other service users in the community. Such pro-social behaviors could potentially be contagious when managed well. If proven practically more cost-effective, pay-it-forward strategies could help mobilize micro-donations from economically better-off areas to cover essential health services in underdeveloped places.</p>
