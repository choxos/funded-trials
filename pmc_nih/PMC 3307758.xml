                <p>The emergence of castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) contributes to the high mortality of patients diagnosed with prostate cancer (PCa), which in part could be attributed to the existence and the emergence of cancer stem cells (CSCs). Recent studies have shown that deregulated expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) contributes to the initiation and progression of PCa. Among several known miRNAs, let-7 family appears to play a key role in the recurrence and progression of PCa by regulating CSCs; however, the mechanism by which let-7 family contributes to PCa aggressiveness is unclear. Enhancer of Zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), a putative target of let-7 family, was demonstrated to control stem cell function. In this study, we found loss of let-7 family with corresponding over-expression of EZH2 in human PCa tissue specimens, especially in higher Gleason grade tumors. Overexpression of let-7 by transfection of let-7 precursors decreased EZH2 expression and repressed clonogenic ability and sphere-forming capacity of PCa cells, which was consistent with inhibition of EZH2 3′UTR luciferase activity. We also found that the treatment of PCa cells with BR-DIM (formulated DIM: 3,3′-diindolylmethane by Bio Response, Boulder, CO, abbreviated as BR-DIM) up-regulated let-7 and down-regulated EZH2 expression, consistent with inhibition of self-renewal and clonogenic capacity. Moreover, BR-DIM intervention in our on-going phase II clinical trial in patients prior to radical prostatectomy showed upregulation of let-7 consistent with down-regulation of EZH2 expression in PCa tissue specimens after BR-DIM intervention. These results suggest that the loss of let-7 mediated increased expression of EZH2 contributes to PCa aggressiveness, which could be attenuated by BR-DIM treatment, and thus BR-DIM is likely to have clinical impact.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second leading cause of cancer death in men in the United States killing over 32,050 men in 2010 <xref rid="pone.0033729-Jemal1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. In the past ten years, there have been significant improvements in the surgical treatment options for patients diagnosed with localized PCa. Prostate surgery has also benefited from technical and technological advancements such as nerve sparing prostatectomy and robotic prostatectomy. Adjuvant therapy, defined as additional treatment to reduce or eliminate local and distant disease, is offered to patients <xref rid="pone.0033729-Sumey1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, especially those who are at high risk of recurrence (as often defined by the d'Amico criteria of PSA &gt;20 ng/mL, Gleason 8–10, and stage T2c to T4) <xref rid="pone.0033729-DAmico1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p>
              <p>Radiation therapy and systemic therapy especially androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) are considered as reasonable adjuvant therapeutic options. Patients in the high-risk category have a recurrence rate of greater than 50% within their lifetime, which is unacceptable. However, one of the concerns in offering adjuvant therapy to all patients in the high risk group is that although greater than 50% of patients do recur, there are 38–50% of patients who do not <xref rid="pone.0033729-Pound1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. To reduce the burden of over-treatment in this patient group, additional tools are needed to identify the truly high-risk patients. Current tools being studied include predictive nomograms <xref rid="pone.0033729-Kattan1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> and studies evaluating gene expression profiling, which have identified a few markers of tumor aggressiveness <xref rid="pone.0033729-Singh1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0033729-Glinsky1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> although such findings have not been translated to patient management.</p>
              <p>Since tumor recurrence and metastasis contribute to the high mortality, studies have suggested that the aggressiveness of PCa could be tightly linked with the acquisition of cancer stem cells (CSC) or cancer stem-like cells (CSLCs) characteristics. Emerging evidence suggests that deregulated expression of many microRNAs (miRNAs) including the let-7 family contributes to cancer progression and recurrence <xref rid="pone.0033729-Peter1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. MicroRNAs are a class of non-coding RNAs of approximately 20 to 22 nucleotides in size. They regulate gene expressions post-transcriptionally by binding to a site in the 3′untranslated region (3′ UTR) of target mRNA. They have been demonstrated to regulate cell cycle, and development and progression of cancer <xref rid="pone.0033729-Sarkar1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Let-7 was first discovered and well studied in Caenorhabditis elegans. The human let-7 family consists of let-7a, let-7b, let-7c, let-7d, let-7e, let-7f, let-7g, let-7i and miR-98. The let-7 family is commonly viewed as a tumor suppressor consistent with down-regulation of oncogenes such as Ras <xref rid="pone.0033729-Kumar1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, high mobility group A2 (HMGA2) <xref rid="pone.0033729-Mayr1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> and c-myc <xref rid="pone.0033729-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> by binding to 3′UTR of these target mRNAs. Moreover, decreased let-7 expression was found in many cancers, including PCa <xref rid="pone.0033729-Barh1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, and it has been linked with poor patient prognosis in lung cancer <xref rid="pone.0033729-Landi1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma <xref rid="pone.0033729-Childs1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, and ovarian cancer <xref rid="pone.0033729-Helland1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p>
              <p>Interestingly, let-7 family members have been demonstrated to regulate the self-renewal capacity of breast cancer cells <xref rid="pone.0033729-Yu1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> and PCa cells by regulating stem cell-associated factors such as Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog expression <xref rid="pone.0033729-Kong1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Recent studies have also documented that let-7 could regulate the expression of Lin28 and Lin28B, which in turn block the accumulation of mature let-7 <xref rid="pone.0033729-Viswanathan1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. This feedback regulation plays a critical role in regulating “stemness” by controlling self-renewal <xref rid="pone.0033729-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0033729-King1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, which is the cellular characteristic of CSCs or CSLCs associated with tumor aggressiveness and recurrence. These results suggest that the let-7 family could play a key role in the progression of PCa by maintaining and regulating molecular features of CSCs or CSLCs in PCa; however, how let-7 family contributes to PCa aggressiveness is unknown.</p>
              <p>Enhancer of Zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) is one of the targets of the let-7 family of miRNAs, and that the expression of EZH2 is strongly associated with molecular features of both normal stem cells and CSCs or CSLCs. EZH2 is a histone-lysine N-methyltransferase, a subunit of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2). The polycomb group of proteins are known to be involved in the regulation of gene repression through chromatin modifications, which is essential for the maintenance of the embryonic and adult stem cells <xref rid="pone.0033729-Boyer1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0033729-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. PRC2 contains EZH2, Suz12, EED, and RbAp subunits and this complex is known to function in the embryonic and adult stem cells to repress developmental genes that are preferentially activated during differentiation <xref rid="pone.0033729-Bracken1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Moreover, further studies have shown that PRC2 target genes are co-occupied by stem cell regulators such as Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog <xref rid="pone.0033729-Boyer2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Recent studies have also suggested that polycomb group proteins are not only essential for embryonic development but also plays critical roles in tumor initiation and progression <xref rid="pone.0033729-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Over-expression of EZH2 has been strongly linked with cancer progression partly because PRC2 inhibits E-cadherin expression, which promotes epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancer cells <xref rid="pone.0033729-Cao1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, a phenomenon that is reminiscent of CSCs or CSLCs. Suz12 has been found to mediate E-cadherin inhibition by snail1 <xref rid="pone.0033729-Herranz1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. More importantly, EZH2 directly regulates DNA methylation by serving as a recruitment platform for DNA methyltransferase <xref rid="pone.0033729-Vire1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. In our previous study, we found that the levels of EZH2 and Suz12 mRNA were increased in PC3 PDGF-D cells (EMT-phenotypic cells) compared to PC3 Neo cells <xref rid="pone.0033729-Kong1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. These results clearly suggest that PRC2 can contribute to EMT characteristics of PC3 PDGF-D cells, which are consistent with signatures of CSCs or CSLCs that are associated with cancer progression and recurrence.</p>
              <p>Previous pre-clinical studies from our laboratory have shown that indole-3-carbinol (I3C) found in cruciferous vegetables and its <italic>in vivo</italic> metabolite 3,3′-diindolylmethane (DIM) especially the formulated DIM (BR-DIM or B-DIM) that we have used for our phase I clinical trial <xref rid="pone.0033729-Heath1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, are potent agents in inhibiting the growth of PCa cells, which was mediated by alterations in multiple cellular signaling <xref rid="pone.0033729-Sarkar2" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Our recent results showed that BR-DIM caused upregulation of miR-200b and miR-200c that are typically lost in PCa cells <xref rid="pone.0033729-Kong2" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. In the current study, we found loss of expression of let-7 family consistent with over-expression EZH2 in PCa cells and in human PCa tissue specimens, especially in tumors with higher Gleason grade. The results from correlation analysis showed that let-7 expression was inversely associated with EZH2 expression in patients with higher Gleason grade tumors. Here we also provide evidence for the role of BR-DIM (formulated DIM: 3,3′-diindolylmethane, abbreviated as either BR-DIM or B-DIM) in the regulation of let-7 and EZH2 in PCa cells as documented by our pre-clinical findings as well as findings from our on-going phase II clinical trial in PCa patients received BR-DIM prior to radical prostatectomy.</p>

                <title>Ethics statement</title>
                <p>Patient tissues were collected after receiving the approval from Wayne State University Institutional Review Board (IRB). This clinical protocol is classified as exempt #4 categories under the NIH policy because such studies are retrospective studies using archival sample. The IRB waived the need for consent for use of the archive samples, which was consistent with NIH guidelines, and the samples were analyzed anonymously. PCa tissue specimens from our on-going clinical trial of BR-DIM (B-DIM) intervention prior to radical prostatectomy were also obtained after receiving approval from Wayne State University Institutional Review Board (IRB) and informed consents were obtained from all study subjects. Because this study is a conventional clinical trial, the IRB process required written consenting from patients prior to accrual into the clinical trial, which is routinely coordinated through the clinical trial office (CTO). The approval through IRB implicates complying with consenting and accrual without which patients cannot be enrolled into the study, and thus our study fulfilled all the required compliance guidelines from the CTO and the IRB. The local clinical trial protocol number is 2007-128, which can be found in the NIH clinical trials.gov. (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00888654">http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00888654</ext-link>). At the time of sample acquisition for the current investigation, the study protocol accrued 20 patients; however, the study has now accrued a total of 33 patients. It is anticipated that we will close this study with 37 patients in early 2012.</p>

                <title>Expression of the let-7 family was lost in prostate cancer (PCa) tissue specimens</title>
                <p>To determine the levels of the let-7 family in PCa tissue specimens, we collected pre-treatment PCa tissues and matched adjacent normal tissue specimens (used as control for comparison with tumor tissues). The results from miRNA expression by mircroarray expression profiling showed that all the members of the let-7 family (miR-98 was undetectable) decreased in the PCa tissues compared to adjacent normal tissue specimens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033729-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). Moreover, we found that the expression of let-7a, let-7b, let-7c and let-7d were accurately measurable compared to other family members because their expressions were very low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033729-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). Therefore, we have determined and confirmed the expressions of let-7a, let-7b, let-7c, and let-7d in all the cases including 129 PCa tissue specimens and 94 adjacent normal tissue specimens. We discovered that the expression of the let-7 family in histologically normal prostate tissues from Gleason grade 7 or higher tumor was decreased compared to histologically normal tissue from Gleason grade 6 tumors (data not shown), suggesting that the histologically normal tissues from the prostate gland of patients with higher grade tumors are not normal. Thus, we took normal from the prostate of all patients diagnosed with grade 6 tumors for further analysis and used that as “normal tissue control”. We observed that the expressions of the let-7 family in grade 6 tumors are not statistically different compared to normal control. However, we found a significantly decreased expression of let-7a, let-7b, let7c and let-7d in PCa with Gleason grade 7 or higher tumors compared to normal tissue control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033729-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). These results suggest that the loss of let-7 family could be associated with PCa aggressiveness especially because the lower grade tumors were no different from the normal tissue control, whereas higher grade tumors were different.</p>

                <title>Expression of EZH2 was increased in PCa tissue specimens and was inversely correlated with the expression of the let-7 family</title>
                <p>Since the expression of the let-7 family was lost in PCa tissues of patients with higher Gleason grade, it raises a question of how the let-7 family could regulate PCa aggressiveness. We have searched targets of the let-7 family using TargetScan software and we found that EZH2 could be regulated by the let-7 family because there is a specific binding site in the 3′UTR of EZH2 mRNA. Thus, we have assessed the expression of EZH2 mRNA in PCa tissues. Our results showed that EZH2 expression was increased in PCa tissue specimens with Gleason grade 7 and higher compared with normal tissue control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033729-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). The expression of let-7b and let-7c was inversely correlated with EZH2 expression with r = −0.36 (95% CI: −0.61 to −0.06), p = 0.0414 and r = −0.43 (95% CI: −0.65 to −0.15), p = 0.0132, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033729-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>). These results suggest that the loss of let-7 could be responsible for increased expression of EZH2.</p>

                <p>We examined the expression of EZH2 in PCa cell lines and immortalized prostate epithelial cell lines, and found that EZH2 was expressed in prostate cancer cells at relatively higher levels compared to immortalized prostate epithelial cell lines: PZ-HPV-7 and RWPE-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033729-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>, upper panel). To further determine the biological consequence of the let-7 family expression in the regulation of EZH2 expression, we transfected PC3 and PC3 PDGD-D cells with let-7 precursors, and the results showed that let-7 family members could significantly inhibit the expression of EZH2 in these two cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033729-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>, middle and lower panel). These results suggest that let-7 family regulates the expression of EZH2. In order to gain further mechanistic insight, we tested whether let-7 could directly repress the expression of EZH2 by binding to 3′UTR of EZH2 mRNA. We co-transfected EZH2 3′UTR luciferase plasmid and let-7 precursors, and found that let-7a, let-7b, let-7c, and let-7b could strongly inhibit EZH2 3′UTR luciferase activity compared to transfection of cells with control miRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033729-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). The let-7 binding sites in the 3′UTR of EZH2 mRNA are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033729-g002">Figure 2C</xref>. We then tested the biological consequence of cells transfected with pre-let-7 family and assessed clonogenic growth as an indirect <italic>in vitro</italic> measure of tumor aggressiveness. We found that the overexpression of let-7 family significantly inhibited the clonogenic growth of PC3 PDGF-D cells, which initially showed lower expression of let-7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033729-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>). However, currently there is no method that could be clinically useful for the upregulation of lost miRNAs. To that end, we tested our hypothesis by testing whether BR-DIM could be useful for the upregulation of miRNAs.</p>

              <p>Although it is known that the let-7 family is associated with maintenance of stem cell signature, which is believed to be strongly linked with cancer recurrence, the mechanism by which let-7 family regulates the stem cell signatures is unknown. In this study, we found that the expression of the let-7 family was lost in PCa tissue specimens with Gleason grade 7 or higher but not in patients with Gleason grade 6 tumors. These results were consistent with corresponding increased expression of EZH2, which appears to be a target of the let-7 family. Our results suggest that the loss of expression of let-7 with a consequent over-expression of EZH2 could be associated with PCa aggressiveness. Moreover, the results from 3′UTR of the EZH2 luciferase assay and Western blot analysis further confirmed that let-7 could repress EZH2 expression by binding to 3′UTR element of EZH2 mRNA.</p>
              <p>Recent studies have shown that miR-101 negatively regulates the expression of EZH2 <xref rid="pone.0033729-Varambally1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Our data suggest that the let-7 family of miRNAs also be responsible for the regulation of EZH2 in human PCa. Our results showed that the let-7 family, especially let-7a, let-7b, let-7c and let-7d are highly expressed in human normal prostate tissue specimens and their expression was lost in PCa tissues, especially, in patients with aggressive (higher Gleason grade tumors) tumors. Notably, we found that the expression of let-7a, let-7b, let-7c, and let-7d was decreased in normal prostate tissues from Gleason grade 7 and higher compared with normal tissues obtained from patients with Gleason grade 6. These results suggest that the normal prostate tissues obtained from patients with higher Gleason grade tumors are not normal, which is consistent with a field-effect of prostate carcinogenesis <xref rid="pone.0033729-Risk1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>.</p>
              <p>EZH2 is a component of the PRC2, which mediates chromatin-based gene silencing through trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone H3. PRC2 also plays a critical role in the maintenance of the embryonic and adult stem cells <xref rid="pone.0033729-Boyer1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0033729-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> as well as playing a critical role in tumor initiation and progression <xref rid="pone.0033729-Bracken1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0033729-Simon1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Over-expression of EZH2 has been found to be strongly linked with the acquisition of EMT phenotype because PRC2 inhibits E-cadherin expression through trimethylation of H3 lysine 27 <xref rid="pone.0033729-Cao1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0033729-Herranz1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0033729-Fujii1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Moreover, EZH2 directly regulates DNA methylation by serving as a recruitment platform for DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) through binding of DNMTs to several EZH2-repressed genes <xref rid="pone.0033729-Vire1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, and methylation of the E-cadherin gene promoter has been demonstrated to correlate with progression of PCa <xref rid="pone.0033729-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. DNA methylation profiles of the E-cadherin promoter were further assessed in the NCI-60 panel of cancer cells. Of the NCI-60 cancer cells, the 38 epithelial cell lines showed significantly lower (28%) methylation levels compared with the nonepithelial cell lines (58%) derived from invasive or metastatic cancer <xref rid="pone.0033729-Reinhold1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. In addition, methylation mediated loss of the miR-200 family leads to E-cadherin expression as documented earlier <xref rid="pone.0033729-Tryndyak1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0033729-Wiklund1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. Interestingly, recent studies have shown that EZH2 inhibits the expression of the miR-200 family and miR-203 through trimethylation of H3 lysine 27 <xref rid="pone.0033729-Cao2" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Loss of the miR-200 family and miR-203 is believed to be associated with EMT and stem cell signatures <xref rid="pone.0033729-Kong1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0033729-Kong4" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0033729-Wellner1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. Therefore, EZH2 could contribute to cancer progression and recurrence by regulating and maintaining EMT and stem cell signatures through methylation of target gene promoter and trimethylation of H3 lysine 27.</p>
              <p>In the current study, we found that the levels of EZH2 were increased in PCa tissue specimens, especially in patients with higher Gleason grade tumors and were also highly expressed in PCa cell lines, suggesting that the over-expression of EZH2 is associated with PCa aggressiveness. Therefore, finding novel approaches by which one could re-express the lost miRNAs such as let-7 family with consequent down-regulation of EZH2 could become a newer avenue for the prevention of PCa and/or treatment of aggressive PCa. To that end, we tested the effects of BR-DIM (B-DIM), which is a “natural agent”-derived compound (formulated DIM: 3,3′-diindolylmethane by BioResponse, Boulder, CO). The results of pharmacokinetic studies of BR-DIM in mice have been reported <xref rid="pone.0033729-Anderton1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref> and a pharmacokinetic comparison was also reported between BR-DIM and unformulated DIM <xref rid="pone.0033729-Anderton2" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref> showing that BR-DIM exhibits 50–60% greater bioavailability than the crystalline formulation in all tissues studied (plasma, liver, kidney, lung, heart and brain). Moreover, our phase I clinical trial results of BR-DIM in PCa patients showed that it is safe <xref rid="pone.0033729-Heath1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, which eventually led to our currently on-going phase II clinical trial in PCa patients prior to radical prostatectomy. The results obtained from eleven tumor specimens from this phase II clinical trial are exciting because it showed, for the first time, that let-7 miRNAs could be upregulated in tumors by BR-DIM intervention with consequent down-regulation of EZH2. Therefore, BR-DIM intervention could become a newer therapeutic approach since BR-DIM could cause targeted elimination of EMT phenotypic cells or CSCs (CSLCs) that contribute to tumor recurrence and metastasis as seen in patients with mCRPC. However, sample size is relatively small from our on-going clinical trial of BR-DIM intervention, and thus the effects of BR-DIM on molecular biomarkers will needs further investigation using larger number of patients to make definitive conclusion. The impact of these “proof-of-concept” findings will be further confirmed upon the completion of our on-going phase II clinical trial.</p>
              <p>In summary, we found that BR-DIM up-regulated the expression of the let-7 family and consequently down-regulated the expression of EZH2 not only in PCa cell lines but also in human PCa tissue specimens from our on-going phase II clinical trial. These results suggest that BR-DIM could serve as a novel agent for the inhibition of PCa progression and recurrence.</p>
