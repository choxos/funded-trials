                <p>CRISPR/Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9)-mediated genome editing holds remarkable promise for the treatment of human genetic diseases. However, the possibility of off-target Cas9 activity remains a concern. To address this issue using clinically relevant target cells, we electroporated Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes (independently targeted to two different genomic loci, the <italic>CXCR4</italic> locus on chromosome 2 and the <italic>AAVS1</italic> locus on chromosome 19) into human mobilized peripheral blood-derived hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) and assessed the acquisition of somatic mutations in an unbiased, genome-wide manner via whole genome sequencing (WGS) of single-cell-derived HSPC clones. Bioinformatic analysis identified &gt;20,000 total somatic variants (indels, single nucleotide variants, and structural variants) distributed among Cas9-treated and non-Cas9-treated control HSPC clones. Statistical analysis revealed no significant difference in the number of novel non-targeted indels among the samples. Moreover, data analysis showed no evidence of Cas9-mediated indel formation at 623 predicted off-target sites. The median number of novel single nucleotide variants was slightly elevated in Cas9 RNP-recipient sample groups compared to baseline, but did not reach statistical significance. Structural variants were rare and demonstrated no clear causal connection to Cas9-mediated gene editing procedures. We find that the collective somatic mutational burden observed within Cas9 RNP-edited human HSPC clones is indistinguishable from naturally occurring levels of background genetic heterogeneity.</p>

              <title>1. Introduction</title>
              <p>Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) are important targets of gene-based regenerative therapies [<xref rid="B1-genes-11-01501" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Permanent correction of inherited hematologic, metabolic and immunologic disorders can be achieved owing to the remarkable ability of long-term repopulating HSPCs to reconstitute and maintain a functional hematopoietic system in vivo. Unequivocal clinical benefits have been obtained over the past decade by vector-mediated addition of a therapeutic gene to HSPCs using replication-defective integrating retroviruses [<xref rid="B2-genes-11-01501" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In recent years, transformative technological advances have allowed the precise editing of cellular genomes, potentially obviating concerns regarding insertional mutagenesis inevitably associated with integrating vectors, as well as enabling appropriate transgene expression levels from endogenous cellular promoters and extending gene therapies to disorders requiring genetic correction of abnormal gene products rather than simple gene addition [<xref rid="B2-genes-11-01501" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-genes-11-01501" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-genes-11-01501" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p>
              <p>The type II clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) bacterial adaptive immune system, known as CRISPR/Cas9, has gained widespread acceptance as a programmable genome editing tool by offering simplicity and flexibility for gene editing applications. The CRISPR/Cas9 system of <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> (SpCas9) is currently the most popular CRISPR/Cas-derived system, but several orthologs of Cas9 have been developed recently that offer application-specific advantages (such as reduced nuclease size) and expand the accessible repertoire of potential target sites [<xref rid="B5-genes-11-01501" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-genes-11-01501" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-genes-11-01501" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-genes-11-01501" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. For genome editing experiments, the Cas9 endonuclease can be easily directed to a cognate target sequence by provision of a small RNA molecule of approximately 100 nucleotides in length, known as the single guide RNA (sgRNA) [<xref rid="B9-genes-11-01501" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The Cas9 protein forms a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex with the sgRNA and, upon recognition of an appropriate DNA target sequence, creates a double-stranded break (DSB) within the DNA duplex. For DNA cleavage activity to occur, the target site must be located immediately upstream of a short ancillary sequence known as the protospacer adjacent motif (or PAM sequence) which, in the case of SpCas9, is a 5′-NGG-3′ triplet (where N is any nucleotide) [<xref rid="B9-genes-11-01501" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In the absence of a homologous DNA donor template, the DNA DSB is rapidly repaired by the cellular non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway, often resulting in small insertions and deletions (indels) that can disrupt protein encoding open reading frames. Alternatively, if an appropriate donor template is available, the DNA DSB may be repaired by the homology-directed repair (HDR) pathway [<xref rid="B4-genes-11-01501" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p>
              <p>In therapeutic contexts, unintended Cas9-mediated DNA breaks at genomic positions with imperfect complementarity to the guide sequence (off-target sites) could permanently alter normal gene expression and function, and facilitate unpredictable clinical complications. Thus, nuclease precision is imperative. As a consequence, substantial effort has gone into quantifying Cas9-mediated off-target activity in various cellular systems and model organisms. Putative off-target sites may be computationally predicted by virtue of the number, type and position of mismatches relative to the target sequence [<xref rid="B10-genes-11-01501" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-genes-11-01501" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Additionally, a palette of increasingly sensitive and unbiased off-target detection methods has recently emerged, based on capture of DNA DSB formation in cells (LAM-HTGTS [<xref rid="B12-genes-11-01501" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], GUIDE seq [<xref rid="B13-genes-11-01501" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], IDLV capture [<xref rid="B14-genes-11-01501" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], VIVO [<xref rid="B15-genes-11-01501" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], DISCOVER-seq [<xref rid="B16-genes-11-01501" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]), in situ (BLISS [<xref rid="B17-genes-11-01501" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], BLESS [<xref rid="B18-genes-11-01501" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]), in vitro (CIRCLE-seq [<xref rid="B19-genes-11-01501" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], Digenome-seq [<xref rid="B20-genes-11-01501" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], SITE-seq [<xref rid="B21-genes-11-01501" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]) or by CHIP-seq as a proxy for genome-wide cleavage events [<xref rid="B22-genes-11-01501" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. However, each approach has its own intrinsic biases. In contrast, whole genome sequencing (WGS) provides a broad-based method to assess the extent of Cas9-mediated off-target activity in gene-edited cells and tissues, including indels, single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and structural variants (SVs) such as inversions, rearrangements, duplications and large deletions. With decreasing sequencing costs, this approach has gained traction in recent years and shown utility for assessment of off-target mutations caused by Cas9 in human cells [<xref rid="B20-genes-11-01501" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B23-genes-11-01501" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-genes-11-01501" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-genes-11-01501" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-genes-11-01501" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-genes-11-01501" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], mice [<xref rid="B28-genes-11-01501" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-genes-11-01501" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30-genes-11-01501" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-genes-11-01501" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-genes-11-01501" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-genes-11-01501" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34-genes-11-01501" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B35-genes-11-01501" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B36-genes-11-01501" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], rats [<xref rid="B28-genes-11-01501" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], goats [<xref rid="B37-genes-11-01501" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and plants [<xref rid="B38-genes-11-01501" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p>

After amplification, each PCR reaction was partially purified using a BioRad PCR Kleen column (BioRad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. T7 endonuclease I (T7E1) reactions were assembled in 8-well, 0.2 mL PCR strips with ≤200 ng of column-purified PCR product per reaction.

                <p>To address the significance of off-target CRISPR/Cas9 activity in human blood stem cells, we performed Cas9 RNP-based genome editing in peripheral blood-mobilized human HSPCs obtained from a healthy donor and characterized the genome-wide accumulation of post-editing somatic mutations using high-throughput WGS analysis of single-cell-derived HSPC clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-11-01501-f001">Figure 1</xref>). To distinguish between naturally occurring spontaneous somatic mutations, potential cell manipulation-induced (i.e., non-Cas9-associated) mutagenesis, and bona fide Cas9-mediated genetic alterations, the experimental design included a parallel set of control manipulations applied to samples of the same bulk HSPC population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-11-01501-f001">Figure 1</xref>A). The bioinformatics pipeline used to identify indels, SNVs, and SVs is outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-11-01501-f001">Figure 1</xref>B. HSPC samples were either (i) not electroporated (“No EP”), (ii) electroporated in the absence of CRISPR/Cas9 effector molecules (“EP only”), (iii) electroporated with recombinant SpCas9 alone (“Cas9 only”) or (iv) electroporated with RNPs consisting of Cas9 bound to 2′-<italic>O</italic>-methyl phosphorothioate-modified sgRNAs. Cas9 RNPs were targeted to either of two genetic loci: exon 2 of the <italic>CXCR4</italic> gene on chromosome 2 (“CXCR4 RNP”), or the insertional “safe harbor” locus, <italic>AAVS1</italic> [<xref rid="B66-genes-11-01501" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>], on chromosome 19 (“AAVS1 RNP”). The sgRNA target sequences are depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-11-01501-f001">Figure 1</xref>C.</p>
                <p>RNP-based genome editing in the bulk HSPC population demonstrated a high efficiency of on-target indel formation, with a gene editing efficiency of 67 and 58% at the <italic>CXCR4</italic> and <italic>AAVS1</italic> loci, respectively, as determined by T7 endonuclease 1 (T7E1) assay of target site-derived PCR amplicons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-11-01501-f002">Figure 2</xref>A). Following experimental manipulation, cells were cloned by limiting dilution and single-cell isolates were minimally expanded in 96-well plates to obtain sufficient genomic DNA for WGS library preparation and high-throughput sequencing. Limited clonal expansion was utilized to diminish the potential for culture-associated genetic alteration, resulting in the recovery of nanogram amounts of genomic DNA in most instances. Prior to whole genome sequencing, successful gene editing within Cas9 RNP-recipient single-cell clones was confirmed by T7E1 assay of target site-derived PCR amplicons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-11-01501-f002">Figure 2</xref>B). High-throughput sequencing of the HSPC samples (3–5 per treatment group plus bulk reference sequence) resulted in approximately two terabytes of data, representing 22 separate human whole genome sequence determinations with a median read depth of ~40× (range from 35× to 47×) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-11-01501-f002">Figure 2</xref>C).</p>

Three of the five CXCR4 RNP-treated clones demonstrated potential multi-allelic on-target indel calls.

Relative percentages of indel incidence within intronic, intergenic, exonic, and “other” annotated sequences (e.g., 5′ UTRs, 3′ UTRs, splicing signals, and ncRNAs) were similar among the treatment groups, with the majority of indels mapping to intergenic regions of the genome (range from 56 to 59% of total).</p>

A Kruskal–Wallis statistical test indicated a significant difference in the frequency of somatic SNVs observed among the groups (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0093). Further analysis utilizing Dunn’s multiple comparison test indicated that the “EP only” group demonstrated a statistically significant difference in SNV counts compared to the untreated baseline group (i.e., “No EP”), albeit with weak statistical support (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0414). In all treatment groups, the majority of observed SNVs were intergenic, with &lt;2% of SNVs occurring within annotated coding sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-11-01501-f003">Figure 3</xref>B); however, when present within an open reading frame, the observed SNVs tended to result in nonsynonymous amino acid changes.

Similarly, comparison of total called indel variants to 422 homologous <italic>AAVS1</italic> off-target sites revealed no off-target indels associated with Cas9 RNP-recipient samples; however, one clone (sample S2–21) within the “CXCR4 RNP” treatment group displayed a fortuitous 2-base pair deletion within the <italic>AAVS1</italic> target site on chromosome 19 (Chr19:55115807, see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-genes-11-01501">Table S1</xref>, “off-target hits” tab). Of the &gt;15,000 SNVs distributed among the five treatment groups, only five occurred within, or in proximity to, potential <italic>CXCR4</italic> or <italic>AAVS1</italic> homologous off-target sites (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-genes-11-01501">Table S2</xref>, “off-target hits” tab), and only 2 of the 5 SNVs originated from Cas9 RNP-recipient samples.</p>

Although two of the deletions were observed within AAVS1 RNP-recipient clones (samples S2–11 and S2–13), neither of the deletions occurred within the AAVS1 RNP-targeted chromosomes (i.e., Chr 19), and none of the called deletion breakpoints mapped in close proximity to potential AAVS1 sgRNA homologous off-target sites. The final structural variant, a deletion of approximately 5.2-kb, was identified on chromosome 20 within one member (sample S2–8) of the “Cas9 only” control group.</p>

              <p>In this study, we used WGS to obtain an unbiased, genome-wide evaluation of non-targeted CRISPR/Cas9 activity in primary, human HSPCs independently edited at two different genomic loci. Our analyses indicate that levels of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated off-target mutagenesis associated with electroporation of human blood stem cells with specific Cas9/sgRNA RNPs is essentially indistinguishable from naturally occurring somatic background mutations within recipient cells.</p>
              <p>The results of our genome-wide analysis are consistent with most previous studies investigating CRISPR/Cas9 off-target activity in vertebrate embryos and human stem cells.

A single report suggested a higher degree of Cas9 promiscuity, describing 43 bona fide Cas9-generated off-targets detected by high-coverage WGS of ten Cas9/sgRNA-treated mouse embryos and their genetic parents [<xref rid="B28-genes-11-01501" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In addition to vertebrate embryos, WGS of human pluripotent stem cell clones subjected to CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing also indicated that off-target Cas9-mediated mutations were low frequency events, comparable to levels of sequence variants that accumulate during routine culture [<xref rid="B24-genes-11-01501" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-genes-11-01501" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B27-genes-11-01501" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Our data also cohere with the sequence capture characterization of off-target mutations in a population of nuclease-treated CD34+ HSPCs where indels at a single off-target site were detected for one of five active guides [<xref rid="B72-genes-11-01501" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. In contrast, several independent studies examining CRISPR/Cas9 activity in transformed cell lines have reported much higher incidence of cleavage events at unintended sites [<xref rid="B14-genes-11-01501" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B23-genes-11-01501" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B39-genes-11-01501" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40-genes-11-01501" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="B41-genes-11-01501" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="B42-genes-11-01501" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="B43-genes-11-01501" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="B44-genes-11-01501" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="B45-genes-11-01501" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="B46-genes-11-01501" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The off-target alterations identified in these investigations harbored up to five nucleotide substitutions between the hybridizing sgRNA and the target genomic sequence [<xref rid="B42-genes-11-01501" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="B46-genes-11-01501" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], raising concerns with respect to therapeutic applications as frequent sequences with five mismatches to a 20-nucleotide sgRNA may be found in the human genome [<xref rid="B39-genes-11-01501" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B41-genes-11-01501" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p>
              <p>It is likely that the detected levels of off-target Cas9 activity will differ under distinct experimental conditions. First, the target cells used to evaluate Cas9 precision can influence the observed rate of off-target events. For example, cells with limited division rate, such as human hematopoietic stem cells, may be less susceptible to off-target effect [<xref rid="B73-genes-11-01501" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Unwinding of double stranded DNA during cell division was recently proposed to unmask cryptic off-target sites, thereby facilitating Cas9 recruitment at these previously unexposed genomic loci [<xref rid="B73-genes-11-01501" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. This idea is in agreement with genome-wide CHIP-seq [<xref rid="B22-genes-11-01501" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and GUIDE-seq [<xref rid="B13-genes-11-01501" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] analyses reporting increased frequency of off-target mutations in regions of open chromatin. Second, strategies utilized for the cellular delivery of editing components may also have a considerable impact on Cas9 fidelity. In cell lines, most studies have relied on delivery of Cas9 nuclease and sgRNA sequences via plasmid transfection or lentiviral transduction. These approaches produce recombinant Cas9 protein at high levels for prolonged periods of time, thus increasing intracellular concentrations of Cas9 and promoting interaction at low affinity off-target sites that display notably larger dissociation constants (K<sub>d</sub>) relative to the cognate on-target site [<xref rid="B41-genes-11-01501" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="B42-genes-11-01501" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In primary cells, electroporation of plasmid DNA for coexpression of Cas9 and sgRNA often results in pronounced cytotoxicity, and more lenient approaches based on delivery of nuclease mRNA or Cas9/sgRNA RNP have generally been favored. These methods limit the intracellular half-life, and thus off-target activity, of Cas9/sgRNA complexes while permitting easier control of their cellular concentration for efficient on-target cleavage [<xref rid="B47-genes-11-01501" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="B48-genes-11-01501" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Third, as the specificity of Cas9-mediated DNA cleavage is locus-dependent and governed by the quantity, position and identity of mismatching bases relative to the targeted site [<xref rid="B41-genes-11-01501" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="B42-genes-11-01501" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="B46-genes-11-01501" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], the choice of sgRNA sequences may significantly influence the occurrence of off-target Cas9 activity within recipient cells. Last, the scope and sensitivity of methods selected for the identification of bona fide off-target sites after genome editing can affect the measured occurrence of unintended mutations. The whole genome sequencing approach used in this report provides a sensitive, genome-wide assessment of nuclease fidelity. A practical drawback is that only a limited number of select clones within a larger population of gene-edited cells can be analyzed by WGS. Additionally, since single-cell HSPC isolates were briefly expanded prior to WGS, off-target genome editing events that abrogate cellular viability or expansion would not be observed; however, such mutations would, by their nature, be self-limiting at the cellular population level and thus present diminished likelihood of contribution to untoward clinical outcomes.</p>
              <p>In sum, the aspects described above highlight the need for context-specific evaluation of Cas9 promiscuity. Extrapolation from studies using alternate cell types, editing protocols or off-target detection approaches may not accurately reflect the specificities of RNA-guided nucleases for the intended application. By combining clinically relevant cells and editing procedures with an unbiased genome-wide survey of off-target CRISPR/Cas9 activity in single-cell-derived HSPC clones, our study has relevance to the successful translation of ex vivo, Cas9-based HSPC genome editing strategies to the clinic.</p>

(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental design. Human HSPCs were either not electroporated (“No EP”), electroporated in the absence of Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes (“EP only”), electroporated with purified Cas9 protein in the absence of single guide RNA (sgRNA) (“Cas9 only”) or electroporated with the indicated Cas9 RNP complex (“CXCR4 RNP” or “AAVS1 RNP”). Clonal isolates were subjected to high-throughput whole genome sequencing analysis. (<bold>B</bold>) Bioinformatics pipeline. Phase 1—Data processing: Reads were aligned to human genome reference build GRCh38 using the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA-MEM) algorithm. Analysis-ready BAM files were prepared by utilizing Picard (MarkDuplicates) software to identify and remove PCR duplicates, followed by localized indel realignment and base quality score recalibration. Phase 2—Variant calling: Identification of novel indels (small insertion/deletion mutations) and single nucleotide variants (SNVs) was performed using LoFreq. Structural variants (SVs) were identified using three structural variant callers, Delly, Manta, and BreakDancer. The three call sets were merged using Survivor. Phase 3—Integration: Somatic variant calls were integrated to generate consensus calls for each group using BCFtools. NGS, next generation sequencing.

For analysis of bulk (i.e., pre-clonal) HSPC gene editing efficiency, genomic DNA (gDNA) was isolated from gene-edited and control HSPC samples at 3 days post-treatment. Isolated gDNA was subjected to PCR amplification using either <italic>CXCR4</italic> (left panel) or <italic>AAVS1</italic> (right panel) target site-specific primer sets as described in Materials and Methods. Where indicated, PCR amplicons were digested with T7E1, and enzymatic cleavage products were resolved by electrophoresis on a native 4–20% polyacrylamide gradient gel. Amplicon substrates are indicated by an asterisk (*), T7E1 cleavage products are indicated by arrowheads. Clonal isolates selected for WGS and variant analysis are indicated by a color-coded dot.
