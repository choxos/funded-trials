                <p>SPL7013 Gel (VivaGel<sup>Â®</sup>) is a microbicide in development for prevention of HIV and HSV. This clinical study assessed retention and duration of antiviral activity following vaginal administration of 3% SPL7013 Gel in healthy women. Participants received 5 single doses of product with â¥5 days between doses. A cervicovaginal fluid (CVF) sample was collected using a SoftCupâ¢ pre-dose, and immediately, or 1, 3, 12 or 24 h post-dose. HIV-1 and HSV-2 antiviral activities of CVF samples were determined in cell culture assays. Antiviral activity in the presence of seminal plasma was also tested. Mass and concentration of SPL7013 in CVF samples was determined. Safety was assessed by reporting of adverse events. Statistical analysis was performed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test with Bonferroni adjustment; pâ¤0.003 was significant. Eleven participants completed the study. Inhibition of HIV-1 and HSV-2 by pre-dose CVF samples was negligible. CVF samples obtained immediately after dosing almost completely inhibited (median, interquartile range) HIV-1 [96% (95,97)] and HSV-2 [86% (85,94)], and activity was maintained in all women at 3 h (HIV-1 [96% (95,98), pâ=â0.9]; HSV-2 [94% (91,97), pâ=â0.005]). At 24 h, &gt;90% of initial HIV-1 and HSV-2 inhibition was maintained in 6/11 women. SPL7013 was recovered in CVF samples obtained at baseline (46% of 105 mg dose). At 3 and 24 h, 22 mg and 4 mg SPL7013, respectively, were recovered. More than 70% inhibition of HIV-1 and HSV-2 was observed if there was &gt;0.5 mg SPL7013 in CVF samples. High levels of antiviral activity were retained in the presence of seminal plasma. VivaGel was well tolerated with no signs or symptoms of vaginal, vulvar or cervical irritation reported. Potent antiviral activity was observed against HIV-1 and HSV-2 immediately following vaginal administration of VivaGel, with activity maintained for at least 3 h post-dose. The data provide evidence of antiviral activity in a clinical setting, and suggest VivaGel could be administered up to 3 h before coitus.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>The global human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic continues, with an estimated 2.7 million people newly infected with HIV and 2.0 million dying of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) in 2008 <xref rid="pone.0024095-UNAIDS1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Women account for half of all people living with HIV worldwide, increasing to nearly 60% of HIV infections in sub-Saharan Africa <xref rid="pone.0024095-UNAIDS1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Vaginally applied microbicide agents offer a potential strategy for prevention of the sexual transmission of HIV or other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) that can be initiated by women. Microbicide classes include non-specific surfactants or detergents and acid buffering agents, moderately specific macromolecular anionic polymers that block HIV and other STIs, and HIV specific drugs that inhibit viral entry and reverse transcription <xref rid="pone.0024095-Balzarini1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. A proof of concept study demonstrating that a vaginal topical microbicide gel containing 1% tenofovir can protect women against HIV acquisition with 39% efficacy compared to placebo gel provides credence to the development of topical microbicides for HIV prevention <xref rid="pone.0024095-AbdoolKarim1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p>
              <p>SPL7013 Gel (VivaGelÂ®) is a vaginal microbicide being developed by Starpharma Pty Ltd (Melbourne, Australia) for the prevention of HIV and herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections <xref rid="pone.0024095-Rupp1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The active ingredient, SPL7013, is a dendrimer comprising a divalent benzhydrylamine (BHA) core, four generations of lysine branches with the outermost branches capped with a total of 32 naphthalene disulfonic acid groups that impart hydrophobicity and a high anionic charge to the dendrimer surface <xref rid="pone.0024095-Tyssen1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. SPL7013 has been formulated in a mucoadhesive Carbopol<sup>Â®</sup>-based aqueous gel for use as a topical vaginal microbicide <xref rid="pone.0024095-McCarthy1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024095-Bourne1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p>

In contrast to most linear polyanion microbicides, SPL7013 demonstrates similar potency against HIV-1 that utilize the CXCR4 and CCR5 chemokine receptors <xref rid="pone.0024095-Tyssen1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, the latter accounting for the majority of HIV transmissions <xref rid="pone.0024095-Shattock1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. SPL7013 is active against HIV in cell culture assays in the presence of high concentrations of serum and cervicovaginal secretions <xref rid="pone.0024095-Tyssen1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, and retains HIV inhibitory activity when diluted 30-fold in seminal plasma <xref rid="pone.0024095-LackmanSmith1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. SPL7013 also inhibits HIV-1 replication in colorectal and cervical explant systems against a CCR5 using strain <xref rid="pone.0024095-Abner1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024095-CumminsJE1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> and does not specifically enhance HIV-1 replication <italic>in vitro</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0024095-Sonza1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. SPL7013 has low toxicity in cervical and colorectal epithelial cell lines and lacks the ability to disrupt intracellular tight junctions of polarized epithelial cells <xref rid="pone.0024095-Dezzutti1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p>
              <p>In a macaque model, SPL7013 Gel was protective against vaginal challenge with a CXCR4 using simian humanised immunodeficiency virus (SHIV<sub>89.6P</sub>) in a dose-related manner and inhibits replication of the CCR5 using SHIV<sub>162P3</sub> strain in macaque and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) <xref rid="pone.0024095-Jiang1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.

              <p>In order to predict the <italic>in vivo</italic> efficacy of a microbicide, there has been a focus on performing pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies to evaluate whether a candidate microbicide is bioavailable and present at levels sufficient to block HIV replication following vaginal application <xref rid="pone.0024095-Keller1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024095-Lacey1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024095-Keller2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Efficacy studies of candidate microbicides against vaginal challenge of SHIV in nonhuman primate models indicate that microbicide concentrations that are required to prevent <italic>in vivo</italic> infection are orders of magnitude greater than the microbicide 50% effective concentrations (EC<sub>50</sub>) observed in cell culture <xref rid="pone.0024095-Jiang1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024095-Lederman1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Furthermore, seminal plasma diminishes the ability of microbicide candidates to inhibit HIV and HSV <xref rid="pone.0024095-Neurath1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024095-Patel1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Thus, prior to performing microbicide efficacy studies in women it is critical to determine whether levels of microbicide that can be recovered after vaginal dosing are substantially in excess of the concentrations required to block viral replication in the absence and presence of seminal plasma. In addition, elucidating antiviral levels of microbicide that can be recovered as a function of time post-application is important for predicting whether the microbicide needs to be applied immediately prior to coitus or whether coitus can be delayed.</p>
              <p>Here we describe the first clinical study of a topical microbicide that investigates <italic>ex vivo</italic> antiviral activity and local retention of SPL7013 Gel over a 24 h period following a single vaginal application of SPL7013 Gel in women. In addition, cervicovaginal fluid (CVF) samples were recovered by the participants using the SoftCupâ¢ as an alternative to cervicovaginal lavage used in previous studies to evaluate <italic>in vivo</italic> microbicide levels <xref rid="pone.0024095-Keller1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024095-Lacey1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024095-Keller2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. The rationale for using the SoftCup was to enable self-sampling of the vaginal vault without introducing an unknown dilution normally associated with the cervicovaginal lavage method. The study was performed in healthy, sexually abstinent, HIV-uninfected women. Our data demonstrate that SPL7013 Gel was successfully recovered after vaginal dosing from all subjects and that high-levels of HIV-1 and HSV-2 inhibitory activity were observed in CVF samples in all participants up to 3 h post-dose, and in more than 50% of women at 24 h post-dose.</p>

The study was an open-label, single centre, randomised (for order of sampling with the treatment being the same in each case), 5-period, cross-over study, conducted between September 2008 and March 2009 at the clinical facilities of Nucleus Network [Alfred Medical Research and Education Precinct (AMREP) Centre for Clinical Studies], Melbourne, Australia. Study participants undertook five single applications of SPL7013 Gel, each dose separated by a minimum of 5 days. CVF samples were taken at 0 (within 2â10 min) (baseline), 1, 3, 12 or 24 h post-application in a randomised fashion using the INSTEAD<sup>Â®</sup> SoftCupâ¢. Additional CVF samples were collected at enrolment prior to dosing (pre-dose sampling period) for determination of intrinsic antiviral activity and assay validation. CVF samples were also collected at follow-up (approximately 1 week post final sample) for the determination of SPL7013 levels. Ethics approval was granted by the Alfred Human Research Ethics Committee (Drugs and Interventions Committee) on 31<sup>st</sup> July 2008.</p>

                <p>Female volunteers aged between 18â45 years were recruited by advertisement, and gave written informed consent to participate. Participants were eligible if they were not pregnant or breastfeeding, had a regular menstrual cycle, were in good general health as determined by medical history and physical/pelvic examination and Pap smear, did not have any sexually transmitted, urinary or vaginal infections, were not using any vaginal products, and were using a reliable form of contraception (<italic>i.e.</italic>, sterilisation, inter-uterine device or non-vaginal hormonal contraception).</p>

                <title>Study procedures</title>
                <p>A screening visit was conducted up to 28 days prior to enrolment. During this visit a physical examination was performed, including a pelvic exam (with Pap smear if not performed in the previous year), vital signs and determination of body mass index (BMI). Samples were taken for HIV, HSV, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> and <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> screening, laboratory assessment (routine biochemistry, haematology and urinalysis), and pregnancy testing.</p>
                <p>Women who fulfilled eligibility criteria and signed informed consent were enrolled in the trial. The SoftCupâ¢ (Instead, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA), a commercial menstrual collection device, was used to collect CVF samples, as previously described <xref rid="pone.0024095-Boskey1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. During the screening visit, each woman was trained in inserting and removing the SoftCup. Each participant was then provided with three CVF sampling kits (comprising a SoftCup, a 50 mL tube, an opaque bag marked with participant details and exact weight of the kit, and an instruction sheet), and discharged from the site. During the pre-dose sampling period (after the screening visit but before first dose of study product), participants provided three separate pre-dose CVF samples. Each sample was taken at least 24 h apart by inserting the SoftCup into the vagina, and then removing after 10â30 seconds. The used SoftCups containing CVF samples were then inserted in 50 mL sterile polypropylene tube and finally sealed in a labelled opaque envelope. Each pre-dose sample was obtained at the participant's home and refrigerated until being packed on ice and couriered to the study site within 24 h of collection. Once the pre-dose phase was complete, study participants attended six further visits to the clinical site. There was one visit each for Treatment Periods 1 to 5, and a follow-up visit at least one week after the final study treatment administration.</p>
                <p>At Treatment Period 1 eligibility was confirmed, a urine pregnancy test performed, and each participant was randomised to one of five different sampling sequences. Each woman administered one applicator of SPL7013 Gel, and then obtained a CVF sample, as before, either immediately post-dose (within 2â10 min) (baseline); or at 1, 3, 12 or 24 h post-dose, depending upon the sampling sequence to which she was randomised. These procedures were repeated during Treatment Periods 2â5, such that a CVF sample was obtained for each woman at each of the 5 post-dose time-points.</p>
                <p>Treatment Periods 1â5 were scheduled during the intra-menstrual period (at least 2 days prior to or 5 days after the expected onset of menses), and at least 5 days apart. Each post-dose CVF sample was obtained at the study site, and participants were permitted to leave the clinical unit between application and sample collection except when the baseline or 1 h samples were collected.</p>
                <p>Participants were required to abstain from sexual and vigorous physical activity for 24 h prior to pre-dose sampling or product administration, and for the period between product application and post-dose CVF sampling. Participants were also required to refrain from administering vaginal preparations throughout the study period (except tampons, which were permitted for menstruation outside the product administration and sampling periods). The exception to this restriction was vaginal treatment of candidiasis or bacterial vaginosis products, which were permitted if prescribed by a medical practitioner. In such cases, study visits were to be suspended until 5 days after the cessation of treatment.</p>
                <p>The final status of participants was determined at the follow-up visit, which included a physical exam (including vital signs and pelvic exam), laboratory assessment and a pregnancy test. The final CVF sample was also obtained at this visit for evaluation of SPL7013 levels. Throughout the study, data were collected on the participants' compliance with the study protocol, occurrence of adverse events (AEs), and administration of any concomitant medication.</p>

                <title>Storage and handling of the cervicovaginal samples</title>
                <p>All CVF samples were stored at 4Â°C until processing, which was performed within 24 h of obtaining the study sample. The amount of recovered CVF was determining by calculating the difference between the combined weight of the 50 ml tube, the used SoftCup (with recovered CVF) and its original wrapper, and the combined weight of the unused SoftCup in its wrapper and the 50 ml tube. The viscosity of SPL7013 Gel made it difficult to quantitatively remove from the SoftCup. Therefore, to maintain consistency in the method used for recovery of the immediate pre-dose and post-dose samples, the CVF sample was washed from the SoftCup using aliquots of chilled 0.9% sterile phosphate buffered saline solution totalling 20 mL with shaking and low speed centrifugation to extract the maximum amount of sample from the cup. Ciprofloxacin and gentamicin were added to the clarified CVF samples to a final concentration of 5 Âµg/mL and 50 Âµg/mL respectively, for samples to be evaluated for HIV-1 and HSV-2 inhibitory activity. Samples without antibiotic were used for determination of the mass of SPL7013. All samples were stored at â80Â°C prior to analysis.</p>

                <p>The determination of SPL7013 recovery in CVF samples was performed using a capillary zone electrophoresis method. The CVF samples were extracted from the SoftCups using a series of end-to-end rotation and centrifugation steps in the presence of isotonic saline solution. The SPL7013 and the internal standard, Orange G (Sigma-Aldrich, Castle-Hill, NSW, Australia), were monitored at 240 nm on a Beckman P/ACE MDQ capillary electropherograph (CE) equipped with a diode array detector. The concentration of SPL7013 in the unknown samples was determined using a calibration curve derived from samples of known SPL7013 concentrations. Total mass of SPL7013 present in the original sample was determined by correcting for the dilution during processing of the sample. The lower limit of quantitation for the SPL7013 recovery from the SoftCup and subsequent analysis was 2.25 mg.</p>

                <p>The HIV-1 inhibitory activity of pre- and post-dose CVF samples was determined against HIV<sub>Ba-L</sub>, a laboratory clade B strain that utilises the CCR5 chemokine coreceptor for viral entry <xref rid="pone.0024095-Gartner1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Assays were performed in the TZM-b1 indicator cell line using luciferase as the readout for HIV replication <xref rid="pone.0024095-Tyssen1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Tissue culture plates (96-well, Nunc) were seeded with 20,000 cells per well the day prior to assay. CVF samples were then diluted 1â¶2, 1â¶4 and 1â¶20 in Opti-MEM (Gibco) containing 0.05 Âµg/mL amphotericin B (which does not inhibit HIV-1 replication at this concentration, data not shown), 2.5 Âµg/mL ciprofloxacin, 50 Âµg/mL gentamicin and 20 Âµg/mL DEAE-dextran, added to triplicate wells and the plates incubated for 30 min at 37Â°C in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> humidified incubator. HIV-1<sub>Ba-L</sub> virus stock, propagated in PBMCs from HIV seronegative donors, was then added at 500 infectious units (IU)/well and the plates incubated for a further 2 days. HIV-1 replication was assessed by determination of luciferase activity in cell lysates using the Steady-Glo Luciferase Assay System (Promega). Virus only and cell controls were included to determine maximum levels of HIV-1 replication and background levels of luciferase activity, respectively. The percentage inhibition of HIV-1 replication in pre-dose and post-dose samples was calculated by dividing the average luciferase activity obtained from triplicate wells (after subtracting background luciferase activity from uninfected cells) by the luciferase activity obtained from untreated HIV-1<sub>Ba-L</sub> infected cells. Unformulated SPL7013 was used as a positive control, and assays were considered valid if the EC<sub>50</sub> fell within two standard deviations of the mean of previously performed assays (5.0Â±5.2 Âµg/mL, nâ=â8). The SPL7013 EC<sub>50</sub> value was calculated from nonlinear regression analysis of the data as described previously <xref rid="pone.0024095-Tyssen1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Cytotoxicity of CVF samples was determined at the same time in duplicate plates to which CVF dilutions but no virus were added. Cytotoxicity was assessed using the MTS reagent (CellTiter 96 Aqueous One, Promega) as previously described <xref rid="pone.0024095-Tyssen1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. CVF samples that resulted in cell viability of less than 80% compared to the cell control were considered cytotoxic and were not considered for effects on HIV-1 replication. Three independent valid assays were performed for each CVF sample.</p>

                <title>Evaluation of HSV-2 inhibitory activity</title>
                <p>The HSV-2 inhibitory activity of CVF samples was determined in human embryonic lung (HEL) fibroblasts using cell viability as the readout for viral replication. The HSV-2 isolate (#250733) <xref rid="pone.0024095-Tyssen1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> that was used in the assay is a highly cytopathic clinical isolate obtained from an Australian patient and isolated and typed by the Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory (VIDRL, Melbourne, Australia). Tissue culture plates (96-well) were seeded with 6,000 cells per well a day prior to assay and then triplicate wells were incubated with CVF samples, diluted 1â¶2, 1â¶5 and 1â¶50 in DMEM (Gibco) containing 2 mM glutamine, 25 mM HEPES, 2.5 Âµg/mL amphotericin B, 10 Âµg/mL ciprofloxacin, 50 Âµg/mL gentamicin and 2% foetal calf serum, for 30 min at 37Â°C in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> humidified incubator, followed by addition of HSV-2 (560 TCID<sub>50</sub>/well). The plates were incubated for a further 5 days before HSV-2 replication was assessed by cell viability using the MTS reagent. Virus and cell only controls were included and cytotoxicity of the CVF dilutions determined as above. CVF samples that resulted in cell viability of less than 70% compared to the cell control were considered cytotoxic and were not considered for effects on HSV-2 replication. The definition of cytotoxicity for HEL cells differed to that used for TZM-bl cells due to the sensitivity of HEL cells to &gt;100 Âµg/ml of SPL7013 (data not shown). The percentage inhibition of samples was calculated by subtracting the average optical density (OD) of samples relative to cell only controls (after subtracting virus only controls) from 100. Unformulated SPL7013 was used as a positive control, and assays were considered valid if the EC<sub>50</sub> fell within the range 1.0Â±1.3 Âµg/ml (mean Â±2SD, nâ=â5). Again, three independent valid assays were performed for each CVF sample.</p>

To achieve a similar level of luciferase activity after 2 days incubation to that seen without seminal plasma, a 4-fold higher inoculum of HIV-1<sub>Ba-L</sub> was required.

An additional woman completed four time-points, including the baseline sample, and therefore was included in the Per Protocol analysis. One of the 12 participants was lost to follow up due to reasons unrelated to AEs or study procedures. Participants were aged between 19â37 years old (mean 25 years old), with a BMI ranging from 18.2 to 30.3 (mean 23.5). All women were using hormonal contraception at baseline, and continued throughout the study.</p>
                <p>There were no clinically significant changes in systemic laboratory parameters during the study. No grade 3 or 4 AEs, serious AEs or deaths were reported during the study. Eight non-genitourinary AEs (mainly grade 1) were experienced by six subjects (50%), all of which were considered not related to study product. Seven genitourinary AEs were experienced by four subjects (33.3%) who received at least one dose of 3% SPL7013 Gel. Two of the AEs reported were considered likely related to SPL7013 Gel administration and were perineal irritation (Grade 1) and bacterial vaginosis (Grade 2). The only reported AEs considered to be possibly related to 3% SPL7013 Gel administration were three cases of clinical symptoms of vaginal candidiasis in three subjects (Grade 1). All other AEs were deemed unlikely to be related to SPL7013 Gel and were Grade 1 in severity. No trends were observed for the time of onset of AE, or randomisation sequence for CVF sampling time.</p>

                <p>The ability of pre- and post-dose samples to inhibit HIV-1 replication was determined in the TZM-bl indicator cell line. CVF samples recovered in 20 mL of saline were subjected to an additional 1â¶2 dilution in medium, representing a total dilution of â¼1â¶40 of the neat CVF sample, which was not cytotoxic to TZM-bl cells used to evaluate HIV-1 inhibitory activity. Since CVF samples obtained at the final non-dosing study visit were found to have undetectable levels of SPL7013, they were not evaluated for antiviral activity. The median (interquartile range) inhibition of HIV-1 by pre-dose CVF samples was 1.9% (0, 5.6). In contrast, almost complete HIV-1 inhibition was observed with baseline CVF samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0024095-g003">Figure 3A</xref>), where a median (interquartile range) inhibition of 96% (95, 97) was achieved.

Inhibition of HIV replication at 1 and 3 h post-dose was not significantly different (defined as pâ¤0.003, Bonferroni adjusted p-value significance level) compared to the baseline CVF sample. There was a significant drop in median inhibition observed at 12 and 24 h post-dose, which was due to reductions in the ability of recovered CVF samples from five women to inhibit HIV-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0024095-g003">Figure 3A</xref>).</p>

In contrast to HIV-1, the difference between median inhibition at baseline and that seen at either 12 or 24 h did not reach, but tended towards, statistical significance for HSV-2. In contrast to the HIV-1 inhibition assays, CVF samples recovered in 20 ml of saline were diluted an additional 1 in 50 for evaluation of HSV-2 inhibitory activity since this was the lowest dilution that was noncytotoxic to the HEL cells used in the assay.</p>

                <p>The Placebo Gel is identical to SPL7013 Gel except for the absence of SPL7013. Thus, the Placebo gel comprises a Carbopol vehicle at pH 4.5, so the acidity of this gel could impart virucidal activity <xref rid="pone.0024095-OConnor1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024095-Olmsted1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024095-Connor1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Therefore, to determine the contribution of SPL7013 in the SPL7013 Gel formulation to the antiviral activity of CVF samples obtained in the study, <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments with Placebo Gel were performed to mimic the assays performed with CVF samples from the trial participants. Either 2 g of either SPL7013 Gel or Placebo Gel were combined with 0.5 g of pooled CVF samples. These samples where then processed as described for the participant CVF samples, except that we investigated additional sample dilutions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0024095-g006">Figure 6A and B</xref>). In parallel, assays were performed to determine doses that were not toxic to the cells used in the antiviral assays to identify dilutions that could be evaluated for antiviral activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0024095-g006">Figure 6C and D</xref>).</p>

                <p>The data reported here show similar levels of HIV-1 inhibition by SPL7013 Gel and Placebo Gel diluted at 1â¶2 and 1â¶4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0024095-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). In contrast, â¥90% HIV-1 inhibition by SPL7013 Gel was observed at 1â¶20, 1â¶100 and 1â¶200 dilution while inhibition was lower in the presence of Placebo Gel, which tended towards significance (pâ=â0.05). No cytotoxicity was observed for either gel formulation at any of the dilutions tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0024095-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). The HIV-1 inhibitory activity of post-dose CVF samples that were diluted 1â¶20 compared to the 1â¶2 dilution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0024095-g003">Figure 3A</xref>) demonstrated similar high levels of HIV inhibition (â¥85%) for all participants up to 3 h post-dose (data not shown). These data indicate that the HIV-1 inhibitory activity of CVF samples can be observed at dilutions where SPL7013 Gel (and thus SPL7013), but not Placebo Gel is inhibitory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0024095-g006">Figure 6A</xref>).</p>
                <p>Significant cytotoxicity is observed in cells used in the HSV-2 inhibitory assays at 1â¶2 and 1â¶5 dilutions for both SPL7013 Gel and Placebo Gel (compromising the ability to assess HSV-2 inhibition at these dilutions), but not at the 1â¶50 dilution or greater (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0024095-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). Cytotoxicity was absent at and above 1â¶50 dilution and these dilutions could thus be evaluated for anti-HSV-2 activity. SPL7013 Gel demonstrated high levels of HSV-2 inhibition compared to Placebo Gel, which lacked inhibitory activity at 1â¶50, 1â¶100 and 1â¶200 dilutions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0024095-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). Since post-dose CVF samples from all participants were tested at a 1â¶50 dilution in the anti-HSV-2 assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0024095-g003">Figure 3B</xref>), the inhibition observed in our cell culture assays is almost certainly due to SPL7013 and not the vehicle (Placebo Gel). Taken together, these data indicate that both SPL7013 and Placebo Gel are likely to contribute to HIV-1 inhibitory activity, however SPL7013-containing gel retains HIV-1 and HSV-2 inhibitory activity upon significant dilution.</p>

              <p>This study demonstrates for the first time the retention of HIV-1 and HSV-2 inhibitory levels of SPL7013 Gel in the female genital tract over a 24 h period. The strength of this study compared to previous studies of microbicide vaginal pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics <xref rid="pone.0024095-Keller1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024095-Lacey1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> is that we followed the time course of retention of antiviral activity present in recovered CVF samples after a single dose of microbicide, in addition to determining the concentrations of SPL7013 present in recovered CVF samples with time. Furthermore, the SoftCup was effectively used for the recovery of CVF samples instead of cervicovaginal lavage, thus allowing direct calculation of the degree of sample dilution. Our data show that the minimum retention time, consistent with high level HIV-1 and HSV-2 inhibitory activity in the post-dose CVF samples in all participants, was 3 h after a single dose of SPL7013 Gel. Remarkably, the CVF samples from the majority of participants (6/11) also demonstrated high levels (â¥80% inhibition) of antiviral activity at 24 h post-dose. Quantitation of the mass of SPL7013 recovered from CVF samples showed that &gt;9 mg and &gt;2.5 mg of SPL7013 was associated with high levels of HIV-1 and HSV-2 inhibition, respectively, representing a small fraction of the original 105 mg dose of SPL7013 in SPL7013 Gel. Notably, antiviral activity was retained in the presence of seminal plasma for the majority of the participants up to 3 h post-dose indicating that dosing of SPL7013 Gel up to 3 h prior to coitus could be incorporated in clinical trials evaluating microbicide efficacy.</p>
              <p>Consistent with previous phase I safety studies, SPL7013 Gel demonstrated no serious AEs, nor Grade 3 or 4 AEs, and the genitourinary AEs were mainly mild in severity <xref rid="pone.0024095-OLoughlin1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024095-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. No trends were observed for the time of onset of AE or randomisation sequence for CVF sampling time and there were no withdrawals due to AEs.</p>
              <p>Remarkably, prolonged retention of HIV-1 and HSV-2 inhibitory activity was observed in the CVF samples from the majority of participants at 12 (8/11) and 24 h (6/11) post-dose. SPL7013 is formulated in a Carbopol vehicle that has mucoadhesive properties, which may extend its retention in the female genital tract. However, it is not clear why some women demonstrated prolonged retention of SPL7013 compared to others. The women, while ambulatory, were instructed to abstain from sex and not undertake physical exercise, such as running, that could promote clearance of the gel from the vagina. Natural variations in anatomical shape of the vagina may have contributed to the difference in retention. It is also possible that women experiencing lower SPL7013 retention times may have experienced vaginal child-birth, thus weakening the pelvic floor. However, such data was not collected from the participants and therefore it would be interesting to examine this possibility in future studies.</p>
              <p>A limitation of this study is that, in order to determine HIV-1 and HSV-2 inhibitory levels in recovered pre- and post-dose CVF samples, it was necessary to dilute the samples. This was because the assays were cell culture based and our pilot studies demonstrated that cervicovaginal secretions, the gel vehicle and moderately high concentrations of SPL7013 (in the case of HEL cells) reduced cell viability and therefore would interfere with the evaluation of antiviral levels in the CVF samples. Accordingly, we performed antiviral and cytotoxicity assays in parallel and three independent assays to obtain robust data for analysis. The total dilution of the 1â¶2 and 1â¶50 CVF samples tested in the HIV-1 and HSV-2 inhibition assays was approximately 1â¶40 and 1â¶1000 respectively, after taking into consideration dilution of the sample with 20 mL of sterile saline that was essential for quantitative removal of sample from the SoftCup. This compares to final (estimated) dilutions of 1â¶20 and 1â¶40 in PRO 2000 samples recovered after vaginal application by cervicovaginal lavage using 10 mL of saline <xref rid="pone.0024095-Keller1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Given the considerable dilution of CVF samples, virus inhibition observed for pre- and post-dose samples are likely to be an underestimate of the actual activity and quantity of the product in the genital tract. CVF sample dilution could also explain why we did not observe intrinsic HIV-1 <xref rid="pone.0024095-Ghosh1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> and HSV-2 <xref rid="pone.0024095-John1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> inhibitory activity in pre-dose CVF samples from all participants similar to that observed in a previous study with PRO 2000 <xref rid="pone.0024095-Keller1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Extensive dilution of our CVF samples is also likely to underestimate the length of duration of high levels of antiviral activity.</p>
              <p>PRO 2000 is a linear macromolecular polyanion microbicide, which has undergone similar studies to determine the retention of antiviral levels of microbicide after intravaginal dosing in women, except that samples were recovered by cervicovaginal lavage with 10 mL of saline and only single time points were evaluated <xref rid="pone.0024095-Keller1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024095-Lacey1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. For the 0.5% PRO 2000 dose, 6.6% recovery of PRO 2000 was achieved for the 2 h post-dose samples <xref rid="pone.0024095-Lacey1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> and 5.8 â 17% recovery for 0.5% PRO 2000 at 1 h post-dose <xref rid="pone.0024095-Keller1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> using the same calculation as described by Lacey and colleagues <xref rid="pone.0024095-Lacey1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Using the SoftCup we achieved an average 41% recovery (50 mg) of the original 105 mg dose of SPL7013 in the 1 h post-dose CVF samples, which is substantially greater than the highest recovery reported for 0.5% PRO 2000. In addition, the baseline post-dose recovery of SPL7013 was 46%. The SoftCup method's recovery of a robust fraction of the recently applied SPL7013 increases confidence in its effective recovery of the intraluminal drug. The SoftCup has a soft elastomeric rubber rim surrounding a collection dome, which when inserted and removed from the vagina has a spatula-like action that may more efficiently collect viscous fluids from the vaginal lumen than does cervicovaginal lavage. However, complete recovery of SPL7013 Gel was not achieved even for baseline post-dose CVF samples. SPL7013 loss is unlikely to be due to systemic absorption <xref rid="pone.0024095-Rupp1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Thus, SPL7013 Gel may have been lost due to leakage from the vagina, inaccessibility to the SoftCup or remained non-specifically bound to the epithelial cells lining the female genital tract. Our data also show that use of the SoftCup leads to reproducible sample recovery independent of the sampling sequence, allows direct calculation of the extent of sample dilution, and can be self administered by the participant following minimal instruction, thus representing a promising alternative to cervicovaginal lavage.</p>
              <p>Levels of PRO 2000 that were sufficient to block HIV-1 infection in cell culture assays were recovered from retention studies with 0.5% PRO 2000 <xref rid="pone.0024095-Keller1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024095-Lacey1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. However, this formulation failed to demonstrate significant protection in preventing HIV acquisition in phase IIB and III clinical trials <xref rid="pone.0024095-AbdoolKarim2" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024095-McCormack1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. The dendrimer, SPL7013, has a chemically defined structure and a distinct surface group compared to polymeric linear polyanion-based microbicides such as PRO 2000. In the 3.5g dose of 3%w/w SPL7013 Gel there is an approximate 20,000-fold excess of SPL7013 delivered to the female genital tract compared with the <italic>in vitro</italic> EC<sub>50</sub> for HIV clinical isolates and an approximate 45,000-fold excess of SPL7013 compared with the <italic>in vitro</italic> EC<sub>50</sub> for a HSV-2 clinical isolate <xref rid="pone.0024095-Tyssen1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Compared to 2 g of 0.5% PRO 2000 <xref rid="pone.0024095-Lacey1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, SPL7013 Gel delivers a 10.5-fold higher mass of active drug at levels that are tolerated <italic>in vivo</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0024095-OLoughlin1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Our retention study shows that in baseline, 1 and 3 h post-dose CVF samples we were able to recover an average 48, 43 and 22 mg of SPL7013, respectively. This represents SPL7013 levels (even when diluted in semen and CV secretions) that are at least 10<sup>3</sup>-fold greater than the cell culture EC<sub>50</sub> for inhibition of both HIV-1 and HSV-2. In previous studies, a 1â¶30 dilution of SPL7013 Gel retained anti-HIV activity in the presence of seminal plasma retained anti-HIV activity in cell culture assays <xref rid="pone.0024095-LackmanSmith1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Consistent with this observation, the HIV-1 and HSV-2 inhibitory activities of recovered CVF samples in this study remained high for the majority of participants up to 3 h post dose even when assays were performed in the presence of seminal plasma. However, other factors that could affect the efficacy of a gel based macromolecular microbicide, apart from dilution or inhibition by genital secretions, includes its re-distribution within the vagina, which may also be affected by stirring during the act of coitus <xref rid="pone.0024095-Keller2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, which was not assessed in this study. As significant inhibition of HIV-1 and HSV-2 is achieved with a small percentage of the original dose of SPL7013, it can be theorised that the effects of coitus would not significantly impact the activity of the product. However this could only be established with further clinical investigation. Nevertheless, in the proof of concept study demonstrating that a topical microbicide gel containing 1% tenofovir protected women against HIV acquisition with 39% efficacy compared to placebo gel, more HIV negative women had detectable CVF concentrations of tenofovir, and tenofovir concentrations in CVF were associated with reduced risk of HIV and HSV-2 infection <xref rid="pone.0024095-Kashuba1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, we have demonstrated retention of high-level HIV-1 and HSV-2 inhibitory activity of a dendrimer microbicide following vaginal administration that is long-lived in the majority of participants. While efficacy trials will be required to determine whether SPL7013 Gel is able to protect women against HIV and HSV acquisition, the concentration of drug in CVF samples is a potentially important means to determine target drug concentrations for providing protection and is a potential surrogate marker for protection.</p>
