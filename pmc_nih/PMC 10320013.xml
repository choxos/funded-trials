                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Cannabis is increasingly used both medically and recreationally. With widespread use, there is growing concern about how to identify cannabis-impaired drivers.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="s2">
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>A placebo-controlled randomized double-blinded protocol was conducted to study the effects of cannabis on driving performance. One hundred ninety-one participants were randomized to smoke ad libitum a cannabis cigarette containing placebo or delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) (5.9% or 13.4%). Blood, oral fluid (OF), and breath samples were collected along with longitudinal driving performance on a simulator (standard deviation of lateral position [SDLP] and car following [coherence]) over a 5-hour period. Law enforcement officers performed field sobriety tests (FSTs) to determine if participants were impaired.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="s3">
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>There was no relationship between THC concentrations measured in blood, OF, or breath and SDLP or coherence at any of the timepoints studied (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &gt; 0.05). FSTs were significant (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.05) for classifying participants into the THC group vs the placebo group up to 188 minutes after smoking. Seventy-one minutes after smoking, FSTs classified 81% of the participants who received active drug as being impaired. However, 49% of participants who smoked placebo (controls) were also deemed impaired at this same timepoint. Combining a 2 ng/mL THC cutoff in OF with positive findings on FSTs reduced the number of controls classified as impaired to zero, 86 minutes after smoking the placebo.</p>

                <sec id="s4">
                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>Requiring a positive toxicology result in addition to the FST observations substantially improved the classification accuracy regarding possible driving under the influence of THC by decreasing the percentage of controls classified as impaired.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>The relationship between cannabis use and driving impairment is complex because of the unique pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of cannabis's major intoxicant: delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) (<xref rid="hvad054-B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). “Impairment” is difficult to define because there is no universally agreed-upon task that can be used to define driving impairment. With ethanol there is a clear relationship between the amount of alcohol consumed, blood alcohol concentrations, and the effects on driving performance (<xref rid="hvad054-B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). With cannabis, these relationships are more complex (<xref rid="hvad054-B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). The relationship between blood THC concentrations and crash risk is not established, but there is a clear understanding that THC impairs driving performance in many, but not necessarily all, individuals (<xref rid="hvad054-B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="hvad054-B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). The question that remains is how to best identify drivers who are impaired by cannabis.</p>
              <p>There are multiple components that influence the relationship between cannabis and impairment. These include factors related to cannabis itself (e.g., % THC content), cannabis use characteristics (e.g., route of administration, frequency, and amount of exposure), characteristics of the individual using cannabis (e.g., experience, prior use), and when impairment is assessed relative to dosing. The psychoactive effects of cannabis inhalation begin within minutes of smoking or vaporization and peak within 3 hours (<xref rid="hvad054-B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), while oral administration causes effects that begin in approximately 1 hour and last up to 8 hours (<xref rid="hvad054-B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). This observation is consistent with findings showing driving-related skills recover between 3 and 5 hours after smoking cannabis (<xref rid="hvad054-B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="hvad054-B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Unlike alcohol, which is cleared within 24 hours of drinking, THC accumulates with repeated dosing, resulting in some frequent users having baseline blood concentrations &gt;5 ng/mL. Although there may be no measurable impairment, background THC concentrations can exceed the per se driving impairment limits currently employed in some states, which are generally set at 2 or 5 ng/mL of THC in blood (<xref rid="hvad054-B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="hvad054-B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). The term per se in context of driving under the influence means that when concentrations exceed the specified limit, a person is considered to be under the influence based solely on the toxicology test. After smoking, blood THC concentrations drop about 90% in the first hour (<xref rid="hvad054-B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="hvad054-B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Since it can take several hours to collect a blood specimen following a traffic stop (<xref rid="hvad054-B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), it is difficult to estimate circulating blood THC concentrations at the time of driving. In one field study of 602 cases in which drug recognition experts (DREs) determined the driver was impaired due to cannabis only (toxicology confirmed), the median THC concentration was 5.05 ng/mL—meaning that around 50% of the group were below per se limits used by some states (<xref rid="hvad054-B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p>
              <p>Oral fluid (OF) is an alternative specimen that can be rapidly collected at the roadside to detect recent use of cannabis. OF has several advantages compared with analysis of blood; sample collection is noninvasive, it can be tested on screening devices at the point of contact, and, like blood, preliminary results can be confirmed by robust analytical techniques such as LC-MS/MS (<xref rid="hvad054-B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="hvad054-B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Analyzing breath samples for THC content has also been proposed for identifying recent cannabis use (<xref rid="hvad054-B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p>
              <p>In the first study to evaluate police officers’ performance for detecting drug-related impairment (<xref rid="hvad054-B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), adult male participants were randomized to receive cannabis, diazepam, secobarbital, or d-amphetamine. In this study the officers were trained DREs and were blinded to the participant's study drug. Only one participant was misidentified as under the influence of cannabis, while the individual was actually administered diazepam. The ability of the officers to correctly identify cannabis exposure (sensitivity) was low but dose related, as the officers correctly identified more participants on the high THC dose as compared with the low THC dose.</p>
              <p>Heishman et al. (<xref rid="hvad054-B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) performed a placebo-controlled double-blind study examining the ability of DREs to correctly classify participants who had been exposed to placebo, ethanol, cocaine, or THC. These authors showed that when the DRE determined impairment due to drugs other than ethanol (e.g., cocaine or THC), DRE conclusions matched toxicology results in 44% of cases. However, when considering cannabis, DREs determined that 6/16 of the participants exposed to placebo were impaired (<xref rid="hvad054-B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p>
              <p>In a follow-up study, Heishman measured maximum THC plasma concentrations of 28 and 61 ng/mL 2 minutes after smoking cannabis in a low- and high-dose group, respectively (<xref rid="hvad054-B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). In this trial, more placebo-exposed participants were considered impaired than the low-dose cannabis group. These authors concluded that DRE determinations of impairment were consistent with toxicology findings in only 32% of the cases (<xref rid="hvad054-B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). The authors point out several reasons for this discrepancy including that, in the field, officers observe other clues including driving behavior, drug paraphernalia, and cannabis odor.</p>
              <p>Most of the published research examining the reliability of DRE observations has been conducted under controlled experimental conditions and only included part of the full DRE exam. This is unavoidable in studies where participants are examined more than once because a full DRE exam typically lasts about an hour (<xref rid="hvad054-B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). This has important implications when correlating laboratory studies with field studies, because several important steps of the DRE examination, such as interviewing the arresting officer, searching the participant, examining for physical signs of drug administration, and performing a breath alcohol test, are not possible in a laboratory study conducted over multiple timepoints after smoking cannabis.</p>
              <p>In this manuscript we report results from the largest randomized double-blinded-placebo-controlled trial to date that examines the relationship between THC concentrations in various biofluids and performance in a driving simulator. We also report on police officers’ assessment of cannabis impairment based solely on field sobriety tests (FSTs) as well as when combined with various biofluid THC concentrations for the classification of persons exposed to active drug or placebo. We report the effect of different cut-points for blood and oral fluid (OF) at different timepoints for classifying participants deemed impaired on FSTs.</p>

Briefly, 199 participants were randomized and classified as “frequent” or “occasional” users. Participants using cannabis ≥ 4 times/week were termed “frequent” users, while those with intake at least 4 times per month but &lt; 4 times/week were termed “occasional” users. Of these 199 participants, 7 were excluded due to having &gt; 5 ng/mL THC in OF on the day of the experimental visit, and one participant withdrew, resulting in 191 participants. Participants were randomized to smoke 700 mg of placebo (0.02% THC), 5.9% THC, or 13.4% THC cannabis in a double-blind manner. The characteristics of the dosing material were described previously (<xref rid="hvad054-B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Participants were required to take at least 4 puffs and could smoke as much as they desired during a 10-minute smoking period. Participants were instructed to “smoke as you would at home to achieve desired highness.” The participants that smoked active drug (5.9% and 13.4% THC) were combined into a single group for all of the analyses in this report because there were no significant differences between how these 2 groups performed on the driving simulator (<xref rid="hvad054-B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) and no correlation was observed between the potential amount of THC smoked (mg based on weight returned following smoking) compared to perceived highness (<xref rid="hvad054-B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). The term “active drug” refers to participants smoking either a 5.9% or 13.4% THC cigarette.</p>

                <p>THC and related cannabinoids were quantified in blood, OF, and breath on a Waters TQ-S micro LC-MS/MS system. Analytical method details were published previously (<xref rid="hvad054-B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="hvad054-B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Precision and accuracy of THC measurements were within +/−15% with a lower limit of quantification of 0.5 ng/mL in blood, 0.4 ng/mL in OF, and 80 pg/breath pad. Blood was collected using sodium fluoride as the anticoagulant and analyzed within the time frames described by Desrosiers (<xref rid="hvad054-B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). OF was collected using the Quantisal device (Immunalysis), and analyzed within the time frames described by Scheidweiler (<xref rid="hvad054-B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). OF was collected until the blue indicator showed that 1 mL specimen was obtained or for a maximum of 10 minutes. OF results are expressed as ng/mL THC in OF.

Relationships between 2 measures of driving performance, SDLP, and car following (coherence) and THC concentrations in blood, OF, and breath are reported.

An increase in SDLP indicates worse driving performance while a decrease in coherence indicates worse driving performance.</p>

                <title>Determination of Impairment</title>
                <p>There is no reference method for identifying impairment following use of cannabis. Real-world driving impairment is the ultimate outcome of interest, but that is difficult to operationally define (crashes, high-risk behaviors, or slowed response to obstacles). Driving simulations, cognitive testing, and FSTs are all surrogates of impairment. Impairment was defined as the officer's interpretation of the participant's performance across all of the FSTs. Any participant with sufficient deficits on the FSTs that a trained police officer deemed them unsafe to drive was defined as being impaired. This definition was selected because, in a traffic stop, an officer's observation of driving performance is the precipitating event, followed by FSTs and possibly a DRE exam. Unlike a traffic stop, in this controlled study officers did not observe participants’ driving and made a determination of impairment based only on observations during the FST examination. Results from the FSTs were combined with different cutoff blood or OF THC concentrations to classify participants as impaired, as was done previously (<xref rid="hvad054-B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>).</p>

              <p>The relationship between THC concentrations in blood, OF, and breath obtained immediately after smoking active drug (i.e., peak measured concentration, median of 13 minutes post-smoking) vs driving performance at the first post-smoking driving simulation (median 26 minutes post-smoking) are shown in <xref rid="hvad054-F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>. No correlation was observed between blood THC concentration and SDLP (<xref rid="hvad054-F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, A</xref>, rho = −0.02, p<sub>adj</sub> = 0.89) or coherence (<xref rid="hvad054-F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, B</xref>; r = −0.102, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.46). These same parameters (SDLP and coherence) compared to THC concentrations measured immediately after the driving simulator (60 minutes post-smoking) also showed no relationship. The same results were observed for all other time points, as well as for analyses comparing THC concentrations and changes in simulator performance between the pre-smoking and post-smoking simulations (data not shown). We also analyzed the OF and breath data in a similar manner (<xref rid="hvad054-F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, C–F</xref>) and demonstrated no relationship between biofluid concentrations and driving performance. The data in <xref rid="hvad054-T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows the Spearman correlation (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> values) between biofluids and driving performance and are similar to the data shown in <xref rid="hvad054-F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> but include all of the time points in the study, vs <xref rid="hvad054-F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, which only shows data for the first driving simulation. The data in <xref rid="hvad054-T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> are important because drivers could potentially be stopped at various times after smoking cannabis. <xref rid="hvad054-T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows that biofluid results from immediately preceding the simulator had no correlation (all <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> values &gt; 0.05) with driving performance at any time during the study for the active drug group. <xref rid="hvad054-T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> is included because, in the field, driving performance is observed prior to collection of biofluid specimens, which are often obtained several hours after the traffic stop. Here we show that the initial driving performance (26 minutes) did not correlate with blood, OF, or breath at any collection period (13, 86, 200, or 262 minutes after smoking) for the active drug group. Both tables show no relationship between biofluid concentrations and driving performance at any time point.</p>

At the same time point, 31/63 participants who smoked placebo were classified as impaired (49.2%). There was a significant difference between participants who smoked active drug that were classified as impaired by the FSTs vs placebo for the first 3 FST examinations. By 252 minutes post start of smoking, there was no significant difference between those who received active drug vs placebo for FST classification of impairment.

              <p><xref rid="hvad054-F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> shows how adding a requirement for a positive toxicology test in addition to the FST results changes the classification of impairment. For this figure we evaluate FST results alone (top line in graph) along with 3 different THC cutoff concentrations (&gt;0.5 ng/mL, 2 ng/mL, and 5 ng/mL). For this analysis we applied the FST assessment from 2 different time points. We chose FST exam #1 (shaded area, 71 minutes post-smoking) and FST exam #3 (188 minutes post-smoking) because the first represents the FST examination at the highest THC concentration and the latter is about 3 hours after smoking when effects should be starting to wear off (<xref rid="hvad054-B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). <xref rid="hvad054-F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3, A</xref> shows that at 90 minutes after smoking, when a 2 ng/mL blood THC cutoff is required in addition to the FST results, 62.4% of subjects who received active drug met both criteria, compared to 81.0% when just the FSTs were employed. <xref rid="hvad054-F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3, B</xref> shows that, for the placebo group, requiring a 2 ng/mL blood cutoff decreased the percent of the placebo cohort classified as impaired to 13.8% at 90 minutes post-smoking compared to 49.2% when just the FSTs were used. The placebo group exceeding the toxicology thresholds reflect their baseline THC concentrations, as might be encountered in the field for drivers who use cannabis, even though it was not recent (i.e., greater than 48 hours before the collection) (<xref rid="hvad054-B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). <xref rid="hvad054-F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3, C</xref> shows that at 90 minutes after smoking, when a 2 ng/mL OF THC cutoff is required in addition to the FST results, 75.2% of active drug subjects met both criteria vs 81.0% when just the FSTs were used. <xref rid="hvad054-F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3, D</xref> shows that requiring a 2 ng/mL OF cutoff decreased the number of the placebo cohort who were classified as impaired to 0% at 90 minutes post-smoking vs 49.2% when just the FSTs were used. <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Table 3</xref> shows the effect of combining different toxicology concentration cutoffs (OF and blood) and FST results for classifying the active drug and placebo cohorts for all time points.

Since SDLP and coherence are 2 of the most commonly reported simulator results sensitive to cannabis (<xref rid="hvad054-B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="hvad054-B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), details of these findings in relation to blood, OF, and breath THC concentrations are reported. The complete lack of a relationship between the concentration of the centrally active component of cannabis in blood, OF, and breath is strong evidence against the use of per se laws for cannabis. Our results are consistent with a recent meta-analysis that concentrations of THC are “relatively poor indicators of cannabis-induced impairment” (<xref rid="hvad054-B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Unlike ethanol (<xref rid="hvad054-B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="hvad054-B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), there is no established relationship between blood THC concentrations and simulator driving performance measures (<xref rid="hvad054-B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="hvad054-B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). In the largest randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled trial to date, our data confirm that THC concentrations (and/or metabolites/related cannabinoids) in blood, OF, or breath cannot be used as a sole indicator of impairment.</p>
              <p>Previously we reported that participants smoking active cannabis produced a significant (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.05) decrement in driving performance that lasted for about 3.5 hours (<xref rid="hvad054-B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Thus, when evaluating the ability of FSTs to detect impairment, it is expected that they classify more participants exposed to active drug as being impaired early following cannabis inhalation as opposed to later time points. <xref rid="hvad054-T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> shows that FSTs classified 81.0% of the active drug participants as impaired at the first FSTs exam while only 22.5% were classified as being impaired at the last time point (251 minutes post-smoking). As evidenced by driving performance in the simulator (<xref rid="hvad054-B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), and results from the FSTs exam, not all participants who smoked active drug were impaired at the time of the FSTs. The relationships between simulator driving performance and individual FST results are reported in a separate publication (<xref rid="hvad054-B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>).</p>
              <p>Of note, in isolation (e.g., without driving observations or a full DRE exam or toxicology testing), the FSTs classified 49.2% of the placebo group as impaired. This is consistent with previous reports from smaller studies examining the ability of FSTs to identify impairment following cannabis use (<xref rid="hvad054-B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="hvad054-B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Practice effects were limited in this study compared to previous studies that exposed participants to FSTs prior to administering study drug. In our study, participants were first exposed to FSTs after the smoking session. This likely increased the sensitivity of the FSTs to active drug but also could have contributed to the high number of placebo participants who were categorized as impaired.</p>
              <p>Adding a requirement for a positive toxicology test to the FST exam results slightly decreased the percentage of participants who smoked active drug that were classified as being impaired but dramatically decreased the percentage of placebo group subjects that were classified as impaired. When the same cutoff concentration was used, OF showed less of an impact than blood for reclassifying the active drug cohort while reclassifying a higher percentage of the placebo group as not impaired. While adding toxicology results may be helpful in increasing the level of suspicion that cannabis was involved in driving impairment, they do not demonstrate causality. Therefore, the results of this study do not translate into supporting per se approaches.</p>
              <sec id="hvad054-s3.1">
                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p>When interpreting these results, several factors need to be considered. First, when relating THC biofluid concentrations to driving performance, our participants’ driving skills were evaluated using a driving simulator in a controlled environment that does not reflect all of the variables that confound actual driving. Second, our participants were instructed not to use cannabis for at least 2 days prior to the study and were excluded from the study if their OF contained ≥ 5 ng/mL THC at baseline. This likely complicates the application of our results to real-world data where participants frequently smoke more than one cannabis cigarette, with chronic users smoking multiple cannabis cigarettes on a daily basis. Third, the same officer examined each participant at multiple time points, which could influence the interpretation of impairment at later time points. In addition, officers also knew the participants would be under the influence of cannabis alone or placebo. Finally, a full DRE exam was not performed, and impairment was determined based solely on the FSTs results.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>In the largest trial to date involving experienced users smoking cannabis, there was no correlation between THC (and related metabolites/cannabinoids) in blood, OF, or breath and driving performance. Our data support the current practice in many areas of the United States that requires officer observations of impairment along with toxicology testing before prosecuting drivers for being under the influence. We provide some evidence for the use of OF as opposed to blood as being more useful in reducing the likelihood of false accusations of driving under the influence of cannabis. The selection of an optimal cutoff is an important determinant of road safety that deserves further study. A better understanding of how a full DRE exam compares with FSTs is also warranted.</p>
