                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Numerous observational studies show associations between family meal frequency and markers of child cardiovascular health including healthful diet quality and lower weight status. Some studies also show the âqualityâ of family meals, including dietary quality of the food served and the interpersonal atmosphere during meals, is associated with markers of child cardiovascular health. Additionally, prior intervention research indicates that immediate feedback on health behaviors (e.g., ecological momentary intervention (EMI), video feedback) increases the likelihood of behavior change. However, limited studies have tested the combination of these components in a rigorous clinical trial. The main aim of this paper is to describe the <italic>Family Matters</italic> study design, data collection protocols, measures, intervention components, process evaluation, and analysis plan.</p>

                  <p id="Par2">The <italic>Family Matters</italic> intervention utilizes state-of-the-art intervention methods including EMI, video feedback, and home visiting by Community Health Workers (CHWs) to examine whether increasing the quantity (i.e., frequency) and quality of family meals (i.e., diet quality, interpersonal atmosphere) improves child cardiovascular health. <italic>Family Matters</italic> is an individual randomized controlled trial that tests combinations of the above factors across three study Arms: (1) EMI; (2) EMIâ+âVirtual Home Visiting with CHWâ+âVideo Feedback; and (3) EMIâ+âHybrid Home Visiting with CHWâ+âVideo Feedback. The intervention will be carried out across 6Â months with children ages 5â10 (<italic>n</italic>â=â525) with increased risk for cardiovascular disease (i.e., BMIââ¥â75%ile) from low income and racially/ethnically diverse households and their families. Data collection will occur at baseline, post-intervention, and 6Â months post-intervention. Primary outcomes include child weight, diet quality, and neck circumference.</p>

                  <p id="Par3">This study will be the first to our knowledge to use multiple innovative methods simultaneously including ecological momentary intervention, video feedback, and home visiting with CHWs within the novel intervention context of family meals to evaluate which combination of intervention components are most effective in improving child cardiovascular health. The <italic>Family Matters</italic> intervention has high potential public health impact as it aims to change clinical practice by creating a new model of care for child cardiovascular health in primary care.</p>

              <p id="Par15">Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a highly prevalent public health problem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. CVD is the leading cause of death for one in four adults in the US and affects over 30% of minoritized populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. While CVD peaks in middle age, risk factors begin in childhood and may provide a critical window for intervening to mitigate risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Children ages 7â10 are at a key age when precursors of CVD begin to be observed, but before the manifestation of disease such as high blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), cholesterol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and less healthful dietary intake, fewer hours of physical activity, and more sedentary behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. To date, there has been low to moderate success with lifestyle behavior interventions for children at risk for CVD and the persistent disparities across race/ethnicity calls for a new and innovative way to intervene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Prior research has identified evidence-based intervention targets and strategies that when combined may provide an innovative approach for improving child cardiovascular health (CVH).</p>
              <p id="Par16">First, over two decades of observational cross-sectional and longitudinal research shows that family meal quantity (i.e., frequency) is associated with child health including higher diet quality, lower prevalence of unhealthy weight control behaviors, better psychosocial health, and reduced risk for childhood obesityâalthough weight status findings are mixed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. These protective associations have been found across child race/ethnicity, age, sex, and income [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In addition, studies have shown that family meal frequency is associated with better diet quality for adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], suggesting family meals may be beneficial for the entire family. However, few studies have tested this association in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par17">Prior interventions to increase child CVH have not been anchored around a specific family context/routine such as family meals. Instead, interventions often take a âkitchen sink approachâ targeting multiple home environment factors (e.g., eating, physical activity, sedentary behavior, parenting) across multiple contexts (i.e., home, school, daycare). These interventions have had limited success [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Family meals are unique in that they create a nexus where multiple parenting and familial behaviors related to childhood obesity occur simultaneously (e.g., parent feeding practices, interpersonal behaviors, availability of healthy foods, portion size, modeling healthy eating) and can be intervened onâwhich rarely occurs in any other context. Furthermore, intervening on one specific context/routine (i.e., family meals) may also seem more doable to parents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par18">Second, some observational studies have shown the need to examine family meal âqualityâ (i.e., dietary intake, interpersonal atmosphere), in addition to family meal quantity, to better understand key protective factors of family meals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Specifically, prior studies have shown associations between interpersonal interactions (e.g., non-controlling food parenting practices, positive communication/connection) during meals and better diet quality of foods served at family meals (e.g., fruits/vegetables, whole grains), lower child weight status, and higher child diet quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The few existing RCTs examining family meal frequency and child CVD risk found that solely increasing the frequency of family meals was not associated with lower weight status in children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Thus, interventions targeting both family meal quality and quantity will have a higher likelihood of improving child CVH.</p>
              <p id="Par19">Additionally, studies have identified barriers to carrying out family meal routines such as busy schedules, parental stress, lack of food prep/cooking skills, and child behaviors (e.g., picky eating) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Research by our team showed that parents experiencing high stress levels earlier in the day, were less likely to have family meals, served less healthy foods at mealtimes, and were more likely to engage in controlling feeding practices later the same day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Interventions including family meal quantity and quality, as well as strategies to reduce barriers (e.g., stress) to carrying out family meals are needed.</p>
              <p id="Par20">Third, research shows that providing immediate feedback on behavior (i.e., ecological momentary intervention (EMI), video feedback) within a specific context (e.g., family meals) results in more behavior change over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], compared to solely utilizing parent education [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. These findings suggest that teaching parents what to do is not enough, rather watching oneâs own behavior(s) and receiving feedback that reinforces positive behaviors or prompts different behaviors is necessary. Meta-analyses show that video feedback in parenting interventions is feasible, has low participant burden, results in moderate to large effects on parenting behaviors, and results in sustainable behavior change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par21">Ecological momentary intervention (EMI), or mobile health (mHealth), uses smartphones to send text messages to participants to intervene on behaviors in real-time as they unfold, moment-by-moment, over time and across contexts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. For example, a participant responds to a text earlier in the day regarding their stress level and source(s) of stress (e.g., too many things to do, demands from family, fatigue) then, an EMI message is sent providing suggestions to support them in making a healthful choice for family meals in the face of stress (e.g., tip for making a quick pasta meal more healthful by adding a vegetable stir in) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. EMI studies from other fields have shown significant improvement in targeted behaviors (e.g., medication compliance, smoking cessation) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], high feasibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], validity and reliability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], few logistical problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], and low burden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par22">Fourth, interventions utilizing community health workers (CHWs) who can meet participants âwhere they are at,â both with regard to readiness for change and in their own environment (i.e., home visiting) are associated with better outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. CHWs link care across clinic and home contexts and have high success with addressing obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] and other chronic conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. In addition, given the rise of virtual technology during the COVID-19 pandemic, the need to test virtual versus in-person measurement and delivery of home visiting interventions in a rigorous RCT is key to confirm the benefits of these approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par23">The main aim of the <italic>Family Matters Intervention</italic> is to target a well-documented family context associated with child CVH (i.e., family meals) using innovative real-time methods (i.e., EMI, video feedback) with CHWs in both virtual and in-person delivery modes to increase child CVH using a three-arm RCT (see Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

                <p id="Par27">Family Systems Theory (FST) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] guides the current study. According to FST, the family environment is the most proximal influence on child CVH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. FST suggests that intervening on individual-level behavior (e.g., dietary intake) has limited success unless the family-level behavior sustaining or overriding the individual-level behavior (e.g., fruits/vegetables served at family meals, food parenting practices) changes too [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. FST also suggests that healthful behaviors learned in one family context (e.g., family dinner meal) will generalize to other family contexts (e.g., breakfast, lunch, snacks) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Thus, in the current study it is expected that positive parenting practices learned in the family meal context will generalize to other eating occasions and contribute to child CVH overall. Also, including multiple family members (e.g., parents, grandparents, siblings) in the intervention increases the likelihood of sustainable family-level change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p>

Therefore, in all Arms, parents receive EMI text messages to their phones that include two parts. First, the parent is sent a text message with a survey link, between 11am-2pm to report their stress level (i.e., scale of 0-10) and sources of stress (e.g., child demands, busy at home/work, social media; see Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Second, a text message is sent back to the participant from a bank of tips (approximately 50 tips per source of stress) for the particular source of stress they reported. This tailored tip is intended to help them cope with the reported stress and increase the likelihood that they will still carry out a family meal the same evening in the face of stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. After the tip is sent, parents are also asked to report whether or not the tip was helpful, which then adjusts their individual EMI algorithm so there is an increased likelihood of them receiving more or less of these types of tips. If parents report no stress, they receive a tip to facilitate having a family meal (e.g., recipe ideas, meal prep tips, mealtime conversation starters).</p>

                  <p id="Par55">Every other week, starting during home visit three, families video-record and upload one family meal via their smartphone (6 total meals). CHWs watch videos in between home visits to identify specific clips to show family members at the next visit that highlight both strengths and growth areas regarding interpersonal interactions and dietary patterns. During HVs, CHWs engage family members in a conversationâusing MI skills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>] where both the CHW and family members identify positive behaviors seen in the videos and areas for growth, based on session content that families have been learning.</p>

                <p id="Par57">Parents randomized to study Arm 3 receive all elements of study Arm 2, but they are delivered hybrid. Specifically, CHWs meet in-person with families every other HV and then virtually via zoom on the other weeks. Families also engage in two cooking demonstration activities with the CHW during in-person HVs to reinforce messages taught, share easy recipes (e.g., batch cooking, one ingredient for multiple meals), and teach food prep skills to increase familyâs self-efficacy for having family meals. This Arm is important to examine whether relationship building and creating an atmosphere conducive to health behavior change requires an in-person component. This Arm is also critical to examine COVIDâs impact on moving research to virtual modes.</p>

For all study Arms, EMI family meal tips are reduced to the three days per week that parents reported their highest stress levels during the 16-week active intervention phase.

                  <p id="Par59">Interventionists are racially/ethnically diverse CHWs, with half being Spanish speaking. CHWs are trained/certified in MI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>], SMART goals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>], the intervention content for eight HV sessions, video feedback skills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], and HV protocols. The CHW supervision process provides multiple levels of supervision throughout training and intervention delivery (see Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Co-investigators who provide supervision and the intervention director (MA) are trained in MI and are licensed mental health clinicians (JB, TM) or registered dietitians (KL, DNS). All role-plays, certification, and family intervention visits in all study Arms are video-recorded. Both the CHW and supervisor watch and give feedback on the video-recordings, which allows for thorough feedback. Just as families receive video feedback on their recorded family meals from the CHWs as part of the intervention, the CHWs are given feedback as well, thus creating a parallel process that models to the CHW how to give feedback that is collaborative, focusing on both strengths and areas of growth, with their intervention families.</p>

                <p id="Par61">This study is powered for three pairs of tests [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>] to evaluate intervention effectiveness: (a) Arm 2 vs. 1, (b) Arm 3 vs. 1, and (c) Arm 2 vs. 3 over three time points. Multi-level, general linear mixed models (MLMM) with a clinic random intercept that nests participants within clinics to address any clinic differences in the recruitment populations, with participant random slopes for time to examine intervention treatment effects, and conditional fixed effects regression models (within-child analytic contrast against baseline), are the primary analytical models for all study hypotheses. Participantsâ randomized condition will be examined irrespective of adherence to the study protocol in accordance with an intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis. After the intervention has been fully administered, data will be assessed for balance across arms, outliers, missingness, and other modeling assumptions. Although randomization is expected to produce balance on measured and unmeasured characteristics, variables will be considered for inclusion as controls in adjusted analyses to reduce test statistic variance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. We expect little missing data based on our prior work, but if needed, we will employ methods recommended for clinical trials to minimize analytical assumptions required when missing data are present (e.g., follow up all randomized participants prior to unblinding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>], evaluating if results from the primary analysis differ when sensitivity analyses are performed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]). Reasons for participant withdrawal and non-adherence will be analyzed and reported in the final ITT analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>].</p>

                <p id="Par62">Study design features were accounted for in powering the study that required increases in sample size to minimize an inflated experiment-wise error rate (EER) due to three pairwise tests between each treatment arm for three primary outcomes (i.e., BMI%ile, neck circumference, and the Healthy Eating Index (HEI)). Accounting for these nine tests, sample size was determined using a conservative two-sided critical value of <italic>z</italic>â=â2.77 (<italic>P</italic>â=â0.006) to achieve experiment-wise Type I error of 0.05. Our power calculations were based on prior studies showing that a decline of two BMI%ile points was a clinically meaningful difference in children with overweight/obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. BMI%ile is a continuous outcome with a variance of 18.8. Eighteen-month follow up data with a comparable cohort provided intraclass correlation coefficient estimates to inform sample size determination (BMI%ile ICC <inline-formula id="IEq1"><alternatives><tex-math id="M1">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

At 80% power and multiple-outcome and pairwise testing corrected EER of 0.05, with a sample size of 525, we will be able to detect a minimum average difference in BMI%ile as small as 1.67 (or 0.38 SD) with 15% attrition. This magnitude translates to approximately a 2.8Â lb difference in a six year-old boy who is 3.8 feet tall and 45 lbs, or approximately a 7.5Â oz per month change in weight by the post-intervention endpoint.</p>

This analysis will inform whether intervention effects depend on participantsâ changes in family meal quality and quantity. This analysis is powered to detect a between-within intervention slope difference over the 6-month intervention period of as little as 9.6Â oz per month, depending on whether participants had high or low change in the moderating variables. Seasonality robustness checks will also be performed to evaluate whether results differ substantively for participants who received the intensive intervention during the summer months.</p>

              <p id="Par67">The <italic>Family Matters</italic> intervention has high potential public health impact as it aims to change clinical practice by creating a new model of care for child CVH in primary care. Research in this field is needed given the low to moderate success of lifestyle behavior interventions for children at risk for CVD and the persistent high prevalence of disparities across race/ethnicity groups. The state-of-the-art measures being used including EMA, EMI, and video feedback combined with the novel intervention context of family meals and CHWs as interventionists will greatly advance the field. In addition, the three-arm study design will allow for testing which combinations of intervention components are most effective in improving child CVH by race/ethnicity as well as whether a virtual or hybrid Arm is more effective. Dependent on study findings, this intervention will be disseminated to other primary care settings.</p>
