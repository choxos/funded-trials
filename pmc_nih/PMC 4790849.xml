              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>The recent three decades saw a growing global obesity epidemic; and overweight and obesity rates among children have increased in many countries including China[<xref rid="pone.0151141.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0151141.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In the U.S., the prevalence of childhood overweight and obesity has tripled since the 1970s[<xref rid="pone.0151141.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In China, overweight and obesity prevalence has increased rapidly in children, from less than 3% overall in 1985 to approximately 10% in girls and 20% in boys in 2010, and the overall rate in major cities like Beijing is over 20%[<xref rid="pone.0151141.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0151141.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p>
              <p>There has been a strong interest in developing effective childhood obesity prevention programs[<xref rid="pone.0151141.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Along with the increasing obesity prevalence, research suggests that rapid economic development, urbanization, globalization, and changes in government policies followed by China’s entry of World Trade Organization (WTO) have led to emerging Western fast food outlets and dietary shifts among the Chinese population[<xref rid="pone.0151141.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0151141.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], which may have fueled the growing obesity epidemic. For example, since the first American fast food chain, Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC), opened its first restaurant in China in 1987, the number of KFC restaurants has increased to over 4,200 in more than 800 cities and towns by 2012[<xref rid="pone.0151141.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. McDonald’s added 200 restaurant in 2011, and grew to over 2,000 restaurants within three decades in China[<xref rid="pone.0151141.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In 2002, the fast food industry yielded 200 billion Chinese Yuan annual sales (approximately US$24 billion), accounting for 2/5 of China’s food and beverage sales[<xref rid="pone.0151141.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p>
              <p>The relationship between Western fast food consumption (FFC) and weight status remains mixed in the existing literature. Some research suggests a positive association while others do not [<xref rid="pone.0151141.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0151141.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Moreover, only a few cohort studies have tested the influence of FFC on obesity [<xref rid="pone.0151141.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0151141.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Very limited longitudinal studies have been conducted to examine the effect of FFC on weight status in children, and no study has been conducted in Chinese children[<xref rid="pone.0151141.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p>
              <p>This study examined the changes over time in FFC and tested the association between FFC and obesity (including overweight) among children in China using nationwide longitudinal data. We hypothesized that FFC had increased over time in China and FFC increased obesity risk in children.</p>

                <p>CHNS is a large-scale, household-based open cohort which includes about 4,400 households and 26,000 individuals in the nine provinces, namely Heilongjiang, Liaoning, Shandong, Henan, Jiangsu, Hubei, Hunan, Guizhou, and Guangxi. CHNS used a multi-stage, random cluster sampling scheme to collect nationally representative data that covered key public health risk factors and health outcomes, demographic, social and economic factors at the individual, household and community levels[<xref rid="pone.0151141.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. At the individual level, detailed health-related data were measured, including dietary intake, physical activity, smoking and drinking behaviors, anthropometrics, blood pressure and limited clinical data[<xref rid="pone.0151141.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p>

                <title>Study Sample</title>
                <p>Our study sample was from the 2004 and 2009 CHNS because FFC data were not available before 2004. The question on FFC was only asked among those aged 6 years or older. Thus, we included children aged 6 to 18. Observations with missing body mass index (BMI) information were removed. A total of 293 observations were missing for BMI. By removing the observations with missing BMI, we obtained a final sample of 2656 observations, with 1542 children in 2004 and 1114 children in 2009, and among them, 376 individuals had complete data in both waves. Children included in the analytic sample were similar to those in the non-analytic sample except they were younger, had lower in-school physical activity levels and were less sedentary.</p>

                <title>Key Study Variables and Data Collection</title>
                <p>BMI and obesity status: BMI was calculated as measured weight in kilograms divided by height in meters-squared. During the survey, weight and height data were collected by trained health workers from individual’s comprehensive physical exam at the local clinic or at the respondent’s home during each visit[<xref rid="pone.0151141.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Height was measured without shoes to the nearest 0.2 cm using a portable stadiometer, and weight was measured without shoes and in light clothing to the nearest 0.1 kg on a calibrated beam scale (Seca North America, Chino, CA, USA).</p>
                <p>Overweight and obesity in children were defined based on the International Obesity Task Force (IOTF)’s gender- and age-specific BMI cut-off points for children aged 2–18 years of old, which correspond to an adult BMI of 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (overweight) or 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (obesity) [<xref rid="pone.0151141.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Children’s BMI varies with age and gender; thus, we calculated BMI z-scores adjusting for age and sex.</p>

                  <p>WesternFFC, excluding Chinese fast food. This definition is used throughout the entire article. Data for FFC were obtained from self-reports on this question in CHNS, “During the past 3 months, how many times have you eaten at a Western fast food restaurant, such as McDonald’s or Kentucky Fried Chicken?” Responses to this question were dichotomized into 1: consumed at least once or 0: not consumed or unknown to calculate the percentage of fast food consumers. Note that there were few FF restaurants (13.32%) in rural China and children were unlikely to eat in places outside 30 minutes’ bus ride from where they lived; therefore, we conducted imputation and treated the missing responses and those answered "unknown" as “0” if children lived in communities with no access to FF restaurants, which saved 2.28% of the final sample.</p>

Caloric, fat and carbohydrate intake were obtained from 3-day 24-hour recalls reported by children’s parents. We dichotomized caloric, fat and carbohydrate intake based on data distribution as well as dietary recommendations[<xref rid="pone.0151141.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, we did not include dietary intakes in our regression analyses due to their strong associations with FFC; instead, we looked into their relationships with FFC patterns.</p>

                  <p>In addition, we examined BMI z-score and FFC by gender, age, income (low, median, and high), geographical region (East China, Northeast, South China, Central China and Southwest), and urbanicity (urban, and rural).

                <title>Statistical Analysis</title>
                <p>First, we explored the FFC patterns among children in China in 2004 and 2009. We examined FFC patterns among children who participated in both waves in 2004 and 2009, and later looked at children of the same age cohort in both waves. We used McNemar tests and Chi-squared tests respectively, to examine if there were any significant differences in terms of the percentage of fast food consumers over time.</p>
                <p>Next, we tested the associations between FFC and BMI z-score and weight status in children. Note that in our models, since the prevalence of obesity was low, we combined the prevalence of overweight and obesity. We conducted linear regression analysis to examine the association between BMI z-scores and FFC, and logistic regression analysis to examine the association between overweight/obesity with FFC. Statistical significance was set at <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05. Analysis was conducted using Stata (Version 11.1, StataCorp).</p>
                <p>We fit a linear regression model to examine the association between FFC and BMI z-scores in boys and girls. The model was specified as:

Our estimates suggest that FFC was associated with 0.02 (95% CI: -0.71, 0.75) higher BMI-z in boys, but 0.14 (95%CI: -1.03, 0.75) lower BMI-z in girls. However, none was statistically significant (p&gt;0.05). Sensitivity analyses were conducted before FFC was imputed, and showed similar results (not shown here).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Our analysis of the nationwide survey data shows that FFC (excluding Chinese fast food) increased significantly among Chinese school-age children during 2004–2009, and the increase was especially rapid among some groups such as older children, boys, those from low- and medium-income families, and those from rural areas and East China, compared to their counterparts. During this period, FFC decreased in children who were from high-income families and those who were overweight. In almost all socio-demographic subgroups, as children aged, more respondents reported having consumed fast food in the past three months. This finding was likely to be fueled by the increased accessibility of Western fast food restaurants and children’s increased pocket money and independence. The trend was different by age group. FFC rate in children was relatively stable, while it increased rapidly in adolescents, from 17.9% to 26.3%. For adolescents, the increasing trend was prominent in boys, of Han ethnicity, from medium-income families, of rural residents, from East China, of under/normal weight, or those with a diet high in calories or fat. These findings are likely due to their increased independence and peer influence.</p>
              <p>The Western fast food industry has been growing rapidly in China. Compared to a decade ago, nowadays children have better access to fast food and the food has become more affordable. Moreover, FFC is viewed favorably among children. A cross-cultural study on brand identity reported that Chinese children had more favorable impressions of KFC than did their US counterparts [<xref rid="pone.0151141.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Despite these changes in the food environment in China, our findings indicate some large spatial-temporal disparities and time trends in FFC in adolescents between urban and rural regions: urban adolescents had more FFC. However, during 2004–2009, FFC increased in rural areas, but decreased in urban areas. Such spatial-temporal differential patterns mirror the inequalities of regional economic development and reflect the nonlinear effect of income rise on food-away-from-home (FAFH) consumption. It is known that an increase in income generates a greater increase in FAFH expenditure in high-income households than in low-income households in China[<xref rid="pone.0151141.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. On one hand, as an important component of FAFH, FFC increased dramatically in rural areas with an increase in rural household income. On the other hand, the effect of increasing household income in urban areas on FAFH was more pronounced for other foods. In high-income urban households, more awareness of health, media influence, and increased demand for high quality food in recent years may have resulted in a decrease in FFC, as FFC may be increasingly viewed as unhealthy for children. We have not observed such pattern in rural areas yet, likely because of nonlinear income effects at different threshold levels. Further research is warranted to explain what we observed.</p>
              <p>By separating the age and period effects, we found different patterns. In general, as age increased, more children had consumed Western fast food, while the consumption prevalence in young children did not change much. This finding is likely because adolescents who had entered middle and high schools had more autonomy and pocket money, and were more likely to be under peer influence than younger kids [<xref rid="pone.0151141.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0151141.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Therefore, older children had more freedom and opportunities to consume Western fast food.</p>
              <p>Interestingly, the FFC rate decreased in the children from high-income families, but those from low- and medium-income families increased their FFC. This result is consistent with the shifted nutrition transition and findings that the burden of obesity and metabolic risk has started to move from the better-off to the poorer population groups in some developing countries [<xref rid="pone.0151141.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p>
              <p>Although FFC generally increased, western FFC did not appear to be a large contributor of childhood obesity in China. We did not find a meaningful association between western FFC and child weight status using the CHNS data. Another study reported that less than 1% of Chinese children’s total calorie intake was obtained from fast food in 2000, while the proportion was 14.8% for children in the United States [<xref rid="pone.0151141.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0151141.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Other factors have contributed to childhood obesity in China, such as increased family income and increased consumption of animal-source food [<xref rid="pone.0151141.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Also, using the CHNS data, Du et al. found that the density of fast food restaurants in neighborhood was not associated with BMI in men in rural China, while an increase of one fast food restaurant was associated with lower BMI (by 0.02) in rural women [<xref rid="pone.0151141.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The CHNS data also show that overweight and obesity was not associated with fast food preference in adults, and food environment might play a smaller role than nutritional knowledge in influencing consumers’ consumption choices [<xref rid="pone.0151141.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. These findings for adults may indicate the complex relationship between FFC and weight outcomes in Chinese children as well.</p>
              <p>Some empirical and review studies have examined the associations between FFC, increased fat and calorie intakes and childhood obesity[<xref rid="pone.0151141.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0151141.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. However, most of these findings were based on studies conducted in high-income countries such as the United States. To our knowledge, thus far, Rosenheck’s (2008) review is the most comprehensive to date in its review of 16 studies (6 cross sectional-, 7 prospective cohort-, 3 experimental studies). It concluded that the association between FFC and weight gain was not clear, but sufficient evidence exists for public health recommendations to limit FFC and facilitate healthier menu selection. Of the 7 prospective cohort studies, 4 were conducted among children and adolescents, 6 found a positive association between more frequent FFC and an increase in total caloric intake or BMI. All 3 studies conducted among young adults reported an association between FFC and increased BMI. Period effect is a potential cause for our mixed findings. We found that the percentage of fast food consumers decreased from 2004 to 2009 among children from high- income families, but it increased in both low- and medium- income families. Over time with increased family income, more and more Chinese families can afford eating fast food on a regular basis. More future research is needed to study the impact of FFC on public health in China.</p>
              <p>Our study helps fill two main gaps in the literature: only a small number of studies have tested the association between FFC and overweight/obese in developing countries, and very few previous studies have used longitudinal data. Two large cross-sectional studies have examined the association in China, but provided conflicting findings. Our previous cross-sectional study among 21,198 children in Beijing reported a positive association between FFC and overweight/obese[<xref rid="pone.0151141.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], but another study among 9,023 adolescents from seven large cities in China reported a negative association[<xref rid="pone.0151141.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p>
              <p>Consistent with findings from a recent US study (29), our present study did not detect a significant association between FFC and childhood obesity. The lack of an association could be because FFC only accounts for a small proportion of Chinese children’s total energy intake, our sample size is relatively small, and there is measurement error in assessing FFC. One of our recent studies shows that the density of neighborhood restaurants was associated with BMI in rural Chinese adults[<xref rid="pone.0151141.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Nevertheless, FFC may affect overweight/obesity indirectly. For example, FFC may have promoted western food culture among Chinese children, which may influence their other food intake and cause a shift to high energy density food and drinks at home or away from home.</p>
              <p>The main strengths of our study include longitudinal analysis and stratified analysis to examine the time trends in FFC and the association between FFC and obesity in Chinese children. The study also has several limitations. First, only 376 children had complete follow-up data. The low follow-up rate was mainly because children were not at home during the follow-up data collection and some families had moved out of the previous community. Second, the definition of fast food was not clearly specified in the survey questionnaire. The survey question asked about the number of times children visited fast food restaurants like McDonald’s. In this case, other Western fast food restaurants may have not been taken into account.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, more Chinese children have consumed Western fast food over time. The increase is dramatic and is more rapid in some groups such as among adolescents (vs. younger children), boys, of non-Han ethnicity, those from low- and medium-income families, and those from rural areas or East China. FFC has been linked with adverse dietary quality and health conditions. Efforts are needed to study the impact of FFC on health outcomes, as well as the methods to promote healthy eating among young people in China.</p>
