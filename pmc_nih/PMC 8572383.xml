                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Robust randomised trial data have shown that routine preoperative (pre-op) testing for cataract surgery patients is inappropriate. While guidelines have discouraged testing since 2002, cataract pre-op testing rates have remained unchanged since the 1990s. Given the challenges of reducing low-value care despite strong consensus around the evidence, innovative approaches are needed to promote high-value care. This trial evaluates the impact of an interdisciplinary electronic health record (EHR) intervention that is informed by behavioural economic theory.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>This pragmatic randomised trial is being conducted at UCLA Health between June 2021 and June 2022 with a 12-month follow-up period. We are randomising all UCLA Health physicians who perform pre-op visits during the study period to one of the three nudge arms or usual care. These three nudge alerts address (1) patient harm, (2) increased out-of-pocket costs for patients and (3) psychological harm to the patients related to pre-op testing. The nudges are triggered when a physician starts to order a pre-op test. We hypothesise that receipt of a nudge will be associated with reduced pre-op testing. The primary outcome will be the change in the percentage of patients undergoing pre-op testing at 12 months. Secondary outcomes will include the percentage of patients undergoing specific categories of pre-op tests (labs, EKGs, chest X-rays (CXRs)), the efficacy of each nudge, same-day surgery cancellations and cost savings.</p>

                  <p>The study protocol was approved by the institutional review board of the University of California, Los Angeles as well as a nominated Data Safety Monitoring Board. If successful, we will have created a tool that can be disseminated rapidly to EHR vendors across the nation to reduce inappropriate testing for the most common low-risk surgical procedures in the country.</p>

              <sec id="s1-1">
                <title>Background and rationale</title>
                <p>Cataract surgery is the most common operation in the USA with 1.7 million procedures performed annually.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Due to the ageing population, this number is expected to increase to 4.4 million by 2030.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Cataract surgery is a low-risk procedure: it lasts an average of 18 min, it is almost always performed using topical anaesthesia, and serious complications are exceedingly rare.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2–4</xref> There is strong consensus based on robust randomised controlled trials that routine preoperative (pre-op) tests for cataract surgery such as blood testing, EKG, chest X-rays (CXRs) and cardiac stress tests are unnecessary and do not improve health outcomes.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5–8</xref></p>
                <p>Since 2002, specialty societies globally have repeatedly published guidelines discouraging such testing.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 9–12</xref> Despite this evidence and concerted efforts to reduce pre-op screening tests before cataract surgery, several studies have found that the majority of patients who undergo this procedure are subjected to these tests.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 7</xref> This is a quintessential example of physician behaviour being driven by factors other than evidence. Reasons why pre-op testing continues despite the evidence that it is low-value include institutional requirements and culture, legal concerns, financial incentives and the belief among providers that another specialist expected the pre-op tests.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Reducing routine pre-op testing before cataract surgery could reduce patient exposure to unnecessary and potentially harmful tests<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> while saving upwards of US$50 million dollars annually.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14–17</xref></p>
                <p>Recognising that empiric proof of non-efficacy alone will not lead to a reduction in the delivery of low-value care, research teams and policymakers are examining the application of behavioural economics as a way to encourage physicians to change their behaviour.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18 19</xref> Behavioural economic theory posits that humans have predictable cognitive biases and that these can be leveraged to reduce undesired behaviours. One application of behavioural economics is through pop-up alerts embedded within a health system’s electronic health record (EHR). This study will test the impact of various appeals to physician professionalism on physician-ordering patterns. Specifically, we will test whether framing risk of psychological harm, financial harm or an absence of improving patient safety will improve physician ordering patterns compared with usual care.</p>
                <p>The study described here will test the hypothesis that an EHR-based behavioural economics intervention implemented in a real-world setting including all physicians in the healthcare system (ie, not just those who agree to participate) will reduce pre-op testing for cataract surgery. To our knowledge, no study has tested the use of an alert that incorporates a behavioural economics-based ‘nudge’ as a mechanism by which to reduce pre-op testing before surgery in a large academic health system setting. In behavioural economics and psychology, nudges are known as strategies that change behaviour in a predictable manner without restricting options.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> If successful, this intervention could be generalised to other EHR systems and disseminated to health systems across the country.</p>

                <title>Study objectives</title>
                <p>Our first aim is to integrate three distinct ‘nudge’ alerts into the UCLA Health EHR. Each nudge will test a different behavioural economics framing strategy. Our second aim is to conduct a four-arm randomised pragmatic trial to compare the effectiveness of the nudges to each other and to usual care. We hypothesise that exposure to the nudges will result in a reduction of pre-op tests ordered by physicians. We will randomise providers who conduct pre-op visits for patients with cataract surgery to one of four study arms: nudge 1, nudge 2, nudge 3 or no nudge (usual care) and measure the effect of the intervention on pre-op testing (see below).</p>

                <title>Trial design</title>
                <p>This is a pragmatic, parallel group, open-label, randomised controlled superiority trial. Groups are allocated 1:1 to the intervention arms (nudges) and control arm (routine care). This trial will be conducted between June 2021 and June 2022 with a 12-month follow-up period. This trial has been registered with the United States Clinical Trials Registry.

UCLA Health operates four hospitals on two campuses (Westwood and Santa Monica) and over 250 outpatient practices.

In 2019, 322 physicians at 74 unique UCLA Health clinics performed such a visit. These physicians conducted a total of 1122 pre-op visits for 995 unique patients. To identify patients who presented for a pre-op visit within 30 days of cataract surgery, we used Surgical Consult Encounter Code 2100 in combination with one of four codes used to identify cataract surgery (<xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental appendix</xref>).</p>

                <title>Study intervention</title>
                <p>At UCLA Health, cataract surgery planning is initiated when a patient is evaluated by a UCLA ophthalmologist and deemed an appropriate candidate for the procedure. The patient is then asked to make an appointment for a pre-op visit with their primary care provider (PCP), cardiologist or another UCLA physician. The Centres for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Joint Commission require that a pre-op visit be completed within 30 days of the surgery.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22 23</xref></p>
                <p>At this pre-op appointment, the provider completes a required history and physical, sometimes working off a checklist provided by the surgeon that may include a list of suggested tests such as EKG, cardiac stress test, Complete Blood Count (CBC), electrolytes and CXR. The ordering of these tests is left to the discretion of the physician completing the pre-op evaluation. The decision to order tests and procedures is influenced by the provider’s previous experiences, preferences and interpretation of the guidelines.</p>
                <p>The intervention will deploy one of the EHR nudge alerts (control, nudge 1, nudge 2 or nudge 3) such that each physician in the study will only get one of the nudges (or none of them) for the duration of the study. These alerts will be triggered when a physician begins to order a pre-op test for patients during their pre-op visit. The full list of pre-op tests, informed by Chen <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic> and Steinberg <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 24</xref> was identified using Current Procedural Terminology codes. These tests fall into several categories including chemistry panel, complete blood count, coagulation panel, urinalysis, EKG, cardiac stress test, CXR and pulmonary function tests. The full list of pre-op tests can be found in the Appendix. Details of the nudge alert including opt-out features are described below.</p>
                <p>To inform the design of the nudges for this study, we considered findings from Liao <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, which found that self-reported behaviour among physicians is most influenced by the patient and the potential for patient harm as compared with societal or institutional factors. We, therefore, tailored the three distinct nudges to highlight the following concepts<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>: patient safety,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> financial costs to the patient and<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> the risk of psychological harm to the patient. Each of the three nudge reference guidelines from the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) and the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO)<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26 27</xref> include links that physicians can access via the EHR. Given that one common reason for ordering cataract pre-op tests is the belief that they are required by the surgeon, we included specific language stating that UCLA ophthalmologists and anesthesiologists advise against pre-op testing. We also included text to reassure the provider that the pre-op team at UCLA will order any necessary labs on the day of surgery. In addition, each nudge includes an image relevant to the message of the nudge and the potential impact pre-op tests may have on patients.</p>

This 11-item survey will elicit physician views on concepts such as knowledge about guidelines related to pre-op testing for cataract surgery and views on electronic decision support tools and whether they find these helpful or burdensome in the clinical decision-making process. We will email providers a link to the survey and providers will receive a US$25 gift card following completion of the survey.</p>

                <title>Primary and secondary outcome analysis</title>
                <p>We will measure and compare rates of testing in the 12 months before and 12 months after initiation of the randomisation (primary outcome) to determine whether the EHR-based intervention is successful in changing physician behaviour. We will also compare each of the three intervention arms and the usual care arm and will perform exploratory comparisons between nudge 1, nudge 2 and nudge 3 (secondary outcome) to determine whether certain behavioural economic framing techniques are more effective than others at reducing pre-op testing.</p>
                <p>Other secondary outcomes will include the percentage of patients who received specific categories of pre-op tests including labs, EKGs and CXRs, same-day surgery cancellations and physician-level experience measured by the surveys. We will also estimate cost savings associated with the intervention (described below). Evaluation of the primary and secondary outcomes will be performed using generalised linear mixed-effects models at the patient level. We will investigate the impact of all nudges versus control, which will require a threefold correction. As a secondary analysis, we will conduct pairwise comparisons of the nudges. Models will include fixed nudge 1, nudge 2 and Nudge 3 effects, a fixed study period effect (postnudge intervention vs prenudge intervention), second-order interactions between these effects, a fixed stratum effect (hospitalist vs PCP) and random physician effects. Physician effects will account for clustering of patients by physician. Comparisons between changes in utilisation rates across study arms will be estimated and tested using model contrasts. All pairwise comparisons of changes between study arms will be performed to identify the most effective nudge, and Bonferroni corrections will be applied to control the familywise type I error rate at 5%. Intervention effects will be summarised using ORs, 95% CIs and p values (with multiple comparison corrections). Differences between strata will be similarly summarised.</p>
                <p>These models will also be adjusted for patient-level covariates (age, race, ethnicity and Elixhauser comorbidities). Because serious complication rates are so low from cataract surgery (&lt;0.1%), we will not have adequate power to determine whether the intervention is associated with a change in complication rates, but we will extract from the EHR all cardiovascular events occurring within 30 days of surgery and compare these in an exploratory fashion among the intervention and control groups. Analyses will be performed using SAS V.9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina).</p>

                <title>Power</title>
                <p>Preliminary analyses of UCLA Health data show that the baseline rate of testing is 65%. In a prior quality improvement study conducted at a different health system,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> we reduced pre-op lab testing by 59% (a reduction from 90% to 31%). We conservatively estimate an effect half as large (30%) in each intervention arm.</p>
                <p>Power will be evaluated using a χ<sup>2</sup> test adjusting for clustering. This is a conservative simplification of the planned mixed-effects logistic regression model analysis. Each nudge will be assumed to independently reduce the rate of testing by 30%. An intraclass correlation of 0.25 will be assumed (correlation between patients seen by the same physician, after adjusting for patient-level characteristics). Assuming each physician sees an average of seven patients during the intervention period (based on preliminary data), and with an anticipated 195 physicians per study arm, using two-sided hypothesis testing and an overall alpha of 5% (controlled using Bonferroni corrections, the individual alpha for each contrast will be 0.008), we will have &gt;90% power to detect a difference of 30% between the usual care arms and each of the intervention arms.</p>

                <title>Cost analyses</title>
                <p>We will measure several cost outcomes associated with the intervention, specifically (1) savings from reduced use of medical services, (2) net total savings after accounting for the cost of the intervention and (3) return on investment. We will also extrapolate the savings estimates we observe to the Medicare population to quantify the amount of savings that the Medicare programme could achieve through the reduction of low-value pre-op services for cataract surgery. We will also extrapolate longer term (ie, 2–5 year) savings that would accrue if the effects of the intervention persist, based on our prior work.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></p>
                <p>To calculate savings from reduced use of medical services, we will multiply the estimates of utilisation (ie, quantity) for each of the pre-op services measured by the relevant payment rates for the services based on the coverage type for the patient (ie, Medicare and average commercial payment rates per service). We will then compare differences in spending overall and by specific services (ie, lab testing, EKGs) between the control arm and each of the intervention arms and a pooled estimate of the three-nudge intervention arms. We will disaggregate the savings to measure the amount and proportion accrued by the health system/payer versus the patient. An extension of this analysis will estimate how reducing the utilisation of pre-op testing affect different parties; we will disaggregate the savings estimates by type of payer contract (ie, capitated vs fee-for-service(FFS)) to derive estimates of savings to the health systems versus the payer. Under capitated payments, the savings accrue to the health system, while under FFS payments, the savings accrue to the payer and represent revenue losses for the health system.</p>
                <p>We will extrapolate observed saving estimates to compute savings the Medicare FFS programme might expect to accrue if similar reductions in the utilisation of pre-op services for cataract surgery were observed in the Medicare population. To generate these savings estimates, we will compute the number of Medicare patients undergoing cataract surgery in a single year and the fraction of patients who have these pre-op tests. We will then take our estimates of reduction in utilisation and apply these estimates to the current use of pre-op testing utilisation in the Medicare FFS programme to determine the number of services that would be reduced. We would then apply FFS payment rates to the number of services that would be reduced to estimate savings to Medicare. Finally, we will develop estimates of longer term savings in a year–year time range, applying a discount rate to costs, assuming that the observed reduced amount of services used remained similar after the 1-year study period ended.</p>
