              <abstract>
                <p>Lipoarabinomannan (LAM), an amphiphilic lipoglycan of the <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> cell wall, is a diagnostic target for tuberculosis. Previous work from our laboratory and others suggests that LAM is associated with host serum lipoproteins, which may in turn have implications for diagnostic assays. Our team has developed two serum assays for amphiphile detection: lipoprotein capture and membrane insertion. The lipoprotein capture assay relies on capture of the host lipoproteins, exploiting the biological association of host lipoprotein with microbial amphiphilic biomarkers to “concentrate” LAM. In contrast, the membrane insertion assay is independent of the association between pathogen amphiphiles and host lipoprotein association, and directly captures LAM based on its thermodynamic propensity for association with a supported lipid membrane, which forms the functional surface of an optical biosensor. In this manuscript, we explored the use of these assays for the detection of LAM in sera from adults whose tuberculosis status had been well-characterized using conventional microbiological tests, and endemic controls. Using the lipoprotein capture assay, LAM signal/noise ratios were &gt;1.0 in 29/35 (83%) individuals with culture-confirmed active tuberculosis, 8/13 (62%) individuals with tuberculosis symptoms, but no positive culture for <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic>, and 0/6 (0%) symptom-free endemic controls. To evaluate serum LAM levels without bias associated with potential differences in circulating host lipoprotein concentrations between individuals, we subsequently processed available samples to liberate LAM from associated host lipoprotein assemblies followed by direct detection of the pathogen biomarker using the membrane insertion approach. Using the membrane insertion assay, signal/noise for detection of serum LAM was greater than that observed using the lipoprotein capture method for culture-confirmed TB patients (6/6), yet remained negative for controls (2/2). Taken together, these results suggest that detection of serum LAM is a promising TB diagnostic approach, but that further work is required to optimize assay performance and to decipher the implications of LAM/host lipoprotein associations for diagnostic assay performance and TB pathogenesis.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of global mortality associated with a single infectious disease, and is estimated to afflict 10 million people worldwide (2018), with ~ 1.3 million deaths [<xref rid="pone.0243337.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The World Health Organization has identified the need for a non-sputum diagnostic test for TB, particularly extrapulmonary TB and pulmonary TB associated with low bacillary burden in airways, as can occur in young children and in individuals with HIV co-infection [<xref rid="pone.0243337.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p>
              <p>Accordingly, several biomarkers have been explored for the empirical diagnosis of TB, with lipoarabinomannan (LAM) arguably being the most studied [<xref rid="pone.0243337.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0243337.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. LAM is an amphiphilic lipoglycan component of the <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (MTB) cell wall that has in vitro immunomodulatory activity including activation of the Toll-like receptor 2 pathway [<xref rid="pone.0243337.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0243337.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Following the findings of Hamasur <italic>et al</italic>. that LAM was detectable in mouse urine within one day after intra-peritoneal injection of crude MTB cell wall extract, most clinical diagnostic work focused on detection of LAM in urine [<xref rid="pone.0243337.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0243337.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. One lateral flow urinary LAM assay is now commercially available (Alere Determine<sup>™</sup> TB LAM Ag, Abbott Biotechnologies). However, the sensitivity of the Alere assay is suboptimal—ranging from 42% in HIV-negative TB patients to 53% in TB patients with advanced HIV disease, a condition in which total mycobacterial burden can be very high and occult renal TB can be present [<xref rid="pone.0243337.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0243337.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0243337.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The next generation Fujifilm SILVAMP TB-LAM (FujiLAM; Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan), a lateral flow test incorporating high-affinity monoclonal anti-LAM antibodies, has 30% better sensitivity compared to Alere LAM but needs further validation in clinical settings [<xref rid="pone.0243337.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Several other LAM assay formats including FujiLAM with enhanced sensitivity are in development [<xref rid="pone.0243337.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0243337.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p>
              <p>The amphiphilic biochemistry of LAM confers instability in aqueous milieu such as blood. Previous work from our team has shown that, in human blood, LAM associates with host lipoproteins such as high-density lipoproteins (HDL). In aqueous blood, HDL is a stable lipidic assembly comprised of a core lipid nanodisc stabilized by coat apolipoproteins [<xref rid="pone.0243337.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0243337.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. While LAM has been extracted from blood of TB patients [<xref rid="pone.0243337.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], direct measurement of LAM in blood or serum has proved to be more elusive, and achieved mainly in individuals with advanced HIV disease [<xref rid="pone.0243337.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0243337.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0243337.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. We hypothesized that sequestration of LAM in host lipoprotein assemblies may contribute to the difficulty in detecting the antigen in blood. In parallel assessment of LAM in serum and urine from TB patients using an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay, Broger <italic>et al</italic>. showed substantially lower assay sensitivity in serum than in urine, but that matrix inhibition of serum could largely be reversed by heat treatment, resulting in substantial increases in LAM signal in tested sera [<xref rid="pone.0243337.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p>
              <p>To evaluate the impact of serum sequestration of LAM in host lipoprotein complexes, we measured serum LAM using two methods tailored for the detection of amphiphilic biomarkers in aqueous matrices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0243337.g001">Fig 1</xref>)–lipoprotein capture and membrane insertion. The lipoprotein capture assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0243337.g001">Fig 1</xref>) relies on capture of host lipoproteins, exploiting their biological association with the pathogen amphiphile to “concentrate” LAM [<xref rid="pone.0243337.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0243337.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In contrast, the membrane insertion assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0243337.g001">Fig 1</xref>) is independent of that host lipoprotein/LAM association, and directly captures LAM based on its thermodynamic propensity for association with a supported lipid membrane which forms the functional surface of a biosensor [<xref rid="pone.0243337.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0243337.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0243337.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Although both of these assays are platform ambivalent, we used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and fluorescence measurements from a waveguide-based biosensor platform developed at the Los Alamos National Laboratory for this study [<xref rid="pone.0243337.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0243337.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. There are two limitations that impact the use of conventional plate-based methods for the detection of LAM. 1) LAM is an amphiphile and therefore, sticks to plastics and other surfaces, reducing assay reliability, sensitivity and reproducibility. 2) In clinical samples, LAM is already sequestered by host lipoproteins and not available in free-form [<xref rid="pone.0243337.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. It must be detected in this conformation or liberated to facilitate detection. In this manuscript, we have attempted to develop methods that address both these limitations. Both the assays are performed on a surface functionalized with lipid bilayer, and therefore override the challenges of using plastic ELISA plates in concert with amphiphiles. Further, we have consistently shown that the use of the waveguide platform offers at least 10x greater sensitivity than conventional plate-based ELISA, which is an advantage when it comes to sensitive detection of pathogen antigens in complex clinical samples [<xref rid="pone.0243337.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0243337.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p>

                  <p>When LAM is associated with a host lipoprotein carrier such as HDL, detection can be performed using lipoprotein capture, which requires two antibodies, as well as prior knowledge of LAM-lipoprotein carrier associations. An antibody targeting apolipoprotein A1, the coat protein of HDL, is used to capture the nanodiscs on the assay surface, followed by detection with a fluorescently labeled antibody targeting LAM. In the absence of sequestration by a host lipoprotein carrier, LAM can be directly detected by membrane insertion, which requires only one antibody. The amphiphilic antigen, LAM, is allowed to partition into a supported lipid bilayer interface, followed by detection with a specific fluorescently labeled antibody.

                <p>This study used existing stored specimens that previously had been obtained from participants in Uganda for a study that evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of the Alere Determine<sup>™</sup> TB LAM Ag assay [<xref rid="pone.0243337.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. That diagnostic accuracy study enrolled HIV-positive adults suspected of having active tuberculosis based on the presence of at least one of cough, fever, night sweats, or weight loss. Individuals were excluded if they had received more than two days of anti-tuberculosis treatment. At enrollment, each participant provided two sputum specimens, each of which was cultured in liquid and solid media. One mycobacterial blood culture, performed using the Myco/F LYTIC system (Becton and Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ), was performed for each participant at enrollment. A participant was considered to have active TB if <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> was isolated in culture from any specimen. Neither Xpert MTB/RIF nor other nucleic acid amplification test was performed on sputum, since those tests were not available on-site at the time of study enrollment. At enrollment, blood was drawn into a BD Vacutainer serum separator tube (Becton and Dickinson), and serum was subsequently withdrawn and immediately frozen at -80 °C until used for this study. For this exploratory study, one of the investigators (S.E.D.) selected specimens based on knowledge of participant microbiological classification, with intent to include a representative spectrum of participants with and without culture-confirmed TB. Samples were selected on the basis of culture results and sent to Los Alamos National Laboratory in a double blinded fashion.

Additionally, we used existing de-identified serum specimens from six Ugandan adults who did not have TB symptoms and were not known to be HIV-positive; no additional meta-data were available for these specimens. Samples were thawed immediately prior to use for the studies described here. If multiple assays were performed on a single serum sample, lipoprotein capture was performed first with the fewest possible freeze/thaw cycles to avoid degradation of lipoprotein carriers.</p>

Lipid micelles for use in waveguide experiments were prepared as described previously [<xref rid="pone.0243337.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Briefly, 2 mM DOPC and 1% cap biotinyl (mol/mol) were combined in a glass tube then the chloroform was evaporated off under argon gas. Lipids were rehydrated in PBS, incubated in the dark for 30 min at room temperature with shaking (100 rpm) on an orbital shaker. Lipid solutions then underwent 10 rapid freeze/thaw cycles alternating between liquid nitrogen and room temperature water. Finally, lipids were probe sonicated for 6 min total (1.0 sec pulse on/off, 10% amplitude) using a Branson ultrasonic generator. Once the lipids were stabilized, the addition of biotin allowed for the bilayer integrity to be evaluated during immunoassay experiments by probing with 50–100 pM of a streptavidin Alexa Fluor 647 conjugate [<xref rid="pone.0243337.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0243337.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p>

                <p>All incubations occurred at room temperature. Dilutions of all reagents were made in PBS. Flow cells were prepared as described above and the lipid bilayer was blocked for 1 hr with 2% BSA in PBS (w/v). All incubations were immediately followed by a wash with 2 mL of 0.5% BSA in PBS (w/v) to remove any unbound constituents. Incident light from a 635 nm laser (Diode Laser, Coherent, Auburn, CA) with power adjusted to 440–443 μW was coupled into the waveguide using a diffraction grading. The response signal was adjusted for maximum peak intensity using a spectrometer (USB2000, Ocean Optics, Winter Park, FL) interfaced with the instrument and an optical power meter (Thor Labs, Newton, NJ) [<xref rid="pone.0243337.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p>
                <p>The background signal associated with the lipid bilayer and 2% BSA block was recorded, and then the integrity of the lipid bilayer was assessed by incubation of 50–100 pM streptavidin, AF647 conjugate (Molecular Probes, S32357) for 5 min. The two control steps are performed in every experiment as intrinsic controls. The remaining assay steps depended on the particular assay as described below. The antibodies used in this assay (FIND Clones 171 and 24) were labeled with AF647, and the optimal combination of antibodies and their concentrations were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0243337.s002">S1 Fig</xref>, S1 Section in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0243337.s001">S1 File</xref>).

                  <title>Lipoprotein capture assay</title>
                  <p>Host HDL lipoproteins are nanodiscs of lipids that are held together by a coat protein, Apolipoprotein A1. The lipoprotein capture assay utilized an anti-apoA1 capture antibody for the capture of HDL lipoproteins onto the sensing surface. Following the test for lipid bilayer integrity (instrument controls), 10 nM unlabeled streptavidin was added and incubated for 10 min to saturate the biotin embedded in the lipid bilayer. Next, 100 nM of biotin conjugated α-apoA1 (α-HDL) antibody was added and incubated for 45 min, allowing for the capture antibody to adhere to the surface via biotin-streptavidin interaction. The surface is now functionalized with the capture antibodies for the lipoprotein capture assay. Prior to experimental measurement, however, the non-specific signal was determined by incubation of the fluorescence reporter antibody, FIND antibody cocktail labeled with AF647 (15 nM each antibody, for 45 min), with control human serum on to the waveguide surface. This allows for the determination of the fluorescence signal associated with the interaction of the reporter antibody with the surface and control serum, in the absence of the antigen (no-antigen control).</p>
                  <p>Upon completion of the control measurements above, the antigen was added, and specific interaction between LAM and the reporter antibody cocktail was measured. To generate standard LAM concentration curves, increasing concentrations of MTB H37RV LAM (100, 250, 500, 1000, 1500, 2500, 5000 nM) were spiked into commercially procured human serum, and incubated for 24 hours to allow for complete association with lipoproteins. For clinical specimens, 200 μL of serum was used for each assay, and directly added to the flow cell. Upon incubation, the FIND reporter cocktail was again added, and the specific signal associated with the binding of LAM with the antibodies was measured via the spectrometer interface.</p>
                  <p>Three sets of controls were performed (n = 25 each). The instrument background signal is an assessment of the biosensor function and bilayer integrity. No antigen control experiments were performed using control serum, in the absence of LAM. Specificity controls were performed using anti-LAM antibodies (FIND 171 and 24), and measuring the signal associated with their interactions with LAM functionalized on the biosensor surface. In all experiments, raw data were recorded as relative fluorescence units (RFU) as a function of wavelength (nm). The specific/non-specific ratio (S/N) was determined by taking the maximum RFU value for the specific signal, subtracting out the RFU value for the instrument controls, specificity and no-antigen controls (henceforth referred to as the background) and dividing this by the maximum RFU value for the non-specific signal minus the maximum RFU value for the background [<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0243337.e001">Eq (1)</xref>].</p>

                  <title>Membrane insertion assay</title>
                  <p>For this assay, LAM is released from host lipoprotein complexes prior to detection via a pre-established sample processing method [<xref rid="pone.0243337.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Briefly, processing was performed using a modified single-phase Bligh and Dyer chloroform:methanol extraction. Chloroform, methanol and LAM sample (either standard or clinical) were combined in a siliconized microfuge tube (Fisher Scientific, 02-681-320) at a 1:2:0.8 (v/v) ratio. The chloroform, methanol, and serum mixture was combined by gentle pipetting using low-retention pipet tips to avoid lipid adherence to the plastic, and then the mixture was centrifuged for 1 min at 2,000 x g to separate the proteins (supernatant) from the lipid/amphiphilic molecules (pellet). The supernatant was discarded and the LAM-containing pellet was resuspended in PBS by gentle pipetting. Following a 5 sec pulse spin to settle debris that could clog the septum of the biosensor flow cell, the LAM-containing solution was used as the biomarker sample for immunoassays.</p>
                  <p>There is no need for a capture antibody (reduces assay time by 40 min.) in the membrane insertion assay format, as it relies on the direct interaction of the LAM antigen (liberated from carrier assemblies as described above) into the supported bilayer interface. To generate standard concentration curves, LAM antigen was diluted to the desired concentration in control human serum in high-recovery glass vials (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) C5000-995 and incubated overnight (18–24 hrs) at 4 °C to allow for association with lipoproteins in serum, as described above the lipoprotein capture assay. The samples were serially diluted, as described above for the lipoprotein capture assay. Each dilution was then subject to the sample processing method, and evaluated in the assay format in order to generate the standard curve. For the clinical samples, 50 μL of each serum sample from patients and controls was subjected to the sample processing method, and used in the assay.</p>
                  <p>For this set of assays, the three control measurements described above (instrument controls, no-antigen control and specificity controls) were performed (n = 10 each) as well, and the concentration of the reporter antibodies was the same as used for the lipoprotein capture assay above (15 nM for 45 min.). For the experimental measurements, 200 μL of the processed sample was incubated in the flow cell, allowing for association of amphiphilic biomarkers with the lipid bilayer. Then the FIND antibody cocktail was added again, and incubated (15 nM for 45 min) for assessment of the specific signal. Raw data were recorded as relative fluorescence units (RFU) as a function of wavelength (nm).</p>
                  <p>For both the lipoprotein capture assay and the membrane insertion assay, a S/N ratio &gt; 1.0 was considered a positive result, and each sample measurement was repeated two times in order to assess reproducibility. The laboratory team performing LAM assays using participant specimens was blinded to participant group assignment and other clinical information, and it was held by one of the team members (S.E.D.) as described earlier.</p>

                <p>For both the lipoprotein capture assay and the membrane insertion assay, antibodies were selected and concentrations determined by enzyme-linkedimmunosorbent assays (ELISAs) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0243337.s002">S1 Fig</xref>, S1 Section in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0243337.s001">S1 File</xref>). Briefly, antibodies were chosen based on sensitivity and specificity for LAM detection, and a combination of two different monoclonal antibody clones (24 and 171) yielded best outcomes for LAM detection in serum samples. These two antibodies were used as a cocktail at 15 nM each for both the membrane insertion and lipoprotein assay formats.</p>

                <p>To further understand the LAM lipoprotein capture assay performance, we stratified culture-confirmed TB patients by specimen source (sputum and/or blood) of positive MTB culture(s). Surprisingly, there was no association between MTB detected in blood culture, and LAM detected in serum. Serum LAM S/N was &gt;1.0 in 10/12 (83%) culture-confirmed TB patients with MTB in blood cultures vs. 19/23 (83%) culture-confirmed TB patients whose blood culture was negative for MTB (relative risk 1.01, 95% CI 0.68, 1.28). Median (IQR) LAM S/N was 2.2 vs 1.3 among culture-confirmed TB patients with vs. without MTB in blood cultures (<xref rid="pone.0243337.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>
                <p>We hypothesized that, if host HDL concentration impacted the outcome of the lipoprotein capture assay, then use of a LAM assay approach that was independent of host lipoproteins—membrane insertion- might increase assay analytical sensitivity. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0243337.g005">Fig 5a</xref> shows the comparison of the two methods for detection of LAM in a serum sample spiked with 500 nM of LAM, with all other parameters held constant.

                <p>Subsequently we performed the membrane insertion and lipoprotein capture assay in parallel for the same eight clinical samples with sufficient volume for comparative testing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0243337.g005">Fig 5b</xref>). For serum from culture-confirmed TB patients, the S/N was uniformly higher for the membrane insertion assay than for the lipoprotein capture assay; no specific signal was detected in healthy control sera by either assay.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>In this exploratory study, we compared and contrasted the use of two tailored methods for the detection of amphiphilic biomarkers in aqueous samples—lipoprotein capture and membrane insertion—for the measurement of serum LAM.</p>
              <p>Both these methods were able to directly measure LAM in serum, with a demonstrated enhancement of sensitivity using the membrane insertion method.</p>
              <p>In our initial evaluation in serum from adults whose TB status had been rigorously characterized by conventional mycobacteriology testing, we observed a clear difference between culture-confirmed TB cases and adult controls with regard to both proportion with detectable LAM signal and LAM S/Ns. This finding demonstrates the applicability of these two tailored methods for serum amphiphilic LAM detection.</p>
              <p>Clinically, there were two unexpected findings. Our working hypothesis—that serum LAM was associated with presence of MTB in blood cultures—was not supported by the lipoprotein capture assay data, as serum LAM was detected in the majority of culture-confirmed TB patients whose blood cultures were negative for MTB, and further, was not detected in the few patients whose blood cultures were positive for MTB. This outcome can be either because of an absence of serum LAM, or simply be associated with a failure to pull-down host lipoprotein/ failure to detect LAM due to LAM epitopes being hidden by the lipoprotein matrix.</p>
              <p>In order to evaluate these two possibilities, we used a membrane insertion assay that is independent of host serum lipoproteins. Compared to lipoprotein capture, the membrane insertion assay resulted in higher S/N in all tested TB patients, but the magnitude of the difference varied from patient to patient. In all, our results indicate clearly that an assay modality that is independent of variable host factors (membrane insertion) is more sensitive than one that is dependent on them (lipoprotein capture). The enhanced sensitivity of membrane insertion compared to lipoprotein capture is based on the optimization assays and the 8 clinical samples. The increased sensitivity of the membrane insertion assay over lipoprotein capture assay, even in spiked samples, indicates some of the LAM associated with lipoproteins is not readily detected. Indeed, a variety of factors can impact host lipoprotein concentrations, including HIV/AIDS [<xref rid="pone.0243337.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0243337.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Because of insufficient volume of clinical samples, we were not able to quantitate lipoprotein concentrations to formally establish an association between serum concentrations of these host lipoproteins and LAM S/N in TB patients, and this is a weakness of our study. HIV is associated with quantitative and qualitative lipid abnormalities including low levels of HDL, disordered HDL metabolism, and reduced Apo A levels [<xref rid="pone.0243337.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0243337.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. It is intriguing to speculate that HIV effects on host lipoproteins might influence host handling of MTB LAM, thereby impacting TB disease pathophysiology in addition to impacting performance of our lipoprotein capture assay. A better understanding of the mechanisms and kinetics of LAM sequestration and clearance could have important implications for understanding tuberculosis and inflammation more broadly.</p>
              <p>The second unexpected finding was that serum LAM was detectable (using the lipoprotein capture assay and threshold S/N &gt; 1.0) in over half of TB symptomatic individuals whose sputum and blood cultures all were negative for MTB. There are two possible explanations for this: 1) These are false positive results, and detected signal in the absence of LAM; or 2) MTB LAM was present in serum, but sputum and blood cultures were falsely negative. Our existing data cannot tease apart these possibilities. However, we note that all of these individuals were enrolled with suspected TB disease, and that our assay did not have any false positive measurements in the control group (0/6). Further, the recognized sensitivity limitations of mycobacterial culture as a gold standard as well as the recognition that “TB” is nonbinary and represents a spectrum of conditions including incipient and subclinical TB, support further investigation of serum LAM as a biomarker [<xref rid="pone.0243337.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0243337.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p>
              <p>There are important limitations of our exploratory study. The sample size was small, and adult controls all were HIV-negative whereas individuals with TB symptoms all were HIV-positive. Second, as noted above, serum specimen volumes precluded performance of both LAM detection methods and HDL quantitation on all specimens, and therefore we were not able to comprehensively characterize the associations between serum LAM, host lipoproteins, and HIV serostatus. We hope to address these limitations in future clinical evaluations that are curated to address out needs.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, we present two tailored assay strategies for the direct detection of amphiphilic serum LAM. Our findings highlight the role that host pathogen interactions play in pathogen amphiphile presentation and the need to account for these interactions in the design of diagnostic assays. Our findings also raise the intriguing possibility that serum LAM might be an informative TB biomarker of incipient or subclinical TB.</p>

              <p>Reviewer #1: The study presents two methods for detection of lipoarabinomannan (LAM) in serum, as a tool to diagnose tuberculosis. Two methods were evaluated, the lipoprotein capture assay and the membrane insertion assay, both intended to solve the important problem with interaction of the amphiphilic LAM with host carrier lipoproteins. A very small number of serum samples are used to evaluate the two methods. It would be valuable to know more about the individual samples, and also about the possible use of these methods in clinical practice.</p>
              <p>The patient samples were selected from existing stored specimens that previously had been obtained for a study that evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of the Alere Determine™ TB LAM Ag assay (ref 27). In that study 1013 HIV-positive participants were enrolled. Among culture-positive tuberculosis patients, the Alere test identified 136/367 (37.1%) overall and 116/196 (59.2%) in the group with CD4 ≤100 cells per cubic millimeter.</p>
              <p>From these specimens serum from 35 verified HIV positive TB cases, and 13 individuals with TB symptoms but no positive cultures, and 6 HIV negative controls were selected for this study. It would be important to know 1) the CD4 status of the 35 culture-confirmed TB patients and the 13 individuals with TB symptoms that were selected for inclusion in this study. The fact that the 6 control samples were from HIV-negative individuals while the 13 individuals with TB symptoms were HIV positive makes this information even more important.</p>
              <p>It would also be important to know whether the samples were selected with knowledge of their Alere results.</p>
              <p>The samples were too few to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the tests, especially the membrane insertion assay: only 8 samples were used to evaluate the membrane insertion assay, in parallel with the lipoprotein capture assay, and there were only 6 control samples, all negative in both assays. Based on the comparison between the two assays in the 8 samples the authors conclude that the membrane insertion assay was the most sensitive one.</p>
              <p>It would also be important to know how the authors envisage how the methods could be developed for use in clinical practice, since they include sophisticated instruments in both methods as well as harsh treatments (chloroform:methanol extraction) in the membrane insertion assay. The need to release LAM from host lipoprotein matrix is at the core of most work on development of methods to detect and quantify LAM in patient fluids, and crude chloroform:methanol extraction poses several problems.</p>
              <p>From this point of view the lipoprotein capture assay seems more interesting, albeit apparently less effective, probably due to LAM epitopes being hidden by the lipoprotein matrix, a fact that should be discussed.</p>
              <p>Minor comment: Reference 17 is redundant and should be excluded or replaced by more recent references.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: The manuscript “Interaction of Amphiphilic Lipoarabinomannan with Host Carrier Lipoproteins in Tuberculosis Patients: Implications for Blood-based Diagnostics” by Mukundan et al. proposes two novel sandwich immunoassays for the detection of lipoarabinomannan derived from Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the blood. The assays are comprised by a capture element and a labeling element. The capture elements leverage LAM association with lipid particles or lipophilic phase and encompass: 1) lipid bilayer and 2) anti high-density lipoprotein antibody associated to a lipid bilayer. Labeling element uses an anti-LAM antibody, clone CS40.</p>
              <p>The paper is well written and clearly presented. It has intellectual merit because it aims to bring additional evidence that LAM exists in the blood of tuberculosis patients in association with lipoproteins. The labeling antibody CS-40 mAb is well characterized in the literature and showed epitope specificity (DOI: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.1701673">https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.1701673</ext-link>). Data present in the supplementary information support the choice of this antibody in comparison to other clones.</p>
              <p>However, the design of the assay lacks rigor. The main issue is that “specificity controls were performed using IgG labelled with AF-647, rather than anti-LAM antibodies”. In order to ensure valid readings, immunoassay controls must be run using all the reagents used for the unknown samples (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK92434/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK92434/</ext-link>). In the proposed assay it is especially crucial that the anti-LAM antibody is used for specificity controls, because it is the only element of the assay that confers specificity. Furthermore, the epitope of the IgG used for the negative control readings is not specified. On a minor note, the advantages of using an anti-HDL antibody linked to a lipid bilayer versus a less complicate alternative, such as ELISA plate coating, are not elaborated.</p>
              <p>Limit of detection is usually presented as a general characteristic of the assay and not in function of the concentration of one sample (DOI: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.1701673">https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.1701673</ext-link>). In the results section, the limit of detection of assay number one is not presented, and the limit of detection of assay number two is 8.5 nM, which for LAM corresponds roughly to 400 ng/mL. Discussion on the expected concentration range of LAM in serum is lacking. Llimit Since S/N values are reported for patients, S/N curves for different concentration of spiked control serum samples should be presented (Fig. 2b, 3b). Figure 5b reports discrepant values obtained from the two assays in individual samples, but a strategy to reconcile the values to obtain a quantitative assay is missing.</p>
              <p>The abstract should indicate that the assays are sandwich assays and use anti-LAM CS-40 mAb as a labeling antibody.</p>
              <p>Demographic and clinical information of patients should be included in the manuscript if available.</p>

              <p>Additionally, we used existing de-identified serum specimens from six Ugandan adults who did not have TB symptoms and were not known to be HIV-positive; no additional meta-data were available for these specimens. Included in manuscript on page 9, lines 160-163.</p>
              <p>2. The patient samples were selected from existing stored specimens that previously had been obtained for a study that evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of the Alere Determine™ TB LAM Ag assay (ref 27). In that study 1013 HIV-positive participants were enrolled. Among culture-positive tuberculosis patients, the Alere test identified 136/367 (37.1%) overall and 116/196 (59.2%) in the group with CD4 ≤100 cells per cubic millimeter.</p>
              <p>From these specimens, serum from 35 verified HIV positive TB cases, and 13 individuals with TB symptoms but no positive cultures, and 6 HIV negative controls were selected for this study. It would be important to know 1) the CD4 status of the 35 culture-confirmed TB patients and the 13 individuals with TB symptoms that were selected for inclusion in this study. The fact that the 6 control samples were from HIV-negative individuals while the 13 individuals with TB symptoms were HIV positive makes this information even more important</p>
              <p>Response: The CD4 status of the patients has now been included in Table S2 of the revised supplemental document and a discussion of this has been included on Page 9, Lines 160-163 of the revised manuscript. </p>
              <p>3. It would also be important to know whether the samples were selected with knowledge of their Alere results. </p>
              <p>Response: Samples were selected on the basis of culture results, and sent to LANL in a double blinded fashion. The Alere results were not taken into consideration for sample selection. Included on page 9, lines 159-160 of revised manuscript in clinical specimens section.</p>
              <p>4. The samples were too few to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the tests, especially the membrane insertion assay: only 8 samples were used to evaluate the membrane insertion assay, in parallel with the lipoprotein capture assay, and there were only 6 control samples, all negative in both assays. Based on the comparison between the two assays in the 8 samples the authors conclude that the membrane insertion assay was the most sensitive one.</p>
              <p>Response: We agree with the reviewer that a much larger cohort should be analyzed to determine performance metrics in the clinical samples. This study was focused on establishing and optimizing the methods for more sensitive detection of serum LAM, and validating efficacy in clinical samples. To this end, the optimization of the study for both membrane insertion and lipoprotein capture (Figure 2b and Figure 3b) was performed in serum spiked with varying concentrations of LAM. The enhanced sensitivity of the membrane insertion assay over lipoprotein capture is noted in these spiked samples for known concentrations of the antigen. This trend is replicated in the small subset of clinical samples that we evaluated. This has been clarified in page 24, lines 481-486 of the revised manuscript. </p>
              <p>It would also be important to know how the authors envisage how the methods could be developed for use in clinical practice, since they include sophisticated instruments in both methods as well as harsh treatments (chloroform:methanol extraction) in the membrane insertion assay. The need to release LAM from host lipoprotein matrix is at the core of most work on development of methods to detect and quantify LAM in patient fluids, and crude chloroform:methanol extraction poses several problems.</p>
              <p>Response: Our team has been working on resolving the engineering and simplification challenges for use of this technology at the point of need. We have developed and validated the first microfluidics device which is capable of performing lipid extractions within minutes at the point of need (Manuscript accepted with minor revisions pending to Nature scientific reports, U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 63/113,310). In addition, we have simplified the waveguide-based optical biosensor for field deployment, and validated assay performance on this new portable (&lt;10Lbs) instrument with optical components integrated and the software for functionality on a phone-based application. This manuscript is in preparation, provisional patent application No S133706.000, Entitled “Microfluidics Device”). We have added a generic description of these developments in lines 331-337, page 17 of the revised manuscript. </p>
              <p>5. From this point of view the lipoprotein capture assay seems more interesting, albeit apparently less effective, probably due to LAM epitopes being hidden by the lipoprotein matrix, a fact that should be discussed.</p>
              <p>Response: We agree with the reviewer that both of these assays have relatively different advantages and disadvantages. With the developments in progress, as outlined in response to the previous question, we anticipate the membrane insertion assay will also become more field friendly. However, for the purpose of this manuscript, we have included a more detailed description of the advantages and disadvantages of the two methods, while briefly mentioning the developments in progress. These changes have now been included on page 15, lines 303-304, page 17, lines 331-337, page 6- lines 99-104 of the revised manuscript. </p>
              <p>The increased sensitivity of the membrane insertion assay over lipoprotein capture assay, even in spiked samples, indicates some of the LAM associated with lipoproteins is not readily detected. We agree with this assessment and have clarified this in the discussion on page 24, lines 486-488 of the revised manuscript. </p>
              <p>6. Minor comment: Reference 17 is redundant and should be excluded or replaced by more recent references. </p>
              <p>Response: This reference has been removed in the revised manuscript. </p>

              <p>Reviewer #2: The manuscript “Interaction of Amphiphilic Lipoarabinomannan with Host Carrier Lipoproteins in Tuberculosis Patients: Implications for Blood-based Diagnostics” by Mukundan et al. proposes two novel sandwich immunoassays for the detection of lipoarabinomannan derived from Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the blood. The assays are comprised by a capture element and a labeling element. The capture elements leverage LAM association with lipid particles or lipophilic phase and encompass: 1) lipid bilayer and 2) anti high-density lipoprotein antibody associated to a lipid bilayer. Labeling element uses an anti-LAM antibody, clone CS40.</p>
              <p>The paper is well written and clearly presented. It has intellectual merit because it aims to bring additional evidence that LAM exists in the blood of tuberculosis patients in association with lipoproteins. The labeling antibody CS-40 mAb is well characterized in the literature and showed epitope specificity (DOI: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.1701673">https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.1701673</ext-link>). Data present in the supplementary information support the choice of this antibody in comparison to other clones.</p>
              <p>1. However, the design of the assay lacks rigor. The main issue is that “specificity controls were performed using IgG labelled with AF-647, rather than anti-LAM antibodies”. In order to ensure valid readings, immunoassay controls must be run using all the reagents used for the unknown samples (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK92434/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK92434/</ext-link>). In the proposed assay it is especially crucial that the anti-LAM antibody is used for specificity controls, because it is the only element of the assay that confers specificity. Furthermore, the epitope of the IgG used for the negative control readings is not specified.</p>
              <p>Response: We apologize if our original manuscript was not clear on the methods used. </p>
              <p>a) Whereas CS40, anti-LAM antibody procured from BEI, was also evaluated, our initial assessments revealed that clones 171 and 24 from FIND performed best in our assay, as indicated in supplemental figure S1. Thus, all the developments described in the manuscript and the clinical evaluations were performed using a combination of FIND clones 171 and 24. </p>
              <p>b) All specificity controls were also performed using FIND 171 and 24 as shown in supplemental figure S1, and not using a generic IgG labeled with AF-647. Thus, every single non-specific measurement reported in the manuscript was performed using the exact combination of anti-LAM antibodies as the specific measurements, and under exactly the same conditions of the assay. We have clarified these points in the methods section of the revised manuscript, on page 14, lines 280-281. </p>
              <p>2. On a minor note, the advantages of using an anti-HDL antibody linked to a lipid bilayer versus a less complicate alternative, such as ELISA plate coating, are not elaborated. </p>
              <p>Response: We have elaborated on the advantages of the lipoprotein capture and membrane insertion assays, as compared to a conventional plate-based ELISA more clearly in the revised manuscript on page 7, lines 108-121. There are two limitations that impact the use of conventional plate-based methods for the detection of LAM. 1) LAM is an amphiphile and therefore, sticks to plastics and other surfaces, reducing assay reliability, sensitivity and reproducibility. 2) In clinical samples, LAM is already sequestered by host lipoproteins and not available in free-form(1). It has to be detected in this conformation or liberated from it to facilitate detection. In this manuscript, we have attempted to develop methods that address both these limitations. Both the assays are performed on a surface functionalized with lipid bilayer, and therefore override the challenges of using plastic ELISA plates in concert with amphiphiles. Further, we have consistently shown that the use of the waveguide platform offers at least 10X greater sensitivity than conventional plate-based ELISA, which is an advantage when it comes to sensitive detection of pathogen antigens in complex clinical samples(2,3).</p>
              <p>3. Limit of detection is usually presented as a general characteristic of the assay and not in function of the concentration of one sample (DOI: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.1701673">https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.1701673</ext-link>). In the results section, the limit of detection of assay number one is not presented, and the limit of detection of assay number two is 8.5 nM, which for LAM corresponds roughly to 400 ng/mL. Discussion on the expected concentration range of LAM in serum is lacking. Limit Since S/N values are reported for patients, S/N curves for different concentration of spiked control serum samples should be presented (Fig. 2b, 3b). </p>
              <p>Response: We have clarified the quantification of the assays more rigorously in the revised manuscript. </p>
              <p>The concentration of LAM in patient serum has not been clearly established. Brock et al. showed a range of 0-132 pg/ml in individuals without HIV infection(4). Other studies have “extracted” LAM from serum, but direct measurement of the antigen has not been largely reported(5–7). </p>
              <p>According to equation 2, LOD for lipoprotein capture assay is 69 nM, which corresponds to a concentration of 1900ng/mL of LAM. LOD for membrane insertion assay is 3.3 nM, which corresponds to a concentration of 114 ng/mL LAM. This clearly demonstrates the greater sensitivity of the membrane insertion assay over the lipoprotein capture assay in standard curves based on spiked samples. At 500 nM of LAM, the S/N by lipoprotein capture assay is 8.2, whereas that by membrane insertion assay is 782. </p>
              <p>Because of the significant difference in fluorescence units between lipoprotein capture and membrane insertion for some of the patients, we have chosen to present the data in terms of S/N. However, we have included the conversion metrics above clearly in the revised manuscript to ensure the interpretation of the data is clear to the reviewer and the reader. </p>
              <p>4. Figure 5b reports discrepant values obtained from the two assays in individual samples, but a strategy to reconcile the values to obtain a quantitative assay is missing.</p>
              <p>The abstract should indicate that the assays are sandwich assays and use anti-LAM CS-40 mAb as a labeling antibody.</p>
              <p>Response: Figure 5b represents the difference in sensitivity for the same clinical sample when two different methods are used to measure the antigen. One method is more sensitive than the other, and is responsible for the disparity in the signature intensity noted. We have expanded on this, and clarified the results, in the results section more clearly (page 22, line 440-442). </p>
              <p>The antibody combination used in the assay was FIND Clones 171 and 24, and this has been clarified in the legends and in the methods as well. </p>
              <p>5. Demographic and clinical information of patients should be included in the manuscript if available.</p>
              <p>Response: We have now included Table S2 in the revised manuscript, which includes meta-data with this information for the patients in the study. </p>

              <p>PLOS ONE does not copyedit accepted manuscripts, so the language in submitted articles must be clear, correct, and unambiguous. Any typographical or grammatical errors should be corrected at revision, so please note any specific errors here.</p>

              <p>6. Review Comments to the Author</p>
              <p>Please use the space provided to explain your answers to the questions above. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: 1. As pointed out in the previous review It would also be important to know how the authors envisage how the methods could be developed for use in clinical practice. The authors have now added information on unpublished work on how that has been done on line 331-337. However these sentences do not belong there (in M6M). They should be in the Discussion, with reference to how they foresee a more userfriendly test, indicating (unpublished results or similar.</p>
              <p>2. An additional comment: on line 505-506 the authors write "2) MTB LAM was present in serum, but sputum and blood cultures were falsely negative". I would not say "falsely". They were negative but the patients may still have eg extrapulmonary TB.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: The authors have addressed all the questions that were raised.</p>
              <p>However, I believe it would be very helpful to readers if the discussion about expected LAM concentrations in serum provided by the authors in the response to reviewers' section is incorporated in the discussion section of the paper. Answer: "The concentration of LAM in patient serum has not been clearly established. Brock et al. showed a range of 0-132 pg/ml in individuals without HIV infection(4). Other studies have “extracted” LAM from serum, but direct measurement of the antigen has not been largely reported(5–7)." This literature review and a short discussion on the apparent discrepancy between LAM concentrations detected in this paper and the suggested concentration range suggested by Brock et al., (4), would provide helpful information on how the present study relates to the state of the field.</p>
