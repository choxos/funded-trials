                <p id="Par1">Neoadjuvant ipilimumab + nivolumab (Ipi+Nivo) and nivolumab + chemotherapy (Nivo+CT) induce greater pathologic response rates than CT alone in patients with operable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The impact of adding ipilimumab to neoadjuvant Nivo+CT is unknown. Here we report the results and correlates of two arms of the phase 2 platform NEOSTAR trial testing neoadjuvant Nivo+CT and Ipi+Nivo+CT with major pathologic response (MPR) as the primary endpoint. MPR rates were 32.1% (7/22, 80% confidence interval (CI) 18.7–43.1%) in the Nivo+CT arm and 50% (11/22, 80% CI 34.6–61.1%) in the Ipi+Nivo+CT arm; the primary endpoint was met in both arms. In patients without known tumor <italic>EGFR</italic>/<italic>ALK</italic> alterations, MPR rates were 41.2% (7/17) and 62.5% (10/16) in the Nivo+CT and Ipi+Nivo+CT groups, respectively. No new safety signals were observed in either arm. Single-cell sequencing and multi-platform immune profiling (exploratory endpoints) underscored immune cell populations and phenotypes, including effector memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T, B and myeloid cells and markers of tertiary lymphoid structures, that were preferentially increased in the Ipi+Nivo+CT cohort. Baseline fecal microbiota in patients with MPR were enriched with beneficial taxa, such as <italic>Akkermansia</italic>, and displayed reduced abundance of pro-inflammatory and pathogenic microbes. Neoadjuvant Ipi+Nivo+CT enhances pathologic responses and warrants further study in operable NSCLC.

              <p id="Par3">Immune checkpoint therapy has changed the treatment paradigm for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); however, until recently, much of the progress had been confined to the locally advanced and metastatic setting. Now, considerable effort is focused on how to best leverage immune checkpoint therapy for patients with resectable early-stage NSCLC and prevent post-operative tumor recurrence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, using adjuvant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> or neoadjuvant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> approaches targeting the PD-(L)1 axis. Neoadjuvant immunotherapy trials are based on the premise that an intact tumor immune microenvironment elicits the most robust responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. These trials have benefited by using major pathologic response (MPR) or complete pathologic response (pCR) as surrogate endpoints of long-term outcomes.</p>
              <p id="Par4">Studies of neoadjuvant single-agent anti-PD-(L)1 therapy have yielded MPR rates between 6.7% and 45%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. The addition of platinum-based chemotherapy to immunotherapy has proved promising<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, with initial phase 2 studies producing MPR and pCR rates of 57–83% and 33–63%, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. CheckMate-816 was the first large-scale phase 3 randomized trial to evaluate neoadjuvant nivolumab plus chemotherapy (Nivo+CT) versus chemotherapy (CT) alone in patients with resectable stage IB–IIIA NSCLC and demonstrated a pCR rate of 24.0% with Nivo+CT compared to 2.2% with CT alone, as well as improved event-free survival (EFS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, which led to FDA approval of neoadjuvant Nivo+CT as the new standard of care for patients with resectable NSCLC.</p>
              <p id="Par5">Another strategy to enhance the efficacy of neoadjuvant anti-PD-(L)1 therapy is to combine it with the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein (CTLA-4) immune checkpoint inhibitor ipilimumab (Ipi), given that the two inhibitors impact the immune system through two independent, and possibly complementary, mechanisms of action<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. In the phase 2 randomized NEOSTAR study, we evaluated neoadjuvant Nivo or Nivo+Ipi followed by surgery in 44 patients with operable NSCLC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. We found that Nivo and Nivo+Ipi produced MPR rates of 22% and 38%, respectively. Addition of Ipi to Nivo also resulted in higher pCR rates, less viable tumor and enhanced tumor immune infiltration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par6">The randomized phase 2 NEOSTAR trial evolved into a platform trial of sequential, single-center, single-arm, phase 2 studies with a modular design using MPR in each individual arm as the primary endpoint, which was hypothesized to be greater than historical controls of neoadjuvant CT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Here we report the primary efficacy results of NEOSTAR arm C evaluating neoadjuvant Nivo+CT and arm D testing neoadjuvant Ipi+Nivo+CT followed by surgical resection in patients with stage IB–IIIA NSCLC. Select secondary endpoints included radiological responses (RECIST version 1.1 (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>)), pCR, toxicity, surgical resectability and perioperative morbidity/mortality, overall survival (OS) and EFS, in alignment with time-to-event analyses performed in other neoadjuvant studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, and tissue immune infiltrate analysis. Exploratory endpoints included tumor molecular, immunological and fecal microbiome biomarkers (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).</p>

                <p id="Par7">Between 14 December 2018 and 22 July 2019, 23 patients were screened and 22 enrolled on the Nivo+CT treatment arm (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). A full list of inclusion and exclusion criteria can be found in <xref rid="Sec14" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>. The baseline clinicopathological patient characteristics are shown in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. All patients underwent baseline invasive mediastinal staging. Eleven (50%) patients had clinical stage IIIA (five with N2 disease, single station). Eighty-six percent (19/22) of patients completed the three planned cycles of neoadjuvant therapy, and 14% (3/22) received two cycles owing to treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs). Eight patients experienced CT dose reduction due to TRAEs. Between 30 December 2019 and 1 December 2020, 25 patients were screened and 22 enrolled on the Ipi+Nivo+CT treatment arm (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The baseline clinicopathological patient characteristics are shown in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. All patients underwent invasive mediastinal staging. Thirteen (59%) patients presented with stage IIIA (nine with N2 disease, single station). Nineteen (86%) patients completed the planned three cycles of neoadjuvant therapies. Two patients discontinued nivolumab—one due to colitis possibly attributed to Ipi and Nivo (grade 3) after cycle one and one due to concern for increased risk of pneumonitis after cycle two and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Neoadjuvant treatment was discontinued in one patient after cycle one due to death from SARS-CoV-2 infection-related complications (non-treatment related). Seven patients had CT dose reduction due to TRAEs. At the time of data analysis cutoff, 17 (77%) patients in the Nivo+CT arm and 15 (68%) patients in the Ipi+Nivo+CT arm had undergone ad hoc tumor molecular profiling (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">1</xref>).

                <p id="Par8">In the intention-to-treat (ITT) population of 22 patients in the Nivo+CT arm, MPR occurred in seven patients (32.1%, 7/22, 80% confidence interval (CI) 18.7–43.1%, <italic>P</italic> = 0.036 for the statistical test against the assumed historical control of 15%), and this arm met the prespecified boundary of six responses to be considered efficacious; pCR occurred in four patients (18.2%, 4/22, 95% CI 5.2–40.3%) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">2</xref>). All 22 treated patients underwent surgery on trial, and the median percentage of viable tumor was 50.5% (range 0–95.5%; Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). In the ITT population of 22 patients in the Ipi+Nivo+CT arm, MPR occurred in 11 patients (50%, 11/22, 80% CI 34.6–61.1%, <italic>P</italic> = 0.00012 for the statistical test against the assumed historical control of 15%), also meeting the prespecified boundary of six responses to be considered efficacious; pCR occurred in four patients (18.2%, 4/22, 95% CI 5.2–40.3%) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Twenty patients (91%) underwent surgery on trial, and the median percentage of viable tumor was 4.5% (range 0–94.4%; Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). In 20 resected patients, the MPR and pCR rates were 55% and 20%, respectively (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">3</xref>). The association between the treatment arm and MPR in subgroups of interest was explored (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). Among the patients with stage IIIA disease, the odds of having MPR were 16.0 (95% CI 1.54–166) times higher in the Ipi+Nivo+CT arm than in the Nivo+CT arm. Similar results were obtained when analyses were performed in the population without known tumor <italic>EGFR/ALK</italic> alterations (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). In both arms combined, the odds of having MPR among the former/current smokers was 23.6 (95% CI 1.11–498) times higher than among never smokers, and the odds of having MPR among patients with squamous histology was 9.60 (95% CI 1.73–53.4) times higher than among patients with non-squamous histologies (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">4</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>Pathologic and radiographic responses in patients treated with neoadjuvant Nivo+CT and Ipi+Nivo+CT.</title><p><bold>a</bold>, Proportion of patients with pathologic responses and percentage of viable tumor in the ITT population (Nivo+CT, <italic>n</italic> = 22; Ipi+Nivo+CT, <italic>n</italic> = 22).

One patient died of SARS-CoV-2 infection-related complications (non-treatment related) after the first cycle of neoadjuvant therapy. Another patient was not resected, despite radiographic SD after completing neoadjuvant therapy, based on surgeon’s judgment because the tumor was abutting the left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery graft, and the patient’s exercise test performance declined. The median time to operation was 28.5 days (range 23–72), with two operations being delayed due to scheduling and a positive preoperative SARS-CoV-2 test requiring quarantine before surgery.

                <p id="Par17">To further characterize the immune composition of tumors treated with neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy and evaluate the impact of Ipi on the phenotype of tumor-infiltrating immune populations, we performed gene expression analysis by NanoString of resected tumors from patients treated with Nivo+CT and Ipi+Nivo+CT. We observed overall favorable immunological changes in tumors from the Ipi+Nivo+CT arm. Cell type scores for immune cells (CD45<sup>+</sup>), T cells, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, NK cells, B cells, cytotoxic cells and macrophages were all greater in tumors resected from patients treated with Ipi+Nivo+CT compared to those treated with Nivo+CT (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">7a–e</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6a,b</xref>, left panels). Signature scores of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) were also significantly higher in tumors from patients treated with Ipi+Nivo+CT compared to Nivo+CT (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">7f</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6c</xref>, left panels). The effect of combining Ipi with Nivo+CT was more evident when we segregated the samples based on treatment response.

Moreover, we observed a higher TLS gene signature score in MPR patients compared to no MPR patients (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">7f</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6c</xref>, right panels).</p>
                <p id="Par18">Analysis of differentially expressed genes in responders (MPR) to Ipi+Nivo+CT compared to Nivo+CT showed an enrichment of genes associated with TLS formation, cytotoxic molecules and memory T cell markers, all of which have been shown to be associated with a favorable clinical outcome in patients with cancer treated with immune checkpoint therapies (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">7g</xref>).

The addition of Ipi to Nivo+CT maintained an overall acceptable toxicity and allowed curative-intent surgery without adverse postoperative outcomes. Although the trial was not directly designed to compare both arms, our clinical and pathological findings of potential enhanced activity of Ipi+Nivo+CT are supported by our translational analyses demonstrating compositional changes consistent with marked tumor immune infiltration with an anti-tumor activity phenotype in tumors from the Ipi+Nivo+CT cohort compared with those treated with Nivo+CT.</p>
              <p id="Par23">MPR was selected as the primary outcome measure in our study owing to the low pCR rates achieved by CT alone in historical neoadjuvant trials and as demonstrated in the control CT arm of the CheckMate-816 study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. pCR has become a more relevant outcome measure only recently, since the report of 24.0% pCR rate in the CheckMate-816 trial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> and 36.8% pCR rate in the NADIM II trial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> in tumor <italic>EGFR</italic> and <italic>ALK</italic> wild-type patients. The results of our evaluation of Nivo+CT are overall consistent with the findings from CheckMate-816 (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>), particularly when excluding tumors with known <italic>EGFR/ALK</italic> alterations. In CheckMate-816, Nivo+CT resulted in MPR and pCR rates of 36.9% and 24.0%, respectively, and a 12-month and 24-month EFS of 76.1% and 63.8%, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. We found MPR and pCR rates of 41.2% and 23.5%, respectively, and a 12-month and 24-month EFS of 100% and 71%, respectively, in patients without known tumor <italic>EGFR/ALK</italic> alterations. The similarities between the two trials with respect to Nivo+CT treatment lend support for the NEOSTAR platform as a viable approach for evaluating new neoadjuvant therapies for resectable NSCLC. Furthermore, the extent of residual viable tumor (RVT) at surgery in patients treated with Ipi+Nivo+CT was a fraction of that found after Nivo+CT (median: 4.5% versus 50.5%). It is worth noting that 86% of patients with MPR in the Nivo+CT group and all patients with MPR in the Ipi+Nivo+CT group had &lt;5% RVT in their tumor specimen. This observation is important in the context of the analysis from the CheckMate-816 trial, which identified 0–5% RVT as the most optimal cutoff associated with 90% 2-year EFS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. We also observed even greater tumor regression to Ipi+Nivo+CT in stage IIIA disease compared to Nivo+CT, which builds on the findings of the CheckMate-816 (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>) and the phase 2 NADIM study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. These data suggest that more advanced tumors may require combination therapy, and addition of CTLA-4 blockade may achieve deeper pathologic responses in the stage III setting. We also observed less viable tumor cells after Ipi+Nivo+CT in tumors harboring <italic>KRAS</italic> and <italic>TP53</italic> alterations, consistent with prior results demonstrating improved outcomes to immunotherapy in these molecular subgroups<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, similar to the exploratory analyses of the CheckMate-227 part 1 study, which revealed improved OS in patients with <italic>KRAS</italic>-mutant and <italic>TP53</italic>-mutant metastatic tumors treated with Ipi+Nivo compared with CT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par24">Our scRNA-seq analysis demonstrated marked differences in the immune landscape between tumors and uninvolved normal tissues in both treatment arms. Tumors were characterized by increased fractions of CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>reg</sub> cells and Tfh, B cells and TAMs, consistent with previous reports on single-cell analyses of samples from treatment-naive patients with NSCLC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Comparative scRNA-seq analysis unraveled conspicuous changes in the fractions of immune populations in tumors across both arms. Our findings of increased fraction of CD8<sup>+</sup> TERM eff/TEM cells, a subset recently described in a pan-cancer T cell atlas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, in Ipi+Nivo+CT-treated tumors suggest their potential role in anti-tumor immune responses by the addition of Ipi. Our observations on increased abundance of B cells in Ipi+Nivo+CT relative to Nivo+CT and their inverse correlation with remaining viable tumor cells, along with our corroborative data on TLS genes by NanoString-based profiling, suggest an association of B lineage cells and TLS-associated genes, such as <italic>CXCL13</italic>, with immunotherapeutic response, as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. B cells from Nivo+CT tumors showed increased expression of <italic>CD24</italic> that is reminiscent of CD24<sup>hi</sup> B cell subsets that restrict T cell activation and cytokine production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Bulk tumor immune profiling using the NanoString platform also showed elevated expression of <italic>CD24</italic> in tumors from the Nivo+CT arm, although it is conceivable that the overall greater viable tumor in this arm may account for increased expression of <italic>CD24</italic> (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>). Also, our observation of increased <italic>CXCL9</italic><sup>+</sup> TAMs in tumors from patients treated with Ipi+Nivo+CT is in accordance with earlier studies suggesting a functional role for these macrophages in response to immune checkpoint therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Overall, our single-cell sequencing analysis suggests that addition of Ipi to Nivo+CT favors a tumor ecosystem with overall enhanced tumor immune infiltrates and reduced immunosuppressive cell subsets and states. Additional support for this notion comes from the results of our tissue immune profiling with mIF and flow cytometry studies that revealed greater infiltration of antigen-activated (GZB<sup>+</sup>) CD8<sup>+</sup> TILs, higher densities of activated (ICOS<sup>+</sup>) and cytolytic (perforin<sup>+</sup>) CD8<sup>+</sup> TILs and reduced infiltration of LAG3<sup>+</sup> immunosuppressive CD4<sup>+</sup> TILs in tumors resected after Ipi+Nivo+CT treatment.</p>
              <p id="Par25">The tumor PD-L1 expression analysis was limited by the number of pre-therapy samples available for evaluation and the unexpected, particularly high incidence of tumors lacking PD-L1 expression on malignant cells in this dataset. This limited our ability to make firm conclusions regarding the association between this marker and therapeutic responses. Nevertheless, this cohort provided a unique opportunity to investigate the impact of treatment on responses in tumors lacking PD-L1 expression on cancer cells. Our findings suggest that Ipi may be particularly relevant to the treatment of PD-L1-negative tumors in which MPR was seen in 22.2% of patients treated with Nivo+CT and 40% of patients treated with Ipi+Nivo+CT. In patients with metastatic disease, the CheckMate-227 study (evaluating first-line Ipi+Nivo)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> and the CheckMate-9LA study (evaluating Ipi+Nivo+CT)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup> suggested notable activity of Ipi in PD-L1-negative tumors. Benefits from neoadjuvant Nivo+CT (in ChekMate-816)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> and adjuvant atezolizumab after CT (in IMpower-010)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> were less in the PD-L1-negative subgroups, underscoring the need for improved perioperative strategies, possibly involving dual immunotherapy, for this patient subset.</p>
              <p id="Par26">The gut microbiome remains a strong tumor-extrinsic factor associated with anti-tumor response across various cancer histologies and treatment modalities. In this study, we observed different fecal microbiome structures and compositions between patients with MPR and those without MPR by treatment arm, suggesting a distinct association among treatment, response and gut microbiome composition. Notably, patients achieving MPR in both arms had fecal microbiomes enriched in <italic>Akkermansia</italic>, a mucin-degrading bacteria previously associated with responses to immunotherapy in NSCLC by our group<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> and others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. Future larger studies will shed light on the mechanisms by which distinct microbial strains influence treatment outcomes and provide the foundation to evaluate the therapeutic benefit of additional microbiome modulation strategies in patients with cancers refractory to standard-of-care treatments.</p>
              <p id="Par27">In conclusion, our findings further support the role of neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy before NSCLC resection and expand on the standard-of-care neoadjuvant Nivo+CT by incorporating CTLA-4 blockade to this treatment regimen. The dual immune checkpoint therapy plus CT produces numerically higher MPR rates, is overall safe and tolerated, enhances anti-tumor immune activity and mitigates an immunosuppressive phenotype in exploratory analyses. The NEOSTAR platform trial design with surrogate endpoints and integrated multi-omic correlates enables the rapid assessment of promising therapeutic strategies and the identification of candidate targets to open new areas of translational investigation in the perioperative setting. The addition of CTLA-4 blockade to PD-(L)1 inhibition plus CT deserves further investigation for patients with resectable NSCLC.</p>

The results of the first two randomized arms of the study have been reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. New eligible patients were enrolled to the third arm (arm C) and treated with nivolumab plus platinum-based chemotherapy (Nivo+CT). Once the accrual of arm C was complete, eligible patients were enrolled to the fourth arm (arm D) and treated with ipilimumab plus nivolumab plus platinum-based chemotherapy (Ipi+Nivo+CT). The primary hypothesis to be tested was that, in patients with NSCLC amenable for surgical resection, induction therapy with Nivo+CT or Ipi+Nivo+CT will produce MPR rates of at least 40%, a target response rate that is superior to the one observed after induction platinum-based CT alone of 15% (as observed in MD Anderson historical controls<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>). The prespecified boundary for a treatment arm to be considered promising for further testing was ≥6 MPR in 21 evaluable patients. The secondary hypothesis to be tested was that Nivo+CT or Ipi+Nivo+CT would induce immune responses (as assessed by CD8<sup>+</sup> TILs) and tumor shrinkage (as assessed by radiographic imaging) and improve survival outcomes (time to events including EFS and OS). The primary endpoint of the trial was MPR, defined as less than or equal to 10% viable tumor cells in the original resected tumor bed after neoadjuvant therapy on trial. Secondary endpoints included treatment toxicity, perioperative morbidity and mortality, quantification of CD8<sup>+</sup> TILs in resected tumor tissues, objective response rate, pCR, completeness of surgical resection, time to events (including EFS and OS) and correlation of blood, tissue and stool biomarkers with efficacy. Exploratory endpoints included tissue-based, blood-based, stool-based and imaging-based biomarkers (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).</p>

                <p id="Par29">Simon’s minimax two-stage design<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup> was applied to test the MPR rate for each of the treatment arms. We assumed a historical MPR rate of 15%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> under the null hypothesis versus an MPR rate of 40% under the alternative hypothesis. For each treatment arm, 15 patients were enrolled in the first stage. If only two or fewer of the 15 patients have experienced an MPR, enrollment to that treatment arm would be terminated, and the treatment would be considered inefficacious. Otherwise, with at least three MPRs, an additional six patients were enrolled to reach a total of 21 patients. At the end of each arm, if we observed six or more patients experiencing MPR, the treatment would be considered efficacious and inefficacious otherwise. Each arm has 90% power when the MPR rate is 40%. When the MPR rate is 15%, the probability of early termination is 60% with an average sample size of 17.4 and one-sided 10% type I error rate. From the above calculations, the study needs up to 21 evaluable patients in each arm. Assuming a non-evaluable rate of 5% (for example, patients drop out, become lost to follow-up or rescind consent due to non-treatment-related reasons before endpoints can be evaluated), we would need to enroll up to a total of 22 patients per arm. Enrolled patients were monitored for adverse events (AEs). AEs were treated as detailed in the protocol algorithm of toxicity management. We applied a Bayesian method to formally monitor the toxicity in the perioperative phase within each treatment arm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>.</p>

Sorted cells were maintained on ice before being washed, filtered, manually counted using a hemocytometer and trypan blue (T8154, Sigma-Aldrich) exclusion and resuspended in 2% FBS in PBS at 1,000 cells per microliter. Viable single cells were loaded on 10x Chromium microfluidic chips, and single-cell gene expression libraries were generated as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> and according to the manufacturer’s standard protocols (Chromium 5′ Next GEM Single Cell Kit version 1.0, 1000006, 10x Genomics) and targeting 1,300-10,000 cells per sample. Single cells loaded onto Chromium Next GEM Chips A (2000167, 10x Genomics) were partitioned into nanoliter-scale gel beads-in-emulsion (GEMs) using Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 5′ Gel Bead Kit version 1.0 (1000003, 10x Genomics). Recovered barcoded GEMs were broken, pooled and underwent magnetic bead clean-up (Dynabeads MyOne Silane, 37002D, Thermo Fisher Scientific) to construct single-cell gene expression libraries using the Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 5′ Library kit (1000002, 10x Genomics) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Next, 10x-barcoded full-length cDNA was amplified by PCR and analyzed using Bioanalyzer High Sensitivity DNA Kit (5067-4626, Agilent). Up to 50 ng of cDNA was subjected to enzymatic fragmentation and size selection to optimize the cDNA amplicon size before 5′ gene expression library construction. Finally, Illumina-ready barcoded gene expression libraries were generated after a round of end-repair, A-tailing, adaptor ligation and sample index PCR using Chromium i7 Multiplex Kit (120262, 10x Genomics). Library quality and yield were measured using Bioanalyzer High Sensitivity DNA (5067-4626, Agilent) and Qubit dsDNA High Sensitivity Assay (Q32854, Thermo Fisher Scientific) kits. Pooling of indexed libraries was done after adjustment of the ratio of the targeted cells per library as well as individual library concentration. Library pools were then denatured and diluted as recommended for sequencing on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform. After quality control assessment, libraries were pooled and sequenced at a target depth of ~50,000 reads per cell on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform.</p>

                <p id="Par75">scRNA-seq analysis was performed using available computational framework. The raw reads were aligned to human reference genome GRh38 (hg38) and processed by 10x Genomics Cell Ranger version 3.1.0 to generate the unique molecular identifier (UMI) count data matrix. The UMI data matrix was processed using the Seurat package (version 3)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>, with the following workflow. (1) Data filtering: The UMI data matrix was filtered to remove genes that were not expressed in any cells as well as cells with fewer than 300 expressed genes or more than 10% of total UMI count of mitochondrial genes. (2) Data normalization and integration: Filtered UMI data matrices from different data batches were normalized, scaled, batch corrected and integrated using the data integration workflow in Seurat version 3, with the integration anchor features set to all genes in filtered datasets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. (3) Data reduction and visualization: Principal component analysis was performed using highly variable genes identified using the Seurat version 3 ‘VariableFeatures’ function. The top-ranked principal components that covered 80% of the total variance were selected and transformed into uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) components for visualization. (4) Unsupervised clustering: Cell clusters were identified using the Seurat ‘FindClusters’ function, with resolution value manually adjusted to find the best separation. (5) Cluster annotation: The marker genes for each cluster were identified using the Seurat version 3 ‘FindClusterMarkers’ function. These markers genes, combined with gene markers for known cell types, such as immune cells and epithelial cells, were used to identify the major cell lineages of each cluster. Each cell lineage was further clustered to identify sublineages if needed. During these processes, additional doublets were identified and removed from the clusters. These clustering/identification processes were performed iteratively until all cell populations were annotated. (6) Differential analysis: For each cell population, we identified the differentially expressed genes between sample types (tumor versus uninvolved) and treatment group (Nivo+CT versus Ipi+Nivo+CT), using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, with statistical cutoff set to false discovery rate less than 0.05 and log<sub>2</sub> fold change greater than 1. Cell proportions between sample types (tumor versus uninvolved) and treatment group (Nivo+CT versus Ipi+Nivo+CT) were compared using two-sided proportion test. All statistical analyses were performed in R version 4.0.1.</p>

In the Ipi+Nivo+CT arm, seven MPRs were achieved in the first stage, and, thus, the study proceeded to the second stage. As the primary analysis, a uniformly minimum variance unbiased estimator (UMVUE) of the MPR rate was obtained using the approach proposed by Jung and Kim<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup> within each study arm.

                        <p>Patients with resectable, cytologically/histopathologically confirmed, clinical stage IB (≥4 cm)-IIIA (N2 single station) NSCLC were treated with neoadjuvant Nivo+CT for up to three cycles (arm C; D1, D22 and D43) or Ipi+Nivo+CT for up to three cycles (arm D; D1, D22 and D43; Ipi given on cycle 1 [D1] only), followed by surgical resection (within 3 to 6 weeks after the last cycle of therapy). *Standard of care adjuvant systemic therapy and/or postoperative radiation therapy were allowed at the discretion of the treating physicians. The primary endpoint of the trial was MPR, defined as ≤10% viable tumor in resected tumor specimens, in treated patients. Tumor samples were collected, when possible, pretherapy and at surgery, adjacent uninvolved (normal) lung tissues were also collected, where possible, at surgery. Stool samples were collected, where possible, pretherapy and post-therapy (prior to surgery). Longitudinal blood samples were collected, where possible, pretherapy, prior to cycle 2 and 3, post-therapy (prior to surgery) and within 8 weeks after surgery (post-surgery). NSCLC, non–small cell lung cancer; Nivo, nivolumab; Ipi, ipilimumab; CT, chemotherapy; D, day of therapy; CT, computer tomography scan; PET-CT, positron emission tomography-computer tomography scan, SOC, standard of care.
