                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="P3">Adjuvant chemotherapy for resected early stage NSCLC provides modest
survival benefit. Bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody directed against
vascular endothelial growth factor, improves outcomes when added to
platinum-based chemotherapy in advanced stage non-squamous NSCLC. We
conducted a phase III study to evaluate the addition of bevacizumab to
adjuvant chemotherapy in early stage resected NSCLC (E1505). The primary
endpoint was overall survival.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="P4">Adult patients (≥ 18 years old) with ECOG performance status
0 or 1 with completely resected stage IB (≥4 centimeters) to IIIA
(AJCC 6th edition) NSCLC were enrolled within 6–12 weeks of surgery
and stratified by chemotherapy regimen, stage, histology, and sex. Minimum
mediastinal lymph node sampling at specified levels was required (level 7
and 4 for right-sided tumors or level 7 and 5 and/or 6 for left-sided
tumors). Normal laboratory values within two weeks of randomisation were
required for enrollment. Chemotherapy, which was selected for each patient
prior to randomisation, consisted of four, 3-week (21-day) cycles of
cisplatin (75 mg/m<sup>2</sup> in all regimens) with either vinorelbine 30
mg/m<sup>2</sup> days 1 and 8; docetaxel 75 mg/m<sup>2</sup> day 1; OR
gemcitabine 1200 mg/m<sup>2</sup> days 1 and 8; OR, starting in 2009 with an
amendment, pemetrexed 500 mg/m<sup>2</sup> day 1 along with B12 and folic
acid supplementation. Patients were randomised 1:1 to Arm A (chemotherapy)
or Arm B, adding bevacizumab at 15 mg/kg every 3 weeks starting with cycle 1
of chemotherapy and continuing for one year. Randomisation to treatment arm
was performed centrally and determined using permuted blocks within strata
with dynamic balancing on institution. The study had 85% power to
detect a 21% reduction in the overall survival (OS) hazard rate with
a one-sided 0·025-level test. The primary endpoint was overall
survival, which was defined as the time from randomisation to death from any
cause, and patients who were thought to be alive at the time of final
analysis were censored at the last date of contact with analysis done based
on intention to treat. This is final analysis of the primary endpoint of
overall survival of E1505 (NCT00324805).</p>

whom 26% (N=383) had stage IB, 44% (N=636)
stage II, and 30% (N=439) stage IIIA) with 28%
(N=422) squamous cell histology. Cisplatin-based chemotherapy
regimens utilized were vinorelbine 25% (N=377), docetaxel
23% (N=343), gemcitabine 19% (N=283), and
pemetrexed 33% (N=497). At a median follow-up time of
50·3 months (IQR 32.9–68.0), estimated OS hazard ratio (B/A)
was 0·99 (95% CI: 0·82–1·19,
p=0·90). The median OS on Arm A has not been reached and is
85.8 months (95% CI 74.9-NA) on Arm B. Statistically significantly
increased grade 3–5 toxicities of note (all attributions) included:
overall worst grade (ie all grade 3/4/5 toxicities)
(67%(N=496) versus 83%(N=610)); hypertension
(8%(N=60) versus 30%(N=219)), and
neutropenia (33%(N=241) versus 37%(N=275))
on Arms A and B, respectively. There was no significant difference in grade
5 adverse events per arm (N=15 on arm A and N=19 on arm
B).</p>

              <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
              <p id="P8">Complete surgical resection remains the most effective initial therapy for
patients with early stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Adjuvant chemotherapy
became a standard after the 2003 presentation of the International Adjuvant Lung
Cancer Trial (IALT) (n=1,867)<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> with a reported 4% absolute five-year survival benefit
and an overall survival hazard ratio (OS HR) =0·86 (95% CI:
0·76–0·98, P&lt;0·03) in favor of adjuvant
cisplatin-based chemotherapy for 4 cycles. Two other positive adjuvant chemotherapy
trials, which utilized only cisplatin with vinorelbine, maintained significantly
improved survival benefits with long-term follow-up.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> More
specifically, the ANITA trial, which included a mix of stage IB, II and IIIA
patients, reported a median overall survival of 65·7 months (95% CI
47·9–88·5) in the chemotherapy arm compared to 43·7
months (95% CI 35·7–52·3) with
observation.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Meta-analyses
of NSCLC adjuvant chemotherapy trials confirmed the 4–5% absolute
survival increase at 5 years.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Thus, current guidelines endorse the
use of adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy for stage II and IIIA NSCLC after
complete resection.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy
doublets for stage I patients is often suggested for patients with larger stage I
(N0) tumors at ≥ 4 centimeters based on improved survival in subset analyses
from the earlier adjuvant trials.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup></p>
              <p id="P9">In the setting of advanced stage NSCLC, the first agent to improve survival
when added to a platinum doublet was bevacizumab. Bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody
directed against vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), improved response,
progression-free survival, and overall survival when added to carboplatin/paclitaxel
in advanced stage non-squamous NSCLC in the E4599 trial.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Based on those positive results, this phase
III trial (E1505) was designed to assess whether the addition of bevacizumab to
cisplatin-based chemotherapy would improve survival of patients with resected early
stage NSCLC in the adjuvant setting, who despite adjuvant chemotherapy remain at
high risk of relapse.</p>
              <p id="P10">In the LACE meta-analysis of adjuvant chemotherapy trials,
cisplatin/vinorelbine was associated with a superior survival benefit compared to
the other regimens.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> In addition
to cisplatin/vinorelbine we decided to include other standard cisplatin-based
doublet regimens utilized for stage IV NSCLC in E1505, including
cisplatin/gemcitabine and cisplatin/docetaxel given their efficacy in the metastatic
setting and practice patterns. In 2009 cisplatin/pemetrexed was also included in
E1505 for non-squamous patients following FDA approval of that regimen in advanced
NSCLC. Subsequently a phase II trial that demonstrated that cisplatin/pemetrexed was
better tolerated than cisplatin/vinorelbine in the adjuvant setting.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Patients with squamous histology
were included in E1505, based on the assumption that the hemoptysis seen more
frequently with bevacizumab in metastatic squamous lung cancer patients would be
unlikely in patients post-resection. However, patients with squamous histology were
not permitted to receive adjuvant pemetrexed/cisplatin based on inferior outcomes
with this regimen in advanced stage squamous lung carcinoma patients.</p>

                <title>Study design and participants</title>
                <p id="P11">This open-label predominantly North American Intergroup phase III trial
was led by the ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group coordinating center and approved
by the ethics committee of every participating center and undertaken according
to the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients gave written informed consent prior
to participation. Eligible patients had undergone complete resection of stage IB
(≥ 4 centimeters), II or IIIA NSCLC no less than 6 weeks and no more
than 12 weeks prior to enrollment and had recovered from surgery. Staging was
completed per AJCC 6th edition. Mediastinal lymph node sampling at specified
levels was required (level 7 and 4 for right-sided tumors or level 7 and 5
and/or 6 for left-sided tumors). Patients were at least 18 years old with ECOG
performance status 0 or 1. No prior systemic chemotherapy was allowed but
patients with a prior cured malignancy treated with surgery, biologic, or
hormonal cancer therapy or radiation therapy was allowed if all treatment was
completed at least 5 years prior to randomisation. Normal laboratory values
within two weeks of randomisation were required including platelet and
neutrophil counts within normal limits (WNL), normal coagulation studies, liver
function within 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), adequate renal function
(creatinine no more than 1·5 times ULN), and urine protein creatinine
spot test WNL or validated with a 24-hour urine collection. Patients assigned to
pemetrexed/cisplatin were also required to have a calculated creatinine
clearance ≥ 45mL/min using the standard Cockcroft and Gault formula.
Patients were excluded for active arterial thrombotic disease (including
myocardial infarction) within 12 months prior to randomisation. Patients with
any history of cerebral vascular accident (CVA) or transient ischemic attack
(TIA) were excluded. All women of childbearing potential had a negative
pregnancy test within 2 weeks prior to randomisation and both fertile men and
women must have agreed to use adequate contraceptive measures during study
treatment. Patients must not have had any clinically significant ongoing,
active, or serious infection; symptomatic or uncontrolled congestive heart
failure; symptomatic or uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia; or any other medical
condition or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance
with study requirements.</p>
                <p id="P12">Patients were excluded for history of bleeding diathesis or
coagulopathy; uncontrolled hypertension; use of dipyridamole, ticlopine,
clopidogrel, and/or cilostazol; serious non-healing wound, ulcer, bone fracture,
or having undergone a major surgical procedure, open biopsy, or significant
traumatic injury within 28 days prior to randomisation OR core biopsy within 7
days prior to randomisation. Patients were excluded for any abdominal abscess or
perforation within 28 days of randomisation or anticipated surgery during course
of the study, or ongoing post-operative hemoptysis.</p>

                <title>Randomisation and masking</title>
                <p id="P13">Randomisation was performed using permuted blocks within strata with
dynamic balancing on main ECOG-ACRIN institutions plus affiliates. The
randomisation was stratified based on the patients planned chemotherapy
(cisplatin/vinorelbine, cisplatin/docetaxel, cisplatin/gemcitabine,
cisplatin/pemetrexed); stage of disease (IB (&gt;=4cm), II, IIIA-N2,
IIIA-T3N1); histology (squamous cell, other NSCLC) and gender (male or female).
No masking was performed and all patients and care team members were aware of
treatment assignments. The only masking that occurred was during Data Safety and
Monitoring Committee (DSMC) meetings during which the DSMC was blinded to
treatment arm during assessments of efficacy and toxicity at the pre-defined
analysis time points.</p>
              </sec>
              <sec id="S10">
                <title>Procedures</title>
                <p id="P14">All patients were to receive up to 4 cycles of 21 days of cisplatin
given at 75 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on day 1, in combination with a third generation
cytotoxic agent. The other chemotherapy agents based on investigator’s
choice were: vinorelbine 30 mg/m<sup>2</sup> days 1 and 8; docetaxel 75
mg/m<sup>2</sup> day 1; gemcitabine 1200 mg/m<sup>2</sup> days 1 and 8; and
starting in 2009 with an amendment, pemetrexed 500 mg/m<sup>2</sup> day 1 along
with B12 (1000 micrograms intramuscularly at least every 9 weeks while on
therapy starting at a minimum on the first day of therapy and folic acid
supplementation (at 400 micrograms daily orally). The investigator was required
to indicate the selected chemotherapy regimen for the patient prior to
randomisation. Patients randomised to Arm B also received bevacizumab
administered with chemotherapy for a total of 4 cycles and continued every 21
days for up to 1 year (measured from first day of protocol treatment).
Bevacizumab was dosed at 15 mg/kg IV on day 1 of each cycle.</p>
                <p id="P15">Dose interruptions and dose reductions for the chemotherapy drugs
followed standard practice guidelines. If a dose delay was required for 1 drug,
both chemotherapy drugs (and bevacizumab for arm B) were delayed and resumed
together so that they remained in sync. Day 1 chemotherapy could only be
administered for absolute neutrophil count of at least 1,500/mm2 and platelet
count of at least 100,000/Ul. Treatment could be delayed for up to 3 weeks to
allow for recovery of counts. If febrile neutropenia was documented cisplatin
doses were not adjusted, but vinorelbine, docetaxel, gemcitabine or pemetrexed
were reduced by 1 dose level for first event and by 2 dose levels for the
2<sup>nd</sup> episode and protocol chemotherapy was discontinued for a
third episode. Dose level 1 was 25% of original dosing and dose level 2
was 50% of original dosing. Cisplatin dose reductions by 25%
were permitted for grade 3 nausea/vomiting despite maximum supportive care or
grade 3 oral mucositis. Cisplatin was reduced by 50% for creatinine of
&gt;1.5–2.0 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) and held if &gt; 2.0
times the ULN, but could be restarted with 25% reduction if the
creatinine improved within 3 weeks. Both chemotherapeutic agents were held for
sensory/motor neuropathy or grade 2 or higher and resumed after recovery to
grade 1 (with 25% reduction if max grade was 2 and 50% reduction
if maximum grade was 3 or higher). Cisplatin was discontinued for grade 3 or 4
hearing loss. For hepatic toxicity: vinorelbine or docetaxel or pemetrexed was
reduced by 25% for grade 2 hepatic toxicity and held for grade 3 or
higher with resumption only if recovery within 3 weeks. For any clinically
significant grade 3 or 4 toxicity felt to be related to chemotherapy the
treatment was delayed until recovery to at least grade 1, then resumed with a
25% dose reduction in the agent felt most likely to have caused the
toxicity. Further dose reductions were permitted per investigator discretion and
discontinuation of protocol chemotherapy was required if such toxicity did not
resolve to at least grade 1 within 3 weeks. For patients on arm B, continuation
of bevacizumab was permitted despite early discontinuation of chemotherapy.</p>
                <p id="P16">Particular for docetaxel, if an allergic reaction/anaphylaxis event
occurred, the drug was stopped and diphehydramine and dexamethasone were given
with a resumption of a slower infusion. If the symptoms recurred then docetaxel
was discontinued. In such instances, after discussion with study chair, the
patient was permitted to switch to another chemotherapy arm, or if on arm B
could continue on bevacizumab alone. For Day 8; vinorelbine or gemcitabine were
reduced to 75% dose for ANC of 500–999 ×
10<sup>6</sup>/L or platelet count of 50,000–74,999 ×
10<sup>6</sup>/L or held for lower results of either ANC or platelets.</p>
                <p id="P17">Patients continued protocol therapy up to 4 cycles of chemotherapy and,
for those on arm B, up to 1 year of bevacizumab (counted from first day of
therapy) unless there was evidence of recurrent NSCLC, development of second
primary cancer (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of the
cervix), or in the situation that continuation on protocol was felt to be
detrimental to the patient’s health due to extraordinary medical
circumstances.</p>
                <p id="P18">Bevacizumab was never dose reduced, but was to be delayed if
chemotherapy was delayed to allow for same day administration. If chemotherapy
was withheld (skipped) bevacizumab was given on schedule. Bevacizumab was
discontinued for hemoptysis of &gt; grade 1, grade 3 or 4 congestive heart
failure, evidence of reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome, grade 4
allergic reaction, grade 2 or higher arterial thrombosis, grade 4 hypertension,
nephrotic syndrome, hemorrhage of grade 2 or higher in the central nervous
system or &gt; grade 2 elsewhere, wound dehiscence requiring intervention,
perforation of gastrointestinal track, or any other grade 3 or 4 clinically
significant adverse event attributable to bevacizumab that did not resolve in 4
weeks of holding drug (grade 3) or had not resolved to grade 1 and with approval
of study chair (grade 4).</p>
                <p id="P19">Post-operative radiation therapy was not permitted. Patients were seen
at least every 3 weeks with a full physical examination including blood pressure
and laboratory studies (including a complete blood count and comprehensive
metabolic panel) and assessment for adverse events during the period of
chemotherapy administration.</p>
                <p id="P20">Patients on Arm B were required to have visits with physical
examination, adverse event assessments and laboratory studies every 6 weeks
while receiving single agent bevacizumab. All patients were followed for
recurrence with chest imaging (radiograph or computed tomography which were
reviewed locally) and physical examination every 3 months for 2 years, then
every 6 months through year 5, then annually through year 10.</p>

                <title>Outcomes</title>
                <p id="P21">The primary objective of this phase III study was to compare the overall
survival in patients with NSCLC randomised to chemotherapy with bevacizumab (Arm
B) and without bevacizumab (Arm A) in an intent-to-treat analysis. Overall
survival was defined as the time from randomisation to death from any cause, and
patients who were thought to be alive at the time of final analysis were
censored at the last date of contact. Secondary objectives included disease-free
survival as well as toxicity assessment defined as toxicity with chemotherapy
with or without bevacizumab used in the adjuvant setting in patients with
resected NSCLC. Other secondary objectives, included to perform analyses of
tissue and blood to establish factors that predict for clinical outcome in
patient receiving chemotherapy, with or without bevacizumab, for resected early
stage NSCLC. To determine whether smoking status is linked to outcome for
patients with resected early stage NSCLC treatment with chemotherapy with or
without bevacizumab in the adjuvant setting.</p>

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p id="P22">All analyses were conducted on an intent to treat basis. All randomised
patients were included in the primary analyses and DFS analysis. For toxicity
data, only patients who received therapy were included. All patients were
otherwise assessable. The randomisation was stratified based on planned
chemotherapy backbone (cisplatin/vinorelbine, cisplatin/docetaxel,
cisplatin/gemcitabine, cisplatin/pemetrexed); stage of disease (IB (≥4
cm), II, IIIA-N2, IIIA-T3N1); histology (squamous cell, non-squamous NSCLC); and
sex (male or female), using permuted blocks within strata with dynamic balancing
on main ECOG institutions plus affiliates. The statistical design targeted an
overall survival (OS) hazard ratio (HR) or 0.79 with 85% power while
maintaining a significance level of 2·5% in a one-sided test.
Assuming exponential event times, the corresponded to an improvement in the
median OS of 66 months on Arm A to 83.5 months on Arm B. The total planned
accrual goal was 1500 patients with full statistical information at 676
deaths.</p>
                <p id="P23">The study design specified interim analyses starting at 25%
information (167 events) and every 6 months thereafter with stopping rules
defined for efficacy with a truncated O’Brien-Fleming boundary and for
futility with repeated confidence intervals. The study was continuously
monitored for toxicity signals, particularly the rates of grade 3–5
arterial thromboembolic events and bleeding events, as well as the rate of grade
4–5 wound healing complications.</p>
                <p id="P24">OS was defined as the time from randomisation to death from any cause,
and patients who were thought to be alive at the time of final analysis were
censored at the last date of contact. Disease-free survival (DFS) was defined as
the time from randomisation to an event defined as disease recurrence, new
primary of lung cancer, second primary, or death, whichever occurred first.
Patients who did not experience a DFS event at analysis were censored at their
last date of disease assessment. Time to treatment discontinuation was measured
in months from date of registration to date off treatment.</p>
                <p id="P25">Event-time distributions were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.
Cox proportional hazards models stratified on the randomisation stratification
factors were used to estimate the hazard ratios and to test for differences
between treatment arms. Adverse events, reported using the NCI Common
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4·0, were
compared using the Fisher’s exact test; cumulative incidence of
treatment discontinuation was estimated using a competing risks model.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> All reported P values are

              <p id="P27">Between study activation on June 1, 2007 and enrollment termination on
September 20, 2013, a total of 1501 patients were enrolled across the United States
National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN) and the Cancer Clinical Trials Group
(formerly NCIC-CTG). All 1501 patients are included in the OS and DFS analyses,
which were done on an intent to treat basis. Twenty-nine patients never started
assigned therapy (12 on Arm A and 17 on Arm B) as noted in the study Consort Diagram
(<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> due to treatment refusal
(N=14), ineligibility (N=4), progression before start of therapy
(N=4), other medical issue (N=7)). A total of 234 patients
(15·6%, 121 on Arm A and 113 on Arm B) were deemed ineligible most
commonly for inadequate nodal sampling (N=101) or ineligible stage
(N=44). Other reasons for ineligibility were registration &lt; 6 weeks from
surgery (N=45), elevated baseline blood pressure or inadequate documentation
of baseline blood pressure (N=15), baseline UPC not obtained in time frame
(N=20), history of malignancy (N=2), inadequate renal function
(N=2) and a variety of individual reasons including incorrect pathology,
history of infarction, active claudication, missing baseline performance status,
history of prior chemotherapy. The majority of these were identified as ineligible
on retrospective central review after initiating (and most commonly after
completing) therapy. As was standard on ECOG-ACRIN trials during the time of
enrollment on E1505, neither centralized screening nor pre-screening strategies were
utilized. The median follow-up on patients still alive was 50·3 months (IQR
32.9–68.0)(51·7 mos (IQR 34.7–68.9) on Arm A and
48·1 (IQR31.1–67.0) mos on Arm B).</p>
              <p id="P28">Patient demographics and disease characteristics were well balanced by
treatment Arm and are summarized in <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.
Of the full 1501 randomized patients (749 on arm A with chemotherapy alone and 752
on arm B with the addition of bevacizumab), a majority of the patients were white
and 50% (N=746) were male. Squamous cell histology was reported for
28% (N=422) of patients (29% (N= 216) Arm A and
27% (N=206) Arm B). The largest proportion of patients (44%,
N=636) had stage II disease with 26% (N=383) stage IB and
30% (N=439) stage IIIA. The vast majority of patients were treated
with a lobectomy (77% (N=577/749) Arm A, 74% (N=557)
Arm B) and 11% (N=81) on Arm A had a pneumonectomy compared to
14% (N=103) on Arm B. Systematic lymph node sampling was reported
for 46% (N=689) of patients on trial and a complete mediastinal
lymph node dissection was reported for 46% (N=346) Arm A and
47% (N=355) of Arm B. When compared to data used as stratification
factors, on-study reporting of chemotherapy choice was discordant in
0·7% (10/1500 cases with data); pathologic subtype was discordant in
3·7% (55/1500 cases with data); sex was discordant in
0·5% (8/1501 cases with data); and stage was discordant in
14·1% (206/1458 cases with data).</p>
              <p id="P29">All chemotherapy options were utilized with 25% (N=377) of
patients receiving cisplatin/vinorelbine, 23% (N=343)
cisplatin/docetaxel, 19% (N=283) cisplatin/gemcitabine, and
33% (N=497) cisplatin/pemetrexed. The median number of treatment
cycles was 4 on Arm A (range: 1–4; IQR: 4-4) and 9 on Arm B (range:
1–18; IQR: 4–17) (IQR = Interquartile Range). The majority
of patients on Arm A (81·3%, N=599/737) completed therapy
per protocol (4 cycles or approximately 3 months), however only
36·6% (N=269/735) of patients on Arm B completed all planned
therapy (a total of 12 months of therapy). The number of patients who discontinued
therapy for adverse events on arm A was 62/737 (8.4%) compared to 203/735
(27.6%) on arm B. The remaining patients came off trial for early
progression (N= 7 and 35 on arms A and B respectively), patient decision to
withdraw (N=51/737 (6.9%) and 174/735 (23.7%) on arms A and
B respectively), and other issues such as alternative therapy, and other
complicating disease (N= 27/737 (3.7%) and 54/735 (7.3%) on
arms A and B respectively). In interpreting these results it is critical to bear in
mind that arm A patients were only on therapy for up to 3 months, compared with up
to 12 months with bevacizumab on arm B. All patients who received any therapy were
included in the toxicity analyses (N=1473, 738 on Arm A and 735 on Arm B).
The reporting of grade 1 events was not required per protocol. Reporting of grade 2
events that were unexpected and related was required, but given uncertainty about
expected toxicity with bevacizumab in the adjuvant setting, and the fact that only
arm B patients were considered to be receiving an investigational agent, toxicity
reporting was skewed towards arm B. A table of grade 1 and 2 events that were

creatinine increased and decreased neutrophil count) are expected events with
platinum based chemotherapy. All post-baseline grade 3–5 adverse events of

grade 3–5 adverse events of any attributions are available in the <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental materials</xref> (pages
6–10). Adverse events associated with anti-angiogenic therapy such as
hypertension were more common for patients treated with bevacizumab. Statistically
significantly increased grade 3–5 toxicities of note (all attributions)
included: overall worst grade (ie all grade 3/4/5 toxicities)
(67%(N=496) versus 83%(N=610)); hypertension
(8%(N=60) versus 30%(N=219)), and neutropenia
(33%(N=241) versus 37%(N=275)) on Arms A and B,
respectively. There was no significant difference in deaths while on treatment per
arm (N=15 on arm A and N=19 on arm B) (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">supplemental material</xref> page 11). Of the
15 deaths on arm A, only 3 (thromboembolic event, stroke and sepsis) were considered
at least possibly related to therapy. Of the 19 deaths on arm B, 10 were considered
at least possibly related (multiorgan failure, febrile neutropenia, sudden death,
myocardial infraction, bronchopulmonary hemorrhage, aspiration, bronchopleural
fistula, wound dehiscence, lung infection (N=2)). Other causes of death that
were not considered related were on arm A: atrial fibrillation, death (or sudden
death) NOS (N=6), thromboembolic death, adult respiratory distress syndrome,
other neoplasm, respiratory failure, other cardiac disorder. For arm A the
non-related causes of death were: death NOS (N=5), myocardial infraction,
hypoxia, sepsis, other neoplasm.</p>
              <p id="P30">After the 6<sup>th</sup> planned interim analysis, the independent data
safety and monitoring committee recommended release of the study results since the
repeated confidence interval (A/B) (0·77 – 1·33) barely
included the alternative of interest, and because the estimated conditional power of
the trial was estimated to be 4·1% (standard error =
0·006). At previous interim analyses, early stopping criteria for efficacy
and futility were not met. The results reported here include data after 475 survival
events (241 on Arm A and 234 on Arm B); this represents 70% (475/676) of the
planned full information for the final analysis and is considered the final
analysis. The estimated median OS on Arm A has not been reached; for Arm B it was
85·8 mos (74·9 - NA). The estimated OS hazard ratio (B/A) was
0·99 (95% CI: 0·82–1·19,
p=0·90). <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref> illustrates

subcutaneous and lymph node (n=126, 16%), skeletal (n=113,

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p id="P33">The addition of bevacizumab to four cycles of adjuvant cisplatin based
chemotherapy for resected early stage NSCLC failed to improve OS, the primary
endpoint of this trial. The estimated OS hazard ratio (B/A) was 0·99
(95% CI: 0·82–1·19, p=0·90). Thus,
four cycles of cisplatin based adjuvant chemotherapy remains the standard of care
for patients with resected stage II and IIIA NSCLC and is also considered for many
patients with resected stage IB NSCLC with larger tumors (at least 4 centimeters in
size). Though bevacizumab has improved response rate, PFS, and survival in advanced
non-squamous NSCLC when combined with carboplatin/paclitaxel<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> an OS benefit was not seen when bevacizumab
was combined with other platinum doublets for advanced stage NSCLC, most notably
with cisplatin/gemcitabine in the AVAiL trial.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> The results of E1505 demonstrate that the addition of
bevacizumab to adjuvant chemotherapy failed to improved outcomes in patients with
resected NSCLC, as it has also failed with adjuvant regimens for colon
cancer<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>–<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>, breast cancer<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>, and melanoma.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup></p>
              <p id="P34">The median overall survival of E1505 was 85·6 months for patients on
Arm B and in excess of 85 months for Arm A, although this could change with longer
follow-up (median follow-up not mature). However, these survival results appear to
surpass the median OS of 65·7 months reported in the ANITA adjuvant trial,
which served as our control arm estimate for this trial. The survival difference is
nearly 20 months despite the fact that bevacizumab was not additive, and thus
patients received no other therapeutic intervention beyond that given on ANITA. The
DFS in our trial was 40·6 months on Arm B and 42·9 months on Arm A
versus 36·3 months DFS on the ANITA trial, a difference of 7 months at most.
Thus, the relative OS benefit seen on E1505 is far in excess of the DFS change seen
over time between the two trials. Likely this in part reflects careful selection of
patients with better imaging modalities available to detect more advanced stage
disease prior to resection, and also the availability of more modalities to treat
patients who have recurred or perhaps the use of modern chemotherapy regimens in
this study. Completion of four cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy was higher on E1505
than ANITA, which may also have contributed. Though any comments on why completion
of chemotherapy was higher on E1505 than ANITA is highly speculative, it may be
related to better tolerability of the newer chemotherapeutic options and also to
improved supportive medications. ANITA did also have a slightly higher proportion of
stage IIIA patients (&gt;35% compared to ~30% on E1505) but that was
offset by a high percentage of stage I patients as well (36% on ANITA versus
25% on E1505).</p>
              <p id="P35">The potential reasons behind the lack of survival benefit in early stage
disease with bevacizumab could be attributed to the relatively modest therapeutic
effects of this agent in advanced stage disease, lack of predictive biomarkers for
patient selection, and activation of alternative biological pathways to promote
angiogenesis. Biomarker analyses from tumor samples of patients enrolled to E1505
are planned to understand the biology underlying disease recurrence, and to
determine whether a sensitive subset to bevacizumab could be identified.</p>
              <p id="P36">Limitations of this trial include the prolonged enrollment period, the high
percentage of ineligible patients, and emerging data over the course of the trial
that bevacizumab in subsequent trials in advanced stage NSCLC and in the adjuvant
setting with other malignancies did not perform at the level envisioned based on the
E4599 results. The lack of a biomarker for bevacizumab was another significant
limitation that prevented us from identifying a patient population who may have
benefitted from adjuvant bevacizumab.</p>
              <p id="P37">E1505 was not designed to compare chemotherapy regimens and at this point no
clear differences have emerged yet. However, follow-up is limited particularly with
the cisplatin/pemetrexed group as that regimen was added later in the trial. Longer
follow-up and additional detailed analyses of these data accounting for potential
imbalances in prognostic factors between treatment arms within the subgroups are
needed before any conclusions of an effect of chemotherapy choice on outcomes can be
made. The ongoing JIPANG trial (UMIN000006737) in Japan is randomizing 800 patients
with resected NSCLC to cisplatin/pemetrexed versus cisplatin/vinorelbine and will
provide prospective data to answer the question of whether or not there are
meaningful differences in outcomes with these two chemotherapy doublets. We also did
not find any meaningful differences in subgroup analyses, but hope that as the
molecular analyses and other correlative work with the tissue and blood samples
collected on the trial is completed that it may shed some light on relevant biologic
markers that can help in the better defining which patients are most likely to
benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy.</p>
              <p id="P38">Areas of ongoing research for adjuvant treatment of advanced stage NSCLC
include targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor use in patients with resected NSCLC
harboring an activating mutation in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or
translocation in anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), but this is a small subset of
patients. The PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors nivolumab and pembrolizumab and the PD-L1
inhibitor atezolizumab are approved for the second-line treatment of advanced stage
NSCLC, with recent positive data in first-line metastatic disease for a subset of
patients. Phase III trials are ongoing with each of these agents, as well as similar
check point inhibitors, as adjuvant therapy for resected early stage NSCLC. E1505
provides definitive evidence that bevacizumab should not be used in the adjuvant
setting for resected early stage NSCLC.</p>

                <p id="P40">In developing the study design and protocol, we did a systematic review
of the scientific literature. We searched PubMed, with no time restrictions;
abstracts of major oncology meetings; and trial websites, including
ClinicalTrials.gov, for preclinical data and clinical trials (phase I, II, III)
published in English that assessed patients with non-small-cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) who were treated with adjuvant chemotherapy, and also searched for
studies with bevacizumab in the context of metastatic NSCLC, and in the adjuvant
setting for any malignancy. We used the search terms: lung cancer, NSCLC,
adjuvant chemotherapy, peri-operative chemotherapy, neo-adjuvant chemotherapy,
adjuvant therapy, post-operative chemotherapy, neo-adjuvant chemotherapy,
adjuvant therapy, bevacizumab. Clinical data in support of this trial included
phase 3 trials demonstrating a survival benefit in NSCLC patients who were
treated with adjuvant chemotherapy after surgical resection and phase 3 trials
demonstrating a response rate and progression free survival benefit with the
addition of bevacizumab to platinum doublet chemotherapy in patients with
metastatic NSCLC. An overall survival benefit with the addition of bevacizumab
was demonstrated in the E4599 trial, in which the agent was added to first-line
carboplatin and paclitaxel chemotherapy in patients with metastatic NSCLC. Based
on the survival benefit seen with adjuvant platinum doublet chemotherapy after
surgical resection in early stage NSCLC and the survival benefit seen with the
addition of bevacizumab to platinum doublet chemotherapy in metastatic disease,
we postulated that the addition of bevacizumab to platinum doublet adjuvant
chemotherapy in early stage NSCLC would result in a survival benefit.</p>

                <p id="P42">Our study demonstrated that despite the additive benefit of bevacizumab
to platinum doublet chemotherapy in patients with metastatic lung cancer, no
differences in disease free survival or overall survival were seen on the
bevacizumab arm of this trial in patients with resected early stage NSCLC. We
did not identify any subsets of patients with benefit or any with unexpected
harm with the combination.</p>

                <title>Implications of all the available evidence</title>
                <p id="P44">Based on the results of this trial the use of bevacizumab as a
post-operative adjuvant regimen in patients with NSCLC is not advised. During
the period of time of the study conduct and analysis adjuvant trials of
bevacizumab in other malignancies were reported and were similarly negative for
any benefit in overall survival. The overall outcomes of this trial did
demonstrate an improvement in overall survival compared to historical controls,
reflecting other improvements in lung cancer outcomes for patients with resected
early stage NSCLC.</p>
