                <title>Background and rationale</title>
                <p>Integration of palliative care (PC) into healthcare through early consultation, education, or symptom monitoring and feedback has been associated with better health related quality of life (HRQoL) and longer survival in adult patients [<xref rid="pone.0277212.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0277212.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and their caregivers [<xref rid="pone.0277212.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. A growing number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in this regard led to the American Society for Clinical Oncology’s endorsement of early PC integration for adult patients with metastatic cancer and/or high symptom burden [<xref rid="pone.0277212.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. International and national organizations also have called for early PC integration for children [<xref rid="pone.0277212.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0277212.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, in a recently published systematic review we did not identify any RCTs that evaluated whether specialized PC improves child and family outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0277212.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Evidence in favor of pediatric PC mostly comes from non-experimental studies [<xref rid="pone.0277212.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0277212.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and a few RCTs focusing on selected aspects of care [<xref rid="pone.0277212.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0277212.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Children and teens with advanced cancer endure a high degree of suffering [<xref rid="pone.0277212.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0277212.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] linked to impaired patient [<xref rid="pone.0277212.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0277212.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and family [<xref rid="pone.0277212.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0277212.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] survivorship experience [<xref rid="pone.0277212.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0277212.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0277212.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0277212.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0277212.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Yet, PC integration is highly variable in terms of availability [<xref rid="pone.0277212.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0277212.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], frequency and timing of PC referrals [<xref rid="pone.0277212.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0277212.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and limited by primary oncologist and family beliefs [<xref rid="pone.0277212.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p>
                <p>In prior work, we identified substantial child suffering from cancer-directed therapies and symptoms [<xref rid="pone.0277212.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0277212.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0277212.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. These findings led to conducting a pilot RCT (the <underline>Pedi</underline>atric <underline>Qu</underline>ality of Life and <underline>E</underline>valuation of <underline>S</underline>ymptoms <underline>T</underline>echnology (PediQUEST) Study) to evaluate a primary PC intervention consisting of providing symptom and HRQoL data to families and clinicians (collected with an electronic-patient reported outcomes (e-PROMs) system, PediQUEST) [<xref rid="pone.0277212.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The study showed that: (i) collecting e-PROMs in these children was feasible [<xref rid="pone.0277212.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]; (ii) symptom burden was high [<xref rid="pone.0277212.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]; (iii) PediQUEST reports increased awareness about distress; and (iv) symptom distress and HRQoL improved although not significantly [<xref rid="pone.0277212.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p>
                <p>As a next step, we developed the PediQUEST <underline>Res</underline>ponse to the <underline>P</underline>ediatric <underline>O</underline>ncology <underline>S</underline>ymptom <underline>E</underline>xperience (PediQUEST/PQ Response) intervention, a strengthened intervention that combines the use of a modernized PediQUEST system and App with early specialized PC intervention for children, adolescents, and young adults (AYAs) with advanced cancer. During the formative research work, we explored barriers and facilitators of the symptom management process and identified that patients, parents, and providers accepted symptoms and suffering as inherent to cancer and its treatment, a pervasive phenomenon that we refer to as “normalization” [<xref rid="pone.0277212.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. This finding led us to focus the PediQUEST Response intervention on activation of both providers and families. We present here the study protocol for a RCT that will assess the effectiveness of the PediQUEST Response intervention. Changes in enrollment and intervention delivery procedures due to the COVID-19 pandemic will be noted when apropriate.</p>

                <sec id="sec022">
                  <title>PQ web system (Surveys + Reports + email)</title>
                  <p>The PQ web system can be accessed through any electronic device via web or mobile application (App). Families assigned to the intervention have access to the full PQ system which consists of: (a) <italic toggle="yes">PQ-Surveys</italic>: measuring symptom burden and HRQoL. Surveys are automatically assigned on a weekly basis to all parents and children (if ≥5 years old); automated reminders are sent daily for two days; after 48 hours, unanswered or incomplete surveys are auto-submitted; (b) <italic toggle="yes">PQ-feedback report</italic>: generated automatically when PQ Surveys are answered. Provides a graphic summary by respondent (child and/or parent) of up to three-months of patient HRQOL and symptom scores and distress level for each symptom. A summary section compares current findings to prior survey; (c) <italic toggle="yes">PQ emails/notifications</italic>: a pdf of the report is automatically emailed—and made available through the App—to designated recipients, including the child if &gt; 8 years old, parents, primary oncology team (including doctor, nurse practitioner and psychosocial clinician), and a designated PC team member, usually a nurse practitioner. PQ reports are the vehicle for a patient-mediated activation of the symptom management process.</p>
                  <p><bold>Early Integration of the PC (Response) team</bold>: Integrated PC is provided through clinicians who typically provide PC consultation in the institution and serve as the “Response team.” All participating Response teams receive an in-person 2-half day intervention-specific training before the study opened at each site. Recommended activities for Response team involvement are described in <xref rid="pone.0277212.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref> and include an <underline>initial in person or virtual (added after March 2020) consultation</underline> with the family within 3 weeks of randomization followed by <underline>phone, videoconference or in person contacts</underline> with the family: (i) on a regular basis over the intervention period (we encourage monthly encounters), (ii) to respond to PQ reports if distress is noted, and (iii) to monitor treatment recommendations. The goal is to <italic toggle="yes">provide interdisciplinary consultative care focused on symptom and HRQoL assessment</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">prevention</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">and treatment</italic> that can be delivered directly or through primary team clinicians. Ultimately, the primary oncology team (P.O.T.) <italic toggle="yes">holds the decision to implement recommendations</italic>. All communications and visits are documented in the patient medical record. Response teams are expected to maintain ongoing and direct communication with the P.O.T. throughout the follow-up period. Once the proposed follow-up is completed, participants in the intervention arm are offered the opportunity to continue being followed by the PC team. In addition, a study listserv including an interdisciplinary roster of national PC experts is available to all Response team members to ask for symptom management advice. PQ Response listserv member guidelines follow the American Academy of Pediatrics—Pediatric Hospice and Palliative Medicine (PHPM) LISTSERV® posting guidelines and the American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine “Connect” Access Agreement.</p>

Participants assigned to the usual cancer care arm receive the usual cancer care provided by participating sites and are required to complete PediQUEST surveys, but no reports are generated. These patients may receive regular PC consultations following the site’s usual referral procedures.</p>
                  <p><italic toggle="yes">Rationale for choice of comparator group</italic>: The goal of this study is to evaluate whether PediQUEST Response can improve current practice. For this reason, we chose a “usual cancer care” control group, which we hope represents the care that patients and families receive on a day-to-day basis. We are aware that this choice involves some potential for bias, as patients and providers may become influenced as the trial develops. However, we believe the risk for bias is low and we are taking some actions to minimize this risk (see <xref rid="sec038" ref-type="sec">Discussion</xref>).</p>
                  <p><italic toggle="yes">Adherence</italic>. Intervention fidelity is monitored following NIH Behavior Change Consortium’s recommendations [<xref rid="pone.0277212.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Indicators include successful provider training, Response teams’ adherence to study procedures, and participants’ adherence (<xref rid="pone.0277212.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">Response teams’ adherence</italic> to intervention delivery is promoted during the initial training session and thereafter, during their regular meetings with local PIs. Participant PC teams receive a monetary incentive per subject assigned to the intervention. To monitor Response team’s adherence, we regularly collect PC notes on intervention arm participants and triangulate them with distress episodes reported through PediQUEST, intervention delivery metrics (e.g., number of PC encounters), and use of listserv. This compiled information is shared with the sites one time during recruitment after at least 10 patients receive the intervention (or one year has elapsed since starting recruitment) to monitor and improve intervention delivery. <italic toggle="yes">Participants’ adherence</italic> to study procedures is facilitated by a relatively short follow-up, PQ system automated reminders, and study team close monitoring of survey response. Participants who miss surveys are contacted by the RCs to identify difficulties and willingness to continue participation. If either parent or child misses four consecutive PediQUEST surveys, the dyad will be removed from the study (eliminated). Rare exceptions to this criterion may be granted at the discretion of the PI and PM. <italic toggle="yes">Qualitative fidelity evaluation</italic>: Patients and parents, and a convenient sample of providers are invited to participate in <italic toggle="yes">exit interviews</italic> to talk about their experience with the study and provide more details about intervention delivery.</p>

                    <italic toggle="yes">Sample Size and Power Considerations</italic>
                  </p>
                  <p>Based on prior work [<xref rid="pone.0277212.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], we estimate that there will be approximately 32 eligible patients/site/year, representing a total of 288 eligible patients available for recruitment over the 36 months of the study. Pilot data suggest an enrollment rate of 70% which translates into approximately <italic toggle="yes">200 patient-parent dyads</italic>, our <italic toggle="yes">enrollment target</italic>. If 25% are non-responders, a conservative estimate based on pilot data, 150 patients will be randomized (n = 75/arm). We expect an attrition of approximately 10%, mainly due to dropouts, which will lead to complete data on <italic toggle="yes">a minimum of 136 dyads</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">68 per group</italic>. Although the sample size is mainly driven by pragmatic considerations (target population is small), power calculations were conducted and indicate that our sample size of 68 children per group provide sufficient power (≥80%) for both primary and secondary outcomes for clinically meaningful effect sizes. For patient-level and parent distress outcomes power estimates are conservative because they only use one observation per subject (average across time) without accounting for the repeated measures within subject. For parent-level outcomes (distress and activation) we report the power to detect moderate to large effect sizes. Power calculations are based on two sample independent one-side tests, α = 0.05 unless otherwise specified.</p>
                  <p><italic toggle="yes">Power calculation for patient-level outcomes (HRQoL (primary) and Symptom (secondary))</italic>: Standard deviations were estimated using data from our PQ study (39 weeks follow up, surveys answered when attending clinic or once a month) [<xref rid="pone.0277212.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. For each child, we identified all 16-weeks periods with ≥6 surveys and calculated PedsQL and PQ-MSAS mean total scores for each 16-weeks period. We randomly selected one period per child and estimated the standard deviation (SD) of 16-weeks PedsQL and PQ-MSAS means. This strategy was repeated 10 times and a pooled estimate was calculated. A sample of 136 children (68 per group) achieves 85% power to detect a 4.4-point increase minimal clinically important difference (MCID) in the mean over 16-weeks PedsQL total score (SD = 9.5, for both groups), and a 95% power to detect a 3-point decrease in mean over 16-weeks PQ-MSAS total score (SD = 5.3). Power calculations are conservative as the SD estimates are based on mixed responses from parents and children, while in the current proposal responses from different informants will be considered in separate analyses and are expected to have less variability.</p>
                  <p><italic toggle="yes">Power calculation for parent-level outcomes–Parent distress (Parental anxiety (S-TAI-State)</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">and depressive symptoms (CES-D-10)</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">secondary outcomes)</italic>: A sample of 68 parents per group achieves &gt; 80% power to detect a moderate effect size (Cohen’s d = 0.43). For example, this effect size corresponds to a difference of 5.2 points in mean S-TAI-State (SD = 12.2) [<xref rid="pone.0277212.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p>
                  <p><italic toggle="yes">Power calculation for parent level outcomes—Family Activation</italic> (<italic toggle="yes">secondary outcomes</italic>): Change in outcome level between baseline and 16-weeks: the target sample size achieves 80% power to detect an effect size of 0.5 in any of the coping scale scores. This effect size corresponds, for example, to a score change of 0.75 points between baseline and 16-weeks (SD = 1.5, consistent with literature reports) [<xref rid="pone.0277212.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The sample size has 82% power to detect a mean increase of 2 encounters with psychosocial clinicians between trial arms across 16-weeks (SD = 4.5, from prior PQ Study). Finally, for mean number of complementary therapies used for symptom treatment over 16-weeks, our sample size has 80% power to detect an effect size of 0.43.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Research coordinators (RCs) at each center regularly review clinic rosters, e-mail sign outs, attend clinic or tumor board conferences. All patients ≥ 2 years old AND seen by the outpatient oncology clinic or inpatient oncology service (base population) are entered into a <italic toggle="yes">pool list excel file</italic> that has automated fields allowing for a quick pre-screening process. For all patients pre-screened as potentially eligible, RCs further review the medical chart to determine eligibility and have eligibility validated by the local PIs (or designated investigator). If a patient is eligible, the RC sends an email to the primary oncology provider informing them that the patient will be invited to enroll unless the provider opts the patient out. The entire process is registered in a REDCap-based screening and tracking system [<xref rid="pone.0277212.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] that includes automated steps such as emails and reminders to prevent the inadvertent loss of potential participants. Initially, we approached families in person at the clinic or ward. In March 2020, because of the COVID-19 pandemic, enrollment was halted for three months in compliance with sites regulations. Enrollment resumed between June and October 2020 at the sites. Due to COVID restrictions, we added a virtual enrollment option consisting of an initial email followed by a videoconference or phone meeting to hold the enrollment conversation with interested families.</p>
                  <p>Strategies to enhance recruitment include in-service sessions with providers to reduce potential gatekeeping, a direct family approach, flexibility in scheduling recruitment interviews, and working with experienced RCs. In addition, it is expected that the study’s relatively short duration, RCs facilitation of PediQUEST web’s registration and close monitoring throughout the study, and the small non-monetary incentives ($40 USD monthly gift cards for the patient and participating parent), boost recruitment and retention.</p>

                <title>Assignment of interventions (allocation and blinding)</title>
                <p>Participants are randomly assigned to the intervention or control group with a 1:1 allocation as per a computer-generated randomization sequence created by the study statistician, and stratified by site, age (2–7, 8–12, ≥13 years old), and type of cancer (hematological, non-hematological malignancies). Random sequences are embedded in REDCap by informatics personnel and concealed to research staff. After the run-in period, if the dyad is classified as being a responder, study arm assignment becomes visible to RC in REDCap. After randomization, participants, PC team, oncologists, and research staff are unblinded to group assignment, because the intervention is not amenable for blinding.</p>

Children aged 2 to 4 years old do not answer any questionnaires and children 5 to 7 years old only answer the HRQoL questionnaire; 7-year-olds also respond to the PQ-MSAS which is read out loud by their parents. All parents answer proxy versions of the questionnaires. Participants without home internet (estimated at &lt;10%) are provided a tablet with cellular service during their participation in the study.</p>

                  <p>All statistical analysis will be conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. Baseline characteristics will be described and compared between groups using summary measures (e.g., means, medians, rates) and tests selected based on variable distribution. Analyses will be adjusted for factors used in the stratified randomization (site, age group and type of cancer). In addition, if, despite efforts to standardize intervention delivery, we identify substantial differences in fidelity across sites, we will evaluate effect modification by site including the site × intervention interaction in the models. The False Discovery Rate criterion will be used to correct for multiple testing in non-planned analyses. <italic toggle="yes">Considerations regarding missing data</italic>: For outcomes in which missing completely at random is a plausible assumption, we will use complete case analysis. If missing at random is highly likely, we will use multiple imputation or inverse probability weighting, depending on the statistical model being considered. If not, we will use sensitivity analyses. Robustness of the estimates to missing data assumptions will be assessed.</p>

The effect of the intervention on child quality of life and symptom burden outcomes will be estimated using mixed linear models, with patient as a random effect and group, time (categorical) and group x time interaction and the stratification factors as fixed effects. Treatment success will be defined as a mean difference between groups of at least 4.4 points, the MCID for PedsQL [<xref rid="pone.0277212.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].

The same analytical approach described for patient-level outcomes will be followed to analyze parent S-TAI-State, CES-D-10 mean scores and aRSQ symptom-related scores. In S-TAI-State analysis, we will additionally adjust for baseline S-TAI-Trait score. We will also compare depressive symptoms (CES-D-10 ≥10) over time between the two groups using generalized linear mixed models with logit link and binomial distribution. As (parent) gender is a predictor of these outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0277212.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], it will be included in these models if imbalanced between arms.</p>
                  <p><italic toggle="yes">Comparison of parent-level outcomes</italic>: <italic toggle="yes">family activation</italic>.

Link and distribution for these models will be defined based on the distribution of the outcome variable. We will explore whether change in parent’s activation score is modified by parent/child characteristics (e.g., parent’s gender, S-TAI-Trait, CES-D-10 scores; and child’s diagnosis, among others) including the corresponding interaction terms.</p>
                  <p><italic toggle="yes">Additional Analyses</italic>. We will also conduct a thorough process evaluation triangulating (a) intervention fidelity indicators (<xref rid="pone.0277212.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>); and (b) exit interviews to better understand whether and how processes were influenced by (or influenced) the intervention. Quantitative data will be reported using descriptive techniques. Qualitative data will be transcribed verbatim, personal identifiers removed, and coded using an inductive, open, and iterative coding strategy to fit the data. Once consensus is reached, a coding dictionary will be developed, and the data recoded independently by two researchers. There will be two analysis levels: 1. individual and 2. cross-case analysis (i.e., grouped by age and site).

                  <p>Finally, and depending on the results of the main analysis, we will also conduct a series of exploratory analyses including assessing parent activation as a mediator in the intervention effect on patient’s HRQoL, evaluating age as a potential effect modifier, and, if sample size permits, a subgroup analysis of PQ-Response effects on symptom burden as reported by children aged 7–12 years.</p>

                  <p>This is a small multisite clinical trial of a supportive care intervention with a risk profile that is comparable to usual cancer care. As such, data monitoring is primarily carried out by the Study Data Center (SDC) at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and a small Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) consisting of 5-members representing different disciplines and expertise (three members are unrelated to the study and act as Independent Monitors). The DSMB holds quarterly conference calls to provide input and guidance on participant’s accrual, retention and safety, data quality, compliance issues, intervention fidelity, and protocol deviations or violations. A blinded primary end-point interim analysis was conducted by the study statistician at 12 and 24 months after the study opened primarily to analyze data variability. The DSMB will present recommendations to the Steering Committee as appropriate.</p>

Study brochures and informed permission/assent document contain all the required elements of informed consent including the purpose of the study and procedures, and potential risks and benefits of participation. The forms are available in English and Spanish. Interpreters are used to aid with the consent process for Spanish speaking families if needed. At least one parent is asked to review and sign the informed permission/assent documents covering the patient’s participation. For children between 5 and 9 years of age the study brochure is considered the assent document and verbal assent is sought whenever possible and if developmentally appropriate. Children and adolescents between 10 and 17 years of age are invited to review and sign a developmentally adapted assent document (there are two assent documents, one for 10–12 years old and one for teenagers). Patients ≥18 years old are invited to review and provide written consent covering their participation. A separate consent document covers caregiver’s participation. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, four IRBs allowed verbal in place of written documentation of consent/assent.</p>

The Steering Committee will make recommendations regarding when and what material should be submitted for publication. Each paper will be reviewed and approved by the SC members prior to submission. The SC will work to reduce the interval between end of data collection and release of the study results. We expect to take about 4 to 6 months to compile and submit the main paper. Study results will be released to the participating physicians and referring physicians through publications in peer-reviewed journals, conference abstracts, and oral presentations, whereas specific materials will be produced to disseminate results among study participants and the general public. Results will also be available in clinicaltrials.gov.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>This study will examine whether PQ-Response, an intervention that combines the collection and feedback of e-PROMS with integration of PC in the care of children/AYAs with advanced cancer, improves child and parent distress. It will be one of the first RCTs to study the effectiveness of early integration of PC in children/AYAs.</p>
              <sec id="sec039">
                <title>Study rationale</title>
                <p>The study is designed with a strong pragmatic [<xref rid="pone.0277212.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] emphasis: we use existing PC clinicians to deliver the intervention, do not require extra visits, and have chosen outcomes that are highly relevant to participants. We expect this design will help understand how to integrate pediatric PC services in real life settings.</p>
                <p><italic toggle="yes">Intervention’s “dose</italic>,<italic toggle="yes">” frequency</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">and administration</italic>: <italic toggle="yes">Weekly PQ-Surveys</italic>: Survey frequency was decided based on pragmatic reasons. Clinically, the weekly timeframe is practical to both to capture distress in real time (longer periods may affect recall) and to allow the Response teams to intervene and propose preventive strategies if symptoms are recurrent. Adherence to weekly surveys was good during the pilot study (manuscript in preparation). We considered allowing for survey completion on an “as needed” basis, to better capture acute distress, however, this approach was considered challenging for controls who may have less incentive to report. <italic toggle="yes">Response team intervention</italic>: Regular contacts are proposed as a means of standardizing the intervention across patients with varying experiences of distress. During training we also provided keys to interpreting PQ reports and scores to promote optimal Response team intervention. Further, this approach helps standardize the response to distress and increases replicability of the intervention.</p>
                <p><italic toggle="yes">Why use parent and patient reports to measure patient outcomes</italic>? While self-report remains the gold-standard for patient HRQoL and symptom burden outcomes, there is an increasing body of evidence suggesting that there is value in having both parent and child/AYAs reports [<xref rid="pone.0277212.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] as each provide a unique perspective [<xref rid="pone.0277212.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Together, these reports provide a broader picture of the child/AYAs’ situation [<xref rid="pone.0277212.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Yet, one of the consequences of using “multiple informants” [<xref rid="pone.0277212.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] is that the information may be non-concordant (divergent) [<xref rid="pone.0277212.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0277212.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. The optimal approach to consolidate multiple informant responses into a unique child/AYAs outcome is still unresolved [<xref rid="pone.0277212.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Acknowledging the clinical importance of considering both “voices” (i.e. patient and parent), we measure patient outcomes (HRQoL and symptom burden) using both reporters. The chosen instruments allow parental report across the study’s full age range, and patient self-report from the age of five for HRQoL, and 7 for symptom burden. Of note, because the younger child version of PQ-MSAS for ages 7–12 does not measure the full range of symptoms we will not use it as an outcome measure, rather it is used as part of the intervention and for exploratory purposes. Given the lack of consensus as to how to handle multiple informant information, the effects of the intervention on patient outcomes will be analyzed separately for each of these informants.</p>

                <title>Anticipated problems and solutions</title>
                <p>Anticipated potential problems may include <italic toggle="yes">failure to meet sample target</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">high attrition</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">contamination</italic> in usual care arm, <italic toggle="yes">feasibility</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">social desirability bias</italic>. Given the strategies presented earlier, we expect strong recruitment rates. From prior experience, attrition due to death and drop-out are expected to be low and were accounted for in sample size calculations. However, we are collecting socio-demographic data and reasons for dropout or elimination to better understand recruitment and attrition drivers. As we successfully did in prior studies [<xref rid="pone.0277212.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], PI and Co-Is closely monitor recruitment and retention rates and characteristics. When concern arises, we revise strategies together and problem solve. Contamination risk is expected to be very low. Even so, we will evaluate the proportion of clinicians who provided care to trial participants in both arms and evaluate behavior shifts during exit interviews, to understand whether contamination was an issue. We believe that the PQ Response intervention is highly feasible: (a) It builds on our prior successful research work; (b) all participating sites have long-standing working relationships and very similar oncology care and PC team approaches; and, (c) the intervention has been carefully piloted and suggests feasibility. Social desirability bias is a common issue in un-blinded studies. We plan to minimize this risk by not emphasizing the specific outcomes we are targeting, and by careful training and supervision of RCs.</p>

              <p>Additional Editor Comments:</p>
              <p>The study reports the protocol of testing an early palliative care intervention in children with advanced cancer. The topic is very important and will have great clinical implications. I agree with the reviewer that there are some minor points for clarifications. Overall, the RCT is well-designed.</p>

                <bold>Comments to the Author</bold>
              </p>
              <p>1. Does the manuscript provide a valid rationale for the proposed study, with clearly identified and justified research questions?</p>
              <p>The research question outlined is expected to address a valid academic problem or topic and contribute to the base of knowledge in the field.<!-- </font> --></p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
              <p>**********</p>
              <p><!-- <font color="black"> -->2. Is the protocol technically sound and planned in a manner that will lead to a meaningful outcome and allow testing the stated hypotheses?</p>
              <p>The manuscript should describe the methods in sufficient detail to prevent undisclosed flexibility in the experimental procedure or analysis pipeline, including sufficient outcome-neutral conditions (e.g. necessary controls, absence of floor or ceiling effects) to test the proposed hypotheses and a statistical power analysis where applicable. As there may be aspects of the methodology and analysis which can only be refined once the work is undertaken, authors should outline potential assumptions and explicitly describe what aspects of the proposed analyses, if any, are exploratory.<!-- </font> --></p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
              <p>**********</p>
              <p><!-- <font color="black"> -->3. Is the methodology feasible and described in sufficient detail to allow the work to be replicable?</p>
              <p>Descriptions of methods and materials in the protocol should be reported in sufficient detail for another researcher to reproduce all experiments and analyses. The protocol should describe the appropriate controls, sample size calculations, and replication needed to ensure that the data are robust and reproducible.<!-- </font> --></p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>

              <p><!-- <font color="black"> -->4. Have the authors described where all data underlying the findings will be made available when the study is complete?</p>
              <p>The <ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/materials-and-software-sharing" ext-link-type="uri">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception, at the time of publication. The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data—e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party—those must be specified.<!-- </font> --></p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
              <p>**********</p>
              <p><!-- <font color="black"> -->5. Is the manuscript presented in an intelligible fashion and written in standard English?</p>
              <p>PLOS ONE does not copyedit accepted manuscripts, so the language in submitted articles must be clear, correct, and unambiguous. Any typographical or grammatical errors should be corrected at revision, so please note any specific errors here.<!-- </font> --></p>

You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about research or publication ethics.</p>

              <p>Reviewer #1: This study protocol for the PediQUEST Response Study is exemplary in its description of the study protocol. There is a clear, comprehensive, and sophisticated data analytic plan. A good rationale is provided for how to handle multiple informant information. Likewise, a reasonable discussion of contamination risk and the plan to address it.</p>
              <p>I have only a few minor suggestions to make.</p>
              <p>Page 8 line 161 Please name the 5 study sites.</p>
              <p>Page 20 line 450 Mention Certificate of Confidentiality from NIH as another protection against breaches to confidentiality.</p>
