                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Behavioural parent training (BPT) programmes are effective in preventing and treating early-onset conduct problems and child maltreatment. Unfortunately, pervasive mental health service disparities continue to limit access to and engagement in these interventions. Furthermore, challenges with parental engagement can impede the successful implementation of evidence-based practices (EBPs) in community settings that serve low-income, ethnic minority families. Lay health workers (LHWs)—individuals without formal mental health training—represent an important workforce to increase engagement, as they are members of the communities they serve. However, the mobilisation of LHWs has not been well studied as an implementation strategy to extend the reach or effectiveness of EBPs in the USA. LHW-delivered implementation interventions that specifically support the engagement of Latinx parents in evidence-based BPT programmes have the potential to improve clinical and implementation outcomes.</p>

                  <p>A community-partnered approach will use the Quality Implementation Framework (QIF) to tailor and implement an LHW-delivered implementation intervention that aims to promote Latinx parent engagement in BPT programmes. Steps from the QIF will guide study activities to (1) conduct a mixed methods needs assessment to fit the implementation intervention to the local context, (2) adapt LHW-delivered implementation strategies to promote parent access to and engagement in Parent-Child Interaction Therapy and (3) conduct a hybrid effectiveness-implementation pilot trial to examine the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary effectiveness of the LHW implementation intervention at increasing engagement.</p>

              <p>Early-onset conduct problems and child maltreatment have been shown to have enormous personal and societal costs, including long-term mental health and substance abuse problems, higher service utilisation and future abuse against women and children.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1–3</xref> Given that behavioural parent training (BPT) programmes have been shown to be effective at preventing and treating both child maltreatment<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> and conduct problems<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> for racially and ethnically diverse families,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 7</xref> large systems of care have invested millions of dollars in the implementation of these interventions.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 9</xref> Even with major implementation efforts, challenges remain with engagement and retention of families in BPT programmes.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 11</xref> A systematic review of engagement in BPT programmes found that at least 25% of families that are appropriate for BPT programmes do not enrol in treatment, and an additional 26% begin, but then drop out of treatment, with higher rates of attrition for low-socioeconomic status families.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> In fact, in community implementation of BPT programmes, attrition rates can exceed 65%.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13–15</xref></p>
              <p>The consequences of poor participation in BPT programmes are significant. Families who drop out of treatment are less likely to experience improvements in parenting skills or child disruptive behaviours.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Moreover, failed efforts to recruit and retain parents are costly for providers.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Frequent cancellations and no-shows leads to fewer billable hours for community agencies, which are often under immense financial pressure.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17 18</xref> Further, inadequate referrals negatively impact the implementation of evidence-based practice (EBP), as therapists may not learn to deliver the practice with fidelity.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 9 19</xref> Challenges with engagement may be especially pronounced for racial and ethnic minority families, as mental health service disparities have been well documented.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> For example, African–American and Latinx children are almost 50% less likely than non-Latinx, white children to receive treatment for externalising disorders.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p>
              <p>In order to meet the public health potential of BPT programmes and address service disparities, implementation interventions are needed to support parental engagement for ethnic minority parents. Implementation interventions, which are usually complex and multilevel, include strategies to enhance the adoption and ongoing implementation of clinical interventions at the organisation, provider and consumer levels.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Multiple implementation strategies have been identified that focus on increasing consumer engagement with EBPs, including (1) increasing demand for EBPs, (2) intervening with consumers to enhance uptake and adherence and (3) preparing consumers to be active participants in treatment.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> These implementation strategies are consistent with evidence-based approaches to improve engagement in children’s mental healthcare, which include assessment of barriers, accessibility promotion, psychoeducation about services and appointment reminders.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24 25</xref></p>

                <title>Addressing mental health service disparities</title>
                <p>Lay health workers (LHWs) may be especially well positioned to deliver consumer-facing implementation strategies focused on addressing service disparities for underserved, low-resource communities.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> LHWs, which include a range of terms, including <italic>promotores</italic>, family peer advocates and wellness navigators, are individuals without formal mental health training, who have roles intended to increase their community’s access to and benefit from services.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27 28</xref> LHWs have the potential to address both demand and supply drivers of disparities in EBP delivery.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Demand for EBPs is impacted by an individual’s mental health literacy, stigma towards mental illness and help seeking, perceptions of treatment providers and culturally based beliefs and preferences.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29 30</xref> Systemic barriers to care may exacerbate disparities in accessing care. For example, undocumented immigrants are especially unlikely to seek mental health services due to fear of being reported to authorities.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Since LHWs come from similar cultural and personal backgrounds as the individuals they serve, they may be especially adept at helping patients overcome distrust of health systems.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></p>
                <p>Regarding supply, the number of professional mental health providers who can deliver linguistically and culturally competent EBPs is inadequate.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> The majority of mental health research with LHWs has been conducted in low-income and middle-income countries, with emerging evidence that LHWs can improve mental health outcomes when they are tasked with delivering EBPs.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28 34 35</xref> Although LHWs have successfully delivered BPT programmes as prevention interventions in high-income countries, using a task-shifting model,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36–38</xref> licensure and certification requirements frequently restrict EBP delivery to professionals in mental health settings.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Therefore, LHWs in the USA may need to have complementary and distinct roles within the provision of EBPs.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 26</xref> For example, if LHWs delivered auxiliary engagement services (eg, outreach and case management), it could reduce the burden on bilingual and bicultural mental health professionals and allow them to focus on activities that require advanced training and licensure, such as providing EBPs for more clients.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19 39</xref></p>
                <p>One example of an LHW-delivered engagement programme is the Parent Empowerment Programme (PEP), which trains family peer advocates to work with parents to address their children’s mental health needs and overcome barriers to care.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40 41</xref> The majority of research on PEP has focused on evaluating the training of family peer advocates, as opposed to investigating the impact of the model on clinical outcomes for families, service utilisation or engagement in EBPs.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40–43</xref> One randomised control trial evaluated the impact of PEP for black and Latinx parents of children with autism. Parents who received PEP had significantly lower stress than parents who received treatment as usual. However, there were no group differences for service utilisation. The researchers advocated that future research on programmes such as PEP should include non-English-speaking families, who may have higher levels of need, and use qualitative research to better understand the strengths and areas of improvement for the model.<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> The proposed study follows these recommendations through the development and evaluation of LHWs Enhancing Engagement for Parents (LEEP), an implementation intervention to improve engagement for low-income, Latinx parents into one BPT programme, Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT).<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> LEEP seeks to follow recommendations by Chacko and colleagues<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> based on their systematic review of parental engagement in BPT programmes by ‘preparing parents for BPT, addressing practical barriers to engagement, assisting in aligning parent’s involvement with their own goals for treatment’ (p. 211) in order to impact initial and ongoing engagement in PCIT.</p>

                <p>PCIT has unique benefits and challenges related to engaging parents in treatment. The treatment model uses in vivo feedback to overcome challenges that are inherent to teaching methods used in other BPT programmes (eg, didactics, discussion) as it necessitates active participation and assesses learning in real time. PCIT requires that parents demonstrate a high level of proficiency with the targeted parenting skills before they advance from the first phase of treatment, which focuses on enhancing the parent-child relationship, to the second phase of treatment, which teaches effective and developmentally appropriate limit setting and discipline approaches, and then until they graduate from treatment.<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> Mastery-based criteria guarantee that all parents can successfully use the skills; however, parents often drop out before they learn the full range of parenting skills needed to decrease disruptive behaviours.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13 16</xref> Furthermore, some research suggests that low-income, ethnic minority parents require more practice and time in treatment to reach this level of skill proficiency.<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46–48</xref> Extended treatment length can lead to long waitlists and fewer families seen in PCIT.<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> Further, problems with attendance, retention and prolonged skill acquisition have downstream effects on PCIT provider implementation outcomes. Clinicians can take up to 3 years to meet PCIT certification requirements (ie, achieving fidelity and graduating two cases).<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> Thus, low parental engagement results in provider attrition from training, which in turn compromises the sustainability of the intervention and limits the return on costly investments made to implement PCIT in public service systems.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 9</xref></p>
                <p>LEEP seeks to improve the supply of and demand for PCIT in agencies that predominately serve low-income, Latinx immigrant families, and address engagement challenges that impact clinical and implementation outcomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>). PCIT is widely implemented in community settings, including in the county where the current study is being conducted. LEEP includes LHW-delivered implementation strategies to increase caregiver engagement as an extension of PCIT services, which will be provided by the licensed mental health professionals. LEEP will be compared with PCIT implementation-as-usual to see if parental engagement and implementation challenges are ameliorated. A community-partnered approach will focus on making LEEP a feasible and acceptable implementation intervention, with the following aims.</p>

Phase 2 in the QIF focuses on the development of implementation structures, which will occur during the second aim with the input of a community-advisory group. The community-advisory group will collaboratively help to develop an implementation plan delineating tasks and timelines to establish infrastructure for LHW capacity building, including job descriptions and training plans. Phase 3 of the QIF includes three main activities that will take place during a hybrid type 2 effectiveness-implementation pilot stepped-wedge trial of LEEP. These activities include (1) providing implementation support strategies (eg, supervision and consultation) to LHWs, (2) conducting a process evaluation to identify successes and barriers to implementation and (3) providing ongoing feedback to organisations about the impact LEEP is having on service outcomes. Finally, aim 3 activities will inform phase 4 of the QIF, which focuses on learning from initial implementation experiences to inform future efforts to scale-up and sustain LEEP.</p>

                    <p>To measure changes in LHW knowledge, perceptions of acceptability and feasibility of PCIT, and competence, LHW will complete pre-self-report and post-self-report and behavioural measures (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>). Ongoing fidelity monitoring will be conducted throughout LHW’s delivery of LEEP. Fidelity monitoring will include reviewing data capture of the ebook created for LEEP, which will include videos about PCIT and scripts for the LHWs to use with the families they serve. LHWs will also audio record their sessions to monitor fidelity to the LEEP model.</p>

Although LHWs have been identified as an important workforce to address mental health disparities, limited research has evaluated the best strategies to mobilise them to support EBP implementation in the USA.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> As a pilot study, findings will be limited in power and generalisability. However, the exploratory and development work in this study will provide data on the feasibility and acceptability of LEEP and its preliminary impact on client recruitment, adherence and retention in PCIT, which will inform future scaling-up of the model.</p>
