              <abstract>
                <p>There is a major need for new adjuvants to improve the efficacy of seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccines. Advax is a novel polysaccharide adjuvant based on delta inulin that has been shown to enhance the immunogenicity of influenza vaccine in animal models and human clinical trials. To better understand the mechanism for this enhancement, we sought to assess its effect on the plasmablast response in human subjects. This pilot study utilised cryopreserved 7 day post-vaccination (7dpv) peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples obtained from a subset of 25 adult subjects from the FLU006-12 trial who had been immunized intramuscularly with a standard dose of 2012 trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) alone (n=9 subjects) or combined with 5mg (n=8) or 10mg (n=8) of Advax adjuvant. Subjects receiving Advax adjuvant had increased 7dpv plasmablasts, which in turn exhibited a 2-3 fold higher rate of non-silent mutations in the B-cell receptor CDR3 region associated with higher expression of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), the major enzyme controlling BCR affinity maturation. Together, these data suggest that Advax adjuvant enhances influenza immunity in immunized subjects via multiple mechanisms including increased plasmablast generation, AID expression and CDR3 mutagenesis resulting in enhanced BCR affinity maturation and increased production of high avidity antibody. How Advax adjuvant achieves these beneficial effects on plasmablasts remains the subject of ongoing investigation.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Poor vaccine immunogenicity remains a major challenge in influenza vaccine development. Adjuvants are able to enhance vaccine immunogenicity and thereby increase influenza protection in low responder populations (reviewed in [<xref rid="pone.0132003.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]). Nevertheless, the widespread adoption of adjuvants in influenza vaccines has been slow due to safety concerns of oil emulsion adjuvants [<xref rid="pone.0132003.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0132003.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and poor understanding of how such adjuvants work [<xref rid="pone.0132003.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Advax is a novel polysaccharide adjuvant based on semi-crystalline microparticles of delta inulin [<xref rid="pone.0132003.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Advax has previously been shown to enhance seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccine protection in murine [<xref rid="pone.0132003.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] or ferret models [<xref rid="pone.0132003.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], respectively. Notably, when combined with a poorly immunogenic avian influenza antigen, Advax adjuvant reduced virus shedding and provided robust protection of immunized ferrets against H5N1-associated mortality and clinical disease [<xref rid="pone.0132003.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Advax adjuvant also enhanced immunogenicity of influenza vaccine administered to pregnant dams, resulting in enhanced protection of their pups via increased breast milk transfer of protective antibodies [<xref rid="pone.0132003.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Importantly Advax adjuvant has been shown to have similar beneficial effects on antibody production in humans, as shown in clinical trials of a pandemic influenza vaccine [<xref rid="pone.0132003.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and a hepatitis B vaccine [<xref rid="pone.0132003.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. With Advax adjuvant advancing towards late stage human trials, it is important to better understand the actions of this novel adjuvant and, in particular, the mechanism whereby it enhances humoral immunity. In this study we sought to characterize the effect of Advax on human plasmablasts [<xref rid="pone.0132003.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] using cryopreserved 7dpv PBMC from a subset of subjects in a previously conducted seasonal influenza vaccine study (FLU006). The results reveal unique adjuvant-related effects on plasmablast frequency, AID gene expression and B-cell receptor usage when subjects that received TIV vaccine alone were compared to those that received vaccine formulated with Advax adjuvant.</p>

                <p>FLU006 was undertaken in 2012 as a randomized, blinded, parallel-group single-center study in Adelaide, Australia, to assess the administration of seasonal influenza vaccine, using different delivery routes and different vaccine formulations with some study results having been previously reported [<xref rid="pone.0132003.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. As detailed in the FLU006 study protocol (<xref rid="pone.0132003.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Protocol</xref>), consenting study subjects were provided the opportunity to participate in a sub-study (FLU006-12) where additional blood samples were obtained weekly post-immunization to allow collection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) for cryopreservation for future studies into adjuvant effects on adaptive immunity. The FLU006-12 plasmablast substudy was performed using 7dpv PBMC samples available from 25 adult subjects ranging in age from 19 to 82 years who had received intramuscular injections via needle and syringe of TIV alone (n = 9), TIV+Advax 5mg (n = 8) or TIV+Advax 10mg (n = 8). The FLU006 study was approved by the Flinders Clinical Research Ethics Committee and is registered on the publicly accessible Australia New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry accessible at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.anzctr.org.au/">https://www.anzctr.org.au/</ext-link> as ACTRN12612000709842.

                <p>Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from fresh heparinized whole blood by standard density gradient centrifugation using Ficoll-Paque Plus (GE Healthcare) in Leucosep tubes (Greiner Bio-One) according to the product manual. After isolation, the PBMC were washed twice in RPMI 1640 medium, followed by centrifugation with 300×g at room temperature to pellet the cells. The pellet was broken by scraping the 15mL centrifuge tube on a tube rack several times, followed by addition of complete RPMI 1640 medium with 10% heat-inactivated neonatal bovine serum (NBS). Then an equal volume of cold cryopreservation buffer (NBS+ 20%DMSO) was added to the cell suspension drop-wise and mixed well by inverting several times. The cell suspension was then transferred to cryovials and frozen down by using freezing containers (Mr. Frosty) at -80°C, followed by liquid nitrogen storage 24h later.</p>

                <p>Interactions of inactivated A/California/07/2009 antigen and patient plasma were studied by surface plasmon resonance with a BIAcore X100 instrument at 25°C using running buffer HBS-EP+ (10mM HEPES, 0.15M NaCl, 3mM EDTA, 0.005% v/v surfactant P20, pH 7.4). Anti-human IgG was immobilized to a CM5 chip (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences AB) in flow cell 2 (fc2) and the reference flow cell 1 (fc1) using wizard amine coupling method. A CM5 chip was activated with EDC/NHS for 7 minutes with the excess activated carboxyl groups were inactivated with ethanolamine for 7 minutes following immobilization of anti-human IgG was diluted in 10mM sodium acetate buffer pH 5.0. Plasma pooled from immunization groups was diluted (1/1000) in HBS-EP+ buffer and injected over fc2 at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. fc1 with no captured anti-human IgG on the reference surface. The level of captured human IgG for each capture experiment was 1500RU (±150). Sixty μl of inactivated A/California/07/2009 antigen (CSL, Australia) was injected at 10 μl/min over both the IgG-captured surface (fc2) and reference surface (fc1) followed by 10 mins dissociation time. The surface was regenerated with 3M MgCl<sub>2</sub> at 10 μl/ml for 70 sec. Sensorgrams were corrected for binding to reference fc1 and for buffer effects (double reference subtracted). Binding changes were recorded in RU and were taken from the end of the association phases from each sensorgram. Dissociation data points from the dissociation phase were fitted to the one phase exponential decay equation for calculation of dissociation rate constants (kd, unit s<sup>-1</sup>) for each vaccination group. Comparison of the binding avidities of antibodies in different vaccination group was performed by measurement of the reciprocal (kd<sup>-1</sup>) of the dissociation rate constants.</p>

                <p>Subjects who agreed to participate and provide additional blood samples for the sub-study were predominantly from an older Caucasian population (median age 64.5 years) and most had a history of a seasonal influenza vaccine within the previous 3 years (80.8%) (<xref rid="pone.0132003.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics between substudy groups. The substudy itself had fewer subjects than the parent study and hence was not powered to detect differences in seroprotection and seroconversion rates between groups, which was the function of the larger parent study, which will be reported elsewhere. Given the limited sample size, the confidence intervals in seroprotection and seroconversion rates overlapped between groups in the sub-study, however point estimates showed a clear trend towards higher antibody titer increases in the Advax-adjuvanted groups, with the Advax 10mg dose group achieving the highest point estimates across all three vaccine strains for seroconversion, seroprotection and GMT fold increases across the vaccine strains (<xref rid="pone.0132003.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), and it is noted that H1 A/Cal and B/Bris showed more advantage. The trends seen in the substudy immunogenicity results are consistent with the findings in the larger parent FLU006 study, some results of which have already been reported [<xref rid="pone.0132003.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p>

                <title>Advax Adjuvant Enhances the 7dpv Plasmablast Response</title>
                <p>Previous studies have reported a correlation between the peak frequency of 7dpv-plasmablasts and the 28dpv HI response to influenza immunization [<xref rid="pone.0132003.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. We therefore asked whether the higher antibody response in subjects that received Advax adjuvant was due to increased plasmablast generation. Plasmablasts in all groups were largely undetectable in peripheral blood pre-immunization, rose to a peak at 7dpv and then rapidly declined back to baseline by 21dpv (<xref rid="pone.0132003.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A–1C</xref>). When the area under the post-immunization plasmablast curve was calculated (<xref rid="pone.0132003.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>), the group that received Advax 5mg group had significantly increased total plasmablast generation (mean area 9.99, standard deviation (SD) 8.5, p = 0.03) when compared to the TIV alone group (mean area 3.27, SD 2.21). Plasmablast generation in the Advax 10mg group (mean area 5.44, SD 3.09) also had a higher point estimate but this did not reach statistical significance when compared to the TIV alone group (p = 0.12).</p>

The area under plasmablast curve (AUC) was used as an estimate of total plasmablast generation post-immunization (mean AUC ± SEM) (D). Also shown is correlation between subject age and 7dpv plasmablast frequency (E).</p>

                </fig>
                <p>Overall, there was a significant negative correlation between the 7dpv plasmablast frequency and subject age (r = -0.46, p = 0.02) (<xref rid="pone.0132003.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E</xref>), consistent with previous reports of reduced B-cell responses to influenza immunization in elderly human subjects [<xref rid="pone.0132003.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p>
                <p>Plasmablasts generated by influenza immunization have previously been shown to represent ~50% influenza-specific B cells. To confirm differences in plasmablast frequency represented true differences in influenza-specific B cell frequency, we undertook ELISPOT assays where thawed PBMC were placed directly into TIV-coated ELISPOT plates and cultured overnight (<xref rid="pone.0132003.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). This assay detects plasmablasts spontaneously secreting large quantities of influenza-specific antibody, as confirmed by the absence of spots when using PBMC obtained pre-immunization or 28dpv when plasmablasts are absent in the peripheral blood (data not shown). There was considerable inter-individual variation in plasmablast frequency when measured by ELISPOT such that intergroup differences were not significant, which likely reflects the variable plasmablast viability following cryopreservation. Nevertheless, there were consistent trends that matched the FACS-generated plasmablast frequency data, with the highest frequency of influenza-specific IgG+, IgM+ and IgA+ spots in the blood of subjects that received Advax adjuvant (<xref rid="pone.0132003.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A–2C</xref>). Overall, the highest percentage of influenza-specific plasmablasts secreted IgG, followed by IgA and then IgM (<xref rid="pone.0132003.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A–2C</xref>). Point estimates of plasmablast frequency for each immunoglobulin isotype were highest in the Advax 10mg group.</p>

                </fig>
                <p>When all groups were pooled for analysis, there was a significant positive correlation between the 7dpv-plasmablast frequency by FACS and 7dpv-influenza-specific plasmablasts detected by ELISPOT to be secreting IgG (r = 0.45, p = 0.02) or IgA (r = 0.57, p = 0.003) but not IgM (r = 0.24, p = 0.26) (<xref rid="pone.0132003.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D–2F</xref>). This suggested that the generation of influenza-specific IgG+ and IgA+ plasmablasts correlated best with the overall size of the plasmablast response. This did not reflect a greater sensitivity of IgM+ plasmablasts to death from cryopreservation as the frequency of IgM+ plasmablasts was comparable in fresh and frozen PBMC from the same subject (data not shown).</p>
                <p>We next assessed the correlation between the 7dpv plasmablast frequency and each subject’s 28dpv HI titer increase. Whereas there were significant correlations between plasmablast frequency 7dpv, and HI increases 28dpv, in subjects that received either Advax 5mg or Advax 10mg, there was no correlation in subjects that received TIV alone (<xref rid="pone.0132003.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). This suggests there is a direct link in the Advax groups between the plasmablast frequency 7dpv and the serum HI titers 28dpv.</p>

                <title>Plasmablast BCR Affinity Maturation</title>
                <p>To explain the higher neutralizing antibody titers in the Advax-immunized groups in previous influenza [<xref rid="pone.0132003.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and hepatitis B [<xref rid="pone.0132003.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] vaccine studies, we hypothesized that Advax adjuvant might positively influence B-cell affinity maturation. Affinity maturation is a process whereby mutations are progressively introduced into the B-cell receptor (BCR) of proliferating antigen-specific B cells, allowing positive selection of the subset of daughter B cells expressing the highest affinity BCR for the antigen [<xref rid="pone.0132003.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. BCR antigen specificity is dictated by the complementarity determining regions (CDR), particularly the CDR3 formed by contributions from the V, D, J gene segments during BCR recombination, as depicted in <xref rid="pone.0132003.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>. During B-cell affinity maturation, amino acid substitutions, additions and deletions are introduced into the CDR3 region thereby allowing generation of new non-germline BCR sequences with higher antigen affinity [<xref rid="pone.0132003.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. We hypothesized that if Advax was enhancing BCR maturation, this should be reflected by an increased frequency of plasmablast BCR amino acid substitutions focused in the antigen-binding CDR3 domain of plasmablasts in the Advax adjuvant groups. Plasmablasts were individually sorted 7dpv and BCR heavy chain genes from each subject cloned into individual expression libraries. Individual clones from each subject’s BCR heavy chain expression library were selected, sequenced and analyzed for mutations using the IMGT online tool [<xref rid="pone.0132003.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The total frequency of BCR heavy chain mutations was not significantly different in 7dpv plasmablasts from subjects that received TIV alone (15.9 mutations/BCR sequence), TIV+Advax 5mg (15.4 mutations/BCR sequence) or TIV+Advax 10mg (16.2 mutations/BCR sequence). This was true whether the data was analyzed for frequency of non-silent mutations (inducing a change in amino acid sequence) (<xref rid="pone.0132003.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>), or silent mutations (no change in amino acid sequence) (<xref rid="pone.0132003.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>). This suggested the absence of any generalized effect of Advax on BCR mutagenesis.</p>

                <p>Next we restricted the mutation analysis to just the BCR CDR3 region, which is the main site of antibody rearrangement responsible for antigen-specificity [<xref rid="pone.0132003.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Notably, there was a significant 2–3 fold higher rate of non-silent CDR3 mutations in 7dpv plasmablasts from the Advax 5mg group (mean = 0.35, SD = 0.05, p = 0.015) and Advax 10mg group (mean = 0.43, SD = 0.06, p = 0.003) when compared to the TIV alone group (mean = 0.18, SD = 0.04) (<xref rid="pone.0132003.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref>). As only non-silent CDR3 mutations result in a change in BCR sequence and are thereby under selective pressure as part of B-cell affinity maturation, we also compared the frequency of silent CDR3 mutations as a control. There was no significant difference between groups in the frequency of silent CDR3 mutations (<xref rid="pone.0132003.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3E</xref>) consistent with immunization with Advax being specifically associated with increased non-silent CDR3 mutations. Analysis of the CDR3 amino acid composition pattern of each vaccine group showed a clear trend to the Advax 10mg group having more variability of amino acid usage across positions 15–23 in the middle of the CDR3 region when compared to the TIV alone group (<xref rid="pone.0132003.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>). Interestingly, there was no effect of Advax adjuvant on the rate of non-silent or silent mutations in CDR1 (<xref rid="pone.0132003.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A–4B</xref>) or CDR2 (<xref rid="pone.0132003.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C–4D</xref>), or on overall CDR3 length: TIV alone group (average CDR3 length 14.3aa, SD = 3.8); Advax 5mg group (14.6aa, SD = 3.3); and Advax 10mg group (13.8aa, SD = 4.2) (<xref rid="pone.0132003.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>).

                <title>Advax Enhances Plasmablast Activation-Induced Cytidine Deaminase (AID) Expression</title>
                <p>The finding that 7dpv plasmablasts in the Advax groups had a 2–3 fold increased rate of non-silent CDR3 mutations raised the possibility that Advax might be having an effect on BCR recombination, an essential process underlying B-cell affinity maturation. AID is a gene that encodes a DNA-editing deaminase that is involved in somatic hypermutation, gene conversion, and class-switch recombination of immunoglobulin genes [<xref rid="pone.0132003.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. We asked, therefore, whether subjects in the Advax groups had changes in plasmablast AID gene expression. Notably, plasmablasts from the Advax 10mg group had a highly significant ~5-fold upregulation of AID expression (p = 0.001) when compared to the TIV alone group (<xref rid="pone.0132003.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>). Despite having a significantly higher rate of CDR3 mutations when compared to the TIV alone group, AID expression was not significantly increased in the Advax 5mg group.</p>

This study used cryopreserved PBMC samples from a seasonal influenza vaccine trial to investigate how Advax adjuvant might be enhancing the human humoral response to influenza immunization at the cellular level. The results provide intriguing insights into the action of this unique polysaccharide adjuvant. As hypothesized based on previous animal studies where delta inulin adjuvant enhanced generation of antigen-specific memory B cells and plasma cells [<xref rid="pone.0132003.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0132003.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], administration to human subjects of influenza vaccine formulated with Advax adjuvant resulted in an increased plasmablast peak post-immunization, although surprisingly this effect was more evident at the lower Advax 5mg dose. This result also accords with a report findings that influenza immunization with an oil emulsion adjuvant increased the peak plasmablast response in human subjects [<xref rid="pone.0132003.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The finding that Advax adjuvant was associated with an increased peak plasmablast response post-immunization, may at least partially explain the finding of higher antibody titers in human subjects receiving Advax-adjuvanted influenza vaccine the modest effect size on plasmablast frequency, particularly at the higher Advax 10 mg dose, suggested that some other mechanism of humoral enhancement might also be operating. To address the possibility that Advax adjuvant might also be having a positive effect on B cell affinity maturation, we compared BCR heavy chain usage in plasmablasts sorted from subjects that had received Advax versus TIV alone. Notably, plasmablasts from the Advax 10mg and 5mg groups both had significantly higher frequencies of non-silent BCR heavy chain mutations focused exclusively in the CDR3 region when compared to plasmablasts of subjects that received TIV alone. Plasmablasts from the Advax 10mg group, which had the highest rate of CDR3 mutations, also exhibited increased AID expression, consistent with the higher dose of Advax adjuvant having a positive effect on B-cell affinity maturation via upregulation of plasmablast AID. The diversity of the antibody repertoire as determined by the composition of the heavy chain CDR3 has been shown to be important to development of influenza heterosubtypic immunity [<xref rid="pone.0132003.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], raising the possibility that the increased CDR3 diversity seen here in human subjects receiving Advax adjuvant might translate into enhanced influenza cross-protection. Whilst this possibility is yet to be tested in human subjects, a positive effect of Advax adjuvant on BCR CDR3 diversity might help explain the enhanced cross-protection against West Nile virus seen in mice immunized with Advax-adjuvanted Japanese encephalitis antigen, protection that could be transferred to naïve mice using memory B cells from immunized mice [<xref rid="pone.0132003.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p>
              <p>We next looked for a potential mechanism whereby Advax might be directly or indirectly be regulating B-cell function. TLR agonists such as CpG oligonucleotide and monophosphoryl lipid A are known to directly stimulate human B cell proliferation and antibody secretion via binding to receptors on the B cell surface [<xref rid="pone.0132003.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0132003.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Interestingly, this did not appear to be the mechanism of action of Advax as direct co-incubation with human B cells down- rather than up-regulated AID expression and had no effect on B-cell proliferation or antibody secretion (data not shown), suggesting that Advax actually has a direct inhibitory effect on human B cells. This suggests that the positive effect of Advax on AID expression and plasmablast generation is indirect and may therefore, for example, reflect an effect of Advax on T-follicular helper cell function that secondarily enhances B-cell AID expression and affinity maturation [<xref rid="pone.0132003.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. However, as we have been unable to show any direct interaction between Advax and human T cells (unpublished data), we hypothesize that any Advax effect on T cells is itself an indirect effect, such that the primary effect of Advax is likely to be on antigen presenting cells (APC) [<xref rid="pone.0132003.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Under this model, Advax interacts with APCs leading to enhanced T-cell co-stimulation, these activated T cells provide help to antigen-specific B cells, resulted in enhanced B cell activation, proliferation, AID expression and affinity maturation, thereby explaining the enhanced production of high avidity serum antibody seen in subjects receiving Advax-adjuvanted vaccine.</p>
              <p>Overall, the Advax dose was associated with the best overall vaccine response, as indicated by serum HI titers and antibody avidity, plasmablast AID expression and BCR non-silent heavy chain CDR3 mutations. The one exception was that plasmablast frequency post-immunisation was highest in the Advax 5mg group. This might suggest that plasmablast proliferation and AID expression are independently regulated with Advax 5mg primarily driving the former, and Advax 10mg, the latter. The Advax 10mg group was uniquely associated with an increased frequency of IgM+ plasmablasts 7dpv, a finding of unknown significance. Humans have a population of IgM+ memory B cells carrying a mutated immunoglobulin receptor that are proposed to correspond to circulating splenic marginal zone B cells [<xref rid="pone.0132003.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In murine models, IgM+ memory B cells were shown to represent a long-lived precursor memory population that repopulates germinal centers and contributes to generation of high affinity plasmablasts and IgM+ and IgG+ memory B cells upon a secondary antigen exposure [<xref rid="pone.0132003.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. By contrast, IgG+ memory B cells only give rise to plasma cells. Hence, enhanced generation of IgM+ memory B cells by Advax might explain its ability in animal models to enhance heterologous virus protection [<xref rid="pone.0132003.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p>
              <p>A limitation of the current study as with other studies of human plasmablast function is the relatively low number of study subjects able to be studied, a reflection of the intensive nature of human cellular immune studies. Nevertheless, the key findings showing Advax adjuvant enhanced plasmablast frequency, AID gene expression and heavy chain BCR CDR3 mutations were all statistically significant. We are currently planning a larger human vaccine study to confirm and extend the current findings. Intensive studies are also underway in animal models, which are more amenable to experimental manipulation, to better understand how Advax might achieves these beneficial effects on B cell immunity. Ultimately this should provide much sought answers on how this novel polysaccharide adjuvant enhances vaccine protection while avoiding the toxicity of other adjuvants.</p>
