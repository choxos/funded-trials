              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Patients with cancer often receive treatment and acute care use, particularly near the end of life, that does not align with their preferences or goals of care.<sup><xref rid="coi200077r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="coi200077r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="coi200077r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="coi200077r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="coi200077r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Early discussions about goals and treatment preferences may lead to better perceived quality of life, reduced emotional distress, and decreased health care use near the end of life.<sup><xref rid="coi200077r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="coi200077r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="coi200077r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> However, most patients with cancer die without a documented discussion about goals and treatment preferences.<sup><xref rid="coi200077r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="coi200077r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup></p>
              <p>There are several reasons for the dearth of such discussions between oncologists and patients with cancer. First, oncologists correctly identify fewer than half of their patients who will die within 6 to 12 months.<sup><xref rid="coi200077r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="coi200077r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Overoptimistic assessments of short-term mortality risk may result in inadequate identification of patients who will benefit from a timely discussion.<sup><xref rid="coi200077r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="coi200077r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="coi200077r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Second, it is often difficult to change clinician behavior and practice patterns. Insights from behavioral economics, including changing default options and delivering performance feedback, have been shown to alter clinician behavior in a variety of clinical settings.<sup><xref rid="coi200077r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="coi200077r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="coi200077r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="coi200077r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Serious illness conversations (SICs) are a type of advance care planning discussion and are structured conversations between clinicians, patients, and families intended to explore prognostic awareness, treatment priorities, and goals of care.<sup><xref rid="coi200077r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> In a prior randomized clinical trial, an intervention that provided clinicians with a Serious Illness Conversation Guide ameliorated anxiety and depression among patients with cancer.<sup><xref rid="coi200077r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="coi200077r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> The objective of the present stepped-wedge cluster randomized clinical trial was to test the effect of an intervention that integrated real-time machine learning (ML) mortality predictions with behavioral nudges on motivating SICs between oncologists and high-risk patients. We used a validated ML algorithm that has been shown to accurately predict 180-day mortality risk.<sup><xref rid="coi200077r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> We hypothesized that this multimodal intervention would increase the rate of SICs between oncology clinicians and all patients as well as between oncology clinicians and high-risk patients.</p>

The trial evaluated the effect of delivering ML mortality estimates with behavioral nudges on the rate of SICs among patients with cancer. The mortality prediction algorithm has been previously validated.<sup><xref rid="coi200077r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> This trial followed the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/consort/">CONSORT</ext-link>) reporting guideline.

                <title>Study Sample</title>
                <p>Eligible clinicians were physicians, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners who provided oncology care at 8 subspecialty clinics (breast, central nervous system, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, lymphoma, melanoma, myeloma, and thoracic or head and neck) and 1 general oncology clinic (n = 78). Clinicians at the 2 smallest subspecialty clinics (melanoma and central nervous system malignant neoplasms) were grouped together, resulting in 8 clinic groups. Clinicians were excluded if they cared only for patients with benign hematologic or genetic disorders (n = 3) saw fewer than 12 patients classified as high risk by the algorithm in either the preintervention or postintervention period (n = 6), or had not undergone SIC training at the time of trial initiation (n = 4).</p>
                <p>Eligible patients had encounters at 1 of the clinics during the study period. Patients were excluded if they had a documented SIC or advanced care planning conversation (ACP) prior to the start of the trial, or if they were enrolled in another ongoing trial of early palliative care. Genetics encounters were also excluded.</p>

                <title>Randomization</title>
                <p>The 8 clinic groups were randomized to the 4 intervention wedge periods, stratified by SIC rate (above or below the median). The study senior author (M.S.P.) and data analyst (C.A.L.R.) were blinded to wedge assignment until analysis of the primary end point was complete. Blinding was not feasible for investigators who were oncologists practicing at Penn Medicine.</p>

              <sec id="H2-4-COI200077">
                <title>Interventions</title>
                <p>All clinicians included in the trial were trained in the use of the Serious Illness Conversation Guide (Ariadne Labs) at least 3 months prior to the start of the trial (range, 5-18 months).<sup><xref rid="coi200077r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> The default advance care planning template for clinicians was based on this guide.</p>
                <p>For approximately 1 year before the trial began, clinicians in all clinic groups received weekly emails that reported their individual SIC performance and blinded peer comparison in 2 bar graphs: 1 for cumulative SICs performed since that clinician’s SIC training date and 1 for SICs performed in the prior week. This continued during the control period of the trial and was turned off once the intervention was implemented. In the first 4-week wedge, all clinic groups remained in usual care (control). In each subsequent 4-week period, 2 clinic groups (intervention) received the intervention. By the start of the fifth wedge, all clinic groups were receiving the intervention (eFigure 1 in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-COI200077-1-s">Supplement 2</xref>).</p>
                <p>The intervention was directed toward clinicians and included 3 main components. First, every Thursday, each clinician received an email with performance feedback indicating the number of SICs he or she performed in the prior 4 weeks. The email also contained a peer comparison message; this message differed for clinicians who performed below or above 8 SICs or who were among the top 10 performers of SICs during the prior 4 weeks. Samples of the email text are shown in eFigure 2 in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-COI200077-1-s">Supplement 2</xref>. Performance feedback and peer comparisons have been shown to be successful in motivating clinician decision-making.<sup><xref rid="coi200077r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="coi200077r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="coi200077r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup></p>
                <p>Second, the email included a link to a secure dashboard in which clinicians could review patients scheduled for the following week in their clinic who had a high risk of mortality; these were described as patients “who may benefit from an SIC.” Mortality risk was determined by a previously validated ML algorithm, which used structured electronic health record (EHR) data to predict risk of 180-day mortality.<sup><xref rid="coi200077r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Every Thursday morning, the algorithm generated mortality risk predictions for all patients with a scheduled encounter during the following week with an eligible clinician. Clinicians could view a personalized list of up to 6 patients with the highest predicted 180-day mortality risk (“high-risk” patients) via a secure dashboard. Patients with a mortality risk below 10% were not included in the list. Mortality predictions were updated weekly; thus, patient assignment as “high risk” could change from encounter to encounter. Information in the dashboard included patient identifiers, the author and date of any prior SICs, and a checkbox to opt out of reminder texts. Using opt out (as opposed to opt in) as a default has been successful in different health care settings to change physician behavior.<sup><xref rid="coi200077r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="coi200077r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="coi200077r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="coi200077r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="coi200077r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> The prediction algorithm silently identified high-risk patients during the control periods, but these lists were not shared with the clinicians via email or text.</p>
                <p>Third, clinicians received a text message reminding them to consider having an SIC with any high-risk patient. For the high-risk patients on the clinicians’ dashboard, clinicians were sent this message on the morning of the patient’s encounter, unless they opted out or an SIC was performed in the prior 2 months.</p>

                <title>Outcome Measures</title>
                <p>The primary outcome was change in SIC rate among all patient encounters. Secondary outcomes included changes in rates of (1) SICs among high-risk patients and (2) ACPs for the overall sample and for the high-risk subgroup.</p>
                <p>The electronic medical record had an ACP section in which advance care planning notes were documented. Any note documented in this section was classified as an ACP. The subset of notes that included a preformatted SIC template was classified as an SIC. Thus, ACPs encompassed both SIC and non-SIC documentation about treatment goals and wishes.</p>
              </sec>
              <sec id="H2-6-COI200077">
                <title>Statistical Analysis</title>
                <p>A priori power calculations used data from the University of Pennsylvania Health System to estimate the rate of SICs. Assuming a baseline SIC rate of 0.65%, we estimated that this trial would have 80% power to detect a 60% relative increase in SIC rate using a 2-sided α of 0.05 as our threshold for statistical significance.</p>
                <p>All trial clinicians and their patients were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. Analyses were conducted using the first patient encounter in each wedge; subsequent encounters were excluded to avoid biasing results toward patients with numerous encounters. Patients seen by physician assistants and nurse practitioners were allocated to their corresponding oncologist. Because care planning documentation can occur days to weeks after an encounter, SICs and ACPs within 28 days of the encounter with no intervening encounter were counted in the primary outcome. We performed a sensitivity analysis that defined the primary outcome using a shorter, 7-day period after the index encounter to count SICs and ACPs.</p>
                <p>Similar to prior work,<sup><xref rid="coi200077r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> we fit models for the outcome measures based on generalized estimating equations with a logit link and an independence correlation structure using oncologist as the clustering unit. The main models used patient-encounter level observations, clinic-group and wedge-period fixed effects, and a binary indicator for intervention implementation. To test the robustness of our findings, we fit a fully adjusted model that also included age, sex, marital status, patient-reported race/ethnicity, insurance status, and Charlson Comorbidity Index. To obtain the adjusted difference and 95% CIs in the percentage points, we used the bootstrap method, resampling patients 1000 times.<sup><xref rid="coi200077r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="coi200077r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> Resampling of patients was conducted by the oncologist variable to maintain clustering at the oncologist level.

              <p>The sample consisted of 78 clinicians (of whom 42 were oncologists), 14 607 patients, and 26 059 patient encounters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="coi200077f1">Figure</xref>). Patients’ mean (SD) age was 61.9 (14.2) years. Of 14 607 patients, 8141 (55.7%) were female, 10 285 (70.4%) were non-Hispanic White, 6876 (47.1%) were commercially insured, 6806 (46.7%) were covered by Medicare, and 925 (6.3)% were covered by Medicaid (<xref rid="coi200077t1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Patients in the control and intervention groups had similar characteristics. High-risk encounters accounted for 2125 of 12 170 patient encounters (17.5%) in the control groups and 1999 of 13 889 patient encounters (14.4%) in the intervention groups. The median 180-day mortality risk per patient-encounter was similar in the control and intervention groups (4% [interquartile range {IQR}, 2%-13%] vs 4% [IQR, 2%-12%]). Among high-risk patients, the patients’ characteristics and median mortality risk (34% [IQR, 20%-53%] vs 36% [IQR, 20%-56%]) were also similar between control and intervention groups (eTable 1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-COI200077-1-s">Supplement 2</xref>). The number of patient encounters and SIC rates by clinic and control vs intervention group are shown in eTable 2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-COI200077-1-s">Supplement 2</xref>.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>In this randomized clinical trial conducted in 9 oncology practices, an intervention that combined ML mortality predictions with behavioral nudges significantly increased rates of SICs and ACPs. The intervention led to a 4-fold increase (3.6%-15.2%) in SICs among high-risk patients targeted by the intervention. To our knowledge, this is one of the first randomized clinical trials testing the effect of real-time ML predictions and behavioral nudges on clinical care. There are several important implications of our findings.</p>
              <p>First, our intervention resulted in a large increase in SIC rates, especially among patients at highest risk of 180-day mortality. Although prior studies have assessed SIC and ACP rates among decedents,<sup><xref rid="coi200077r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="coi200077r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> our study showed that a behaviorally informed intervention led to a rapid increase in such conversations among all patients with cancer. Although the optimal SIC prevalence among patients with cancer is unknown, the effect of this intervention compares favorably with other published interventions on increasing the number of such conversations.<sup><xref rid="coi200077r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="coi200077r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="coi200077r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> Discussions about goals and treatment preferences have been associated with less aggressive care for cancer patients near the end of life, including increased hospice utilization rates and reduced chemotherapy and hospitalization rates near the end of life.<sup><xref rid="coi200077r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="coi200077r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="coi200077r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="coi200077r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="coi200077r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="coi200077r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="coi200077r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="coi200077r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Furthermore, documentation of such discussions ensures that patients’ wishes are recorded and available across care settings in a health system. Our study has particular importance as oncologists and patients now grapple with care delays and competing risks due to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Indeed, documentation of goals and wishes has been recognized by several oncology guideline bodies as a key priority to ensure goal-concordant care during the pandemic. A uniform approach to the automated identification of high-risk patients that increases the rate of SICs can be combined with new care models, such as telemedicine, to meet this need.</p>
              <p>Targeting SICs to high-risk patients at risk of short-term mortality may result in improved goal-concordant care, which was not shown in a previous randomized clinical trial of an intervention consisting primarily of training on the Serious Illness Conversation Guide.<sup><xref rid="coi200077r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="coi200077r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> The cohort in that trial consisted of individuals who died. The use of that cohort may explain why overall rates of SICs in the control and intervention groups were much higher than those in the present trial, which consisted of all patients (decedents and nondecedents) with cancer, including many with curable early-stage cancers for whom SICs would not be expected. In addition, the relatively low SIC prevalence among even high-risk patients after the intervention may be due to the exclusion of patients with an existing SIC at the start of the present trial, a short follow-up period, clinician time constraints, the performance of SICs that were not documented in a trackable fashion in the EHR, and misclassification of patients as high risk. Subsequent research should determine longer-term clinical and quality-of-life outcomes associated with SICs prompted by this intervention.</p>
              <p>Second, although several trials have prospectively integrated ML risk predictions into clinical care, few studies have shown that interventions that involve ML predictions can positively influence clinical care or decision-making.<sup><xref rid="coi200077r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="coi200077r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> Our intervention illustrates that generalizable behavioral principles combined with ML predictions may inform more accurate, individualized prognoses that clinicians and patients use to guide treatment decisions and ensure receipt of goal-concordant care. A key innovation of the present study was integrating behavioral economic principles into the ML-based intervention, including peer comparison, performance feedback, and opt-out reminders, which have been used successfully in other clinical settings to change clinician behavior.<sup><xref rid="coi200077r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="coi200077r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="coi200077r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="coi200077r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="coi200077r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> Future implementation of artificial intelligence or ML tools in clinical practice should explore similar mechanisms of delivering predictions and integrating behavioral principles to maximally improve clinician and patient decision-making. Yet these behavioral nudges may not be equally necessary and effective. Although the present study cannot disentangle the effects of individual intervention components, setting the default to a desired behavior—in this instance, defaulting clinicians to receive notifications encouraging SICs with high-risk patients—is a powerful nudge that has been widely applied in medicine to change behavior and may be the most impactful component.<sup><xref rid="coi200077r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> Future research should use head-to-head comparisons to identify which intervention components deliver the most benefit and how an integrated EHR-based mortality prediction tool can be generalized to other health systems.</p>
              <p>Third, although our intervention effect was strongest in the high-risk patients flagged by the algorithm, we still detected an increase of nearly 2 percentage points in SICs among patients who were not deemed high-risk by the algorithm. These “off-target” patients comprised the majority of our cohort. To our knowledge, off-target effects of an intervention to promote supportive care have not been shown. This off-target effect may have occurred because the clinicians who received the intervention became accustomed to actively considering mortality risk in their clinical practice, resulting in an increase in SICs for patients who may have a poor prognosis but were not flagged by the algorithm as high risk.</p>
              <sec id="H2-9-COI200077">
                <title>Strengths and Limitations</title>
                <p>Our study has several strengths, including the application of behavioral insights into an ML-based intervention, integration of accurate individual-level mortality risk predictions at the point of care, a stepped-wedge design that controlled for cancer site–specific uptake of SICs, and a large sample of patients across several different cancer types and in both tertiary academic and general oncology practices. This study has several limitations. First, this study was performed in a single academic health system, and the participants may not be representative of the general population of oncologists or patients with cancer. However, given the prominence of EHRs in oncology care and the many examples of EHR-based ML algorithms across EHR types, the principles behind this intervention could theoretically be applied in any cancer care setting.<sup><xref rid="coi200077r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> Second, early ACPs and SICs are surrogates for goal-concordant care and decreased aggressive end-of-life care. Longer-term studies are needed to assess whether algorithm-based interventions improve clinical outcomes for patients. Third, our intervention consisted of several components, including a real-time prediction algorithm, a secure list of high-risk patients, peer comparisons, performance reports, and text messages. Future work is needed to assess the individual effects of each of these interventions.</p>
