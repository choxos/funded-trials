                  <p id="Par1">Formerly chronically homeless adults who live in permanent supportive housing (PSH) have high prevalence of smoking. It is uncommon to find smoke-free policies in PSH because of the concern that such policies contradict PSH’s harm reduction framework and could increase homelessness should residents lose their housing because of the policy. However, in the absence of such policies, non-smoking PSH residents face the harmful effects of secondhand smoke exposure while residents who smoke see increased risks from high rates of smoking throughout their residence. Our pilot work highlighted the feasibility and acceptability of an intervention designed to promote voluntary adoption of a smoke-free home. Here we report a protocol for a cluster randomized controlled trial of the smoke-free home intervention for formerly chronically homeless residents in PSH.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">The smoke-free home intervention provides face-to-face counseling and instruction to PSH residents on how to adopt a smoke-free home and offers training for PSH staff on how to refer residents to tobacco cessation services. We will randomize 20 PSH sites in the San Francisco Bay Area to either the intervention or wait-list control arms. We will enroll 400 PSH residents who smoke cigarettes in their housing unit and 120 PSH staff who work at the sites. At baseline, three- and six-months follow-up, we will ask residents to report their tobacco use and cessation behaviors and adoption of smoke-free homes. We will ask staff to answer questions on their knowledge, attitudes, practices, and barriers related to supporting residents’ smoking cessation. The primary outcome for PSH residents is adoption of smoke-free homes for 90 days or more at six-months follow-up, and the secondary outcome is point prevalence tobacco abstinence. The primary outcome for PSH staff is change in Smoking Knowledge Attitudes Practices survey score.</p>

                  <p id="Par3">Voluntary adoption of smoke-free homes is a promising approach for reducing exposure to secondhand smoke and reducing tobacco use among a population facing high rates of tobacco-related disease, and is aligned with PSH’s harm reduction framework. Findings from this study have the potential to inform adoption of tobacco control policies among vulnerable populations most at risk for smoking-related harms.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par8">Tobacco use is more prevalent among low-income and socially marginalized communities than their affluent counterparts, contributing to an unequal burden of tobacco-related diseases, a key health equity issue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Previously chronically homeless individuals residing in permanent supportive housing (PSH) have borne the brunt of structural inequities leading to high rates of tobacco use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. PSH is subsidized housing with closely linked or on-site voluntary medical and/or social services for individuals with a history of chronic homelessness and co-occurring mental health conditions, substance use disorders, and disabilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Chronic homelessness is defined by the U.S. federal government as being continuously homeless for more than 1 year, or having four or more episodes of homelessness over 3 years, which combine to more than 1 year, in addition to having a disabling condition. Approximately 25% of people experiencing current homelessness in the U.S. meet these criteria for chronic homelessness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. PSH is an evidence-based approach to ending homelessness and represents the largest type of residential program in the U.S. for individuals who were previously homeless, with over 376,000 beds throughout the country [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Housing first is the most common and preferred approach to PSH. Rooted in harm reduction, housing first approaches have no preconditions of abstinence from alcohol or substances and do not require residents to engage in supportive services prior to obtaining or maintaining housing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par9">Negative social determinants of health are associated with high rates of tobacco use among people who experience homelessness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. These determinants include extreme poverty and the social marginalization that results from being homeless, increased availability of tobacco products in low-income communities, and limited access to cessation resources and smoke-free housing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Approximately 50% of those living in PSH report current smoking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Mortality rates among PSH residents are at least double that of age-matched individuals in the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and tobacco-caused chronic diseases including cancers and cardiovascular disease contribute to over 60% of the all-cause mortality of PSH dwelling individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Housing inequities disproportionately expose disadvantaged communities to secondhand smoke (SHS) and other cancer risks and contribute to poor access to preventive health care such as cancer screenings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par10">Tobacco use also increases financial strain on this already at-risk population. PSH residents in the San Francisco Bay Area who smoked spent 12% (median, range 5–26%) of their monthly income on tobacco [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. PSH residents who have an income are required to pay up to 30% of their earnings on their monthly rent, and tobacco spending may interfere with residents’ ability to pay rent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Tobacco expenditures may also interfere with residents’ ability to purchase food and increase risk for food insecurity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Despite high rates of tobacco use and its detrimental impact on PSH residents’ health and financial well-being [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], PSH typically do not have mandated smoke-free policies restricting indoor smoking in living areas nor do they offer cessation services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p>
              <sec id="Sec2">
                <title>Tobacco control initiatives</title>
                <p id="Par11">Smoke-free policies and smoking cessation services are among the most effective tobacco control interventions. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) mandated a smoke-free policy that restricted indoor smoking in public housing authority housing, effective July 2018, and in some housing authority sites, that mandate is accompanied with access to cessation resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In contrast, smoke-free policies are uncommon in PSH. There is a concern that mandated smoke-free policies may conflict with PSH’s harm-reduction framework, potentially increasing risk of evictions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. PSH staff may lack resources and time to enforce a smoke-free policy even if they put one into effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], and policies without cessation resources are thought to be minimally effective in promoting smoke-free living environments.</p>
                <p id="Par12">Given this hesitation, encouraging residents to voluntarily designate their homes as smoke-free represents one approach to introducing smoke-free living environments in the absence of a mandated policy. This strategy relies on education and voluntary behavioral change and therefore is aligned with PSH’s harm reduction framework. Smoke-free homes not only reduce exposure to SHS among non-smokers, but they also reduce smoking among smokers. In prior population-based studies, a smoke-free home was associated with reduced consumption, increased quit attempts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], reduced relapse to smoking, and increased effectiveness of smoking cessation aids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Despite the fact that low-income households were less likely to have smoke-free homes, low-income smokers who had a smoke-free home had similar quit rates to higher-income smokers, suggesting that smoke-free homes could mitigate part of the income disparity in smoking cessation.</p>
                <p id="Par13">We previously conducted a pilot study to evaluate the efficacy of a multi-faceted intervention to increase voluntary adoption of smoke-free homes, i.e., a voluntary no-smoking rule in one’s home, with 100 formerly homeless adults in 15 PSH sites in the San Francisco Bay Area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The intervention consisted of providing a step-by-step guide to residents on how to voluntarily adopt a smoke-free home and training PSH staff on how to refer residents to local cessation resources. At 6 months, 31% of residents adopted a voluntary smoke-free home compared to 12% at baseline.</p>

                <p id="Par14">Here we describe a protocol for a cluster-randomized wait-list controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of the same smoke-free home intervention on the primary outcome of voluntary adoption of a smoke-free home. This approach of encouraging the voluntary adoption of smoke-free homes offers a novel pathway to increase access to smoke-free living in housing where there is no mandated policy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p>

                <title>Theoretical foundation</title>
                <p id="Par17">The individual intervention components are rooted in the social cognitive theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], which posits that behavior change takes place as a result of a dynamic and reciprocal interaction of the individual, behavior, and environment. We anticipated that by providing PSH residents knowledge and skills to adopt a smoke-free home, we would increase PSH residents’ engagement with the intervention. To scale up the intervention to multiple PSH sites and to lend rigor and structure to intervention development, we mapped intervention functions to the Behavior Change Wheel (BCW), a theoretical framework that describes barriers to and enablers of the behavior and offers nine possible intervention functions and seven possible policy options to affect behavior change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The BCW domains and corresponding elements of the intervention are provided in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. The BCW includes three layers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]: the first uses the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation, Behavior (COM-B) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] model to highlight key barriers and potential enablers to voluntarily adopting a smoke-free home [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]; the second highlights five intervention options that cuts across individual, social, and organizational influences to address the barriers identified in the COM-B domains; and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] the third offers three policy and programmatic options to disseminate the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Psychological capability reflects knowledge and awareness, and physical capability refers to skills necessary for behavior change. Opportunity comprises social and physical factors that make behavior change possible. Motivation includes the processes that direct behavior change, including emotional response, habitual processes, and cognitive processes.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Mapping the smoke-free home intervention delivery to the Behavior Change Wheel</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td>Barriers identified using the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation, Behavior (COM-B) model</td><td>Intervention functions (layer 2)</td><td>Policy targets (layer 3)</td></tr><tr><td><p><bold>PSH resident barriers and potential enablers</bold></p><p>-Have decreased knowledge of SHS or thirdhand smoke <italic>(capability)</italic></p><p>-Lack skills to adopt a smoke-free home <italic>(capability)</italic></p><p>-Indoor cannabis use and other substance use reduces capability and motivation to smoke outdoors <italic>(capability/motivation)</italic></p><p>-<sup>a</sup>Kids/pets may encourage smoke-free home adoption <italic>(motivation)</italic></p><p><italic>- </italic>Lack of safe designated smoking zones reduces opportunity for smoke-free living<italic> (opportunity)</italic></p><p>- Social norms of pervasive smoking reduces opportunity for smoke-free home <italic>(opportunity)</italic></p></td><td><p><bold>PSH residents</bold></p><p>-Education: Information on harms related to SHS and thirdhand smoke; combustible tobacco and e-cigarettes, and cannabis</p><p>-Training: Step-by-step guide to adopt a smoke-free home</p><p>-Restrictions: Voluntary smoke-free home adoption</p><p>-Persuasion: Pledges; infographics on impact of SHS on kids and pets</p><p>-Enablement: Referral to smoking cessation resources</p></td><td rowspan="2"><p><bold>Environmental or social planning</bold></p><p>-Voluntary adoption of smoke-free homes</p><p>-Exploring potential downstream effect of other residents adopting smoke-free homes</p><p><bold>Service provision</bold></p><p>-Providing referrals to cessation programs</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><bold>PSH staff barriers</bold></p><p>-Believe residents prefer to smoke indoors <italic>(capability)</italic></p><p>-Have no skills to refer residents to smoking cessation programs <italic>(capability)</italic></p><p>-Believe that smoking can allay a resident’s mental health symptoms <italic>(capability)</italic></p></td><td><p><bold>PSH staff</bold></p><p>-Training: To refer residents to smoking cessation programs</p><p>-Education: Information from pilot data that residents are supportive of indoor smoke-free policies; debunk myths around nicotine allaying mental health symptoms</p></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><sup>a</sup>Potential enabler</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p>
                <p id="Par18">Through our formative work and pilot study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], we identified that residents’ psychological and physical capability to adopt a smoke-free home was limited by lack of knowledge on the harms of SHS, and lack of skills on how to adopt a smoke-free home. PSH staff also reported a lack of knowledge needed to help residents implement smoke-free homes or access cessation resources. Opportunity was limited by lack of a safe designated smoking zone to smoke outdoors and on-site resources for smoking cessation. Awareness that SHS negatively impacted children and pets was a motivation for smoke-free home adoption; however, indoor co-use of substances decreased motivation to quit. Guided by the BCW framework, the resident intervention will include the following key components: education and skill building for PSH residents using a step-by-step guide on how to adopt a smoke-free home, training for PSH staff on how to provide brief cessation counseling, restrictions that include voluntary adoption of smoke-free homes, persuasion using imagery to encourage smoke-free home adoption, and enablement that includes provision of brief cessation counseling and referrals to cessation services. Study staff will also assist participants in calculating their personal financial costs related to tobacco use and encourage them to use the smoke-free home pledge to designate their home smoke-free. The intervention will be delivered using a culturally-tailored informational pamphlet.</p>

Because PSH staff often play an essential role in linking residents to medical and mental health care, the training intervention emphasizes the importance of staff and empowers them to ask, advise, and refer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] to smoking cessation services.

                <p id="Par46">For the primary outcome of voluntary smoke-free home adoption, the minimum detectable effect for the intervention group is 30.3% compared to 12% for the control group, which compares favorably with 31.3% obtained in our pilot study as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. For the secondary outcome of point prevalence abstinence at 6 months, the minimum detectable effect in the intervention group is 12.6% compared to 4% in the control group, which compares favorably with 16.9% obtained in the pilot study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p>

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p id="Par47">First, we will conduct descriptive analyses including means, proportions, variation, and confidence intervals of PSH resident socio-demographic variables including age, gender, and race/ethnicity. Randomization adequacy will be evaluated by considering whether baseline characteristics are independent of intervention group assignment, and attrition analysis will also be conducted. Missing data will be accommodated by multiple imputation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. If any key demographic or risk factors are imbalanced at baseline, propensity score-based adjustment will be included [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Then, we will analyze patterns of smoking cessation behaviors over time to determine the relationship between these practices and voluntary adoption of a smoke-free home. We will conduct primary analysis using intention-to-treat comparisons.</p>
                <p id="Par48">To account for the structure of these data where participants are measured repeatedly over time and are grouped by housing site, we will employ a mixed logistic model with random intercepts for sites and residents. The primary outcome is a binary indicator of smoke-free home adoption which, in an intention-to-treat analysis, will be regressed onto indicators of experimental groups, categorical time (baseline, 3 months, 6 months), and the group-by-time interaction. We will interpret and describe any significant intervention group main effect at follow-up and group-by-time interaction effect.</p>
                <p id="Par49">A secondary analysis will fit a mixed logistic model of the secondary outcome, point prevalence abstinence. Additional analyses will explore mediators (e.g., skills related to smoke-free home adoption, use of referrals to counseling) and moderators (e.g., children or pets at home, indoor cannabis use or other combustible tobacco and nicotine product use) of intervention effects on smoke-free home and point prevalence abstinence outcomes via mixed effects regression models. Replicability of within-group changes on primary and secondary outcomes will be tested by comparing baseline to six-month changes in the intervention group to corresponding six- to 12-month changes in the waitlist group.</p>
                <p id="Par50">Analyses of PSH staff data will include a pre-post training analysis of the smoking knowledge, attitudes, practices, efficacy, and barriers scale using mixed linear models. We will use mixed linear regression models to examine factors associated with change in each of the scales, clustering by site and staff participant ID, and adjusting for demographics, staff smoking status, encounters with residents on providing referrals for cessation, and staff role in the PSH site (e.g., case manager). In addition, we will examine unadjusted SKAP scores by PSH staff attendance of training, smoking status, PSH site and geographic location.</p>

              <p id="Par51">At the time of the manuscript submission, the trial is actively enrolling participants. Recruitment began in February 2022, and we have rolled out the intervention in three blocks of six sites (i.e., 18 sites). Within each block, there are three intervention and three control sites. We have enrolled 129 participants to date and have completed 3 months follow-up data collection on 79 participants, and 6 months follow-up data collection on 20 participants. We plan to continue recruitment until we reach our target sample size, which we expect to reach by October 2023.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par52">This protocol describes a voluntary approach to introducing smoke-free living environments in housing where there is no mandated policy or where a mandated policy may be difficult to enforce. A voluntary approach has the benefit of being self-enforced and has the potential to catalyze a normative shift in smoking behaviors. Early adopters of smoke-free homes could motivate a critical mass of residents in a building to voluntarily adopt a smoke-free home, potentially paving the pathway for a building to become smoke-free. The proposed study protocol offers a potentially useful and scalable approach for other types of multi-unit housing that are considering implementing smoke-free policies.</p>
              <p id="Par53">Federal legislation prohibiting smoking in public housing authority housing does not address other multi-unit living arrangements like housing choice voucher programs or PSH, leaving a gap in the implementation of policies in housing for people that are disproportionately impacted by tobacco use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. Intersectional populations including low-income, multi-generational families with elderly residents and children who belong to racial/ethnic minority groups are over-represented in subsidized housing and are vulnerable to the harmful effects of SHS and heightened morbidity and mortality from tobacco use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. Low-income multi-unit housing residents have a higher prevalence of tobacco use than the general population, due in part to tobacco industry targeting of these populations and increased tobacco retail density in low-income communities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. These structural and commercial determinants of tobacco use highlight an urgent need for comprehensive smoke-free policies in all forms of multi-unit housing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par54">Current implementation efforts of smoke-free policies in public housing authority housing present important lessons for enforcement. A pre- and post-study that evaluated the effects of the 2018 federal ban on smoking in public housing on air nicotine concentration levels in New York City public housing, found no significant difference in nicotine levels between living areas where the policy was in effect to areas where there was no policy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. In a mixed methods evaluation of the federal smoke-free public housing policy in New York City, residents saw limited enforcement of the ban in the year following its implementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. Moreover, qualitative findings suggested that there would be resident and staff resistance to a mandated smoke-free policy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par55">In the context of these challenges, smoke-free home initiatives that include resident endorsement and provision of a designated smoking zone provide a promising alternative because they offer a self-enforced approach to having an indoor smoke-free policy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. A voluntary, self-enforced approach could facilitate transition to a building-wide smoke-free policy or increase impact of a smoke-free policy that is in place. Further, smoke-free home interventions that are tied to proven smoking cessation services (such as behavioral counseling and pharmacotherapy) are poised to promote a supportive environment where people are able to quit smoking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Results from our pilot study showed that 17% of participants reported carbon-monoxide verified abstinence at 6 month follow-up, and self-reporting a smoke-free home was associated with abstinence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par56">Housing is an important social determinant of health. People who have experienced homelessness have also faced lifelong trauma and chronic housing instability. Access to affordable housing including supportive housing and services is the foundation for health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. When those managing affordable housing demonstrate commitment to reducing environmental exposures like tobacco and the accompanying risk of tobacco-related morbidity and mortality, there is a greater opportunity for recovery. By promoting smoke-free homes and access to cessation services, we capitalize on the opportunity for housing to be the foundation of health and recovery.</p>
