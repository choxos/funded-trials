                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>A first-in-human, randomized pilot phase II clinical trial combining vaccines targeting overexpressed, non-mutated tumor blood vessel antigens (TBVA) and tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib was conducted in human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A2<sup>+</sup> patients with advanced melanoma.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Patient monocyte-derived type-1-polarized dendritic cells were loaded with HLA-A2-presented peptides derived from TBVA (DLK1, EphA2, HBB, NRP1, RGS5, TEM1) and injected intradermally as a vaccine into the upper extremities every other week. Patients were randomized into one of two treatment arms receiving oral dasatinib (70 mg two times per day) beginning in week 5 (Arm A) or in week 1 (Arm B). Trial endpoints included T cell response to vaccine peptides (interferon-γ enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot), objective clinical response (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors V.1.1) and exploratory tumor, blood and serum profiling of immune-associated genes/proteins.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Sixteen patients with advanced-stage cutaneous (n=10), mucosal (n=1) or uveal (n=5) melanoma were accrued, 15 of whom had previously progressed on programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) blockade. Of 13 evaluable patients, 6 patients developed specific peripheral blood T cell responses against ≥3 vaccine-associated peptides, with further evidence of epitope spreading. All six patients with specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response to vaccine-targeted antigens exhibited evidence of T cell receptor (TCR) convergence in association with preferred clinical outcomes (four partial response and two stabilization of disease (SD)). Seven patients failed to respond to vaccination (one SD and six progressive disease). Patients in Arm B (immediate dasatinib) outperformed those in Arm A (delayed dasatinib) for immune response rate (IRR; 66.7% vs 28.6%), objective response rate (ORR) (66.7% vs 0%), overall survival (median 15.45 vs 3.47 months; p=0.0086) and progression-free survival (median 7.87 vs 1.97 months; p=0.063). IRR (80% vs 25%) and ORR (60% vs 12.5%) was greater for females versus male patients. Tumors in patients exhibiting response to treatment displayed (1) evidence of innate and adaptive immune-mediated inflammation and TCR convergence at baseline, (2) on-treatment transcriptional changes associated with reduced hypoxia/acidosis/glycolysis, and (3) increased inflammatory immune cell infiltration and tertiary lymphoid structure neogenesis.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>Combined vaccination against TBVA plus dasatinib was safe and resulted in coordinating immunologic and/or objective clinical responses in 6/13 (46%) evaluable patients with melanoma, particularly those initiating treatment with both agents.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>The incidence of melanoma continues to rise, with American Cancer Society estimates of &gt;100,000 diagnoses of this form of cancer in 2021, and over 7180 disease-associated deaths.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> The landscape of first-line treatment options for patients with advanced-stage IIIB-IV melanoma has been recalibrated over the past decade with the advent of targeted small molecule inhibitors (ie, BRAFi, MEKi) and immune checkpoint blockade, resulting in increased rates of objective clinical response (OCR) but also a significant rise in the incidence of immune-related adverse events.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 3</xref> Despite improved rates of response, most patients with melanoma exhibit primary or acquired resistance to immune checkpoint blockade, reinforcing the need to develop effective salvage therapies.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p>
              <p>Although melanoma vaccines have been universally well-tolerated by patients,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> their performance in past phase II/III trials has proven disappointing overall, with minimal clinical benefits reported versus new standard-of-care therapies.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Numerous factors have been posited to limit vaccine efficacy in patients with cancer, including variance in host immune competency, heterogeneity in tumor antigenicity/immunogenicity, a tumor microenvironment (TME) refractory to vaccine-induced T effector cell infiltration and sustained ‘fitness’, and expansion of immunoregulatory networks, among others.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 5 7</xref> We have previously demonstrated in preclinical models that vaccines targeting non-mutated antigens (ie, DLK1, EphA2, HBB, NRP1, RGS5 and TEM1) overexpressed by tumor-associated (but not normal tissue-associated) vascular endothelial cells or pericytes promote T cell-dependent tumor vascular normalization in mice, resulting in superior immune cell recruitment, a pro-inflammatory TME and slowed tumor growth or regression.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8–10</xref> While dasatinib monotherapy is ineffective in treating patients with advanced melanoma,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> we and others have also reported that dasatinib functions as a potent adjuvant to specific vaccination in murine melanoma models.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12 13</xref> In this context, the combination of dasatinib +vaccine therapy promoted: (1) superior expansion and recruitment of therapeutic T cells into tumors (via locoregional production of CXCR3 ligand chemokines), (2) reduced tumor hypoxia and prevalence of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and regulatory T cells (Treg), (3) broadening/spreading in the antitumor CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell repertoire, and (4) extended overall survival.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p>
              <p>Based on these translational findings, we developed a single-center, prospective randomized pilot phase II clinical trial combining these modalities for the treatment of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A2<sup>+</sup> patients with advanced melanoma. We confirmed the safety, immunogenicity and antitumor efficacy of intradermal administration of autologous type-1 dendritic cells (αDC1) loaded with a mixture of six HLA-A2-presented peptides derived from the tumor-associated vascular antigens DLK1, EphA2, HBB, NRP1, RGS5 and TEM1 combined with daily oral administration of dasatinib (70 mg two times per day) as an immune adjuvant/conditioning agent in patients who had failed prior therapies, including checkpoint blockade.</p>

                <p>Sixteen patients were enrolled, with one patient voluntarily withdrawing from trial prior to vaccine generation and one patient expiring after vaccine generation but prior to treatment. Of the 14 patients receiving treatment, 13 were evaluable for all endpoint analyses, with 1 patient expiring prior to the completion of treatment cycle 1. Patients were randomized onto one of two treatment arms (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1A</xref>). All treated patients received an autologous αDC1/peptide vaccine administered by a single intradermal injection of approximately 10<sup>7</sup> cells on days 1 and 15 of each monthly therapy cycle. Intradermal administration of the vaccine was provided in the vicinity of the nodal drainage groups of the four extremities and was performed on an outpatient basis in the Hillman Cancer Center Clinical and Translational Research Center. Patients on Arm A started dasatinib administration (70 mg orally two times per day) on cycle 2, day 1 (ie, in week 5), while patients on Arm B began dasatinib administration on cycle 1, day 1 (ie, in week 1). Study treatment was continued for at least six cycles or until disease progression, intercurrent illness preventing further treatment, unacceptable adverse event(s), or unacceptable changes in the patient’s condition. Patients were followed for 1 year after removal from study treatment or until death, whichever occurred first.</p>

                <p>The primary endpoint of this clinical trial was patient peripheral blood T cell response to vaccine peptides based on interferon (IFN)-γ enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISPOT) analyses. Secondary endpoints included safety and investigator-assessed OCR and objective response rate (ORR) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) V.1.1, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and exploratory analyses of patient blood, tumor and serum specimens for treatment-associated changes in Treg/MDSC content (blood), vascular structure (tumor) and pro-inflammatory CXCL10 levels (serum). Radiographic imaging was performed at baseline and then approximately every 8–9 weeks until disease progression by CT or positron emission tomography/CT. Response assessments were predicated on RECIST V.1.1 criteria. Adverse events (AEs) were evaluated using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events V.4.0. Tumor biopsies were obtained prior to treatment and at week 5 on-treatment. Peripheral blood specimens were obtained at baseline and then every 2 weeks while on the study protocol. Biopsy tissues were analyzed using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and Thermo Fisher Ion Torrent-based transcriptional profiling platforms (Oncomine TCRB-LR Assay, Oncomine Immune Response Research Assay (OIRRA)).</p>

TCRβ chain repertoire libraries were constructed by multiplex PCR utilizing FR1 and constant gene targeting primers via the Oncomine TCRB-LR assay, then sequenced using the Ion Torrent S5 to a target depth of 1.5M raw reads per library. To evaluate T cell receptor (TCR) convergence, we searched for instances where TCRβ chains were identical in amino acid space but had distinct nucleotide sequences owing to N-addition and exonucleotide chewback within the V-D and D-J junctions of the complementary determining region 3. Targeted gene expression profiling of pretreatment and post-treatment tumor biopsies was performed using the OIRRA and total RNA input.</p>

                <title>Autologous αDC1/TBVA peptide vaccines + dasatinib are safe, immunogenic and promote clinical responses in PD-1-resistant patients with melanoma in association with extended OS</title>
                <p>Fourteen of 16 patients received autologous αDC1/tumor blood vessel antigens (TBVA) peptide vaccines plus dasatinib in two treatment arms distinguished by the start date for dasatinib administration (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>, <xref rid="SP2" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental figure S1A</xref>). The treatment arms were chosen to allow for a comparison of immunogenicity induced by vaccine alone versus vaccine + dasatinib in the first cycle, and to test whether concurrent or sequential administration of dasatinib is more effective. Thirteen of these 14 patients were evaluable for endpoint blood, serum and tumor biopsy analyses at the week 5 time point and CT imaging beginning in week 8/9, with 1 patient expiring in association with disease progression prior to completing cycle 1 of treatment. Although patient immunologic response to vaccine peptides was the primary endpoint in this study, we were struck by unexpected reductions in patient tumor sizes on-treatment, particularly for individuals treated on Arm B versus Arm A (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1B</xref>; p=0.044). Of the 13 evaluable patients, 6 patients (2 in Arm A and 4 in Arm B) developed specific peripheral blood CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses against ≥3 of the vaccine peptides that were not detected at baseline based on results obtained in IFN-γ ELISPOT assays (<xref rid="F1 F2" ref-type="fig">figures 1 and 2</xref>). As depicted in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1C</xref> (patient #1, Arm B) and <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1E</xref> (patient #5, Arm B) examples, vaccine-specific immune responses were detectable as early as trial week 3, with undulating levels of peptide-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells observed in longitudinal monitoring of peripheral blood on-treatment. Each of the six vaccine peptides was recognized by at least three evaluable patients, with peptides DLK1<sub>310-318</sub>, EphA2<sub>883-891</sub>, HBB<sub>31-39</sub>, NRP1<sub>433-441</sub>, RGS5<sub>5-13</sub> and TEM1<sub>691-700</sub> recognized by 6/6, 3/6, 5/6, 5/6, 4/6 and 4/6 of the immunologic responder patients on-treatment, respectively (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">figure 2A</xref>).</p>

                <p>Notably, four out of six patients exhibiting vaccine-specific T cell responses developed OCRs (four partial response (PR) and two stabilization of disease (SD); <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1D,F and 2A</xref>), and of the seven patients that failed to respond immunologically to vaccination, one patient exhibited SD (PFS, OS=8.3 months) while six patients had progressive disease (PD). Of the four patients achieving a PR on this trial, on-treatment CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses were detected against the vaccine DLK1, EphA2, HBB, NRP1, RGS5 and TEM1 peptides in 4/4, 2/4, 4/4, 3/4, 2/4 and 3/4 cases, respectively (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">figure 2A</xref>). Patients treated on Arm B (ie, combined vaccine + immediate dasatinib from treatment outset) displayed significantly improved OS (median 19.1 vs 8.3 months; p=0.0086) and a trend for improved PFS (median 7.9 vs 2.2 months; p=0.063) versus patients treated on Arm A (ie, vaccine + delayed dasatinib administration beginning in week 5; <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">figure 2B</xref>, <xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental table S2</xref>).

                <p>Overall, the combination vaccine + dasatinib immunotherapy was well-tolerated, with no treatment-related AEs &gt; grade 3 observed (<xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental tables S3 and S4</xref>). Among the 15 patients receiving at least one vaccine, the most commonly observed AEs included anemia (8 patients), fatigue (10 patients) and hyponatremia (9 patients), consistent with AEs reported for dasatinib monotherapy. Patients treated on Arm B versus Arm A had increased incidence of fever (33% vs 0%), headache (33% vs 0%), maculopapular rash (50% vs 11%), nausea (83% vs 11%), neutrophil count reduction (67% vs 22%), platelet count reduction (50% vs 22%) and vomiting (67% vs 0%).</p>

We observed that while evenness in patients’ TCR repertoires at baseline or on-treatment failed to correlate with immunologic response to vaccination or to patient PFS or OS (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">figure 3C,D</xref>), TCR convergence was significantly associated with all three of these trial endpoints (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">figure 3C–E</xref>).

                <p>These data suggest that αDC1-TBVA peptide-based vaccines were most effective in patients who were immunologically competent to (1) respond to vaccine inclusive peptide epitopes and (2) coordinately develop spreading in their antitumor T cell repertoires. Therapeutic T cell responses were not characterized by the expansion of dominant T cell clonotypes within the peripheral repertoire, but rather with the development of polyclonal populations of T cells exhibiting common specificity (ie, convergence).</p>

                <p>To determine characteristics of the autologous αDC1 cell product that might be associated with patient on-treatment T cell responses against vaccine epitopes (ie, immune response (IR)) and beneficial clinical outcome (ie, PR), patient vaccine DC were phenotypically-profiled and transcriptionally-profiled in exploratory analyses. Levels of cytokines secreted from patient αDC1 were also analyzed by ELISA. We observed that DC expression (%-positive and mean fluorescence intensity (MFI)) of biomarkers traditionally used in αDC1 cell product release criteria, including CD11c, CD14, CD25, CD40, CD80, CD83, CD86, CD206, CCR7 and HLA-DR failed to discriminate vaccine DC generated from responders versus non-responders (data not shown). Extended flow cytometry analyses of cell surface costimulatory and checkpoint molecules on vaccine αDC1 similarly failed to identify potential biomarkers associated with treatment outcome, with the possible exception of OX40L, which appeared to be expressed at higher levels on αDC1 from patients who failed to respond immunologically to vaccination (<xref rid="SP2" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental figure S5</xref>; p = 0.035). Analyses of levels of interleukin (IL)-12p70 and IL-10 secreted by vaccine αDC1 did not identify differences associated with patient immunologic or clinical response to treatment (data not shown).</p>

                <title>Development of a TLS transcriptional profile in tumors on-treatment predicts immunologic/clinical outcomes</title>
                <p>Based on recent reports linking patient with melanoma response to immunotherapy with the presence or treatment-induced formation of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) within the TME,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24–26</xref> we developed a custom NanoString probe set for 23 TLS-associated genes and analyzed RNA isolated from patient tumor biopsies at baseline and for changes in transcript expression on-treatment. While baseline profiling of TLS-associated gene transcripts was not predictive of subsequent patient response to vaccination (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">figure 6A</xref>), hierarchical clustering of TLS-associated DEGs segregated patients with vaccine/clinical responses versus those with progressive disease that failed to respond immunologically to the vaccine (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">figure 6B</xref>). Specifically, as shown in <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">figure 6B,C</xref>, only patients with positive outcomes displayed increased on-treatment expression of gene transcripts linked to TLS formation (<italic toggle="yes">CCL19, CCL21, LTA, LTB, TNFSF14</italic>), high endothelial venule development (<italic toggle="yes">CHST2, FUT4</italic>), immune cell infiltration and inflammation (<italic toggle="yes">CD8A, CD20, CD274, CXCL10, IFNG, LAMP3, TBX21</italic>). Patient #13 (SD, immunologic non-responder) clustered with PD patients in exhibiting a deficiency in expression of TLS-associated biomarker transcripts. Furthermore, we noted that the emergence of a TLS biosignature in the therapeutic TME was strongly correlated (p&lt;0.001) with epitope spreading in the peripheral CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell repertoire (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">figure 6D,E</xref>). Hence, while we were unable to assess histopathologic presence of TLS in situ due to limited amounts of tumor biopsy tissue, these data suggest that effective vaccination against TBVA may promote a therapeutic TME characterized by a TLS transcriptional bio-signature and epitope spreading in the peripheral T cell repertoire.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>In this pilot phase II trial, we observed that treatment of advanced, patients with checkpoint-refractory melanoma with an autologous αDC1-based vaccine targeting TBVA together with a TME conditioning agent (dasatinib) was safe, immunogenic and therapeutically effective. These results parallel findings in our preclinical tumor models.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> AEs were consistent with those observed in previous clinical studies of dasatinib monotherapy,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27 28</xref> with no discernable impact from the vaccine component in the combination regimen, as one would predict from the consensus safety profile (ie, grade 1–2 skin reactions, flu-like symptoms) for past DC/peptide-based vaccines administered alone or in combination with alternate interventional agents.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></p>
              <p>Given previous reports for clinical efficacy of DC-based vaccines being associated with patient with melanoma T cell responses against multiple versus single target epitopes,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> our primary endpoint required patient T cell reactivity against three or more vaccine peptides for designation as a positive response. Six of 13 evaluable patients developed specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses to ≥3 vaccine peptides on-treatment (ie, 46% IRR), with all of the immunologic responder patients exhibiting preferred clinical outcomes (ie, 4 PR and 2 SD). Notably, in patients responding to vaccination, anti-TBVA peripheral blood T cell responses undulated over time on treatment, consistent with results from prior DC-based vaccine trials<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31–33</xref> and suggestive of reiterative temporal rounds of specific T cell cross-priming and recruitment of vaccine-induced T cells from blood into the TME. Conversely, seven evaluable patients who failed to respond to vaccination had comparatively poor clinical outcomes (one SD and six PD). Remarkably, patients treated on Arm B developed superior outcomes versus patients treated on Arm A with respect to IRR (66.7% vs 28.6%), ORR (66.7% vs 0%), OS (median 15.45 vs 3.47 months) and PFS (median 7.87 vs 1.97 months). By comparison, a phase II study of dasatinib (70 mg two times per day) monotherapy in 51 evaluable patients with advanced-stage melanoma yielded an ORR of 5.9%, with median OS and PFS of 7.5 and 2.1 months, respectively.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></p>
              <p>The observed inter-cohort differences in immunologic/clinical outcomes could reflect the benefit of dasatinib administered during the initial vaccine priming phase of therapy for patients on Arm B versus Arm A, with the latter patients receiving vaccine alone for the first cycle of treatment. In this regard, dasatinib has been previously reported to enhance specific T cell cross-priming and to improve OS in murine tumor (melanoma, breast carcinoma) models treated with combination vaccine protocols.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12 34</xref> Dasatinib is also known to improve innate pro-inflammatory natural killer (NK) effector cell activity<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> and to enhance the immunostimulatory capacity of DC,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> while coordinately reducing levels of immunoregulatory cell populations such as Treg and MDSC in the TME of treated animals.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Any of these drug-associated effects would be anticipated to augment DC-mediated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell cross-priming in vivo.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> With these caveats, we observed that while the magnitude of peak T cell responses against vaccine and non-vaccine peptides did not differ significantly between the immunologic responders in Arm A versus Arm B (data not shown), the kinetics of patient T cell responses were strikingly different based on treatment arm. On-treatment time to first detection of positive patient T cell response against vaccine peptides was 3.5±1.0 weeks in Arm B versus 8.5±0.7 in Arm A (p=0.0035, t-test), while time to first detection of positive patient T cell response to non-vaccine peptides was 3.9±1.1 weeks in Arm B versus 9.5±0.7 weeks in Arm A (p=0.0018, t-test). This temporal shift in patient response between the two treatment arms roughly approximates to the delay in initiating dasatinib administration as a co-therapeutic agent/vaccine adjuvant to patients treated on Arm A, suggesting the importance of dasatinib in enabling vaccine-induced T cell (cross)priming by the combination regimen.</p>
              <p>Counterintuitively, dasatinib can also (reversibly) inhibit lymphocyte cell-specific protein-tyrosine kinase (LCK), a Src-family tyrosine kinase required for effective TCR-mediated signaling in T cells.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> In this regard, it has been suggested that transient interruption of TCR signaling in the cancer setting may be beneficial to sustaining antitumor T cell fitness and preventing T cell apoptosis due to chronic antigen-specific stimulation.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Expanded studies evaluating the fitness and polyfunctionality of therapeutic T cells in the periphery and the TME of treated individuals will be required to address these mechanistic possibilities in future dasatinib-based combination immunotherapies.</p>
              <p>An alternate or additional consideration impacting the apparent superior efficacy of the Arm B regimen in our study may reflect an imbalance in male/female composition among evaluable patients in the two treatment arms (ie, 2/7 (28%) women in Arm A vs 3/6 (50%) women in Arm B). As such, the data could support possible gender bias in IRR (80% vs 25%) and ORR (60% vs 12.5%) favoring female versus male patients treated on the Arm B versus Arm A regimens, respectively. Interestingly, a growing literature argues for the convention that women (and males with hypogonadism) exhibit stronger pro-inflammatory responses when compared with intact men, with women at higher risk to develop autoimmune-related pathologies.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39–41</xref> Indeed, 80% of systemic autoimmune diseases have been reported to occur in women.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> Relevant to the UPCI 12-048 trial, women have also been reported to respond more robustly than men to vaccination in the infectious disease setting,<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39 40</xref> in murine tumor models receiving anti-PD-1 checkpoint blockade immunotherapy,<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> and in patients with melanoma with low-moderate levels of partially-exhausted cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes receiving combination anti-PD-1-based immunotherapies.<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43 44</xref> Such female versus male dominance in response to immunotherapy has been correlated to sex-associated differences in the microbiome,<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45 46</xref> gene-dosing effects of X-chromosome-linked immune gene products, and the comparative immunostimulatory versus immunoregulatory action of estrogens versus androgens, respectively.<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> However, there are reports that clearly support an opposing viewpoint for the superior efficacy of vaccines and checkpoint blockade-based interventions in men versus women.<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47 48</xref> These contrasting results may relate to the specific immune pathways primarily targeted by the applied regimens, with gender-dimorphism in the targeted pathways dictating differential outcomes to treatment between the sexes. Given the greater incidence of solid cancers in men versus women,<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> it will be important that prospective translational and clinical studies of (combination vaccine) immunotherapies be designed in accordance with sex and gender equity in research guidelines.<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> Furthermore, confounding variables such as age, sex hormone concentrations, hormone replacement therapies, body mass index and menopausal status should be factored into the analysis and interpretation of future study outcomes as potential covariates.</p>
              <p>Our trial included patients with cutaneous, mucosal and uveal melanoma, with the latter indications notoriously difficult to treat with interventional therapies, including immunotherapies.<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> Notably, the demographics of patient site of primary melanoma differed between the treatment arms (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">figure 2A</xref>, <xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental table S1</xref>) which could conceivably impact vaccine outcomes, with Arm A containing a higher frequency of patients with uveal melanoma (44.4% vs 16.7% in Arm B) and mucosal melanoma (11.1% vs 0% for Arm B) and Arm B containing more patients with cutaneous melanoma (83.3% vs 44% in Arm A). However, IRR was greater for both cutaneous (60% vs 0%) and uveal (100% vs 25%) patients with melanoma treated on Arm B versus Arm A, and PR to treatment was observed in 60% versus 0% of patients with cutaneous melanoma and 100% versus 0% of patients with uveal melanoma treated on Arm B versus Arm A (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">figure 2A</xref>). These data suggest that the Arm B treatment regimen may be superior to Arm A irrespective of the patient’s site of primary disease.</p>
              <p>As was the case in foundational murine melanoma modeling developed using this combined vaccine approach,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> we observed that patients that coordinately developed CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses against multiple vaccine peptides and OCR also displayed evidence for expanded T cell reactivity against antigens that were not targeted in the vaccine, but which are considered disease-relevant as they derive from known melanoma differentiation antigens or TBVA. Such DC-dependent spreading in the peripheral T cell repertoire has been previously reported to occur in patients exhibiting OCR after treatment with a range of immunotherapies (ie, vaccines, gene therapies, checkpoint blockade, recombinant cytokines; <xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental table S1</xref>).<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14 15 52</xref> In such cases, the extended T cell response against tumor (differentiation, oncofetal, mutated neo-) antigens is believed to improve immune-mediated control of antigenically-diverse tumor lesions, providing an operational improvement in immune surveillance over that enforced by vaccine-specific T cells or adoptively-transferred monospecific T cells.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14 52 53</xref></p>
              <p>As an alternate means to assess changes in the patient’s T cell repertoire on trial, coordinate profiling of TCRVβ chain transcripts was performed. In contrast to several recent reports associating baseline/on-treatment peripheral blood TCR clonotypic evenness with improved PFS, OS, ORR and/or OCR in trials administering cancer vaccines or checkpoint blockade,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17 54</xref> we did not observe a significant association between baseline or on-treatment TCR evenness in peripheral blood with patient responsiveness to vaccination, PFS, OS or OCR (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">figure 3</xref>). However, we did identify significant associations between TCR convergence (indicative of antigen-driven responses) and IRR, PFS, OS and OCR in baseline and (particularly) on-treatment peripheral blood specimens that were analyzed (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">figure 3</xref>). These findings are similar to those reported by Naidus <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic><xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref> where peripheral blood TCR convergence was directly correlated to patient OS after PD-L1 blockade in patients with advanced-stage non-small cell lung cancer. These data suggest that TCR convergence in peripheral blood T cells may represent an actionable biomarker for (1) identification of patients most likely to respond to immunotherapeutic interventions that mechanistically require T cell responses to achieve preferred clinical outcomes and (2) effective longitudinal monitoring of therapeutically meaningful T cell responses in patients on-treatment.</p>
              <p>One major unresolved question for the field of DC-based vaccines relates to the identification of biomarkers associated the ability of injected DC to elicit therapeutic antitumor T cell responses in treated patients. Although all patient-derived type-1-polarized αDC1 were generated using a standard operating protocol and passed release criteria for use in vaccine formulations, consistent with recent reports,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 56</xref> we observed that none of the markers used to traditionally qualify vaccine DC (ie, CD11c, CD14, CD25, CD40, CD80, CD83, CD86, CD206, CCR7, HLA-DR, IL-12p70 production, IL-10 production, IL-12p70/IL-10 ratio) were correlated with patient specific T cell or clinical responses. Extended analysis of costimulatory/coinhibitory molecules on vaccine αDC1 cells by flow cytometry similarly failed to demonstrate associations with patient response to vaccination (<xref rid="SP2" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental figure S5</xref>), with the exception of OX40L which appeared to be expressed at higher levels on αDC1 generated from patients that failed to respond to vaccination. In this context, it is interesting to note that subsets of OX40L<sup>+</sup> DC have recently been reported to selectively promote Treg expansion<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref> and melanoma progression.<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref></p>
              <p>Despite our general inability to identify potential vaccine bioefficacy markers using protein-based methods, Affymetrix gene chip transcriptional profiling of patient-generated vaccine DC revealed possible associations between preferred outcomes (ie, IRR and OCR) with biomarkers linked to DC maturation (ie, <italic toggle="yes">CSF2/GMCSF</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">LAMP3, RELB</italic>), naïve T cell priming by antigen presenting cells (ie, <italic toggle="yes">BTNL8</italic>), pro-inflammatory immunity/Type-1 IFN signaling (ie, <italic toggle="yes">CXCL14, CXCR3, IL34, IRF3, PKN1</italic>), cell survival (ie, <italic toggle="yes">TRAF1, TRAF2</italic>) and intriguingly, the formation of lymphoid structures (ie, <italic toggle="yes">LTB, TLX1</italic>).<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59 60</xref> Conversely, vaccine DC associated with superior patient IRR/OCR were deficient in expression of gene products associated with immune cell apoptosis (ie, <italic toggle="yes">BID</italic>), immature DC (ie, <italic toggle="yes">CD47, ITGB3BP</italic>) or immune suppression/tolerance (ie, <italic toggle="yes">IL18BP</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">LAIR</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">PTGER2</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">RGS5</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">SATB1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">TGFBI</italic>).<xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61 62</xref> Gene signature analyses suggested inferiority in overall αDC1 functionality in patients with NIR/PD (<xref rid="SP2" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental figure S6</xref>). Validation of these DC vaccine biomarkers for their capacity to predict patient IRR/OCR on-treatment will need to be carefully evaluated within the context of immunologic monitoring in future clinical trial designs.</p>
              <p>Transcriptional profiling of tumor biopsies at baseline revealed several potential biomarkers associated with immunologic and clinical response to autologous αDC1-based vaccination in the current trial, with GSEA suggesting existing adaptive immune presence as predictive of patient IR/PR status on-treatment (<xref rid="SP2" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental figure S10</xref>). Consistent with several recent reports, expression of CD274/PD-L1 in baseline tumors appeared predictive of patient response to our immunotherapeutic intervention.<xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref> These immunologically ‘hot’ tumors also expressed high levels of a range of transcripts associated with recruitment of inflammatory innate immune effector cells (<italic toggle="yes">CCL3</italic>), including NK andinnate lymphoid cells (<italic toggle="yes">KIR2DL2, NCR1/NKp46, NCR3/NKp30</italic>), secretory/cytolytic cells (<italic toggle="yes">GLNY, SRGN</italic>) and antigen presenting cells (<italic toggle="yes">CD80, CD86, CD226, HLA-DMB, ICOSLG, ITGAM, ITGB2</italic>) into a TME that is deficient in acidosis/hypoxia based on reduced expression of <italic toggle="yes">CA4</italic>.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> That CBLB expression in baseline tumors was associated with superior response to treatment was somewhat surprising as this E3-ligase has been previously reported to negatively regulate the function of immune cells, including CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and DC.<xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref> One possible explanation for our observations may reflect the reported need for Src family kinase activation of CBLB for its reported immunoregulatory activity.<xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref> Hence, provision of the Src inhibitor dasatinib within the context of our combined immunotherapy might be envisioned to release immune cells from CBLB-mediated suppression in support of beneficial immune-mediated treatment outcomes.</p>
              <p>Molecular changes in the TME associated with response to vaccination (IR, OCR) included a reduction in hypoxia (<italic toggle="yes">HIF1A</italic>) and glycolysis (<italic toggle="yes">IRS1</italic>) indices, consistent with the expectation for vascular normalization as an endpoint for this vaccine approach targeting TBVA.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8–10</xref> A strengthening of transcript profiles associated with immune cell recruitment (<italic toggle="yes">CCL2, CX3CL1, JAML</italic>), and a more diversified immune cell profile including B cells (<italic toggle="yes">CD22</italic>), DC/macrophages/monocytes (<italic toggle="yes">MRC1, S100A8, S100A9</italic>), NK cells (<italic toggle="yes">FCGR3A/CD16, KIR2DL2</italic>) and secretory/cytotoxic cells (<italic toggle="yes">GNLY</italic>) was observed in the tumors of patients responsive to treatment. Based on reduced levels of <italic toggle="yes">PTPN11/SHP2</italic> transcript expression in the tumors of responding patients, one may also hypothesize that immune cells within the therapeutic TME may be less encumbered by regulatory signaling molecules containing ITIM motifs, including checkpoint and KIR molecules.<xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">66 67</xref> Surprisingly, OIRRA-based profiling suggested that lower levels of <italic toggle="yes">ISG15</italic> transcript expression in the TME on-treatment were linked to superior OS (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">figure 5F</xref>). Although ISG15 protein has been reported to serve as an effective adjuvant to vaccination,<xref rid="R68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref> it is also known to represent a biomarker of poor prognosis in the cancer setting<xref rid="R69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref> and to mediate pro-tumor immunoregulatory activity.<xref rid="R70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref> GSEA supported enhanced vascular-immune crosstalk, innate and adaptive immune cell presence, and antigen-presenting cell function in the TME of patients with IR/PR versus NIR/PD on trial (<xref rid="SP2" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental figure S11</xref>).</p>
              <p>Complementary NanoString-based transcriptional profiling clearly distinguished patients that performed well on trial (IR, OCR) versus patients that failed to respond to the vaccine either immunologically or clinically (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">figure 6B</xref>). Responding tumors transcript profiles were enriched in biomarkers of inflammation (<italic toggle="yes">CD274, CXCL10, IFNG, IRF1, TBX21, TNFA</italic>), cytotoxic effector cells (<italic toggle="yes">GZMB</italic>) and tertiary lymphoid structures (<italic toggle="yes">CCL19, CCL21, CD8A, CD20, CHST4, CXCL13, FUT4, LAMP3, LTA, LTB, TNFSF14</italic>). These findings are consistent with recent reports supporting the association of TLS neogenesis in the TME with favorable clinical response to immunotherapy.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24 25</xref> It is also interesting to speculate that therapeutic TLS formation in the TME may serve as a center for expanded T cell cross-priming and spreading in the antitumor CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell repertoire, since these events were strongly correlated in this trial (p=0.0005 and p=0.00098, respectively; <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">figure 6D,E</xref>).</p>
              <p>Finally, it is worth noting that all patients treated on this trial had previously received at least one form of prior immunotherapy, including rIL-2, rIFNα, checkpoint blockade and/or vaccines (<xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental table S1</xref>). We observed no apparent impact of prior treatment on patient outcomes on the current trial, with five of the six immunologic/clinical responders having demonstrated primary and/or acquired resistance to prior treatment with checkpoint blockade, and the remaining responder (ie, patient #14) being checkpoint treatment naive (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">figure 2A</xref>). Four patients, including three on treatment Arm A (ie, patients #4, #7, #9) and patient #5 treated on Arm B had received previous autologous DC-based vaccines (ie, adenovirus-engineered DC expressing MAGE-6, MART1 and tyrosinase; <xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental table S1</xref>), however, the vaccine antigens used in the previous trial and the current trial do not overlap and we observed no baseline T cell responses against TBVA antigens in these patients (assuming spreading might could have occurred in T cell responses as a consequence of the prior vaccination regimen).</p>
              <p>The authors acknowledge several limitations in this phase II clinical trial including its small sample size, its inclusion of advanced stage patients with cutaneous, mucosal or uveal forms of melanoma, and the characterization of the therapeutic TME which was restricted to use of transcriptional profiling rather than tissue imaging technologies (particularly in the context of TLS). Our findings must be confirmed in larger cohort studies in future trials. In this regard, we plan to extend our investigation of αDC1/TBVA peptide-based vaccines in two NIH-supported, prospective phase II clinical trials to be initiated in 2021. In one trial (NCT04093323), up to 24 advanced-stage HLA-A2<sup>+</sup> patients with melanoma with primary resistance to anti-PD-1 will be treated with autologous αDC1/TBVA and a systemic chemokine modulating regimen (ie, combined IFNα<sub>2</sub>, rintatolimod, celecoxib) designed to enhance vaccine-induced TIL recruitment and to potentially support enhanced TLS formation by sustaining inflammation in the therapeutic TME. In the other trial, up to 21 patients with early-stage HLA-A2<sup>+</sup> with clear-cell renal cell carcinoma will receive autologous αDC1/TBVA peptide-based vaccination combined with low-dose cabozantinib in the neoadjuvant setting beginning 6 weeks prior to planned surgery, with tumors evaluated for treatment-associated changes in size, vascular structure, immune infiltration, TIL TCR repertoire and TLS formation.</p>
              <p>In summary, our data support the safety and immunogenicity of vaccination against non-mutated TBVAs overexpressed by the tumor-associated vasculature, and they provide a preliminary indication of the therapeutic efficacy of this treatment approach in patients with checkpoint-refractory disease particularly when combined with early dasatinib co-administration. Since the TBVAs targeted in this trial are overexpressed in multiple cancer types, these outcomes have implications for future vaccine protocols designed to treat patients with diverse forms of solid, vascularized tumors.</p>
