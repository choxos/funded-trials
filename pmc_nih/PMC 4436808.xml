                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Cystic fibrosis (CF) leads to advanced lung disease despite aggressive care. Persistent inflammation and oxidative stress contribute to exacerbations and disease progression. Flaxseed (FS), a dietary botanical supplement with high fiber, lignan phenolics, and omega-3 fatty acids has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties in murine models of acute and chronic lung injury. This pilot study was designed to determine whether CF patients could tolerate FS, evaluate circulating FS metabolites, and study biomarkers of lung damage, as a prelude to studying clinical outcomes.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>10 CF patients and 5 healthy volunteers consumed 40 g of FS daily for 4 weeks with safety and tolerability being assessed. Urine was evaluated for systemic oxidative stress and plasma for FS metabolites (enterolignans) and cytokine levels. Buccal swabs were analyzed for gene expression of Nrf2-regulated antioxidant enzymes including Heme Oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and NAD(P)H Quinone Oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1).</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>All subjects completed the study without serious adverse events. Plasma levels of enterolignans were detectable in both healthy controls and CF volunteers. CF patients were stratified based on plasma enterolignan levels after 2 weeks of FS administration into high- (174 to 535 nM ED and 232 to 1841 nM EL) and low- (0 to 32 nM ED and 0 to 40 nM EL) plasma lignan cohorts. The low enterolignan level cohort experienced a statistically significant drop in urinary inflammatory IsoP and plasma TNFα levels, while demonstrating higher average NQO1 mRNA levels in buccal epithelium compared to high-lignan patients.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>This pilot study demonstrated that FS is tolerated by CF patients. FS metabolites could be detected in the plasma. Future studies will assess appropriate dosing and target populations for FS, while exploring clinical outcomes.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p>Cystic fibrosis results from malfunction of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) responsible for chloride transport; this therefore affects the viscosity of mucus covering epithelia throughout the body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Dysfunction contributes to chronic sinusitis, pancreatic insufficiency, and pulmonary infections with virulent pathogens including <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> and methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Exacerbations are characterized by inflammation measured in the blood, urine, and sputum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p>
              <p>Despite enzyme replacement, antibiotics, and broncho-pulmonary hygiene – standard practice helping to improve life expectancy in CF, exacerbations still occur and as lung function declines, quality of life worsens and early death is common. Dietary antioxidants have shown promise when used in cardiovascular diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]; but their use has never been validated in CF.</p>
              <p>Christofidou-Solomidou has investigated the use of antioxidants in acute and chronic lung injury pioneering animal models of acute and chronic systemic oxidative stress to evaluate the anti-inflammatory/antioxidant potential of naturally occurring phytochemicals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Flaxseed (FS), a wholegrain rich in omega-3 fatty acids and lignans demonstrates potent anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-fibrotic properties in murine models of ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) and radiation-induced lung injury (RILI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Omega-3 fatty acids reduce inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], while lignans are potent antioxidant phytoestrogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. FS has been well tolerated in studies involving patients with diabetes or prostate cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p>
              <p>Patients with CF are often excluded from dietary studies because investigators hypothesize malabsorption might negate beneficial properties of the study compound. Serum levels of FS metabolites – enterodiol (ED) and enterolactone (EL) can be sustained in healthy volunteers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and we aimed to demonstrate this with our CF cohort.</p>
              <p>FS in murine models induces the expression of phase II detoxification and antioxidant enzymes (Heme Oxygenase 1 (HO-1) and NAD(P)H Quinone Oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1)), transcriptionally regulated by Nrf2 binding to the antioxidant response element (ARE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Validated biomarkers of systemic oxidative stress, 8,12-iso-iPF2α-VI isoprostane (IsoP) and DNA damage, 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2′deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dGuo) have been utilized to quantify inflammation and oxidative stress in diseases including CF and were quantified here as secondary outcome measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p>
              <p>We wanted to know if FS is safe and tolerable in stable CF adults as compared to healthy volunteers. We secondarily hypothesized that FS with its beneficial properties would increase antioxidant gene expression. Lastly, we hoped to measure biomarkers of chronic inflammation and oxidative stress in urine and plasma. This is the first study to investigate the effect of FS on inflammation and oxidative stress in patients with CF. Hopefully it will lead to future studies that can demonstrate improvement in clinically relevant outcomes, including enhanced nutrition and lung function, and decreased exacerbations.</p>

                <p>All fifteen subjects were enrolled to consume 40 grams of finely ground wholegrain FS for one month provided in resealable individual pouches. On the first visit prior to starting FS, blood, urine and buccal swab samples were collected to establish baseline values of FS metabolite levels, biomarkers of oxidative stress and DNA damage, as well as baseline levels of gene expression of antioxidants HO-1 and NQO1.</p>
                <p>Each patient consumed 40 grams of finely-ground flaxseed daily in the manner of their choice, typically as a primary ingredient in a smoothie. Patients returned each week to supply blood and urine samples to trend biomarkers of oxidative stress and trend levels of FS metabolites enterodiol and enterolactone, a metabolism requiring intact gut flora. If no side effects related to FS ingestion were recorded by the patient, one week during that month could be skipped in terms of supplying samples for the study – but FS was continued during that time. After one month on FS, the patient again returned to the clinic to supply blood, urine and now a follow up buccal swab to establish if after one month of FS, endogenous levels of antioxidant enzymes were boosted by FS administration. Lastly, after another month now off of FS, each patient was asked to return to the clinic to supply blood, urine, and buccal swabs to this time establish if off the supplement, biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation, as well as lignan levels, and endogenous antioxidant enzyme expression reverted back to baseline levels originally collected approximately 2 months prior.</p>

                <title>Enrollment criteria and outcome variables</title>
                <p>This feasibility-pilot study was conducted at the University of Pennsylvania in accordance and after approval by the Institutional Review Board of the same institution, which approved the study prior to its initiation. Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> displays patient enrollment and exclusions. 10 adult patients were recruited from the Adult CF Center and provided informed consent. Exclusion criteria included prior or planned hospitalization or surgical procedure within 1 month of enrollment (other than simple dental procedure); an acute pulmonary exacerbation; history of bowel resection, inflammatory bowel disease or distal intestinal obstruction syndrome; receiving broad spectrum intravenous or oral antibiotics (other than maintenance oral azithromycin or inhaled antibiotics) within 1 month of enrollment; current supplementation with FS or soy derivatives or allergies to them; active or prior ingestion of Vitamin E exceeding 30 IU within 21 days; significant liver disease (cirrhosis); significant renal dysfunction (GFR below 50 ml/hr/m<sup>2</sup>); or poorly controlled diabetes (evidenced by HgbA1c &gt; 7.5%).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Study Enrollment Flow Diagram. Study enrollment opened July 2012. 67 CF cases were reviewed to determine eligibility. All cases were reviewed by 3 board-certified pulmonary and critical care physicians actively caring for adults with CF. 50 patients immediately met pre-determined exclusion criteria: actively infected, actively on intravenous antibiotics, recently had surgery, had gut issues or were known to be unreliable (&gt;3 office no shows). 17 CF patients met eligibility criteria so were interviewed during the 3-month open enrollment period. Another 5 patients refused to participate due to distance from Philadelphia, concerns about meeting the requirements of the study, or were just not interested. Among the 12 patients that consented and began the trial, another 2 withdrew for personal reasons. Between July – November 2012, 10 CF patients completed the study.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12906_2015_651_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>
                <p>5 healthy adult volunteers from the University of Pennsylvania research and clinical community were recruited and provided informed consent to serve as controls. They were generally healthy without major medical problems, as determined by review of their past medical history by 2 co-investigators. No study volunteers could exceed age 65 or have extremes of BMI (&lt;18 or &gt;35).</p>
                <p>Primary outcome was feasibility, toxicity, and tolerability of dietary FS administration in CF as documented through weekly surveys conducted at clinic - assessing side effects, serious adverse events, and favorable effects of FS. Secondary outcomes included measurements of urinary biomarkers of systemic oxidative stress and plasma levels of FS metabolites enterodiol (ED) and enterolactone (EL). Blood and urine samples were obtained at 5 time points (Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>): 1) Baseline – prior to FS; 2) FS – 1 Week; 3) FS – 2 Weeks; 4) FS – 4 Weeks and 5) 4 Weeks post-FS supplementation. Subjects consumed FS in a manner of their choice. Urine was analyzed for F2-IsoP and 8-oxo-dGuo levels. Plasma was analyzed for FS metabolites and systemic cytokines. A buccal swab was obtained at baseline, after 4 weeks of FS supplementation, and at 4 weeks post-FS to determine antioxidant gene expression.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Study Schematic. Total duration of the study was 8 weeks. Patients (10 adult cystic fibrosis patients and 5 healthy volunteers) were enrolled at T = 0 at which time blood, urine and buccal swabs were collected to establish baseline levels of lignans, cytokines, isoprostanes, and 8-oxo-dGuo. Urine and blood samples were drawn during each visit at 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks.

                <p>The plasma specimens were aliquoted and stored at −80°C until lignan measurements could be performed. 5 ml of blood was obtained prior to starting FS, approximately 15–20 ml of blood was obtained while the patient ingested FS, and 5 ml of blood was obtained after a one-month period of washout when no FS had been ingested, for a total of approximately 30 ml of blood obtained during the pilot. Urine samples were collected, centrifuged at 1500 RPM (297*g force) for 5 min to settle debris and also stored at −80°C until measurements of oxidation and inflammation could be performed.</p>

Paired t-tests (at defined α &lt; 0.05), comparing plasma lignans, oxidative stress biomarkers, plasma cytokines, and buccal epithelium antioxidant mRNA levels were performed for both healthy volunteers and all CF patients evaluating FS-induced changes from baseline within each respective cohort. Upon evaluating individual CF patient levels of plasma lignans, we separated all CF patients (n = 10) into cohorts with low plasma lignans (n = 6) and high plasma lignans (n = 4). This decision was made, post-hoc, as some patients had undetectable levels, while others had levels similar to healthy controls. Pairwise comparisons were then performed on these groups. Paired t-tests or their non-parametric equivalents, Fisher’s exact test and box plots were generated using SAS 9.3 and Stata data analysis and statistical software (release 12, Stata Corp, College Station, TX). No corrections were made for multiple comparisons, as only a few planned comparisons within separate cohorts were made. Additionally this was a small pilot study – hypothesis-generating for future work and such corrections would not change the conclusion of the study.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>This study validated the safety and tolerability of FS in stable CF patients. We demonstrated FS could be safely added to the diet of CF patients without adding unwanted side effects or causing exacerbations. 100% completion of the trial occurred with no SAEs. The primary side effect (well documented) was change in gut motility. CF patients were split into cohorts based on plasma enterolignan levels. The low lignan group demonstrated statistically significant decreases in oxidative stress and inflammatory biomarkers along with upregulation of phase II detoxification/antioxidant enzymes.</p>
              <p>Our results differed the ones seen by Milby et al. in lung cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy (XRT), as they consumed FS muffins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. They likewise studied FS safety and tolerability while measuring biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation. Our population, having the freedom to ingest FS however and whenever they chose could divide FS throughout the day mixing it in shakes, smoothies, etc. thus maximizing tolerability. In contrast, administering dry texture FS muffins seemed to reduce tolerability among oncology patients with xerostomia in Milby <italic>et.al</italic>. Oxidative stress biomarkers also trended lower in this trial.</p>
              <p>Intact gut flora facilitates metabolism of FS enriched in secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG) to ED and EL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Malabsorption due to pancreatic insufficiency might have played a role in lower lignan levels. 7 of 10 patients were maintained on azithromycin therapy (initiated long prior to enrollment in this study), likely having reached homeostasis with enteric bacteria. Azithromycin alone would not have eradicated gut flora. SDG is rapidly converted by human intestinal microbiota to SECO and further to the mammalian lignans ED and EL, and is excreted in urine and feces. While no SDG was detected in the plasma of controls and CF patients, FS consumption has been shown to correlate with accumulation of ED and EL levels in plasma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p>
              <p>Urinary biomarkers of systemic oxidative stress trended lower in CF patients, particularly those who had documented low lignan levels throughout the study. The most dramatic change for nearly every CF patient occurred after that first week of supplementation. The changes among the healthy controls were less obvious. Notably, CF patients were considered “well” or in a steady state in terms of disease, so oxidative stress biomarkers were nearly identical to their healthy control counterparts enrolled in the study. Importantly, the presence of FS did not result in increased oxidative stress on a cellular or DNA level.</p>
              <p>The novel data gathered from the human cytokine multiplex samples has been hypothesis generating. This pilot study of 10 highly selected CF patients from a single center showed favorable trends in inflammatory biomarkers particularly in CF patients who demonstrated low lignan levels leading us to ponder how this happened. The inflammatory response of the innate immune system is triggered by a TNF-α surge causing neutrophils, macrophages, and other professional antigen presenting cells to perform their primary functions then present antigen to the adaptive immune system. Chronic inflammation in CF would be dominated by TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-6, and IL-8 with decreased levels of IL-10, IL-4, etc. Absolute plasma cytokine levels were low (pg/ml), but trends toward decreasing pro-inflammatory cytokine levels were observed among CF patients. Whether this is biologically relevant requires more study of longer duration and with greater numbers.</p>
              <p>One of the most interesting findings of our study was the presence of high and low plasma enterolignan levels in CF. The high lignan group had features that were very similar to healthy controls, while low lignan patients had different response in many measures, but improved markers of oxidative stress. One possible explanation could be FS was not absorbed by the low lignan patients; however, the changes in oxidative stress markers suggest that FS had been absorbed causing systemic effect. An alternative explanation could be higher level of oxidative stress in these patients and therefore faster consumption of the lignans. This hypothesis is strengthened by the comparison between the groups. Low lignan patients had higher sweat tests, were pancreatic insufficient, had genotypes associated with severe disease, with worse spirometry. These patients are expected to have more inflammation as a group based on their features. If true, further studies will be needed to assess optimum FS dose to achieve adequate lignan levels causing appropriate antioxidant effect. Our patient number was too small to make any firm conclusions. These results could be erroneous or by chance. Another issue needing further exploration is macrolide use in that group. It is possible this is related to disease severity, which necessitates its use; other possibilities are interference with lignan levels leading to lower levels. Macrolide use was chronic and not new in any patients. These findings will be further explored in larger studies that are in the planning phases.</p>
              <p>Along with direct ROS scavenging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], activation of the Nrf2 pathway and downstream effects may explain FS benefits. Buccal swabs (validated surrogates of respiratory epithelia) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] were collected from CF patients as was done in prior studies of patients with chronic oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] to quantify gene expression change from FS. The process of extracting RNA was cumbersome, with a process standardized as much as possible, but could account for error. Regardless, all patients increased expression of specifically NQO1, part of the Nrf2 family of endogenous antioxidants. Increased NQO1 expression continued even after FS was absent from the diet. How and why this occurred is speculative but FS could have activated long-term oxidative stress protection. Additional study is necessary to clarify this interesting finding.</p>
              <p>We are aware of our study limitations. It was a single center, non-blinded, non-randomized trial without a control grain for comparison and without correction for multiple comparisons. There were imbalances in the usage of antibiotics among patients with high and low lignan levels, which might explain the difference in levels, but it also might just be a marker of disease severity. Regardless, we were able to show that in this formulation, FS could be incorporated into the daily medical regimen of CF patients and provide a safe, well-tolerated supplement. Lignan levels and how they may impact oxidative stress and gene expression needs further study.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>In the current proof of concept pilot study we were successful in assessing FS tolerability by CF patients and establishing whether certain biomarkers can be measured. The study was not designed to prove that FS works in mitigating disease which will be the focus of larger trials. Indeed, we are in the planning stages of larger trials to further explore our findings and assess whether FS supplementation can lead to improvement in clinically meaningful outcomes in CF patients.</p>
