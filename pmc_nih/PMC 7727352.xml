                  <title>Objective</title>
                  <p>To assess usability and usefulness of a machine learning-based order recommender system applied to simulated clinical cases.</p>

                  <title>Materials and Methods</title>
                  <p>43 physicians entered orders for 5 simulated clinical cases using a clinical order entry interface with or without access to a previously developed automated order recommender system. Cases were randomly allocated to the recommender system in a 3:2 ratio. A panel of clinicians scored whether the orders placed were clinically appropriate. Our primary outcome included the difference in clinical appropriateness scores. Secondary outcomes included total number of orders, case time, and survey responses.</p>

                <sec id="s3">
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Clinical appropriateness scores per order were comparable for cases randomized to the order recommender system (mean difference -0.11 order per score, 95% CI: [-0.41, 0.20]). Physicians using the recommender placed more orders (median 16 vs 15 orders, incidence rate ratio 1.09, 95%CI: [1.01-1.17]). Case times were comparable with the recommender system. Order suggestions generated from the recommender system were more likely to match physician needs than standard manual search options. Physicians used recommender suggestions in 98% of available cases. Approximately 95% of participants agreed the system would be useful for their workflows.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>Clinicians can use and accept machine learned clinical order recommendations integrated into an electronic order entry interface in a simulated setting. The clinical appropriateness of orders entered was comparable even when supported by automated recommendations.</p>

              <p>Physician compliance with evidence-based care often falls short, with overall compliance with clinical guideline recommendations ranging from 20 to 80%.<xref rid="ocaa190-B1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Such variability may compromise care quality and cost effectiveness, especially when knowledge is inconsistently applied.<xref rid="ocaa190-B2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> The meaningful use era of electronic health records (EHRs)<xref rid="ocaa190-B3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> creates the opportunity for data-driven clinical decision support (CDS) that utilizes the collective expertise of many practitioners in a learning health system.<xref rid="ocaa190-B4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4–8</sup></xref> It may additionally facilitate the acquisition of medical knowledge by enabling clinicians to adopt evolving evidence-based practice patterns.<xref rid="ocaa190-B9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> Tools such as order sets already reinforce consistency and compliance with best practices,<xref rid="ocaa190-B10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ocaa190-B11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> but maintainability is limited in scale by a top-down, knowledge-based approach requiring the manual effort of human experts.<xref rid="ocaa190-B12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> Moreover, the intended vs actual usage of EHR order sets may not align with physician workflows,<xref rid="ocaa190-B13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> and it may impede physicians from learning appropriate alternatives toward patient care.<xref rid="ocaa190-B14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> A key challenge to fulfill a future vision for clinical decision support<xref rid="ocaa190-B15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ocaa190-B16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> is the automatic production and delivery of content from the bottom-up by data-mining clinical data sources.<xref rid="ocaa190-B17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref></p>
              <p>Most prior studies in automated development of clinical decision support content have been strictly offline analytical evaluations,<xref rid="ocaa190-B17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17–24</sup></xref> with few studies assessing the response of human clinicians to such recommender tools and their ordering patterns. More broadly, the majority of physicians have significant distrust or negative attitudes toward the EHR,<xref rid="ocaa190-B25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25–27</sup></xref> which may affect how well these tools could be adopted. As with many machine-learning models designed to support clinical decision-making, it is unknown if physicians will actually accept such suggestions into their clinical workflow.</p>
              <p>Previously, we developed an automated order recommender system by data-mining our hospital’s EHR data.<xref rid="ocaa190-B22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> The results of this approach align with established standards of care<xref rid="ocaa190-B17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ocaa190-B28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ocaa190-B29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> and are predictive of real physician behavior and patient outcomes.<xref rid="ocaa190-B22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> Our underlying vision is to seamlessly integrate a system into clinical order entry workflows that automatically infers the relevant clinical context based on data already in the EHR and provides actionable decision support in the form of clinical order suggestions, analogous to Netflix or Amazon.com’s “customers who bought A also bought B” system.<xref rid="ocaa190-B30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ocaa190-B31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> It is unknown if these suggested orders would be accepted by clinicians or affect quality of care.</p>
              <p>This study seeks to address these issues by examining physicians’ behaviors while interacting with a clinical provider order entry (CPOE) interface that simulates an EHR for hospital clinical scenarios. We specifically examine whether the automated order recommender system impacted the number of clinically inappropriate/appropriate orders placed during the simulated cases. We further evaluated physician ordering patterns, user experience metrics, and survey responses when an automated order recommender system was added to standard functionality.</p>

                <title>Participants and setting</title>
                <p>This study was conducted at a single academic institution from 10/2018–12/2019. We recruited physicians (n = 43) with experience caring for medical inpatients within the past year using local mailing listservs. Participants included medical residents (trainees who have a medical license but still require oversight) and attending physicians. The study was approved by the Stanford University Institutional Review Board.</p>

                <title>Study design</title>
                <p>Participants were offered a $195 incentive payment for a 1-hour usability testing session in a closed office setting where they were exposed to a series of 5 clinical cases that simulate common inpatient medical problems (see <italic>Cases &amp; Grading</italic> below) on a digital interface that simulated their institution’s EHR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ocaa190-F1">Figures 1–3</xref>). Upon recruitment to the study, a researcher guided participants through 2 demonstration cases (diabetic ketoacidosis and chest pain) to illustrate basic functions of the digital interface (data review, order entry, order sets).

Note: There is a clinical note window on the left and a clinical order entry interface on the right, including a search box for individual orders and order sets, as well as a running list of new orders placed. All participants in the study were already familiar with this interface from their prior clinical practice.</p>

                    <p>The simulated electronic medical record interface with order sets and automated order recommender available.Note: In all cases, participants had the option to manually search for pre-authored order sets or individual orders. The example on the left panel illustrates the user searching for ã shortnessã and then finding and opening the ã ED Shortness of Breathã order set previously assembled by a hospital committee. For the physician-cases where the recommender option was turned on, rather than starting with a blank order search results field, the recommender algorithm dynamically presents a list of suggested clinical orders (right panel), in this example triggered by a presenting symptom code (Shortness of Breath, ICD9 786.05). Clinical orders predicted most likely to occur next are highlighted under <italic>Common Orders (top 10 when sorting options by positive predictive value relative to the available patient input data)</italic>, while those under <italic>Related Orders</italic> are less likely but disproportionately associated with similar cases and thus may be more specifically relevant (top 10 options sorted by the negative log of the P-value association between the patient input data and suggested options). As users enter additional orders, the recommender algorithm continually updates the suggested lists based on the accumulating information.</p>

                </fig>
                <p>All physician participants were subsequently assigned each of the 5 cases (<xref rid="ocaa190-T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) in random order for a within-subjects design. Three of their 5 cases were randomly assigned to have an automated order recommender system that provided order suggestions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ocaa190-F3">Figure 3</xref>) vs no order recommender system in their remaining 2 cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ocaa190-F2">Figure 2</xref>). Based on previous pilot testing, we found that users could not consistently complete more than 5 simulated cases during the scheduled 1-hour testing sessions.<xref rid="ocaa190-B37" ref-type="bibr"><sup>37</sup></xref> The unbalanced 3:2 treatment assignment was therefore selected to acquire more usability feedback on the recommender interface. The study participants were unblinded to their treatment allocation as this was infeasible from a user interface study context. Conventional clinical order entry options including order-set checklists and manual search of individual orders were available in all cases, making usage of the automated order recommender system completely optional. Participant activity was recorded through screen capture, audio, and user interface tracking software. Following the case series, all participants filled out a survey on their experiences with the system and their receptiveness to the automated order recommender.

                <title>Outcomes</title>
                <p>The primary outcome was the clinical appropriateness of orders placed (mean score per order) in the simulated cases. Clinical appropriateness was determined by a panel of clinicians who assigned a score to each order for each simulated case (see <italic>Cases &amp; Grading</italic> below). Secondary outcomes included 4 ordering outcomes (the total score of all orders, number of orders, number of positively scoring orders, and number of nonpositively scoring orders) and 2 user-experience outcomes (number of clicks, time to complete the simulated cases). Planned ancillary analyses were done to summarize survey results and calculate precision and recall of the ordering systems.</p>

                <title>Automated order recommender development</title>
                <p>As described previously,<xref rid="ocaa190-B22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> we extracted deidentified structured data for all inpatient hospitalizations from the 2009–2014 STRIDE clinical data warehouse.<xref rid="ocaa190-B38" ref-type="bibr"><sup>38</sup></xref> The data cover &gt; 74K patients with &gt; 11M instances of &gt; 27K items (medication, laboratory, imaging, and nursing orders as well as lab results and diagnosis codes). We built a clinical collaborative filtering (recommender) system based on this data, modeled on commercial product recommender algorithms<xref rid="ocaa190-B30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ocaa190-B31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> using item co-occurrence statistics. While the algorithm is specifically designed to adapt to continuous streams of clinical data, to maintain consistency within this study, the recommender system content was kept fixed after training with data up to 2014.</p>
                <p>We built a simulated computerized provider order entry (CPOE) interface with open technologies including PostgreSQL, Python, Apache HTTP, and HTML/JavaScript. This CPOE was modeled after the EHR currently used in our hospital (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ocaa190-F1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ocaa190-F2">2</xref>). Our unique addition is an automated recommender (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ocaa190-F3">Figure 3</xref>), analogous to a “customers who bought this item also bought this…” service that anticipates other clinical orders that are likely to be relevant based on similar prior cases in prior EHRs.</p>

                <title>Cases &amp; grading</title>
                <p>A panel of board-certified internal medicine physicians (AK, JH, LS, and JHC) developed 5 simulated clinical cases of common inpatient medical problems: unstable atrial fibrillation, neutropenic fever, variceal gastrointestinal hemorrhage, bacterial meningitis, and acute pulmonary embolism (<xref rid="ocaa190-T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Each participant was exposed to the clinical interface (Appendix), which included the patient’s history and physical examination. Depending on the interventions ordered, the case would progress across several decisional nodes (<xref rid="ocaa190-T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). For example, if a participant ordered a lumbar puncture and antibiotics for bacterial meningitis, the case would progress toward a different node (patient improvement). In contrast, if antibiotics were not ordered, the patient would deteriorate (updated vitals and clinical notes would appear in this node). Diagnostic test results are only visible if respective orders are entered. With each entered order, the automated order recommender lists would continuously update based on the accumulating patient information.</p>
                <p>To determine clinical appropriateness for all orders, the case designers reviewed options via the Delphi method.<xref rid="ocaa190-B39" ref-type="bibr"><sup>39</sup></xref> Each physician panelist (AK, JH, LS, and JHC) independently reviewed all orders placed for the case. Cases were classified according to their state (initial, subsequent, or resolution) and orders were considered in the context of each state. Each grader assigned an individual score to an order on a −10 (very inappropriate) to +10 (very appropriate) scale based on 1-step intervals. The Appendix includes an extended description of how scoring was considered. The initial independent review had an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.51 (95% CI: [0.47–0.53]) for all scored orders on a −10 – +10 scale.<xref rid="ocaa190-B39" ref-type="bibr"><sup>39</sup></xref></p>
                <p>Following independent scoring, the reviewers met as a panel in multiple rounds to review their independent assessments and deliberated to assign a consensus score.<xref rid="ocaa190-B39" ref-type="bibr"><sup>39</sup></xref> Appropriate research studies and clinical guidelines were considered when assigning a consensus score (<xref rid="ocaa190-T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In instances where the panel could not reach a final consensus, no score was assigned.</p>
                <p>When considering the scoring outcomes, the total score assigned for a simulated case was the sum of scores for each order placed during the case. The average score per order was the total score divided by the total number of graded orders entered per case. Only unique orders were counted for this graded total, discounting repeats and clinically redundant orders (eg, ordering a complete blood count and a complete blood count with automated differential). Repeat or clinically redundant orders were counted towards the “Total Orders” secondary outcome.</p>

                <title>Order search performance</title>
                <p>The information retrieval performance of order search methods was assessed in terms of precision (positive predictive value: fraction of search result options that were ordered) and recall (sensitivity: fraction of orders that came from the search result options). When manually searching for orders by name or order sets, the user is presented with N(manualOptions) to consider, of which we count a subset of N(uniqueManualOptions) after discounting repeats. Considering actual orders entered N(totalOrders) and N(manualOrders), Manual Search Precision is calculated as N(manualOrders)/N(uniqueManualOptions) while Manual Search Recall is N(manualOrders)/N(totalOrders). Respective metrics are calculated for the “search result” options and orders automatically presented by the recommender system. Note that when the recommender system was not available, N(manualOrders) = N(totalOrders) and thus Manual Search Recall = 100% since there was no alternative way to enter clinical orders. Further note that a user may be presented with a recommender option, ignore it, then subsequently manually order the same thing, which will be counted towards N(manualOrders) and not N(recommenderOrders).</p>

                <title>Survey</title>
                <p>After completion of the clinical scenarios, all participants were sent an electronic survey regarding their experience with the automated order recommender system used in this study. The survey used a 5-point Likert scale to assess physician opinions of this system and its potential impact on physician workflows (see Survey Responses below). Participants were also asked the following open-ended questions: “in which clinical scenarios would this system be most useful?” and “in which clinical scenarios would this system be least useful?” All open-ended responses were qualitatively coded and analyzed using thematic analysis.<xref rid="ocaa190-B40" ref-type="bibr"><sup>40</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ocaa190-B41" ref-type="bibr"><sup>41</sup></xref></p>

                <title>Statistical Methods</title>
                <p>Because several of the secondary outcome measures were nonsymmetrically distributed, median and interquartile ranges (IQR) are reported. The primary outcome (average score per order) was assessed using a linear mixed effects model with a normal distribution. Secondary outcomes were assessed using a generalized linear mixed effects model with a negative binomial distribution. All mixed effects models included a fixed effect for the recommender system (on/off), a random intercept for the physician, and a random intercept for the simulated clinical case (atrial fibrillation, gastrointestinal bleed, meningitis, neutropenic fever, and pulmonary embolism). No <italic>P</italic> values were reported for any mixed-effects model due to uncertainty in the statistical literature on the correct approach for calculating these values.<xref rid="ocaa190-B42" ref-type="bibr"><sup>42</sup></xref> In the secondary analyses, a result was considered nominally statistically significant if the confidence intervals for the incidence rate ratio estimate did not overlap a value of 1. For the secondary outcomes, negative and neutral scoring orders were pooled into a single “nonpositively scoring orders” analysis. This decision was made prior to analyzing the outcomes of the study. In the final order scores, there was substantial variation in the number of negatively scoring orders between the 5 simulated cases. In particular, there were no negatively scoring possible orders for the neutropenic fever case, and only 1 negatively scoring order for the pulmonary embolism case. Therefore, negative orders were not individually modeled given the limited statistical power.</p>
                <p>All statistical analyses were performed in R (Vienna, Austria). Linear mixed effects models were fit using the lme4 package.<xref rid="ocaa190-B43" ref-type="bibr"><sup>43</sup></xref> The appropriateness of the negative binomial model was assessed with the visualizing categorical data package.<xref rid="ocaa190-B44" ref-type="bibr"><sup>44</sup></xref> The ICC of the scores from individual expert reviewers was calculated with the incidence rate ratio package.<xref rid="ocaa190-B45" ref-type="bibr"><sup>45</sup></xref></p>

                <title>Participants</title>
                <p>A total of 43 licensed physicians participated in this study, with a total of 215 unique observations. All participants received the intended treatment. The physicians had a median of 3.0 (IQR: [3.0–5.0]) years since obtaining their medical degree. The primary specialties of the participants were identified as Internal Medicine (including those with subspecialty training) for 32 (74%) participants, Emergency Medicine for 9 (21%) participants, and 1 each for Family Medicine and Pediatrics. Participants included 24 (56%) resident trainees and 19 (44%) attendings, who were board certified in their respective specialty.</p>

                <title>Primary outcome</title>
                <p>The median score per order for each physician-case was 6.2 (IQR: [5.2–7.5]). There was no significant difference detected in the mean score per order for simulated cases randomized to the automated order recommender (mean 0.11 decrease in score, 95% CI: [−0.41, 0.20]; <xref rid="ocaa190-T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The random effects for physicians had an estimated standard deviation (SD) of 0.4 (95% CI: [0.1–0.6]), while the random effects for the simulated cases had an SD of 1.4 (95% CI: [0.7–2.7]). This suggests that more variation in the primary outcome may be attributable to the different simulated cases than to the specific physician participant.

Overall, the clinical decision tool was positively received by the study participants, where 96% agreed or strongly agreed that the tool would be useful for their position (<xref rid="ocaa190-T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Moreover, 90% agreed or strongly agreed that the system would make their job easier, and 86% felt that it would increase their productivity. Thematic analysis of the open-ended questions revealed that the majority of respondents felt the system would be useful for patients who have a clear diagnosis or whose clinical problems could be guided by a stepwise, algorithmic approach. Others mentioned the tool’s utility for diseases that may require several simultaneous orders (eg, diabetic ketoacidosis). Additional comments indicate physicians felt that the tool would be less useful for subspecialized care or for patients that require few simultaneous orders.

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>An automated order recommender system interface for common clinical scenarios seen in hospital medicine and emergency medicine was usable and accepted by physicians, without adversely affecting the quality of patient care decisions reflected in adverse or irrelevant orders. The automated order recommender system reduced the number of clicks per case and did not affect the amount of time physicians spent on the simulated EHR interface. Physicians placed more orders overall (median 1.0 additional order per simulation). The automated order recommender demonstrated superior recall of orders, suggesting that users were more likely to find the orders they wanted from the automated order recommender rather than from manual searches. The tool was positively received by the study participants, who identified clear benefits toward their workflow and productivity. This represents a key study to examine the usability and acceptability of clinical recommender decision support tools on physician ordering habits and patient care.</p>
              <p>There is wide variability in clinical practice, even in instances with clear guideline-directed diagnostic and treatment algorithms for well-defined clinical problems.<xref rid="ocaa190-B1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Such variability may compromise care quality, cost effectiveness, or expedient healthcare delivery.<xref rid="ocaa190-B2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> Healthcare systems have sought to improve both the quality of patient care and the EHR experience by providing standardized order sets, which can promote evidence-based care.<xref rid="ocaa190-B46" ref-type="bibr"><sup>46–49</sup></xref> Healthcare systems have also sought to use EHR alerts to encourage evidence-based ordering of diagnostic tests in both inpatient and outpatient settings.<xref rid="ocaa190-B50" ref-type="bibr"><sup>50</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ocaa190-B51" ref-type="bibr"><sup>51</sup></xref> Given the variability of clinical practice,<xref rid="ocaa190-B1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> guidance for up-to-date medical care must come from multiple sources. Machine learning tools have the potential to augment these existing features, and they offer a potential advantage of a collaborative filtering approach that can rapidly and automatically adapt to newly emerging practices. Our automated order recommender essentially functions as a dynamic order set that continuously updates in response to new patient information, demonstrating increased accuracy and reduced need for conventional manual searches. While there are challenges to designing and maintaining such a system,<xref rid="ocaa190-B52" ref-type="bibr"><sup>52</sup></xref> there may be several benefits, including increased physician acceptance and usage. In this study, physicians could use any of our institution’s order sets for the simulated cases, regardless if the recommender was available or not. Notably, 100% of physicians in this study used the recommender options at least once, even though it was completely optional. The automated order recommender system interface received largely positive views by our participants, suggesting that physicians will accept machine-generated clinical order tools if they are embedded into clinical workflows. Further studies are needed to evaluate the role of machine-learning tools in EHR interfaces and how they can augment existing features that promote evidence-based care.</p>
              <p>There are several potential consequences to an automated recommender system. First, it may lead physicians astray by following “common, but not necessarily good” practices. Our expert panel found no significant deterioration in the overall quality of clinical orders, but there was still substantial case-variability in the amount of clinically appropriate orders placed with or without the automated recommender system. These findings highlight the ongoing variability of clinical practice among physicians (even when additional point-of-care tools are given to them). A second concern of automated order recommender systems is they may increase extraneous cognitive load by bombarding the user with continuously updated order suggestions (some of which may not be relevant). Indeed, time-motion studies indicate that clinicians already spend most of their time in the EHR,<xref rid="ocaa190-B53" ref-type="bibr"><sup>53</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ocaa190-B54" ref-type="bibr"><sup>54</sup></xref> with many spending significant time searching for and entering orders.<xref rid="ocaa190-B55" ref-type="bibr"><sup>55</sup></xref> Our study showed a reduction on reliance of manual searches and navigational clicks with an automated recommender system. However, there was no reduction in the amount of time that physicians spent per simulated case. The simulated test setting with a predetermined duration and number of cases may have led participants to artificially “fill” the time within cases, or perhaps the reduction in manual search efforts freed their cognitive attention to attend more to the medical decision-making tasks of each case. Additionally, other authors have shown that most of a clinician’s time in the EHR is spent in data review (reviewing clinical notes, laboratory results, or diagnostic reports),<xref rid="ocaa190-B55" ref-type="bibr"><sup>55–57</sup></xref> which was simplified in these clinical scenarios. A third limitation regarding automated order recommender systems is that they can present users with a continuously updated menu of order options, which may result in excessive ordering and increased healthcare expenditures. Our study found that users placed an additional 1.0 order per case with the automated recommender, which could result in significant increases in healthcare costs when viewed on a macro level. In contrast, order sets have been shown to promote cost-effectiveness.<xref rid="ocaa190-B46" ref-type="bibr"><sup>46</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ocaa190-B47" ref-type="bibr"><sup>47</sup></xref> Future studies should consider the implementation of automated order recommender systems in real practice environments to assess whether they result in time savings for physicians navigating the EHR without compromising the cost or quality of care.</p>
              <p>There are several limitations to this study. Our tool was based on a clinical data warehouse of EHR data that may not be available at all institutions. This study used simulated cases, and it remains to be seen how an automated order recommender system would perform in “live” practice settings with real patients. The simulated cases pertained to inpatient or emergency medicine contexts, which limits the generalizability of these findings. Similarly, our primary users were internal medicine physicians, and it is unclear how physicians from other specialties would respond to this system. The recommender system was based on data collected from 2009–2014, and as such, clinical practice patterns may have changed. Our users were given an orientation of the recommender system and its purpose before engaging with the practice scenarios, which likely contributes a Hawthorne effect on how users interacted and viewed the system.<xref rid="ocaa190-B58" ref-type="bibr"><sup>58</sup></xref> Each testing session was prescheduled for a fixed time (1 hour for orientation, 5 test cases, and survey), which may have artificially constrained the variability in task completion time. Although our expert panel used previously validated methodology to devise a scoring system,<xref rid="ocaa190-B39" ref-type="bibr"><sup>39</sup></xref> the initial interrater agreement was moderate for some clinical orders, which limits the generalizability of these findings to other clinical scenarios or healthcare settings. Finally, the lack of a broadly accepted, open-architecture platform that allows for custom workflow integrations into common commercial EHRs limits the ability to easily implement systems similar to the 1 used in this study.</p>
              <p>At a time when the EHR is met with distrust and negativity by clinicians due to the burdens of documentation and data entry, automated order recommender systems represent a key opportunity to improve the quality, consistency, and experience of healthcare. This study represents an important step towards a future where EHRs anticipate clinical needs without users even having to ask, so that clinicians can start to feel like the computers are working for them, instead of the other way around.</p>

              <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
              <p>Clinical order suggestions from a data-driven recommender system were readily used and accepted by physicians across a variety of simulated clinical cases. The clinical appropriateness of orders entered were comparable when supported by automated recommendations, even as the system increased the number of clinical orders placed per case. Physicians were more likely to find the clinical orders they wanted using such tools as compared to manual search methods (ie, superior recall), and reduced the number of mouse clicks, but did not change the overall amount of time they spent in a simulated EHR setting. Clinicians overall viewed such clinical recommender systems positively, perceiving a clear potential benefit toward their workflow.</p>
