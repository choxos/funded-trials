CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses were measured in 44 patients with HIV-associated
cryptococcal meningitis at baseline and during follow-up. Responses were assessed
following ex vivo cryptococcal mannoprotein stimulation, using 13-color flow-cytometry.
The relationships between cryptococcal-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses,

                <p><bold><italic>Results.</italic></bold> Cryptococcal-specific CD4<sup>+</sup>
T-cell responses were characterized by the production of macrophage inflammatory protein
1α, interferon γ (IFN-γ), and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α).
Conversely, minimal interleukin 4 and interleukin 17 production was detected. Patients
surviving to 2 weeks had significantly different functional CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell
responses as compared to those who died. Patients with a response predominantly consisting
of IFN-γ or TNF-α production had a 2-week mortality of 0% (0/20), compared
with 25% (6/24) in those without this response (<italic>P</italic> = .025).
Such patients also had lower fungal burdens (10 400 vs 390 000 colony-forming units/mL;
<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), higher cerebrospinal fluid lymphocyte counts (122 vs 8
cells/μL; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), and a trend toward faster rates of clearance
of infection.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Cryptococcal meningitis is a leading cause of mortality in human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV)–infected patients in the developing world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT099C1">1</xref>]. A clear understanding of the underlying immune response to
<italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> is essential to help elucidate the causes of
mortality and inform development of immune-based therapies. Unfortunately, correlates of
immune protection in patients with HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis remain poorly
defined.</p>
            <p>Most data regarding the immune response to <italic>C. neoformans</italic> comes from animal
models and in vitro work. <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> evades killing by the innate immune
system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT099C2">2</xref>], and adaptive CD4<sup>+</sup>
T-cell responses are critical for immune control and clearance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT099C3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT099C6">6</xref>]. In mouse
models, a dichotomy exists between T-helper 1 (Th1)–type T-cell responses and T-helper
2 (Th2)–type responses. Th1-type responses are protective and associated with
proinflammatory cytokine responses; production of interferon γ (IFN-γ), tumor
necrosis factor α (TNF-α), and interleukin 12; and effective intracellular killing
of <italic>C. neoformans</italic> by classically activated macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT099C3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT099C4">4</xref>,
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT099C7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT099C20">20</xref>]. Th2-type responses appear to be detrimental and are characterized by
production of interleukin 10 (IL-10), interleukin 4 (IL-4), and interleukin 13; alternative
macrophage activation; increased <italic>C. neoformans</italic> proliferation; and impaired
killing by innate effector cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT099C7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT099C16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT099C28">28</xref>]. T-helper 17 (Th17)–type cytokine production has also been associated
with reduced fungal burdens and effective resolution of infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT099C29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT099C32">32</xref>].</p>
            <p>Human data are limited. The epidemiology of cryptococcal disease clearly demonstrates that
CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell depletion is the key predisposing factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT099C33">33</xref>]. Cryptococcal meningitis nearly exclusively
affects patients with profound defects in cell-mediated immunity. In HIV-infected patients
who develop cryptococcal meningitis, adverse clinical and microbiological outcomes are
associated with lower CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell counts and poor inflammatory responses in
the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT099C34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT099C36">36</xref>], but the phenotype of the immune response in
HIV-infected patients with cryptococcal meningitis is not well described. HIV disease
progression has been associated with a loss of Th1-type responses and a switch to
Th2-weighted CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell and cytokine responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT099C37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT099C39">39</xref>], although
very few data are available that directly examine the functional phenotypes of
CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in HIV-infected patients with advanced disease.</p>
            <p>To explore the host response to cryptococcal infection in patients with HIV-associated
cryptococcal meningitis, both at the site of infection in the central nervous system and
systemically, CSF cytokine levels and <italic>Cryptococcus-</italic>specific peripheral
CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses were measured in an exploratory analysis of 44
patients with acute cryptococcal meningitis enrolled in a trial of adjuvant interferon gamma
immunotherapy. The phenotype of the peripheral CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses to
<italic>Cryptococcus</italic> was compared to better characterized antigen-specific
cytomegalovirus (CMV)– and <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>–specific
responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT099C40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT099C41">41</xref>], both to act as internal validation of the performance of the
experiments and to enable a comparison between the CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses to
mycobacterial, fungal, and viral opportunistic infections. The relationships between
<italic>Cryptococcus-</italic>specific peripheral CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses
and clinical parameters and outcomes were explored.</p>

patients who survived, ART was initiated after a median of 23 days of antifungal therapy.
None of the patients had clinically apparent CMV disease at the time of sample collection or

patients (15) were being treated for tuberculosis at the time of sample collection, a
further 23% (10) had a history of treated tuberculosis, and 5% (2) developed
tuberculosis during the 1-year follow-up period. Additional PBMC samples were collected from
37 of the 38 surviving patients 2 weeks after the initial sample was collected, following

positively associated with CSF IL-10 and IL-17 concentrations (Spearman rho, 0.29 for
IFN-γ and IL-10 [<italic>P</italic> = .05], 0.27 for TNF-α and IL-10

negatively associated with MCP-1 concentrations (Spearman rho, −0.35 for IFN-γ
and MCP-1 [<italic>P</italic> = .02] and −0.27 for TNF-α and MCP-1
[<italic>P</italic> = .08]).</p>
                <p>To examine the influence of CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell response phenotype independently
from magnitude, an analysis restricted to patients with a CRAG-specific total response at

IFN-γ/TNF-α predominant as described above. Patients with
IFN-γ/TNF-α–predominant CRAG-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses
had higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines in the CSF and lower levels of MIP-1α,
MCP-1, and GM-CSF (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="JIT099F6">6</xref>). <fig id="JIT099F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) immune parameters in subjects with and subjects

                <title>Effects of Exogenous Interferon Gamma on Systemic Immune Responses</title>
                <p>The 44 patients in this study are a subset of a 90-patient cohort enrolled in a clinical
trial assessing the effect of adjuvant interferon gamma administration on the rate of
clearance of cryptococcal infection from the CSF of patients with HIV-associated
cryptococcal meningitis. Administration of interferon gamma with standard antifungal
therapy led to significantly faster rates of clearance of infection than standard therapy
alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT099C42">42</xref>]. When examined according to
baseline antigen-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses, the effects of adjunctive
interferon gamma therapy were found to be most marked in patients who had no CRAG-specific
IFN-γ/TNF-α–producing CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell response at baseline. In
the 24 patients without an IFN-γ/TNF-α–producing CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell
response at baseline, the addition of interferon gamma led to an increase of 0.25
log<sub>10</sub> CFU/mL/day (95% confidence interval [CI], .07–.43) in the
rate of clearance (<italic>P</italic> = .01), compared with an increase of 0.15
log<sub>10</sub> CFU/mL/day (95% CI, −.05–.35) in the rate among
those with a CRAG-specific IFN-γ/TNF-α–producing CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell
response (<italic>P</italic> = .14), following adjustment for absolute
CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell count and baseline fungal burden.</p>
                <p>To determine whether administration of adjuvant interferon gamma had an effect on the
CRAG-specific T-cell response, the change in magnitude of the total CRAG-specific
CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell response over the initial 2 weeks of antifungal treatment
was examined with respect to interferon gamma exposure. Overall, interferon gamma
treatment was not found to have a statistically significant impact on either the change in
magnitude of the total CRAG-specific response between days 1 and 14 or the phenotype of
the CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell response on day 14 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/infdis/jit099/-/DC1">Supplementary Figure 1</ext-link><italic>A</italic>). Interferon gamma–treated
patients had proportionally less single-function MIP-1α–producing
CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells than controls on day 14 (24% vs 67%) and
higher percentages of single-positive IFN-γ– and TNF-α–producing cells
(4% vs 1% and 13% vs 4%, respectively) and dual-function
IFN-γ/TNF-α–producing cells (11% vs 6%).</p>

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>This is the first study characterizing antigen-specific peripheral CD4<sup>+</sup>
T-cell responses to <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> in patients with HIV-associated
cryptococcal meningitis. Although this work is primarily a descriptive, or
“discovery,” study examining a relatively small and heterogeneous patient
population, clear trends are evident when the results are taken as a whole, providing novel
data and unique insights. The magnitude of CRAG-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell
responses in patients with active cryptococcal infection was similar to the magnitude of
CMV-specific and <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>–specific responses, even though none
of these patients had clinically apparent CMV disease and only one-third had evidence of
active tuberculosis. CRAG-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses differed markedly
from <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>–specific and CMV-specific responses in terms of
maturational and functional profiles. <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>–specific
CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were the least differentiated and were primarily TNF-α
producing. CMV-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells exhibited a highly differentiated
effector-memory phenotype, primarily produced IFN-γ and TNF-α, and included large
numbers of polyfunctional cells. CRAG-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells had a more
differentiated maturational profile than <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>–specific
CD4<sup>+</sup> cells but were less differentiated than CMV-specific cells. A large
proportion of CRAG-specific cells produced MIP-1α, with slightly lower proportions
producing IFN-γ or TNF-α, and very little polyfunctionality observed. Following ART
initiation, CRAG-specific responses decreased or remained constant, in keeping with a
reduction in antigen burden during effective antifungal therapy. In contrast, the magnitude
of both <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>– and CMV-specific responses increased
following ART initiation, particularly markedly in the case of <italic>M.
tuberculosis</italic>–specific responses. From low levels of <italic>M.
tuberculosis</italic>–specific IFN-γ production at baseline (when TNF-α
predominated), there was a 10-fold increase in the frequency of IFN-γ–producing
CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells after 1 month of ART. This observation is consistent with the
observed poor performance of IFN-γ release assays in the diagnosis of tuberculosis in
highly immune-suppressed populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT099C47">47</xref>].</p>
              <p>Although CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell depletion is the key predisposing factor for
development of HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis, in this cohort of patients with
cryptococcal meningitis the functional phenotype of the CRAG-specific CD4<sup>+</sup>
T-cell response was associated with disease severity and clinical outcome, unlike the
overall magnitude of response. Survivors had higher proportions of IFN-γ– and
TNF-α–producing cells and significantly lower proportions of
MIP-1α–producing cells. When analyzed according to the presence or absence of an
IFN-γ/TNF-α–producing CRAG-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell response,
those with such a response were found to have higher CSF lymphocyte counts, a more
proinflammatory CSF cytokine response, significantly lower baseline fungal burdens, a trend
to more rapid clearance of infection from the CSF, and a significantly lower 2-week
mortality.</p>
              <p>No Th2- or Th17-type antigen-specific cytokine production was seen in response to
mannoprotein stimulation. Given the widely reported role of Th2-type responses in animal
models of cryptococcal meningitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT099C16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT099C22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT099C23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT099C28">28</xref>], and especially in light of the
described Th2-weighting of immune responses in late-stage HIV-infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT099C37">37</xref>], this may seem surprising. However this finding
could be related to the use of mannoprotein rather than whole-organism or other capsular
components in cell stimulations. Cryptococcal mannoproteins have previously been shown to
elicit delayed-type hypersensitivity and Th1-type cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT099C48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT099C49">49</xref>], while other
capsular components, notably GXM, appear to inhibit these responses, promoting detrimental
Th2-type immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="JIT099C50">50</xref>]. It is possible that,
rather than Th2-type CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses to <italic>C.
neoformans</italic>, an absolute lack of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells may lead to
detrimental Th2-type cytokine production by monocytes/macrophages or glial cells in
HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis. However, we found no inverse correlation between
either total or IFN-γ/TNF-α–producing CRAG-specific peripheral
CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell counts and Th2-type CSF cytokine levels. The only inverse
correlation seen was between the number of IFN-γ/TNF-α–producing CRAG-specific
peripheral CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and the chemokine MCP-1, suggesting that an adequate
peripheral CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell response leads to downregulation of CNS chemokine
production.</p>
              <p>In terms of determining the mechanism by which exogenous IFN-γ leads to more rapid
clearance of cryptococcal infection from the CSF, our results are inconclusive. The benefits
of exogenous IFN-γ were most marked in patients with no
IFN-γ/TNF-α–producing CRAG-specific peripheral CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell
response. However, this did not reach statistical significance, possibly because our study
was underpowered for such comparisons, particularly for subgroup analyses and in situations
where there was much heterogeneity of responses. As the biological effects of exogenous
IFN-γ may primarily result from direct activation of innate effector cells such as
monocytes/macrophages and microglial cells, a limitation of this study is that innate
effector-cell function was not directly examined. Further work is required to better
characterize the subgroup of patients who have poor baseline immune responses to
<italic>Cryptococcus</italic>, in whom adjuvant immunotherapy may be of most benefit.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, the presence of an IFN-γ/TNF-α–producing CRAG-specific
peripheral CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell response has been shown to correlate with favorable
microbiological and clinical outcomes in patients with HIV-associated cryptococcal
meningitis. Mannoprotein stimulation of peripheral CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells did not lead
to Th2-cytokine production even in these patients with advanced HIV. Unlike animal models,
we found no evidence of a dichotomous Th1/Th2 response in this cohort of patients with
advanced HIV infection and cryptococcal meningitis. Rather, an
IFN-γ/TNF-α–producing CRAG-specific peripheral CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell
response was associated with increased concentrations of cytokines at the site of infection,
including classical Th1 cytokines, as well as IL-10 and IL-17, and the presence of this
combined inflammatory response appears to be beneficial, while its absence is
detrimental.</p>
