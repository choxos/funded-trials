              <abstract>
                <p>Amidst the therapeutic void at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, a critical mass of scientific and clinical interest coalesced around COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP). To date, the CCP literature has focused largely on safety and efficacy outcomes, but little on implementation outcomes or experience. Expert opinion suggests that if CCP has a role in COVID-19 treatment, it is early in the disease course, and it must deliver a sufficiently high titer of neutralizing antibodies (nAb). Missing in the literature are comprehensive evaluations of how local CCP programs were implemented as part of pandemic preparedness and response, including considerations of the core components and personnel required to meet demand with adequately qualified CCP in a timely and sustained manner. To address this gap, we conducted an evaluation of a local CCP program at a large U.S. academic medical center, the University of North Carolina Medical Center (UNCMC), and patterned our evaluation around the dimensions of the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework to systematically describe key implementation-relevant metrics. We aligned our evaluation with program goals of reaching the target population with severe or critical COVID-19, integrating into the structure of the hospital-wide pandemic response, adapting to shifting landscapes, and sustaining the program over time during a compassionate use expanded access program (EAP) era and a randomized controlled trial (RCT) era. During the EAP era, the UNCMC CCP program was associated with faster CCP infusion after admission compared with contemporaneous affiliate hospitals without a local program: median 29.6 hours (interquartile range, IQR: 21.2–48.1) for the UNCMC CCP program versus 47.6 hours (IQR 32.6–71.6) for affiliate hospitals; (P&lt;0.0001). Sixty-eight of 87 CCP recipients in the EAP (78.2%) received CCP containing the FDA recommended minimum nAb titer of ≥1:160. CCP delivery to hospitalized patients operated with equal efficiency regardless of receiving treatment via a RCT or a compassionate-use mechanism. It was found that in a highly resourced academic medical center, rapid implementation of a local CCP collection, treatment, and clinical trial program could be achieved through re-deployment of highly trained laboratory and clinical personnel. These data provide important pragmatic considerations critical for health systems considering the use of CCP as part of an integrated pandemic response.</p>

              <p>As SARS-CoV-2 infections rapidly swept the globe in early 2020 [<xref rid="pone.0277707.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0277707.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], hospitals were faced with caring for an influx of severely ill patients without a therapeutic standard of care. Although antiviral and immunomodulatory agents were thought to be possible therapeutic options, there were initially few evidence-based treatments available. Further, the supply of novel anti-SARS-CoV-2 anti-virals and patient access to enroll in randomized controlled trials (RCT) was limited. COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) emerged as a leading therapeutic option. CCP was considered scalable to meet the rapidly increasing demands across both large and smaller medical centers. However, like other early therapeutics, the literature at the time suggested conflicting evidence of its potential efficacy [<xref rid="pone.0277707.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p>
              <p>Enthusiasm for the therapeutic benefits of CCP included experimental models of sarbecovirus pathogenesis and preliminary reports suggesting antibodies from recovered individuals neutralize SARS-CoV-2, interrupting viral replication and virus-mediated damage in patients with active infection [<xref rid="pone.0277707.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0277707.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Additionally, convalescent plasma had been safely used in other respiratory viral infections including SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and 2009 H1N1 Influenza [<xref rid="pone.0277707.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0277707.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. CCP collection and distribution could also leverage a broad network of blood banking capabilities where available, thereby making the therapeutic use of CCP immediately scalable in well-resourced settings.</p>
              <p>In the United States (U.S.), an Expanded Access Program (EAP) for CCP treated more than 100,000 participants hospitalized with severe COVID-19 [<xref rid="pone.0277707.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0277707.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Large regional and national blood collection centers reported rapid implementation and mobilization efforts to recruit, collect, and distribute CCP in diverse healthcare settings, demonstrating that large blood donation networks can deliver CCP at scale. The University of North Carolina Medical Center (UNCMC), and other academic medical centers capable of collecting plasma, also developed local programs for on-site use [<xref rid="pone.0277707.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. These local programs were designed to maximize institutional resources for community benefit, align with translational and clinical research, and reduce the demand on national blood donation banks. Additionally, there may also be clinical benefits associated with using locally-sourced plasma that may better represent regionally-specific, prevalent SARS-CoV-2 variants [<xref rid="pone.0277707.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p>
              <p>Although implementation is typically focused on therapies with proven clinical efficacy, in the context of this novel rapidly spreading and fatal virus, therapeutic programs, like the UNCMC CCP program, had to implement potential life-saving therapeutics before clinical effectiveness was known. Thus, in this report, we evaluate the impact of the UNCMC CCP program, patterning our evaluation after the dimensions of the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework, which has been used extensively to guide program evaluations in clinical settings, including unconventional clinical settings [<xref rid="pone.0277707.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0277707.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. We document the core components and personnel needed in health systems deploying CCP in response to COVID-19. We describe the UNCMC CCP program’s performance against pre-specified program goals of reaching a target population with severe or critical COVID-19, integrating into the structure of the hospital-wide pandemic response and individual care teams, adapting to shifting landscapes, and moving toward sustainability over time. Key implementation-relevant metrics and process measures are compared between CCP delivery for emergency compassionate use versus participation in a RCT [<xref rid="pone.0277707.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0277707.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p>

                <title>Ethics statement</title>
                <p>CCP was collected and stored at UNCMC in accordance with U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidelines [<xref rid="pone.0277707.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and the UNCMC Blood Donation Center (BDC) standard operating procedures. Other aspects of CCP studies were performed under the oversight of the UNC Institutional Review Board (IRB), in accordance with the FDA EAP for CCP, and in accordance with UNC’s CCP RCT protocol and UNC IRB 20–1544 (<ext-link xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04524507" ext-link-type="uri">https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04524507</ext-link>). Review of electronic health record data for patients with COVID-19 at UNCMC and UNC-affiliated hospitals was done under a UNC IRB approved research study registry, UNC COVID Cohort (UNC IRB 20–1095). All patients, or their legally authorized representatives (LARs), gave informed consent, which in some cases occurred via a two-MD consent (described below).</p>

                <title>Study design, program evaluation, definitions, and metrics</title>
                <p>Given prevailing expert opinion on CCP in early 2020, the primary <italic toggle="yes">a priori</italic> program goals for the UNC CCP program were to treat as many patients as were eligible and desired treatment, and treat patients within 72 hours of admission (as a proxy measure for program effectiveness). Because we had access to laboratory capabilities to perform neutralizing antibody (nAb) titers, we aimed to provide CCP consistent with the initial FDA-recommended guidance of nAb titer &gt;1:160 or &gt; 1:80 if supply was limited, as often as possible [<xref rid="pone.0277707.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. As expert opinion evolved during the pandemic, we added a goal of treating within 10 days of symptoms onset (a more biologically and clinically relevant time-bound measure). These goals extended throughout the EAP era of CCP administration (April 2020—August 2020). When the FDA transitioned from an EAP to an emergency use authorization (EUA) mechanism in late August 2020, we integrated CCP delivery into clinical care via an investigator-initiated RCT (rather than the EUA). Our RCT goal was to enroll without delaying COVID-19 treatment access for study participants (i.e. to deliver CCP as quickly via the RCT as we could deliver CCP via other compassionate use mechanisms). The RCT was intentionally designed to provide CCP with nAb titer ≥ 1:160 and within 10 days of symptoms onset (<ext-link xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04524507" ext-link-type="uri">https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04524507</ext-link>). Additionally, we had the goals of leveraging blood banking and regulatory resources to facilitate affiliate hospital uptake of CCP as well as avoiding unintended negative effects from the CCP program on receiving COVID-19 treatment, which we assessed via using time to remdesivir as a comparator. We generally organized our evaluation of the UNCMC CCP program against these goals according to definitions patterned after the evaluative dimensions of the RE-AIM framework [<xref rid="pone.0277707.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], with specific metrics for our program detailed in <xref rid="pone.0277707.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.</p>

                <p>UNCMC is a quaternary care U.S. academic medical center with 950 hospital beds (43 medical intensive care unit (ICU) beds) [<xref rid="pone.0277707.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0277707.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] located in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. UNCMC is one of 11 hospitals in the UNC Health system encompassing a total of &gt;3400 beds, including 403 ICU beds. Simultaneous with the FDA EAP, UNCMC developed a local CCP program. The primary goals of the program were to provide CCP to UNCMC COVID-19 patients, through an RCT for those eligible and interested in research participation, and through clinical care otherwise included via the compassionate use mechanisms (EAP and later the EUA). This program had three core components: 1) on-site donation, banking, and transfusion capacity, 2) on-site novel assays to directly measure the <italic toggle="yes">functional</italic> anti-viral activity of CCP, and 3) a dedicated clinical trials unit with key clinical research staff, study coordinators, and investigators.

                <p>During the 18-week EAP participation period, 526 patients were admitted to the UNCMC with SARS-CoV-2 infection and 163 (30.9%) received CCP (<xref rid="pone.0277707.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). All patients who enrolled in the EAP received CCP. Most CCP recipients had severe or critical disease (N = 151; 93.8%) and 10 (6.2%) were considered at high-risk of progression to severe or critical disease. Compared to non-CCP recipients, CCP recipients were more likely to have more severe illness as measured by greater use of ICU-level supportive care. Hispanic ethnicity was associated with greater likelihood of receiving CCP (unadjusted for severity of COVID-19).</p>

                <p>Among recipients with documented date of symptoms onset, 71.5% (N = 113/158) were treated within 10 days of symptom onset. Overall, 94.5% (N = 154/163) and 47.2% (N = 77/163) were treated within 10 and 3 days of diagnosis, respectively. Compared with CCP non-recipients, recipients were also more likely to receive at least one other COVID-19-directed therapy (87.1% vs 33.6%) including remdesivir (76.1% vs 19.3%, P&lt;0.0001) and dexamethasone (56.4% vs 19.8%, P&lt;0.0001) (<xref rid="pone.0277707.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p>

                <p>The majority of the time from admission to infusion was spent performing the aggregate activities of initial evaluation, consultant approval, consent, and enrollment (median 22.6 hours, IQR 16.2–33.0), whereas ~18% of the time (median 5.3 hours, IQR 3.0–9.7) transpired from physician order entry to nursing documented transfusion time. Except for 3 CCP units, during the first 9 weeks of the EAP, UNCMC relied exclusively on CCP that was collected and stored at the UNCMC Blood Donation Center and UNCMC Blood Bank. Subsequently, a combination of on-site CCP and CCP acquired from a national supplier were used (N = 88, 54.0% and N = 75, 46.0%, respectively). The lag-time between national supplier and locally sourced CCP (median 6.8 hours (IQR 5.1–11.8) vs 3.4 hours (IQR 2.3–6.5) (P&lt;0.0001) was not sufficient to significantly decrease total time to infusion after admission (<xref rid="pone.0277707.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>).</p>
                <p>The time from admission to CCP infusion for participants consented directly was slower than other modes of consent (<xref rid="pone.0277707.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>). There was no significant difference in time from admission to CCP infusion by consent language (<xref rid="pone.0277707.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3A Fig</xref>). The only patient-specific factor that discriminated time from admission to CCP infusion among CCP recipients was ABO type, with longer delays for the less common and less available B blood type (median 36.0 hours, IQR 26.9–68.8 vs 31.8 hours, IQR 20.8–46.6, type A and 27.7 hours, IQR 19.5–47.6, type O; p &lt;0.05) (<xref rid="pone.0277707.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3B–S3F Fig</xref>).</p>
                <p>Remdesivir was directly available through the pharmacy with ID approval during this time period, and did not require additional processes for consent, enrollment and communication with the UNCMC Blood Bank. Using time to remdesivir as a comparator, it was estimated that there was an additional time burden of ~9.8 hours (<xref rid="pone.0277707.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>) associated with the receipt of CCP. However, compared with non-CCP recipients, CCP recipients experienced faster time to remdesivir (<xref rid="pone.0277707.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>)–primarily in the ICU where time to remdesivir was faster than the non-ICU COVID-19 care unit (<xref rid="pone.0277707.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E</xref>).</p>

                <title>Implementation</title>
                <p>The UNCMC CCP program was a clinical translational research program co-led by two ID physician scientists consisting of three primary domains: a clinical domain (CCP collection and infusion of CCP under the EAP or RCT protocols), a virology-immunology domain (processing donor plasma for quantification of nAb), and a data administrative domain (entry and management of participant and program data and reporting to sponsors). Each domain was led by one or two faculty co-investigators. The organizational structure remained stable throughout the program. Collectively, a total of 14 key personnel contributed to program activities. All but one temporary position were existing UNCMC employees who re-deployed their efforts to the program when their pre-pandemic clinical and research activities were paused. Scientific, clinical, and operational advisors guided the inception and ongoing implementation of the program. The clinical treatment team was available at all times, including weekends, and consisted of an on-call ID physician (rotating between 5 MDs) and up to two study coordinators (rotating between 1 MD, and 2 NPs) (<xref rid="pone.0277707.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>).</p>
                <p>Of 925 individuals contacted for donation, transfusable CCP units were collected from 127 (13.7%) unique volunteers over 22 collection dates. Thirty-two individuals donated at least twice resulting in a total of 170 donations and 449 transfusable plasma units collected. Eighty-seven of 163 recipients (53.4%) received their CCP units from UNCMC plasma bank.</p>
                <p>In accordance with emerging guidelines and data, on June 17, 2020, the CCP team discouraged use of CCP in patients on mechanical ventilation for &gt;3 days and those with symptoms onset &gt;10 days prior to admission. After the first two months of the program, the proportion of non-ICU to ICU patients increased and then remained stable. The median time from diagnosis and symptoms onset to infusion did not decrease over time (<xref rid="pone.0277707.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>).</p>

                <p>The program was implemented and operated stably over approximately 5 months. The proportion of admitted patients receiving CCP ranged from 21.9% (month 1) to a peak of 41.0% (month 3) as cases fluctuated over time (<xref rid="pone.0277707.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>).</p>
                <p>The program collected a median of 22 transfusable units from approximately 8 donors per week. The research laboratory performed nAb titers, although inpatient CCP needs outpaced turnaround time required for nAb titers challenging provision of real-time results. Further, despite efforts to target donors more likely to generate higher nAb titers, the proportion of CCP with titers &lt;1:160 did not decrease over time (<xref rid="pone.0277707.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A and 4C</xref>).

              <p>A comprehensive summary of the EAP for CCP [<xref rid="pone.0277707.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] as well as the serological repertoire and clinical efficacy of CCP across a spectrum of COVID-19 disease severity, including its role among patients with immunosuppression, has been described previously [<xref rid="pone.0277707.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0277707.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Expert opinion suggests that if CCP has a mortality benefit in COVID-19 treatment, infusion needs to be given early in the disease course, and the CCP needs an adequate concentration of nAb [<xref rid="pone.0277707.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0277707.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0277707.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0277707.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The novelty of our study, however, is a comprehensive evaluation of a local CCP program, including a description of the core elements and personnel required to implement such a program during a pandemic.</p>
              <p>Overall, our evaluation suggests that the UNCMC CCP program achieved some impact based on metrics following RE-AIM, having reached many COVID-19 inpatients, including those members of racial and ethnic minority groups disproportionately affected by COVID-19 [<xref rid="pone.0277707.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], and having rapidly provided CCP with FDA-recommended minimum-titer to most patients in ICU and non-ICU units, although time to infusion was shorter in the ICU. Our program required substantial resourcing and staffing for implementation, but was maintained whether administered through a compassionate use mechanism or an RCT. Our experience demonstrates that existing blood collection infrastructure at a single institution can be leveraged during a global pandemic to rapidly pivot to collecting and infusing convalescent plasma for a novel infectious agent, and also suggests that access to a national CCP pipeline may be helpful to supplement local collection efforts.</p>
              <p>Within the first weeks of COVID-19 emerging in our catchment area, it became apparent that a dedicated CCP team would be needed to achieve our goal of reaching as many eligible patients as possible. The team overcame several implementation barriers, including fulfilling regulatory and reporting requirements for emergency investigational therapy use; efficiently using scarce personal-protective equipment for consent, laboratory testing, and infusion; and rapidly deploying regulatory-approved multi-lingual mobile e-consent tools. The CCP team integrated safely, ethically, and efficiently into existing COVID-19 clinical workflows without obstructing routine operations in the ICUs and wards.</p>
              <p>Almost all patients approached by the study team completed enrollment and all those enrolled received CCP infusion. COVID-19 risk factors and disease severity differed by CCP receipt type, as expected, but demographic characteristics were comparable between CCP recipients and non-recipients. Timing of CCP infusion differed by admitting ward and patient blood type, again as expected, but not by consent process or need for Spanish-language interpreter.</p>
              <p>A major success of our program was our ability to deliver CCP to patients in just over one day from admission. While sourcing plasma from our on-site bank was slightly faster than ordering from a nearby national supplier, our ability to more rapidly infuse CCP compared to our affiliate hospitals is likely due to the additional core personnel and resources dedicated to referral and enrollment into the UNCMC program. Indeed, the less burdensome demands on providers involved with the streamlined and later to emerge EUA process closed the infusion time gap at affiliate hospitals. Within our medical center, differences in the care team structure, mode of consent, patient acuity, nurse-to-patient ratios, and process familiarity (like routine type and screen and general blood transfusion consent) likely contributed to more rapid infusion times in the ICU.</p>
              <p>Some data supports greater CCP effectiveness at higher nAb titers, with some suggesting therapeutic titer levels &gt;1:640 [<xref rid="pone.0277707.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0277707.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0277707.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0277707.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0277707.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Through our local CCP program, a high proportion of infused CCP contained at least the FDA-recommended minimum nAb titer of 1:160—approximately half of which contained high nAb titer (1:640) CCP. While these proportions are higher than those reported nationally [<xref rid="pone.0277707.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], like other academic centers [<xref rid="pone.0277707.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], we struggled to fill our CCP bank with high-nAb titer CCP. Despite persistent recruitment efforts at UNCMC to sustain a sufficient quantity of CCP, only a small proportion of contacts (13.7%) presented for voluntary donation. Further, despite efforts to target individuals likely to have high-titer plasma, we, like most donation centers [<xref rid="pone.0277707.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], had to rely on post-collection assays to qualify CCP. Consequently, our bank became disproportionately filled with low nAb titer CCP. This key deficiency in the program highlights the need for future efforts to provide more resources to rapidly develop, expedite, and distribute reliable antibody assays to pre-qualify donors before expending unnecessary resources on low-nAb titer CCP, or perhaps highlights the opportunity for future advancements in methods to concentrate and pool low-nAb titer CCP. Other areas for improvement in the program included ensuring universal assessment for CCP eligibility among inpatients and providing CCP infusion within 10 days of symptom onset for consenting patients. The latter primarily represented patients who were late presenting for care and who did so before outpatient therapeutics were available.</p>
              <p>At inception, one of our program’s goals was to conduct a CCP treatment RCT as quickly as possible. In practice, we gave more CCP via compassionate use EAP than through the RCT. This imbalance resulted from our inability to stockpile an adequate supply of nAb-titered defined CCP before our hospital met a rapid influx of admissions for COVID-19, and our concerns that integrating the RCT may create an access barrier to rapid treatment for patients. When the FDA replaced the EAP with the EUA mechanism, we were able to seamlessly transition instead to the RCT. Despite the more complicated clinical trial protocol, infusion times for clinical trial participants were similar to EAP participants at UNCMC and no different from infusion times for contemporaneous EUA participants at affiliate hospitals. These observations demonstrate that operating clinical trials in acute care settings, even during a pandemic response, may not interfere or delay routine care. Rather, we found that CCP recipients received remdesivir faster than non-recipients and were more likely to receive other COVID-19 specific therapies, suggesting that the program did not have unintended negative effects on receiving COVID-19 treatment, which is a key consideration in the RE-AIM definition of effectiveness [<xref rid="pone.0277707.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0277707.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p>
              <p>Implementation evaluations typically focus on understanding the adoption and integration of therapies with proven clinical efficacy into routine health systems. However, in the context of the novel, rapidly spreading and fatal SARS-CoV-2 virus, there was an unprecedented reversal of this typical sequence: the nationally endorsed putative therapy, CCP, was widely distributed before consensus of clinical effectiveness was obtained. We therefore applied a broader definition of implementation effectiveness, patterned after the RE-AIM framework [<xref rid="pone.0277707.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and consistent with literature focused on understanding how to introduce potential solutions into the health system [<xref rid="pone.0277707.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0277707.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], with the intention of critically examining unprecedented implementation issues that newly emerged with COVID-19 [<xref rid="pone.0277707.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. We believe that the question of ‘how’ to roll out emergent therapeutics, even prior to proven clinical efficacy, during a pandemic is an important one. Indeed, evaluations of our program, and programs like it, are essential for guiding preparation and rational use of resources for ongoing and future pandemics.</p>
              <p>Our findings should provide trialists and patients at academic medical centers with confidence that participating in a clinical trial does not impede routine care. Thus, as noted by others after the 2014–2015 West African Ebola epidemic [<xref rid="pone.0277707.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0277707.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], it seems worthwhile to coordinate response efforts early during future pandemics at centers that have the capacity to quickly collect, qualify, and infuse titer-defined convalescent plasma in multi-center RCTs.</p>
              <p>In summary, we successfully and rapidly implemented and maintained a local CCP collection, treatment, and clinical trial program at a single highly resourced academic medical center. We found that a dedicated CCP team comprised of personnel from ID and clinical trial units could be re-deployed to appropriately reach the intended population of COVID-19 patients with timely infusion of titered CCP. The greatest barrier we encountered to CCP program implementation was collecting adequate supply of high-titer plasma. We hope our findings prompt critical reflection, planning, and consideration of including a dedicated therapeutics and convalescent plasma team as part of future integrated pandemic response efforts.</p>

              <p>Reviewer #1: In this retrospective study, the authors provide an evaluation of the feasibility of operating a COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) program. Compared to affiliate hospitals the UNC CCP program provided significantly faster CCP infusion after admission. Nearly 80% of CCP recipients received the FDA recommended minimum titer.</p>
              <p>Minor revisions:</p>
              <p>1- Abstract: Define UNC.</p>
              <p>2- Abstract: Provide a measure of dispersion for time to CCP infusion for UNC and for affiliate hospitals.</p>
              <p>3- Tables: Replace “no.” with “n” since this is the standard statistical abbreviation.</p>
              <p>4- Lines 234 and 279: For clarity, identify the test as the Mann-Whitney U test.</p>
              <p>5- Figures: Include numeric p-values instead of NS.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: This study applies implementation science frameworks in attempt to evaluate the routine use of COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP), an intervention with limited evidence of efficacy.</p>
              <p>Herein is my primary concern:</p>
              <p>"Implementation science (IS) is the study of methods to promote the adoption and integration of evidence-based practices, interventions, and policies into routine health care and public health settings to improve our impact on population health" <ext-link xlink:href="https://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/is/about" ext-link-type="uri">https://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/is/about</ext-link></p>
              <p>Using implementation science frameworks to routinize an intervention of unproven efficacy goes against the principles and ethos of implementation science.</p>
              <p>The authors failed to establish that CCP is an evidence-based intervention which they want to integrate into routine practice. The literature suggests conflicting evidence on the efficacy of CCP. Examples of studies report are as follows:</p>
              <p>"CCP therapy did not result in beneficial virological or clinical improvements." (2021)</p>
              <p>
                <ext-link xlink:href="https://bmjopenrespres.bmj.com/content/8/1/e001017.abstract" ext-link-type="uri">https://bmjopenrespres.bmj.com/content/8/1/e001017.abstract</ext-link>
              </p>
              <p>"CCP did not meet prespecified outcomes for efficacy, but high-titer CCP may have benefited hospitalized patients with COVID-19 early in the pandemic when other treatments were not in use" (2021)</p>
              <p>
                <ext-link xlink:href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/2787090" ext-link-type="uri">https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/2787090</ext-link>
              </p>
              <p>The authors themselves acknowledge this gap in their study when they stated that: "COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) emerged as a 65 leading therapeutic option, although evidence of its efficacy for any infection was limited"</p>
              <p>I do acknowledge that interim recommendations were made for use of CCP. E.g.</p>
              <p>"Based on the available evidence, AABB developed interim recommendations for CCP use. These interim recommendations will be updated as more peer‐reviewed clinical trial data are published." <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8014606/" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8014606/</ext-link></p>
              <p>The authors use the RE-AIM framework, however, the indicators used do not align with the intent of the RE-AIM from the literature.</p>
              <p>For example, the indicators used to assess "effectiveness" as a RE-AIM domain are "Proportion of patients who received CCP infusion &lt; 72 hours after admission at UNCMC vs affiliate hospitals" and "Time to remdesivir in CCP recipients and non-recipients at UNCMC." These have absolutely nothing to do with "effectiveness". It would seem that the authors are aware that the intervention, not having sufficient evidence of efficacy, may not result in effective outcomes in the real world. Thus, they used a monitoring indicator to replace "effectiveness". In my opinion, this is misleading with respect to the spirit of implementation science.</p>
              <p>I believe this article can be re-written as a practice paper from the field, or fit somewhere in the monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) literature, but should certainly not be published in the guise of implementation science, as it may project an inappropriate use of implementation science frameworks.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: This manuscript describes a retrospective evaluation of a COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) program implemented at a single highly resourced academic medical center. Although this appears to be a relatively small program (including 163 people who received CCP), these data and associated narrative summary of the CCP program may provide considerations for the use of experimental therapeutics during a pandemic. The investigators report metrics describing the success of the framework of their local program and the performance of their local program, particularly relative to affiliate hospitals in a similar catchment area. This is a novel study with important implications for the next global health calamity.</p>
              <p>I have several broad and more specific comments for the authors to consider and/or clarify.</p>
              <p>Broad Comments</p>
              <p>1. Because a recent paper was published that appears to provide a large and seemingly comprehensive summary of the Expanded Access Program (EAP) for CCP,1 the novelty of this investigation should be more clearly defined. Notably, the current manuscript adds important information to the literature by describing the local framework that may support operating a local experimental therapeutic program during a pandemic.</p>
              <p>1Senefeld JW, Johnson PW, Kunze KL, et al. Access to and safety of COVID-19 convalescent plasma in the United States Expanded Access Program: A national registry study. PLoS Med 2021;18: e1003872. PMID: 34928960.</p>
              <p>2. The goals of the program described in the methods do not appear to represent a priori goals, but goals based on new information gleaned during the COVID-19 pandemic. There was limited information on timing of treatment and limited/no available assays to assess neutralizing antibody levels in April 2020. Additionally, the manuscript presents limited information about the ‘successes of these goals, but it could be suggested that these goals were not successfully reached. For example, ~30% of patients received plasma after 10 days of symptom onset, most CCP was provided outside of the local RCT, and many eligible patients did not receive CCP. Consider reframing this section of the manuscript.</p>
              <p>3. Generally, the methods supporting data curation and presentation are unclear. The authors present comparisons of CCP recipients to patients who received remdesivir. The rationale and methods supporting these comparisons should be more clearly delineated in the methods. The authors focus on CCP associated with the EAP, and (largely) do not report data associated with the local RCT. The authors should provide a justification for removing data associated with the RCT—given that the scope of the manuscript. However, the RCT is discussed at length, and presented in Supplemental material and Figure 5. It is also unclear on how data representing CCP associated with the EUA were collated if data EHR data were censored on 31 August. Additionally, the ethics associated with RCT should likely be presented given that some data are discussed (e.g. Fig 5).</p>
              <p>Specific Comments</p>
              <p>Lines 62-65: Please clarify this passage — this may be an overstatement or oversimplification. Was the access to or supply of experimental therapeutics limited?</p>
              <p>Lines 93-98: The ethics statement associated with providing CCP is clearly described. However, the ethics statement associated with collection of data via electronic health records does not appear to be described.</p>
              <p>Table 1, primary metric for reach: The final bullet point includes “10 days of illness onset”, however, most of the text states “symptom(s) onset”. Consider using the same language throughout the manuscript for reader clarity. Additionally, it is unclear why CCP relative to symptom onset is a primary metric (as opposed to ‘within 72 hours of admission’, as presented elsewhere). The time between symptom onset and admission does not represent metrics associated with the program, transfusion within 72 hours of admission is likely better represents a metric of the program.</p>
              <p>Lines 187-190: No information about post-hoc testing nor adjustments for multiplicity were provided. Because statistical analyses involved comparisons between two or more groups (e.g., Fig 2C), details about post-hoc testing and/or multiplicity should be addressed.</p>
              <p>Lines 198-200: The comparator group is not defined. “CCP recipients were more likely to…” compared to whom? According to Table 2, there were no group-related differences in comorbid conditions (P=0.156) between non-CCP recipients and CCP EAP recipients.</p>
              <p>Line 203: Please provide associated statistics to support the described group-related differences in receiving remdesivir and dexamethasone.</p>
              <p>Table 2. Gender and sex are different constructs and likely should not be used interchangeably.</p>
              <p>Line 224: The term “on-site bank” should include “blood”, or specifically refer to UNC Blood Donation Center.</p>
              <p>Line 227: The term ‘EAP recipients’ is not idiomatic. Consider an alternative phrase.</p>
              <p>Line 237-244: IQR should be defined using the quartile values (as the authors do elsewhere), as opposed to one number.</p>
              <p>Line 245-250: For clarity, the authors should consider referring to ‘CCP infusion’ rather than simply ‘infusion’.</p>
              <p>Line 240: The authors should more clearly define CCP that is described as “on-site stored CCP”. Perhaps it would be clearer to describe the collection center than the storage center. Is this CCP collected at the UNC Blood Donation Center?</p>
              <p>Line 253: Does ‘Blood Bank’ refer to UNC Blood Donation Center?</p>
              <p>Line 272: The authors should provide justification for removing April from these analyses while including April in other analyses and visuals.</p>
              <p>Line 273: Many abbreviations associated with the table are not defined (e.g. MV, AMC, RA, HFNC).</p>
              <p>Line 315: “Overall, 68 (78.2%) UNCMC CCP recipients…” The denominator associated with the percent is not clear. It appears that the denominator is 77, which is not found elsewhere in the manuscript.</p>
              <p>Line 327: The authors do not provide details on collection of data associated with the RCT.</p>
              <p>Lines 340-342: This sentence should be reconsidered. First, expert opinion primarily debates whether or not CCP has a mortality benefit rather than whether or not CCP has a role. Second, the authors fail to mention that CCP has a large role among patients with immunosuppression.</p>
              <p>Lines 346-349: “including those disproportionately affected by COVID-19”. Where is this statement evidenced? Can the authors clarify?</p>
              <p>Line 351-353: The data presented also suggest that the National pipeline may be helpful to supplement local collection efforts.</p>
              <p>Line 364-366: This passage appears to rely on conjecture rather than data presented in the manuscript. Please consider removing or providing supporting evidence.</p>
              <p>Line 390-393: It may be a reductionist viewpoint to suggest that unnecessary resources are expended on low-nAb titer CCP. Perhaps this highlights the opportunity for future advancements in methods to concentrate and pool low-nAb titer CCP.</p>

              <p>Generic comments on figures: 1) consider providing more descriptive y-axis labels on figures, 2) please define abbreviations in the legends, 3) the authors should consider including precise p-values unless &lt;0.0001, 4) consider using different symbols for different plots and/or colors that include a more color blind-friendly palette (several plots are difficult to visually distinguish)</p>
              <p>Figure 1: Please see that “hRS” is written, perhaps the authors intended “hrs”.</p>
              <p>Figure 2: The rationale for two different colors associated with UNCMC EAP in Panel A is unclear. Consider including an x-axis title on panel C.</p>
              <p>Figure 5: The abbreviation AMC is not defined. Additionally, several data appear to be outliers. (even on a semi-log scale). Did the authors perform an analysis to distinguish outliers? The authors appear to be presenting data suggesting that one patient had to wait ~6 weeks for a CCP unit.</p>
              <p>S1 Figure: Consider adding the timeline associated with on-site novel assays to directly measure the functional anti-viral activity of CCP is not depicted.</p>
              <p>S2 Figure: It is unclear why EAP and EUA data are presented separately and compared to UNCMC EAP. If data associated with UNCMC are restricted to CCP units associated with EAP, it is unclear why data for affiliates would have broader inclusion criteria and incorporate CCP units associated with EUA.</p>

              <p>REVIEWER #1</p>
              <p>In this retrospective study, the authors provide an evaluation of the feasibility of operating a COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) program. Compared to affiliate hospitals the UNC CCP program provided significantly faster CCP infusion after admission. Nearly 80% of CCP recipients received the FDA recommended minimum titer.</p>
              <p>Thank you for your directive comments. We have made all the revisions as suggested.</p>

              <p>REVIEWER #2</p>
              <p>This study applies implementation science frameworks in attempt to evaluate the routine use of COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP), an intervention with limited evidence of efficacy.</p>
              <p>Herein is my primary concern:</p>
              <p>"Implementation science (IS) is the study of methods to promote the adoption and integration of evidence-based practices, interventions, and policies into routine health care and public health settings to improve our impact on population health" <ext-link xlink:href="https://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/is/about" ext-link-type="uri">https://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/is/about</ext-link></p>
              <p>Using implementation science frameworks to routinize an intervention of unproven efficacy goes against the principles and ethos of implementation science.</p>
              <p>The authors failed to establish that CCP is an evidence-based intervention which they want to integrate into routine practice. The literature suggests conflicting evidence on the efficacy of CCP. Examples of studies report are as follows:</p>
              <p>"CCP therapy did not result in beneficial virological or clinical improvements." (2021)</p>
              <p>
                <ext-link xlink:href="https://bmjopenrespres.bmj.com/content/8/1/e001017.abstract" ext-link-type="uri">https://bmjopenrespres.bmj.com/content/8/1/e001017.abstract</ext-link>
              </p>
              <p>"CCP did not meet prespecified outcomes for efficacy, but high-titer CCP may have benefited hospitalized patients with COVID-19 early in the pandemic when other treatments were not in use" (2021) <ext-link xlink:href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/2787090" ext-link-type="uri">https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/2787090</ext-link></p>
              <p>The authors themselves acknowledge this gap in their study when they stated that: "COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) emerged as a leading therapeutic option, although evidence of its efficacy for any infection was limited"</p>
              <p>I do acknowledge that interim recommendations were made for use of CCP. E.g.</p>
              <p>"Based on the available evidence, AABB developed interim recommendations for CCP use. These interim recommendations will be updated as more peer‐reviewed clinical trial data are published." <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8014606/" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8014606/</ext-link></p>
              <p>We agree that there remains clinical equipoise surrounding the role of CCP, if any, as a therapeutic for COVID-19. We have added the three references mentioned above to our manuscript (reference #’s 28 - 30). There are many others, as well. Elaborating on the interpretation of the many CCP trials and whether sufficient evidence supports current FDA emergency use and IDSA guidelines recommendations (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.idsociety.org/covid-19-real-time-learning-network/therapeutics-and-interventions/convalescent-plasma/#:~:text=Ambulatory%20Patients%3A%20IDSA%20guidelines%20suggest,no%20other%20treatment%20options%20" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.idsociety.org/covid-19-real-time-learning-network/therapeutics-and-interventions/convalescent-plasma/#:~:text=Ambulatory%20Patients%3A%20IDSA%20guidelines%20suggest,no%20other%20treatment%20options%20</ext-link>(conditional) is beyond the scope of this manuscript. We refer the reviewer to our pre-print <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.04.29.22274387v1.full-text" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.04.29.22274387v1.full-text</ext-link> (reference #46) that delineates the importance of defining antibody content in CCP and the limitations of trials that studied CCP without defined antibodies.</p>
              <p>The authors use the RE-AIM framework, however, the indicators used do not align with the intent of the RE-AIM from the literature.</p>
              <p>For example, the indicators used to assess "effectiveness" as a RE-AIM domain are "Proportion of patients who received CCP infusion &lt; 72 hours after admission at UNCMC vs affiliate hospitals" and "Time to remdesivir in CCP recipients and non-recipients at UNCMC." These have absolutely nothing to do with "effectiveness". It would seem that the authors are aware that the intervention, not having sufficient evidence of efficacy, may not result in effective outcomes in the real world. Thus, they used a monitoring indicator to replace "effectiveness". In my opinion, this is misleading with respect to the spirit of implementation science.</p>
              <p>I believe this article can be re-written as a practice paper from the field, or fit somewhere in the monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) literature, but should certainly not be published in the guise of implementation science, as it may project an inappropriate use of implementation science frameworks.</p>
              <p>We appreciate the reviewer’s thoughtful perspective on implementation research, and we are familiar with the NCI definition of “implementation science”. We clarify that in this project we used other, broader, and more inclusive definitions of “implementation research” that have been endorsed by WHO and that we believe are relevant to our study: “Implementation research is the scientific inquiry into questions concerning implementation—the act of carrying an intention into effect, which in health research can be policies, programmes, or individual practices (collectively called interventions).” (please see: DH Peters et al., BMJ 2013;347:f6753 doi: 10.1136/bmj.f6753). And from WHO: “Broadly speaking, the term implementation research describes the scientific study of the processes used in the implementation of initiatives as well as the contextual factors that affect these processes. It can address or explore any aspect of implementation, including the factors affecting implementation (such as poverty, geographical remoteness, or traditional beliefs), the processes of implementation themselves (such as distribution of fully-subsidized insecticide-treated bednets (ITNs) through maternal health clinics, or the use of mass vaccination versus surveillance-containment), and the outcomes, or end-products of the implementation under study. Implementation research is applicable and relevant to many different research domains, and to different degrees, depending on the subject under study”. (see: <ext-link xlink:href="https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/91758/9789241506212_eng.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/91758/9789241506212_eng.pdf</ext-link>). </p>
              <p>When we began our program, it was impossible to know what, if any, therapeutics would be effective against the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus. Yet, as the first waves of hospitalized patients spread throughout the globe, there was fervent interest in rapidly deploying potential therapeutics. The current literature is almost entirely focused on the clinical outcomes of these various interventions in observational studies and clinical trials. Yet, there is a major gap in the literature regarding objective evaluations of the deployment of these interventions for either emergency use or clinical trial purposes. Indeed, the ability to implement novel interventions and clinical research amidst a rapidly spreading pandemic is a subject of interest in pandemic response literature (see Integrating Clinical Research into Epidemic Response: The Ebola Experience, National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine; Health and Medicine Division; Board on Health Sciences Policy; Board on Global Health; Committee on Clinical Trials During the 2014-2015 Ebola Outbreak.

Because we had established a priori metrics for delivery of CCP within our program, including through a randomized control trial, we agree with Reviewer #3 that we are in a position to make an important contribution to the literature that we hope can inform future pandemic responses. </p>
              <p>That said, we have followed the reviewer’s recommendation to reframe the paper more as a program evaluation and mention that we used a pragmatic application of the RE-AIM framework to that end. We have revised the manuscript title accordingly to Evaluation of a COVID-19 convalescent plasma program at a U.S. academic medical center. It is important to note that RE-AIM was designed to be used both for planning and evaluation (see: Glasgow RE, Estabrooks PE. Pragmatic Applications of RE-AIM for Health Care Initiatives in Community and Clinical Settings. Prev Chronic Dis 2018; 15:170271. DOI: <ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5888/pcd15.170271" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.5888/pcd15.170271</ext-link>.) and has been used as an empirically supported tool for systematic evaluation of a variety of implementation efforts, including real-world clinical programs (please see: Burke et al. BMC Obesity (2015) 2:21 DOI 10.1186/s40608-015-0050-8, Kwan BM, McGinnes HL, Ory MG, Estabrooks PA, Waxmonsky JA and Glasgow RE (2019) RE-AIM in the Real World: Use of the RE-AIM Framework for Program Planning and Evaluation in Clinical and Community Settings. Front. Public Health 7:345. doi: 10.3389/fpubh.2019.00345).</p>
              <p>These changes in response to the reviewer’s very much appreciated overarching comment about the manuscript are reflected throughout the manuscript (see lines 48-51, 99-102, 151-153).</p>
              <p>REVIEWER #3</p>
              <p>This manuscript describes a retrospective evaluation of a COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) program implemented at a single highly resourced academic medical center. Although this appears to be a relatively small program (including 163 people who received CCP), these data and associated narrative summary of the CCP program may provide considerations for the use of experimental therapeutics during a pandemic. The investigators report metrics describing the success of the framework of their local program and the performance of their local program, particularly relative to affiliate hospitals in a similar catchment area. This is a novel study with important implications for the next global health calamity.</p>
              <p>I have several broad and more specific comments for the authors to consider and/or clarify.</p>
              <p>Thank you for your very thoughtful comments. We very much appreciate both the broad and more detailed comments and have responded to each of them as below.</p>
              <p>Broad Comments</p>
              <p>1. Because a recent paper was published that appears to provide a large and seemingly comprehensive summary of the Expanded Access Program (EAP) for CCP,1 the novelty of this investigation should be more clearly defined. Notably, the current manuscript adds important information to the literature by describing the local framework that may support operating a local experimental therapeutic program during a pandemic.</p>
              <p>1Senefeld JW, Johnson PW, Kunze KL, et al. Access to and safety of COVID-19 convalescent plasma in the United States Expanded Access Program: A national registry study. PLoS Med 2021;18: e1003872. PMID: 34928960.</p>
              <p>Thank you for this suggestion. We have added this reference (reference #12) to the manuscript (see line 422) as well as more clearly defined the novelty of our manuscript (see lines 427-430). </p>
              <p>2. The goals of the program described in the methods do not appear to represent a priori goals, but goals based on new information gleaned during the COVID-19 pandemic. There was limited information on timing of treatment and limited/no available assays to assess neutralizing antibody levels in April 2020. Additionally, the manuscript presents limited information about the ‘successes of these goals, but it could be suggested that these goals were not successfully reached. For example, ~30% of patients received plasma after 10 days of symptom onset, most CCP was provided outside of the local RCT, and many eligible patients did not receive CCP. Consider reframing this section of the manuscript.</p>
              <p>We have clarified in the Methods section (see lines 128-138) which goals were a priori program goals and which evolved. We note that the goals for type of titer and timing of treatment evolved quickly as the COVID-19 pandemic evolved after April 2020. In their original guidance statement, the FDA stated “We recommend neutralizing antibody titers of at least 1:160. A titer of 1:80 may be considered acceptable if an alternative matched unit is not available” (see Investigational COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma Guidance for Industry, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug Administration, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, April 2020, page 6). Because we had access to neutralizing antibody assays, we did have the goal of a minimum neutralizing antibody titer as an a priori goal. We also quickly adopted a goal of 10 days from symptoms onset based on early findings of the kinetics of seroresponse from Wuhan, China and to be consistent with our randomized controlled trial protocol. These goals were incorporated into our randomized controlled trial protocol IND application (IND 22282, submitted May 1, 2020 and issued May 8, 2020). Therefore only 7 participants (Table 3) were treated prior to the intent of treatment within 10 days of symptoms onset. We have added to the Discussion section narrative noting where our program may have fell short in some respects (see lines 485-489), including in delivering CCP late and missing eligible patients, although most of the delay in time from symptom onset to CCP infusion was because of late presentation to care for many patients. In addition, please note that patients could receive CCP outside of the local RCT through our CCP program based on patient and provider preference.</p>
              <p>3. Generally, the methods supporting data curation and presentation are unclear. The authors present comparisons of CCP recipients to patients who received remdesivir. The rationale and methods supporting these comparisons should be more clearly delineated in the methods. The authors focus on CCP associated with the EAP, and (largely) do not report data associated with the local RCT. The authors should provide a justification for removing data associated with the RCT—given that the scope of the manuscript. However, the RCT is discussed at length, and presented in Supplemental material and Figure 5. It is also unclear on how data representing CCP associated with the EUA were collated if data EHR data were censored on 31 August. Additionally, the ethics associated with RCT should likely be presented given that some data are discussed (e.g. Fig 5).</p>
              <p>These are important points that we hope to clarify here. First, we largely focused on the EAP era because we had enough participants and total hospitalizations during this period to have adequate power for comparisons of demographics data and longitudinally. Demographics data from the RCT need to first be reported in the primary publication for the RCT outcomes which is currently under review (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.04.29.22274387v1.full-text" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.04.29.22274387v1.full-text</ext-link> inclusion). Thus, we only report data on the delivery infusion times of the RCT recipients here. Since there were only 55 participants during that time period, we also lack adequate power to compare with contemporaneous non-RCT participants. Additionally, the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the RCT required treatment within 10 days of symptoms onset and within 48 hours of hospital admission with a neutralizing antibody titer of at least 1:160. Therefore, by definition, all RCT participants would have met those effectiveness measures. All reported EUA use was from patients at affiliate hospitals. When the EUA replaced the EAP at these hospitals, UNCMC shifted to an RCT. All EUA data from affiliate programs was collated 9/1/2020 and 12/04/2020 to be contemporaneous with the UNCMC RCT era. Lines 140-147 now better clarify these rationale and Table 1 explicitly indicates when primary metrics were focused on the EAP era.</p>
              <p>We have added details in lines 235-241 regarding manual extraction of infusion times from the EHR for EUA and RCT enrollees. </p>
              <p>We have added an ethics statement for the RCT in the methods section (see line 121).</p>
              <p>We used remdesivir as a comparator to attempt to assess whether the CCP program had unintended negative effects on receiving COVID-19 treatment, which is a key consideration in the RE-AIM definition of effectiveness. We have provided this clarification in the methods (see lines 149-150).</p>
              <p>Specific Comments</p>
              <p>Lines 62-65: Please clarify this passage — this may be an overstatement or oversimplification. Was the access to or supply of experimental therapeutics limited?</p>
              <p>Both supply of drugs, like remdesivir, and patient access to enroll in pharmaceutical company sponsored RCTs was limited. We have clarified this passage (see lines 72-77).</p>
              <p>Lines 93-98: The ethics statement associated with providing CCP is clearly described. However, the ethics statement associated with collection of data via electronic health records does not appear to be described.</p>
              <p>We have included a statement in the ethics statement in response to this comment (see lines 122-124).</p>
              <p>Table 1, primary metric for reach: The final bullet point includes “10 days of illness onset”, however, most of the text states “symptom(s) onset”. Consider using the same language throughout the manuscript for reader clarity. </p>
              <p>Thank you for drawing attention to this inconsistency. We have changed “illness onset” to “symptoms onset” in Table 1.</p>
              <p>Additionally, it is unclear why CCP relative to symptom onset is a primary metric (as opposed to ‘within 72 hours of admission’, as presented elsewhere). The time between symptom onset and admission does not represent metrics associated with the program, transfusion within 72 hours of admission is likely better represents a metric of the program.</p>
              <p>We have added transfusion within 72 hours of admission as primary metric as a proxy measure for program effectiveness and kept transfusion within 10 days of symptoms onset as an additional primary metric as a more biologically and clinically relevant time-bound measure (see lines 132-133, 137-138). Additionally, we have moved these primary metrics to the effectiveness rather than the reach section (see table 1 and effectiveness section in the results section).</p>
              <p>Lines 187-190: No information about post-hoc testing nor adjustments for multiplicity were provided. Because statistical analyses involved comparisons between two or more groups (e.g., Fig 2C), details about post-hoc testing and/or multiplicity should be addressed.</p>
              <p>We have added to the methods section that in addition to the reported Mann-Whitney tests, we performed one-way ANOVA with multiple comparisons (Tukey-Kramer) (lines 245-247). Following a Tukey-Kramer post-hoc test, none of the p-values were significant for Figure 2C. </p>
              <p>Lines 198-200: The comparator group is not defined. “CCP recipients were more likely to…” compared to whom? According to Table 2, there were no group-related differences in comorbid conditions (P=0.156) between non-CCP recipients and CCP EAP recipients.</p>
              <p>We have clarified this (see line 256-257).</p>
              <p>Line 203: Please provide associated statistics to support the described group-related differences in receiving remdesivir and dexamethasone.</p>
              <p>We have provided these statistics (see Table 2).</p>
              <p>Table 2. Gender and sex are different constructs and likely should not be used interchangeably.</p>
              <p>Thank you for calling attention to this inconsistency. We have changed terminology to “sex” only throughout the manuscript (see Table 2, and S3 Fig supporting information captions).</p>
              <p>Line 224: The term “on-site bank” should include “blood”, or specifically refer to UNC Blood Donation Center.</p>
              <p>We have changed this to “UNCMC Blood Donation Center” throughout the manuscript.</p>
              <p>Line 227: The term ‘EAP recipients’ is not idiomatic. Consider an alternative phrase.</p>
              <p>We have changed this to “EAP participants.”</p>
              <p>Line 237-244: IQR should be defined using the quartile values (as the authors do elsewhere), as opposed to one number.</p>
              <p>We have fixed this (see lines 311-312, 317-318, 324-325).</p>
              <p>Line 245-250: For clarity, the authors should consider referring to ‘CCP infusion’ rather than simply ‘infusion’.</p>
              <p>We have made this change throughout the manuscript.</p>
              <p>Line 240: The authors should more clearly define CCP that is described as “on-site stored CCP”. Perhaps it would be clearer to describe the collection center than the storage center. Is this CCP collected at the UNC Blood Donation Center?</p>
              <p>We have clarified this (see lines 314-315).</p>
              <p>Line 253: Does ‘Blood Bank’ refer to UNC Blood Donation Center?</p>
              <p>We have changed this to, “UNCMC Blood Bank.” (see line 329).</p>
              <p>Line 272: The authors should provide justification for removing April from these analyses while including April in other analyses and visuals.</p>
              <p>We have redone these analyses to include April (see Table 3).</p>
              <p>Line 273: Many abbreviations associated with the table are not defined (e.g. MV, AMC, RA, HFNC).</p>
              <p>We have added the definitions of the abbreviations (see lines 349-353).</p>
              <p>Line 315: “Overall, 68 (78.2%) UNCMC CCP recipients…” The denominator associated with the percent is not clear. It appears that the denominator is 77, which is not found elsewhere in the manuscript.</p>
              <p>We clarified this to the following, “Overall, 68 out of the 87 (78.2%) UNCMC CCP recipients that received CCP with known titers, received …” (see lines 396-397).</p>
              <p>Line 327: The authors do not provide details on collection of data associated with the RCT.</p>
              <p>We have added these details to the Ethics statement (see lines 120-121).</p>
              <p>Lines 340-342: This sentence should be reconsidered. First, expert opinion primarily debates whether or not CCP has a mortality benefit rather than whether or not CCP has a role. Second, the authors fail to mention that CCP has a large role among patients with immunosuppression.</p>
              <p>We have revised this sentence and added a sentence and references #41 and #43 to include information about CCP’s role in immunocompromised patients (see line 422-427).</p>
              <p>Lines 346-349: “including those disproportionately affected by COVID-19”. Where is this statement evidenced? Can the authors clarify?</p>
              <p>We have clarified this statement and added new reference #44 (see lines 433-434).</p>
              <p>Line 351-353: The data presented also suggest that the National pipeline may be helpful to supplement local collection efforts.</p>
              <p>We have added that comment (see lines 441-442).</p>
              <p>Line 364-366: This passage appears to rely on conjecture rather than data presented in the manuscript. Please consider removing or providing supporting evidence.</p>
              <p>We have removed the passage of concern.</p>
              <p>Line 390-393: It may be a reductionist viewpoint to suggest that unnecessary resources are expended on low-nAb titer CCP. Perhaps this highlights the opportunity for future advancements in methods to concentrate and pool low-nAb titer CCP.</p>
              <p>We have added that comment (see lines 484-485).</p>

              <p>We have updated this reference to the published version.</p>
              <p>Generic comments on figures: 1) consider providing more descriptive y-axis labels on figures, 2) please define abbreviations in the legends, 3) the authors should consider including precise p-values unless &lt;0.0001, 4) consider using different symbols for different plots and/or colors that include a more color blind-friendly palette (several plots are difficult to visually distinguish)</p>
              <p>We have provided more descriptive y-axis labels on figures, have defined abbreviations in the legends, and included more precise p-values unless &lt;0.0001. Several changes were made to symbols and colors on the figures that are intended to be a more color blind-friendly palette. New co-author, Bridget Nelson, contributed to these figure revisions.</p>
              <p>Figure 1: Please see that “hRS” is written, perhaps the authors intended “hrs”.</p>
              <p>This change has been made.</p>
              <p>Figure 2: The rationale for two different colors associated with UNCMC EAP in Panel A is unclear. Consider including an x-axis title on panel C.</p>
              <p>The rationale for two different colors with UNCMC EAP is because Fig 2B then further splits that group into Local UNCMC CCP units and ARC CCP units. We have defined this more clearly in the legend. </p>
              <p>Figure 5: The abbreviation AMC is not defined. Additionally, several data appear to be outliers. (even on a semi-log scale). Did the authors perform an analysis to distinguish outliers? The authors appear to be presenting data suggesting that one patient had to wait ~6 weeks for a CCP unit.</p>
              <p>We have changed AMC to UNCMC throughout the manuscript. </p>
              <p>Yes, we examined for outliers and have double checked our data set for accuracy. Using a ROUT test with Q=1% which identified a total of 39 outliers across all reported categories. When we removed the outliers, the respective p-values uniformly decreased. Since the removal of outliers did not result in loss of significance, we chose to report all raw data with analyses inclusive of the entire data set, indicative of the real-world range of values. All p-values remain as previously reported. Regarding the specific example of a patient waiting multiple weeks for CCP, our center, like others, experienced situations where-in patients, especially those with high-risk factors like immunocompromise, experienced secondary worsening of symptoms resulting in prolonged hospitalizations and/or acquired COVID-19 while inpatient. In these scenarios, treating providers could request CCP as a salvage therapy or for treatment of newly acquired symptomatic COVID-19. New co-author, Bridget Nelson, contributed to these repeat analyses.</p>
              <p>S1 Figure: Consider adding the timeline associated with on-site novel assays to directly measure the functional anti-viral activity of CCP is not depicted.</p>
              <p>We struggled to depict the rolling results from these assays on the figure. We have therefore added to the figure legend: Functional neutralizing antibody assays were available by April 1, 2020 and assay results from CCP donors were reported on a rolling basis every 2-4 weeks throughout 12/01/2020.</p>
              <p>S2 Figure: It is unclear why EAP and EUA data are presented separately and compared to UNCMC EAP. If data associated with UNCMC are restricted to CCP units associated with EAP, it is unclear why data for affiliates would have broader inclusion criteria and incorporate CCP units associated with EUA.</p>
              <p>We understand how this is confusing. We do not report EUA recipients from UNCMC because we prioritized the RCT mechanism for CCP administration rather than the EUA. To further clarify, there was no temporal overlap between the EAP and the EUA. On 8/22/2020 the FDA announced a transition from EAP to EUA. At UNCMC, when the EAP ceased, we routed eligible patients into the RCT. EUA-treated patients at UNCMC were too few to report. Thus, the comparisons between EAP eras at UNCMC and affiliate hospitals are contemporaneous. Likewise, comparisons between RCT at UNCMC and EUA at affiliate hospitals are contemporaneous. This figure therefore compares both the contemporaneous EAP era times to infusion between UNCMC and affiliate hospitals as well as the time to infusion between EAP and EUA eras at the affiliate hospitals.</p>

              <p>Dear Dr. Root,</p>

              <p>Reviewer #1: (No Response)</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: I appreciate the authors for revising the manuscript and making clarifications. I am still not convinced as to why the study seeks to routinize an intervention with unproven efficacy. Is an implementation research on CCP not premature at this time?</p>
              <p>Given that the above concerns are philosophical rather than methodological, the editor would be in the nest position to decide on this.</p>
              <p>Further, I maintain that the indicators used for the "effectiveness" component of the Reach-Effectiveness-Adoption-Implementation-Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework do not in anyway speak to "effectiveness". rather they speak more to "Reach". So is the RE-AIM therefore an appropriate framework for this study, given that the intervention has not been proven to be an efficacious treatment, and thus may not be "effective" in the real world.</p>
              <p>For clarity here are the measures the authors have for "Effectiveness" the CCP</p>
              <p>• The proportion of patients at UNCMC who received CCP within 10 days of symptom onset in the EAP era.</p>
              <p>• Proportion of patients who received CCP infusion within 72 hours of admission at UNCMC versus affiliate hospitals in the EAP era.</p>
              <p>• Time to remdesivir in CCP recipients and non-recipients at UNCMC in the EAP era.</p>
              <p>Clearly these indicators cannot test effectiveness, rather they are mostly measures of "Reach"</p>
              <p>Once again, I invite the editor to consider these concerns.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: This manuscript is a revised version of a manuscript which describes a retrospective evaluation of a COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) program implemented at a single highly resourced academic medical center. Although this appears to be a relatively small program (including 163 people who received CCP), these data and associated narrative summary of the CCP program may provide considerations for the use of experimental therapeutics during a pandemic. The investigators report metrics describing the success of the framework of their local program and the performance of their local program, particularly relative to affiliate hospitals in a similar catchment area. This is a novel study with important implications for the next global health calamity.</p>
              <p>The authors should be commended on the many revisions, which appear to have improved the potential quality and impact of this manuscript— kudos. The manuscript is well-written and nicely organized, and the scientific approach remains high quality. This manuscript offers sage lessons learned and ideas about preparation for future outbreaks of infectious disease.</p>
              <p>I have no major criticisms of the work. In the continued spirit of enhancing the quality of the manuscript, modest revisions are suggested below. Please do note the text below represents suggestions and not directives.</p>
              <p>Suggested Revisions</p>
              <p>Please note the line numbers are based on the revised manuscript with track changes.</p>
              <p>Lines 96-98: Should “reduce the demand on large blood donation banks” be changed to “reduce the demand on national blood donation banks”? Of note, there may also be clinical benefits associated with using locally-sourced plasma that may represent regionally-specific, prevalent SARS-CoV-2 variants (PMID: 34381030).</p>
              <p>Line 222-224: Tittered should likely be replaced with titered. Consider rephrasing this sentence, perhaps, “…to provide sufficient supply of CCP with specified nAb titer”.</p>
              <p>Lines 242-248: Consider a comment stating that p-values for adjusted for multiplicity.</p>
              <p>Lines 256-259: If a result is not statistically significant, there is limited empirical evidence to support the statement. Consider removing this sentence.</p>
              <p>Table 2. As noted in the discussion, fantastic inclusion of members of minority race and ethnic groups. Interesting to see reduced representation of minority groups in the RCT relative to the overall program.</p>
              <p>Lines 275-276: Consider adding the phrase “of symptom onset” to the end of the sentence, such that the sentence may read “…were treated within 10 days of symptom onset”.</p>
              <p>Lines 281-284: Consider adding “of admission” after 48 hours and 24 hours.</p>
              <p>Lines 281-286: Consider switching the order of sentences 2 and 3, such that the sentence that begins “The median time from…” precedes the sentence beginning “Comparing patients receiving…”</p>
              <p>Lines 284-286: The second use of ‘median’ appears to be redundant. Consider rephrasing.</p>
              <p>Lines 322-326: This is an important and interesting finding. Although ABO compatible plasma should be transfused preferentially. Did the group use either Group A plasma or low anti-A titer Group O plasma if ABO-compatible plasma was not available?</p>
              <p>Lines 329-330: The additional time burden was associated with CCP, correct? Although this may be intuited, consider clearly denoting.</p>
              <p>Line 392: Although 8.5 donors may be mathematically precise, referring to a portion of (rather than a whole) person is “odd”.</p>

              <p>Reviewer #2: I appreciate the authors for revising the manuscript and making clarifications. I am still not convinced as to why the study seeks to routinize an intervention with unproven efficacy. Is an implementation research on CCP not premature at this time? Given that the above concerns are philosophical rather than methodological, the editor would be in the best position to decide on this.</p>
              <p>We appreciate the reviewer’s question, and we agree that the concern raised has to do with perspective rather than the methodology or interpretation of the reported results. The main issue here has to do with a re-iteration of the intention of our study, which was to evaluate a novel pandemic response program during the height of COVID-19 at an academic medical center in the United States. In response to prior comments raised by Reviewer #2, we have deliberately framed the paper as a program evaluation rather than a formal theory-driven implementation research study of introduction of an established evidence-based practice into a routine healthcare setting. A separate, and somewhat philosophical, question is whether our program evaluation falls under the domain of implementation research. While we are aware that much of implementation research is focused on how best to introduce proven therapies and avail them to target populations, broader definitions of implementation research endorsed by WHO and others are more concerned with the process of implementation itself rather than the evidence-base for the intervention being implemented per se. (For more inclusive broader definitions, see additional references: DH Peters et al., BMJ 2013;347:f6753 doi: 10.1136/bmj.f6753 and Allotey, P., Reidpath, D.D., Ghalib, H. et al. Efficacious, effective, and embedded interventions: Implementation research in infectious disease control. BMC Public Health 8, 343 (2008). <ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-8-343;" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-8-343;</ext-link> we have added these references to the manuscript - see line 660, references #49 and #50). In the case of CCP, by unprecedented necessity, this therapy was rolled out and widely distributed before clinical effectiveness could be established (see lines 97-100). Thus, our objective in this paper is not, in any way, to endorse that CCP is a proven clinically effective therapy, or to tout this work as implementation research, but rather to fill a gap in the literature, that to the best of our ability evaluates the local implementation of emergency use therapies amidst an unprecedented pandemic from a novel rapidly spreading and lethal virus that strained healthcare systems around the globe. Thus, we patterned the evaluation of our program after the dimensions of RE-AIM, consistent with prior applications of this framework and independent from considerations of the clinical effectiveness of the therapy (See our reference #15: Glasgow RE, Estabrooks PE. Pragmatic Applications of RE-AIM for Health Care Initiatives in Community and Clinical Settings. Prev Chronic Dis 2018; 15:170271. DOI: <ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5888/pcd15.170271" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.5888/pcd15.170271</ext-link>) (see lines 100-103). While we patterned our program evaluation after RE-AIM to ensure its rigor, we acknowledge that there are few frameworks with flexible construct definitions and a track record of use ideally suited for evaluating pandemic response programs like ours. We use CCP here as a case example to address how to implement emergency therapies for novel and high-mortality pathogens during global pandemics (see discussion lines 517-528). </p>
              <p>The FDA endorsement of emergency use CCP resulted in a broad sweeping deployment of CCP to more than 500,000 patients with Covid-19 in the United States alone. While these high numbers establish that CCP can be collected in large volumes and widely distributed throughout the US healthcare system, there is no existing literature that objectively reports what was necessary to implement a CCP program at a local level and whether the ‘expert opinion-based’ recommendations of treatment within certain timeframes of symptoms onset, or at a minimum defined antibody titer level, or via a compassionate use mechanism versus a typically more labor-intensive randomized control trial were feasible for hospitals with surging cases of Covid-19. From seasonal influenza, to Ebola, to now Covid-19, convalescent plasma has surfaced in the emergency setting. Therefore, we think it is critical that an evaluation of a program like ours be performed and reported. As indicated by Reviewer #3, we hope our study will inform future operations that may again turn to convalescent plasma for other novel pathogens, and the lessons learned can help guide expectations and resource allocations if convalescent plasma is used again.</p>
              <p>To be very clear, it is not our objective to seek to ‘routinize CCP’ as a clinical intervention. The reviewer makes an important point about the typical order in which the therapeutic pipeline functions—from proven therapy to distribution of that therapy. However, the reality of emergency use therapies for Covid-19 were that CCP was widely distributed before clinical effectiveness could be established. We are careful throughout the manuscript therefore to indicate that our report is not meant to be an endorsement of clinical effectiveness. Rather, our aim here, again, acknowledging the realities of the pandemic, is to provide as objective of an assessment as possible of the implementation of putative therapies. Evaluating how we implemented this emergency therapy for a rapidly surging pandemic is critical for informing, and improving upon, future pandemic responses. To that extent, we were uniquely positioned to compare certain metrics between a compassionate use versus a randomized control trial mechanism. These metrics included considerations of the reach of Covid-19 therapeutics and mitigating inequities in access to Covid-19 treatment for historically marginalized populations—both priority areas for the field of implementation research to enhance implementation in the era of Covid-19 (see reference Wensing, M., Sales, A., Armstrong, R. et al. Implementation science in times of Covid-19. Implementation Sci 15, 42 (2020). <ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s13012-020-01006-x;" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.1186/s13012-020-01006-x;</ext-link> we have added this reference to the manuscript see line 661, reference #51).</p>
              <p>For our present study, we respectfully request that if the editorial staff and other reviewers consider our report appropriate for review and publication in PLoS One, we can continue moving the manuscript forward in a timely manner. We appreciate the debate Reviewer #2’s comments have raised within and external to our group and are open to the potential opportunity for engaging in viewpoint/editorial discussions where these matters of perspective in the field can more fully be put into conversation. What is the role of implementation research in shaping our understanding of how to best implement emergency use therapies if the field is restricted only to proven effective therapies? How do governments and policy makers make informed decisions about resource allocations without knowing the personnel and material ‘costs’ of emergency use programs? How do experts provide rational guidance regarding the timing, dosing, and administration of therapies like CCP if there is no understanding of the real-world practicalities of the recommendations? How do panels decide if a situation truly warrants bypassing the randomized control trial mechanism if there has not been an objective comparison of implementation of a randomized control trial compared to compassionate use therapy. A lesson from the Covid-19 response is that decisions to roll-out emergency use therapies can occur at a national level, and prior to knowing if they are clinically proven. How do we best implement these programs when circumstances like an unprecedented pandemic force our healthcare system to operate outside of the typical therapeutic pipeline? </p>
              <p>Further, I maintain that the indicators used for the "effectiveness" component of the Reach-Effectiveness-Adoption-Implementation-Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework do not in anyway speak to "effectiveness". rather they speak more to "Reach". So is the RE-AIM therefore an appropriate framework for this study, given that the intervention has not been proven to be an efficacious treatment, and thus may not be "effective" in the real world.</p>
              <p>For clarity here are the measures the authors have for "Effectiveness" the CCP</p>
              <p>• The proportion of patients at UNCMC who received CCP within 10 days of symptom onset in the EAP era.</p>
              <p>• Proportion of patients who received CCP infusion within 72 hours of admission at UNCMC versus affiliate hospitals in the EAP era.</p>
              <p>• Time to remdesivir in CCP recipients and non-recipients at UNCMC in the EAP era.</p>
              <p>Clearly these indicators cannot test effectiveness, rather they are mostly measures of "Reach"</p>
              <p>Once again, I invite the editor to consider these concerns.</p>
              <p>We have carefully considered this concern. Again, we would like to clarify that when we are referring to “effectiveness” in our manuscript, we are referring to “implementation effectiveness”, not “clinical effectiveness.” To quote the creator of RE-AIM, Russell Glasgow: “The efficacy-based research paradigm that dominates our current notions of science is limiting and not always the most appropriate standard to apply. A reductionistic scientific paradigm oversimplifies reality in the quest to isolate efficacious treatments. Most clinical trials focus on eliminating potential confounding variables and involve homogeneous, highly motivated individuals without any health conditions other than the one being studied. This approach provides important information and strong internal validity; from an external validity perspective, however, it results in samples of non-representative participants and settings” (Reference: Glasgow et al. Am J of Public Health. September1999, Vol.89, No.9).</p>
              <p>In an effort to clarify the definition of implementation effectiveness further, we include here a table from the originator of RE-AIM, Russell Glasgow. This definition of effectiveness is outlined in his table copied and pasted below:</p>
              <p>Reference: Glasgow RE, Estabrooks PE. Pragmatic Applications of RE-AIM for Health Care Initiatives in Community and Clinical Settings. Prev Chronic Dis 2018; 15:170271.

              <p>For the purposes of implementation effectiveness of our program, the ‘benefit’ we were trying to achieve was timely administration of CCP within the expert-recommended guidance at the time of our program and as measured across sub-groups, like those that did or did not receive other Covid-19 directed therapies. We have referenced this manuscript (see lines 103, 151, 515, 522).</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: This manuscript is a revised version of a manuscript which describes a retrospective evaluation of a COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) program implemented at a single highly resourced academic medical center. Although this appears to be a relatively small program (including 163 people who received CCP), these data and associated narrative summary of the CCP program may provide considerations for the use of experimental therapeutics during a pandemic. The investigators report metrics describing the success of the framework of their local program and the performance of their local program, particularly relative to affiliate hospitals in a similar catchment area. This is a novel study with important implications for the next global health calamity.</p>
              <p>The authors should be commended on the many revisions, which appear to have improved the potential quality and impact of this manuscript— kudos. The manuscript is well-written and nicely organized, and the scientific approach remains high quality. This manuscript offers sage lessons learned and ideas about preparation for future outbreaks of infectious disease.</p>
              <p>I have no major criticisms of the work. In the continued spirit of enhancing the quality of the manuscript, modest revisions are suggested below. Please do note the text below represents suggestions and not directives.</p>
              <p>Thank you for your suggestions and for noting that this is a “novel study with important implications for the next global health calamity.” We very much appreciate your additional comments that will enhance the quality of our manuscript. We have responded to each of your suggestions below. </p>
              <p>Suggested Revisions</p>
              <p>Please note the line numbers are based on the revised manuscript with track changes.</p>
              <p>Lines 96-98: Should “reduce the demand on large blood donation banks” be changed to “reduce the demand on national blood donation banks”? Of note, there may also be clinical benefits associated with using locally-sourced plasma that may represent regionally-specific, prevalent SARS-CoV-2 variants (PMID: 34381030).</p>
              <p>We have made this edit as well as added the suggested additional comment and reference (see lines 94-96, reference #14).</p>
              <p>Line 222-224: Tittered should likely be replaced with titered. Consider rephrasing this sentence, perhaps, “…to provide sufficient supply of CCP with specified nAb titer”.</p>
              <p>We have made this suggested edit (see line 228).</p>
              <p>Lines 242-248: Consider a comment stating that p-values for adjusted for multiplicity.</p>
              <p>We have added this comment (see line 251).</p>
              <p>Lines 256-259: If a result is not statistically significant, there is limited empirical evidence to support the statement. Consider removing this sentence.</p>
              <p>We have removed this part of the sentence (see lines 259-260).</p>
              <p>Table 2. As noted in the discussion, fantastic inclusion of members of minority race and ethnic groups. Interesting to see reduced representation of minority groups in the RCT relative to the overall program.</p>
              <p>Thank you for your comment. We agree that this is an interesting observation. </p>
              <p>Lines 275-276: Consider adding the phrase “of symptom onset” to the end of the sentence, such that the sentence may read “…were treated within 10 days of symptom onset”.</p>
              <p>We have added this phrase to the end of that sentence (See line 278).</p>
              <p>Lines 281-284: Consider adding “of admission” after 48 hours and 24 hours.</p>
              <p>We have done this (see line 288).</p>
              <p>Lines 281-286: Consider switching the order of sentences 2 and 3, such that the sentence that begins “The median time from…” precedes the sentence beginning “Comparing patients receiving…”</p>
              <p>We have switched the order of these two sentences (see lines 283-288).</p>
              <p>Lines 284-286: The second use of ‘median’ appears to be redundant. Consider rephrasing.</p>
              <p>We have rephrased this sentence (see line 283).</p>
              <p>Lines 322-326: This is an important and interesting finding. Although ABO compatible plasma should be transfused preferentially. Did the group use either Group A plasma or low anti-A titer Group O plasma if ABO-compatible plasma was not available?</p>
              <p>We are aware that exceptions were allowed for use of these low anti-blood group antigen titer plasma if ABO-compatible plasma was unavailable. Out of abundance of caution and for safety purposes, however, we designed our program to only infuse ABO-compatible plasma. </p>
              <p>Lines 329-330: The additional time burden was associated with CCP, correct? Although this may be intuited, consider clearly denoting.</p>
              <p>We have edited this sentence to more clearly denote that (see lines 336-337).</p>
              <p>Line 392: Although 8.5 donors may be mathematically precise, referring to a portion of (rather than a whole) person is “odd”.</p>
              <p>We have changed this to “…approximately 8 donors…” (see line 403).</p>
