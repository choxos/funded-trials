              <abstract>
                <p>Peptides presentation to T cells by MHC class II molecules is of importance in initiation of immune response to a pathogen. The level of MHC II expression directly influences T lymphocyte activation and is often targeted by various viruses. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) encoded LANA is known to evade MHC class I peptide processing, however, the effect of LANA on MHC class II remains unclear. Here, we report that LANA down-regulates MHC II expression and presentation by inhibiting the transcription of MHC II transactivator (CIITA) promoter pIII and pIV in a dose-dependent manner. Strikingly, although LANA knockdown efficiently disrupts the inhibition of CIITA transcripts from its pIII and pIV promoter region, the expression of HLA-DQβ but no other MHC II molecules was significantly restored. Moreover, we revealed that the presentation of HLA-DQβ enhanced by LANA knockdown did not help LANA-specific CD4+ T cell recognition of PEL cells, and the inhibition of CIITA by LANA is independent of IL-4 or IFN-γ signaling but dependent on the direct interaction of LANA with IRF-4 (an activator of both the pIII and pIV CIITA promoters). This interaction dramatically blocked the DNA-binding ability of IRF-4 on both pIII and pIV promoters. Thus, our data implies that LANA can evade MHC II presentation and suppress CIITA transcription to provide a unique strategy of KSHV escape from immune surveillance by cytotoxic T cells.</p>

                <p>Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II is critical for eliciting specific adaptive immune responses against a wide range of pathogenic agents. KSHV as a member of the herpesvirus family has been shown to encode viral proteins for deregulation of the MHC II signaling pathway. In this study, we discovered that a critical viral encoded antigen LANA can significantly reduce MHC II expression by directly targeting CIITA transcription, and that IRF-4 as an activator of the CIITA promoter directly interacts with LANA, which leads to suppression of IRF-4-mediated CIITA expression. Importantly, inhibition of LANA production restores both CIITA and HLA-DQβ, the only one of six MHC II molecules expressed in KSHV-positive PEL cells. This study clearly demonstrates that each MHC II molecule could be precisely deregulated by specific viral antigen to escape from immune surveillance.</p>

              <p>Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II is known to play critical roles in the induction and regulation of adaptive immune responses to pathogenic agents <xref rid="ppat.1003751-Waldburger1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. In human, there are at least six major MHC II molecules: HLA-DRα, HLA-DRβ, HLA-DPα, HLA-DPβ, HLA-DQα and HLA-DQβ. During the initiation of the immune response, MHC II molecules expressed from antigen presenting cells (APC) are responsible for binding and presenting peptides to CD4<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes <xref rid="ppat.1003751-Matechak1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. This process triggers the activation and proliferation of the T cells and so elicits an immune response directed against the antigen derived from MHC II-bound peptides. All mature B cells constitutively express MHC class II molecules on their cell surfaces and the Class II transactivator CIITA is the master regulator of MHC class II and its downstream gene expression activities. Previous reports showed that genetic mutations of CIITA are tightly associated with pathogenesis linked to Hodgkin lymphoma and primary mediastinal B cell lymphoma <xref rid="ppat.1003751-Steidl1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Transfection of CIITA into cell lines and primary cells which normally lack MHC II expression has been shown to be sufficient to induce MHC II expression <xref rid="ppat.1003751-Honey1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Consistent with these studies, MHC II mRNA was barely detectable, and the cell surface expression of MHC II was undetectable in CIITA-deficient cells <xref rid="ppat.1003751-Chang1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003751-Otten1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. In humans, the transcription of CIITA is controlled by a multi-promoter region which harbors 4 independent promoter units <xref rid="ppat.1003751-Otten1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Among these, promoter pI is constitutively activated in dendritic cells, while pIII promoter is designated as the main regulator of CIITA expression in many hematopoietic lineages including B lymphocytes, dendritic cells, monocytes, and activated T cells <xref rid="ppat.1003751-MuhlethalerMottet1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Of particular interest to our studies, promoter pIV is predominantly involved in IFN-γ–inducible CIITA expression in APCs as well as other cell types <xref rid="ppat.1003751-Piskurich1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. However, the function of the pII promoter is still poorly understood. For CIITA-mediated MHC II expression by cytokines like IL-4 and IFNγ, it was shown that IFN-γ activates CIITA through the promotion of STAT1 binding to the GAS site, IRF-1/2 to the IRF-E box, and USF-1 to the E-box within the pIV promoter <xref rid="ppat.1003751-MuhlethalerMottet2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. In contrast, it remains unclear if IL-4 targets the CIITA promoter, although it was previously shown that IL-4 induces MHC II expression <xref rid="ppat.1003751-LombardPlatet1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p>
              <p>Interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-4 is a member of the IRF family of transcription factors that participates in a variety of immunological events, especially in pathogen recognition, hematopoietic differentiation and immune modulation <xref rid="ppat.1003751-Gabriele1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. IRF-4 is a multi-functional protein containing a conserved DNA-binding domain (binds to consensus or similar DNA sequences like interferon-stimulated response element ISRE and IRF-binding E-box elements) at the N-terminus and a variable portion at C-terminus that defines biological functions <xref rid="ppat.1003751-Gauzzi1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. The ability of IRF-4 to serve as both a transcriptional repressor and activator is determined by the DNA context of its specific binding motif and the interactions with specific transcription factors. It is distinct from other IRFs that are known to be involved mostly in regulation of MHC II inducible expression <xref rid="ppat.1003751-Loh1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. The expression of IRF-4 is restricted to the lymphoid and myeloid lineage <xref rid="ppat.1003751-Gauzzi1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, and is involved in regulation of various cellular processes including cytokine signaling and expression <xref rid="ppat.1003751-Negishi1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, proliferation <xref rid="ppat.1003751-Mittrucker1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, apoptosis <xref rid="ppat.1003751-Aldinucci1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, DNA repair, metastasis and immune recognition <xref rid="ppat.1003751-Mamane1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Deregulation of IRF-4 results in failure to produce antibodies, and impaired functions of some T cells including Th1, Th2, Th9, Th17 and T<sub>reg</sub>
<xref rid="ppat.1003751-Veldhoen1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. In addition, emerging evidence shows that IRF-4 activates the CIITA pIII promoter <xref rid="ppat.1003751-vanderStoep1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, which is involved in the associated pathogenesis linked to EBV-mediated transformation of B lymphocytes, cell growth of multiple myeloma cells <xref rid="ppat.1003751-Xu1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003751-Shaffer1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, as well as acting as a tumor suppressor in early B cell development <xref rid="ppat.1003751-Acquaviva1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, all of which supports the targeting of IRF-4 by viruses for immune suppression.</p>
              <p>Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV, also called human herpesvirus 8) is a human γ-herpesvirus and a major cause of morbidity and mortality in Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), multicentric Castleman's disease (MCD) and primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) <xref rid="ppat.1003751-Dupin1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003751-Chang2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003751-Cesarman1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003751-Soulier1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Like other herpesvirus, KSHV is predominantly latent in most cells of KSHV-associated lesions and only a few viral genes are expressed during latency. The latency associated nuclear antigen (LANA) encoded by open reading frame ORF73, is one of the critical KSHV encoded latent antigens, and is highly expressed in tumor cells of KSHV-associated malignancies <xref rid="ppat.1003751-Dupin2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003751-Parravicini1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Studies on LANA have demonstrated that it is a multifunctional protein responsible for viral persistence and tumorigenesis through targeting DNA replication, chromosome tethering, anti-apoptosis, cell cycle regulatory, and gene regulatory functions <xref rid="ppat.1003751-Friborg1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003751-Kaul1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003751-Cotter1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003751-DeLeonVazquez1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003751-Barbera1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003751-Shinohara1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003751-Lu1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>.

Although the acidic-repeat region of LANA was demonstrated to act as an inhibitor of MHC class I peptide presentation <xref rid="ppat.1003751-Kwun1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, particularly in the presentation of the ovalbumin-derived H2K<sup>b</sup>-restricted CTL epitope <xref rid="ppat.1003751-Zaldumbide1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, LANA is also able to generate specific peptide for different CD4+ T cells recognition <xref rid="ppat.1003751-Sabbah1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. However, it remains unclear however whether LANA is directly involved in dysregulation of host MHC class II anti-viral immune response.</p>
              <p>In this study, we now show that the MHC class II particularly HLD-DQβ, is significantly down-regulated by LANA, and that this inhibition is due to a direct interaction of LANA with IRF-4, which reduces the DNA-binding affinity of IRF-4 with CIITA pIII and pIV promoters in a IL-4- and IFN-γ- independent manner.</p>

                <p>LANA has been shown to widely interact with several cellular transcription factors. To analyze the overall outcome of these interactions at the level of the cellular gene transcriptome related to immune regulation, the B lymphoma BJAB cells with LANA-RFP stably expressed or RFP vector alone were established and immunology/hematology-related gene mRNA expression profiles were determined by microarray. Microarray analysis revealed that HLA-DRα (a MHC II molecule), CIITA and CREB transcripts were consistently down-regulated more than 18-fold upon LANA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003751-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). The observed down-regulation of HLA-DRα upon LANA expression was verified by northern blot analysis in both BJAB and DG75 cells transduced with LANA-expressing Lentivirus (YLF) when compared with vector alone control (GFP) at levels ranging from 4–8 fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003751-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). This was further confirmed by the fact that LANA induces a dose-dependent decrease in HLA-DRα expression in DG75 cells with transient transfection up to about 5-fold as expected when compared to the northern blot above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003751-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). To determine if HLA-DR presentation was affected by LANA, the levels of HLA-DR at the cell surface in the presence or absence of LANA was determined by flow cytometric analysis. The results showed that LANA dramatically reduced HLA-DRα presentation at the cell surface as seen by the shift in fluorescence peak for LANA-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003751-g001">Figure 1D</xref>).</p>

                <p>To confirm if LANA down-regulates CIITA in a dose-dependent manner, we performed luciferase reporter assays by using CIITA pIII or pIV promoter-driven luciferase gene expression, as well as detected endogenous CIITA protein levels by immunoblotting in both DG75 and Ramos B lymphoma cells with an increasing dose of LANA. The results showed that the reduced CIITA protein levels of 5–9 fold were seen with increased LANA expression in the two B-cell line Ramos and DG75 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003751-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Consistently, similar results showing transcriptional inhibition of both pIII and pIV promoters by LANA from the reporter assays in Ramos and DG75 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003751-g003">Figure 3B and C</xref>), strongly indicate that down-regulation of CIITA transcripts were tightly associated with LANA expression during KSHV infection. Importantly, the rapid inhibition of MHC II expression during early infection could be critical for KSHV to establish long-term latent infection (which at least is partially contributed by LANA expression, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003751-g003">Figure 3D</xref>), we also observed there was a dramatic dose-dependent inhibition of MHC II expression in the presence of LANA alone.</p>

                <p>To further elucidate the role of LANA on CIITA and MHC II expression, LANA in both KSHV-positive BC3 and JSC1 cell lines was transiently knocked down individually by introduction of small interference RNA specifically against LANA without significantly interrupting or affecting the expression of other latent transcripts <xref rid="ppat.1003751-Cai1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. The levels were monitored by quantitative PCR analysis. The results showed that the levels of both CIITA pIII and pIV transcripts were dramatically enhanced once LANA expression was reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003751-g004">Figure 4A</xref>, the protein level of CIITA was verified by western blotting at the bottom panel). Intriguingly, only HLA-DQβ but no other MHC II molecules (HLA-DRα, HLA-DRβ, HLA-DPα, HLA-DPβ and HLA-DQα), was significantly enhanced upon LANA knockdown in both BC3 and JSC1 cells (BC3 over 2 fold greater compared to JSC1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003751-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). This was further confirmed by using flow cytometric analysis with PE-conjugated antibodies specific against HLA-DQ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003751-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). Unexpectedly we also observed that the levels of HLA-DRα, DRβ, and DQα were presented consistently lower after LANA inhibition, while the levels of vIRF3 (a viral antigen previously shown to inhibit MHC II in latent infection <xref rid="ppat.1003751-Schmidt1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>) were slightly enhanced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003751-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). This supports our hypothesis that LANA not only modulates the transcriptional activity of the CIITA promoter but can directly contribute to regulation of MHC II molecules, in particular HLA-DQβ expression in a CIITA-independent manner, and that LANA can also cooperate with vIRF3 in controlling MHCII expression.</p>

                <p>To define the potential inhibitory mechanism that LANA has on CIITA promoter pIII and pIV, we examined transcription factor function on these promoters in the presence of LANA. IRF-4 is known to regulate pIII activation <xref rid="ppat.1003751-vanderStoep1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, and that we and other groups have found that IRF-4 is constitutively expressed in PEL cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003751-g005">Figure 5B</xref>) <xref rid="ppat.1003751-Arguello1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, although an additional IRF-4 protein band located around 72 kDa in both DG75 and Ramos cells while there was much lower expression of IRF-4 in BJAB cells. We asked if IRF-4 was also able to upregulate pIII or pIV promoter activity in the presence of LANA. To do so, we performed similar pIII and pIV promoter-driven luciferase reporter assays in both DG75 and Ramos cells in the presence or absence of IRF-4. Interestingly, we found that similar to the effect of IRF-4 on the pIII promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003751-g005">Figure 5C</xref>, compare lanes 2 with 1), there was a dramatic enhancement of pIV transcription in the presence of IRF-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003751-g005">Figure 5C</xref>, compare lanes 5 with 4).

                <p>To determine if IRF-4 directly interacts with LANA, we performed GST pull-down assays by using a series of <italic>in vitro</italic>-translated truncated mutants of LANA plus the full length molecule incubated with bacterially expressed GST-IRF-4 or GST alone protein. The results showed that the C-terminal domain (945–1162) of LANA strongly interacted with IRF-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003751-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). Similarly, using <italic>in vitro</italic>-translated IRF-4 co-incubated with bacterially expressed GST-LANA N (1–340) and C (945–1162), the results of GST pull-down assays confirmed that the C-terminus of LANA directly binds with IRF-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003751-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). To define which domain of IRF-4 is responsible for interacting with LANA, we generated four truncated mutants of IRF-4 with FLAG tag residues (1–271, 145–451, 246–451 and 1–135) and performed similar GST pull-down assays again by using GST-LANA C incubated with <italic>in vitro</italic>-translated truncated mutants of IRF-4. The results showed that IRF-4 bound with LANA through its DNA-binding domain (residues 1–135) at the N-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003751-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). The results which showed that in-vitro translated IRF-4 treated with DNase I still bound to LANA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003751-g006">Figure 6B</xref>), excluded the possibility that IRF-4 and LANA interaction was dependent on the DNA sequence. To confirm that these two molecules do associate in cells, we performed co-immunoprecipitation assays to determine if LANA forms a complex with IRF-4 in KSHV negative (DG75) and positive (BC3) B-lymphoma cell lines. The results of the co-IP assays from DG75 cells with exogenous LANA and IRF-4 co-expression, showed a complex of IRF-4 with LANA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003751-g007">Figure 7A</xref>, lane 6). Consistent with these results, the co-IP studies from BC3 cells showed that endogenous IRF-4 was dramatically immunoprecipitated with anti-LANA antibody, but not using a control mouse serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003751-g007">Figure 7B</xref>, top and left panels). The reverse immunoprecipitation using anti-IRF-4 antibody further confirmed that LANA does form a complex with IRF-4 in KSHV infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003751-g007">Figure 7B</xref>, top and right panels). This supports the data above that these two proteins can associate in the same molecular complex.</p>

                <title>LANA knockdown enhances DNA-binding affinity of IRF-4 with CIITA promoter</title>
                <p>Since LANA bound to the DNA-binding domain of IRF-4, we wanted to determine if LANA-mediated inhibition of IRF-4 transcriptional activity on CIITA promoter is due to the interaction of LANA with IRF-4. Therefore, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation assays with exogenous IRF-4 alone or IRF-4 and LANA in the presence and absence of pIII and pIV promoter DNA element. As shown in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003751-g007">Figure 7C</xref>, LANA dramatically reduced the ability of IRF-4 to bind to the DNA element of pIII or pIV promoter. To further confirm the consequence of LANA blocking DNA-binding ability of IRF-4 and argue for the possibility that IRF-4 can directly bind to the DNA probe, we also performed reporter assays by co-expressing exogenous IRF-4 with different truncated mutants of LANA N- and C-terminus in the presence of pIII or pIV promoter-driven luciferase reporters in DG75 cells. The results showed that LANA C-terminus instead of N-terminus significantly diminished IRF-4-mediated transcriptional activity of both the pIII and pIV promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003751-g007">Figure 7D</xref>). Consistent with the results of chromatin immunoprecipitation assays using antibodies against endogenous IRF-4, we observed that IRF-4 had a much stronger affinity when compared to the non-specific IgG control in binding to CIITA pIII promoter once LANA was knocked down in BC3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003751-g007">Figure 7E</xref>). In strong support, the levels of well-known IRF-4 downstream targets including c-Myc, CDK6 and Cyclin B1 were also enhanced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003751-g007">Figure 7E</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that LANA can reduce CIITA transcript levels through targeting the binding of IRF-4 to pIII and pIV promoters.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Latency is a phase of the viral life cycle where expressions of encoded proteins susceptible to immune recognition are significantly reduced. During KSHV latency, it has been widely demonstrated that LANA is one of the key latent antigens responsible for KSHV episome maintenance and pathogenesis <xref rid="ppat.1003751-Cai2" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. In the present study, we further characterize another function that LANA evolves an elaborate mechanism to modulate host immune response through targeting IRF-4-mediated transcription of CIITA. The interaction of LANA with IRF-4 blocks the ability of IRF-4 bound to CIITA promoters, which results in the shut-off of all of CIITA-mediated MHC II molecule expression (HLA-DR, DP and DQ). In contrast, suppression of LANA only led to a specific MHC II namely HLA-DQβ expression and presentation instead of HLA-DQα, DR or DP, as well as the evidence of vIRF3 inhibition further enhanced the HLA-DQβ expression caused by LANA suppression, indicating that LANA is directly involved with the deregulation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells immune response against viral infection through cooperation with other viral antigen like vIRF3. In addition, the inhibition of CBP which results in blocking of LANA-mediated suppression of HLA-DQβ expression indicated that LANA can play a global role on deregulation of MHCII in a CIITA dependent and independent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003751-g008">Figure 8</xref>).</p>

                  <p>In the KSHV-infected cells, the major latent antigen LANA interacts with IRF-4 and reduces the DNA-binding ability of IRF-4 on the IL-4-inducible pIII and IFN-γ-inducible pIV promoter of CIITA, which inhibits the transcriptional activity of CIITA on MHC class II promoter. Meanwhile, associated with this is LANA-mediated inhibition of MHC class II expression and presentation (particularly HLA-DQβ) and other viral genes (like vIRF3) expression in terms of cooperative regulation of host MHC II molecules during viral pathogenesis.</p>

              <p>It has been demonstrated that KSHV contains a cluster of open reading frame encoding proteins with homology to the cellular IRF family <xref rid="ppat.1003751-Cai2" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, and that IFN-γ is transcribed in most KSHV positive PEL cells <xref rid="ppat.1003751-Schmidt1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Different from these studies, KSHV encodes vIRF-3 or upregulates cellular SOCS3 expression, which were reported to inhibit MHC II expression and presentation through blocking of IFN-γ-STAT1 signaling <xref rid="ppat.1003751-Schmidt1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003751-Butler1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. In this study, we showed that LANA can directly regulate the transcriptional activity of cellular IRF-4 on the CIITA promoter independent of IFN-γ or IL-4 signaling (we have previously found that LANA blocks IL-4 induced STAT6 signaling pathway <xref rid="ppat.1003751-Cai3" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>). Interestingly, in addition to IRF-4 constitutively activating the pIII promoter as described previously <xref rid="ppat.1003751-vanderStoep1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, we have now shown that activation of the pIV promoter by IRF-4 requires an intact STAT1-binding site. Furthermore, LANA is able to efficiently block the transcriptional activity of IRF-4 by directly interacting with the DNA-binding domain of IRF-4 instead of the PU.1-binding domain. In contrast, we did not observe any effect of LANA on the pI and pII promoters of CIITA (data not shown). This may explain why LANA can inhibit CIITA through targeting IRF-4 instead of through IFN-γ or IL-4 signaling. Together with the recent report showing that vIRF3 not only modulates MHC II antigen presentation through both CIITA dependent and independent pathway, overexpression of vIRF3 also inhibits endogenous LANA expression <xref rid="ppat.1003751-Zuo1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. Our studies showing that LANA regulates MHC II in both CIITA dependent and independent manner, as well as the fact that LANA inhibits vIRF3 transcripts, further suggest that LANA and vIRF3 tightly collaborate to control MHC II and CIITA pathway.</p>
              <p>It was previously reported that KSHV encoded IRF homologues show some homology to cellular IRF-4, particularly vIRF-3 <xref rid="ppat.1003751-Lubyova1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003751-Kanno1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. To address if anti-IRF-4 antibody recognizes both vIRF-3 and vIRF-4, we performed immunbolotting assay of whole cell lysate from PEL cells by using anti-IRF-4 antibody. The results showed that only a ∼45 kDa protein band of IRF-4 appeared instead of a ∼73 kDa vIRF-3 or a ∼130 kDa vIRF-4 signal which excludes the possibility of cross recognition by the anti-IRF-4 antibody. Furthermore, consistent with the previous report <xref rid="ppat.1003751-Arguello1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, we also found that IRF-4 is constitutively expressed and has clearly different protein modified pattern in the most of PEL cells. In the B-cell context, PU.1 is required for IRF-4 to strongly transactivate downstream target genes. It is intriguing that a complete abrogation of PU.1 expression in PEL cells could be due to LANA deregulation. However, further investigation of IRF-4 downstream gene promoters (i.e. c-Myc, CDK6 and Cyclin B1) will be needed to address this hypothesis.</p>
              <p>In addition, the fact that inhibition of CIITA and partial MHC II molecules (other MHCII could be impaired by vIRF-3 expression) in PBMC upon KSHV primary infection is in a LANA-dependent manner, supports the notion that both vIRF-3 and LANA participate in deregulation of MHC II molecules through different targets. The fact that LANA knockdown restores only HLA-DQβ instead of other MHCII molecules, further confirms the conclusion that LANA can precisely regulate specific MHC II molecules not just CIITA expression. However, further investigation is required to address how LANA differentially regulates each HLA molecule independent of CIITA expression. It has been previously demonstrated that CIITA activates MHC II transcription through interactions with the ubiquitously expressed MHC II promoter binding proteins RFX, CREB and NF-Y <xref rid="ppat.1003751-Choi1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. In light of the fact that LANA can inhibit CREB <italic>trans</italic>activation by direct interaction or via indirect interaction with CREB-binding protein <xref rid="ppat.1003751-Lim1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>, it is possible that LANA may also influence more cellular genes that are involved in MHC II particularly the HLA-DQβ pathway to intervene in recognition of infected cells by the immune system. Our discovery that knockdown of CBP disrupts the up-regulation of HLA-DQβ by LANA, further confirms that CBP is one of the transcriptional factors targeted by LANA to inhibit MHC II expression. Notably, LANA knockdown did not restore all MHC II molecules except for HLA-DQβ, indicating that there are different subtle regulations of each MHC II molecule in addition to the master regulator CIITA, and that LANA may mainly target the CREB/CBP-associated HLA-DQβ. Due to the complexity of the DQ subtypes (at least DQ1, 2, 3 to 9) in human HLA which has different affinity with specific peptide, it was not surprising for us to observe that LANA knockdown do not enhance specific DQ7 or DQ5 (data not shown) T-cell recognition with particular LANA-derived peptides loading <italic>in vitro</italic>. It is also exclusive that the other KSHV encoded antigens including RTA, responsible for lytic reactivation when LANA is knocked down may be involved in deregulation of MHC II expression. We did not observe any significant change of the same promoter latent antigen vCyclin and vFLIP transcripts.</p>
              <p>In summary, the present study has identified a novel role for LANA in down-regulation of CIITA expression through a critical IRF-4 binding site within both CIITA pIII and pIV promoters. By interaction with IRF-4, LANA acts as a viral inhibitor of the MHC class II pathway, negatively regulating CIITA transcription, and thus inhibiting the expression and presentation of MHC II molecules. This further supports an increasing body of evidence which shows that viruses can escape detection of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells by inhibiting induction of MHC class II gene expressions by IFN-γ signal transduction or CIITA expression. This property may be important for LANA to contribute to KSHV latency in APCs like endothelial and B cells, and provides a significant strategy for circumvention of the immune response for survival of KSHV.</p>
