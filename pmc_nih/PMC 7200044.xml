                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Men who are overweight or obese in the rural Midwestern USA are an unrepresented, at-risk group exhibiting rising rates of cardiovascular disease, poor access to preventive care and poor lifestyle behaviours that contribute to sedentary lifestyle and unhealthy diet. Self-monitoring of eating and activity has demonstrated efficacy for weight loss. Use of mobile technologies for self-monitoring eating and activity may address rural men’s access disparities to preventive health resources and support weight loss. Our pilot trial will assess the feasibility and acceptability of two mobile applications for weight loss in rural men to inform a future, full-scale trial.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>A 6-month randomised controlled trial with contextual evaluation will randomise 80 men using a 1:1 ratio to either a Mobile Technology Plus (MT+) intervention or a basic Mobile Technology (MT) intervention in rural, midlife men (aged 40–69 years). The MT+ intervention consists of a smartphone self-monitoring application enhanced with discussion group (Lose-It premium), short message service text-based support and Wi-Fi scale. The MT group will receive only a self-monitoring application (Lose-It basic). Feasibility and acceptability will be evaluated using number of men recruited and retained, and evaluative focus group feedback. We seek to determine point estimates and variability of outcome measures of weight loss (kg and % body weight) and improved dietary and physical activity behaviours (Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) physical activity and fruit and vegetable consumption surveys, data from Lose-It! application (kcal/day, steps/day)). Community capacity will be assessed using standard best practice methods. Descriptive content analysis will evaluate intervention acceptability and contextual sensitivity.</p>

                <title>Background and rationale</title>
                <p>Over 55 million American men are overweight or obese.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Rates among midlife and older men residing in the Midwestern USA have tripled in the past 20 years, with 75.3% of all adults in the USA aged 40–59 years are overweight or obese.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Rural men report overall poorer health than urban men.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Their obesity status predisposes high risk for metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3–5</xref> Historically, rural men were less likely to be overweight and obese due to the high levels of physical activity involved in agricultural occupations.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> However, the mechanisation of agriculture has shifted men’s work roles to more sedentary, technology-driven lifestyles, increasing the likelihood of developing overweight/obesity.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 8</xref></p>
                <p>Mobile health applications such as messaging and other interfaces available via mobile phone have demonstrated improvement in health behaviour change for weight loss among adults,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9–11</xref> and in some hard-to-reach minority populations.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> The benefit that mobile technologies may hold for engaging hard-to-reach rural men for weight loss is unknown. In addition, there has been limited study of men’s health promotion through weight loss,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> particularly rural men.</p>
                <p>Men, when compared with women, are less likely to use weight control practices,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> attempt weight loss or participate in weight loss programmes.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15–17</xref> Poor access to weight loss resources is one reason.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Rural men also tend to exhibit dominant masculine norms,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> which view help-seeking behaviours and health promotion strategies as feminine and weak.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 19</xref> Health promotion activities oriented to rural men’s work roles are preferred.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Therefore, a weight loss intervention whose content is adapted to the local norms, is accessible through the privacy of a smartphone, and communicated in an acceptable tone is critical. The Rural Men’s Health Study plans to address the current gaps in knowledge by delivering a contextually sensitive weight loss intervention that is feasible to the rural environment and acceptable to participants.</p>

                <title>Aims</title>
                <p>We aim to 1) determine the feasibility and acceptability of a mobile technology enhanced self-monitoring intervention (Mobile Technology Plus (MT+)) for achieving weight loss in routine care of overweight and obese men in rural communities, 2) determine the point estimates and variability of outcome measures at 3 and 6 months following MT+ and MT interventions for achieving weight loss and improved dietary and physical activity behaviours for sample size estimation for a larger trial and 3) determine quantitative and qualitative indicators of community capacity (resource mobilisation, partnership linkages) to support a relevant weight loss intervention for rural men.</p>

                <p>We propose a pilot, feasibility,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> pragmatic randomised controlled trial (pRCT) with an allocation ratio of 1:1. We will randomise 80 men into two groups: intervention and comparison. This pRCT will observe men in real-life rural conditions using varied versions of a mobile phone-based self-monitoring application: one that is free and available in the community setting and an enhanced, premium version.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Recommendations of good practice for design and analysis of a pilot study note that 30 participants per group is sufficient to estimate values for future trials sample size calculations.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23 24</xref> As weight loss studies in rural men are a gap in the current literature, it is important that we obtain reliable estimates of effect size with which to perform a power analysis for subsequent research. So 30 participants per group will be needed, for a total of 60. Some participants will likely not complete the study, so we will enrol 80 men to allow for up to a 25% attrition rate. Participants will complete assessments at baseline, 3 and 6 months postbaseline.</p>

                <title>Public and patient involvement</title>
                <p>Community engagement was used to inform the development of this protocol involving health professions students from the disciplines of nursing, physical therapy and public health. A community advisory board (CAB) was also developed. The CAB members represent the rural sampling region (ie, farmers, insurance and machinery dealers, extension staff and community health workers) and meet quarterly to inform the study approach, material content and imaging, targeted venues for social marketing, dissemination of recruitment materials and the direct referral of eligible participants. The funding source for this pilot study requires student involvement in study activities. One goal of the supporting grant mechanism was to expose under-represented rural students to research. Therefore, we involved graduate and undergraduate student nurses from the study sampling region.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> We are involving undergraduate level student nurses in planning, implementation and evaluation of community outreach and recruitment strategies. Two graduate (Masters and PhD) level student nurses, who are part of the investigative team, will also be used to assist with implementation and evaluation of the intervention, as described in Participants and interventions.</p>

                  <title>Aim 1: MT+ intervention feasibility and acceptability</title>
                  <p>Aim 1 will be evaluated through: 1) participation rates including number of men recruited and randomised over a 6-month period; 2) participant retention rates; 3) feasibility, usability, satisfaction ratings; 4) application logs of MT+ and 5) evaluative focus group feedback. Descriptive statistics will be calculated on all variables, including frequencies and percentages for recruitment/retention, demographic and categorical variables. To determine feasibility of recruitment, a rate will be measured in the time it takes to enrol 80 participants. To determine feasibility of retention, we used a threshold retention of 70% which is similar to studies of weight loss in men.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref> Feasibility, usability and satisfaction ratings will be measured from modified health-iTUES, which was originally validated by authors to measure technology usability, but has further been validated to be used as a customisable technology survey.<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref> Means and SD will be calculated for all continuous variables and measures at each time point. Feasibility and acceptability analyses for aim 1 are largely descriptive, as we will be assessing participation rates and percentages of eligible men and which recruitment methods were the most effective.</p>
                  <p>Qualitative content analysis<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> will guide interpretation of the focus group findings. The interview transcript and reflective memos taken during each focus group will comprise one unit of analysis for within/across case comparison. The topics outlined by the interview guide will be extracted and organised and transcripts read for substantive coding. Data ‘facts’ will be organised under a priori coding categories. The categories are named a priori because they are built into the interview guide questions. A data ‘fact’ will be defined as those data elements that recurred in the interview without lack of consensus or were least participant to errors in inference.<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref> All data provided in a response to each question will be coded together. Incomplete, competing or alternative topics that present in the discussion but were not identified a priori will be aggregated and examined to determine their fit with the purpose.<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref> A data matrix will be used to display the coded data to search for patterns across coding categories. The principal investigator and graduate student nurse will return to the data to explore patterns further, supporting iterative analysis. Data categories will be re-contextualised into an account that makes sense for the entire study’s data set. Meaning, the findings are integrated to provide new understanding or explanation to the interpretation of the intervention outcome data.<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref> Peer-debriefing and audit checking will occur weekly across the analysis to assure accuracy of the findings.</p>

                  <title>Aim 2: variability of outcome measures and sample size estimation</title>
                  <p>Descriptive statistics of participants’ profiles for outcomes by time point and stratified by intervention group will be reported. The proportion of participants meeting the clinically meaningful threshold of 5% wt loss over the course of the study will also be reported. A maximum likelihood estimation method (ie, mixed models) will be used in order to use all available data. Outcome variables that are not normally distributed will either be transformed or assessed with non-parametric methods. An independent group t-test will be used to assess overall weight loss at follow-up solely to estimate an effect size (Cohen’s d for weight loss between groups) for sample size estimation for a future large trial.</p>

                  <p>Multiple indicators of community capacity will be used to evaluate support for the weight loss intervention applying best practice recommendations: 1) CAB-assessed community capacity change via survey report,<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> participation level of CAB members (ie, number of attended meetings, activities, resources allocated, partnership linkages), member attrition with reasons, perceived benefits/skills gained, barriers and facilitators of retention, proposed strategies to increase retention, 2) student support in the outreach and recruitment will be tracked via number of hours of participation and partnership linkages.</p>

Safety monitoring will be conducted monthly by the principal investigator, study statistician and independent data safety monitor. Per university policy, all serious adverse events (AEs) and unintended effects of the intervention will be reported to the university IRB and the independent data safety monitor (IDSM) within 2 days after the principal investigator is notified of the AEs. The technology safety report will include troubleshooting requests from participants, re-engagement attempts for participants who were not logging and any technology-related protocol violations. The enrolment safety report includes new enrolment counts, subject withdrawals, protocol violations, AEs and preliminary outcomes.</p>
