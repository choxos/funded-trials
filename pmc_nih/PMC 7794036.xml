              <abstract>
                <p>Preterm birth occurs at excessively high and disparate rates in the United States. In 2016, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) launched the Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) program to investigate the influence of early life exposures on child health. Extant data from the ECHO cohorts provides the opportunity to examine racial and geographic variation in effects of individual- and neighborhood-level markers of socioeconomic status (SES) on gestational age at birth. The objective of this study was to examine the association between individual-level (maternal education) and neighborhood-level markers of SES and gestational age at birth, stratifying by maternal race/ethnicity, and whether any such associations are modified by US geographic region. Twenty-six ECHO cohorts representing 25,526 mother-infant pairs contributed to this disseminated meta-analysis that investigated the effect of maternal prenatal level of education (high school diploma, GED, or less; some college, associate’s degree, vocational or technical training [reference category]; bachelor’s degree, graduate school, or professional degree) and neighborhood-level markers of SES (census tract [CT] urbanicity, percentage of black population in CT, percentage of population below the federal poverty level in CT) on gestational age at birth (categorized as preterm, early term, full term [the reference category], late, and post term) according to maternal race/ethnicity and US region. Multinomial logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Cohort-specific results were meta-analyzed using a random effects model. For women overall, a bachelor’s degree or above, compared with some college, was associated with a significantly decreased odds of preterm birth (aOR 0.72; 95% CI: 0.61–0.86), whereas a high school education or less was associated with an increased odds of early term birth (aOR 1.10, 95% CI: 1.00–1.21). When stratifying by maternal race/ethnicity, there were no significant associations between maternal education and gestational age at birth among women of racial/ethnic groups other than non-Hispanic white. Among non-Hispanic white women, a bachelor’s degree or above was likewise associated with a significantly decreased odds of preterm birth (aOR 0.74 (95% CI: 0.58, 0.94) as well as a decreased odds of early term birth (aOR 0.84 (95% CI: 0.74, 0.95). The association between maternal education and gestational age at birth varied according to US region, with higher levels of maternal education associated with a significantly decreased odds of preterm birth in the Midwest and South but not in the Northeast and West. Non-Hispanic white women residing in rural compared to urban CTs had an increased odds of preterm birth; the ability to detect associations between neighborhood-level measures of SES and gestational age for other race/ethnic groups was limited due to small sample sizes within select strata. Interventions that promote higher educational attainment among women of reproductive age could contribute to a reduction in preterm birth, particularly in the US South and Midwest. Further individual-level analyses engaging a diverse set of cohorts are needed to disentangle the complex interrelationships among maternal education, neighborhood-level factors, exposures across the life course, and gestational age at birth outcomes by maternal race/ethnicity and US geography.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Preterm birth (PTB) (&lt; 37 weeks’ gestation) occurs at excessively high rates in the United States compared to other developed nations. Provisional data for 2018 show an overall US rate of PTB of 10.02%, up from 9.93% in 2017, which translates to 386,400 affected births annually [<xref rid="pone.0245064.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0245064.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Within the United States, the rate of PTB varies considerably by race/ethnicity [<xref rid="pone.0245064.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In 2015–2017, the highest rate of PTB was for women who were non-Hispanic black (13.6%), followed by American Indian/Alaska Native (11.3%), Hispanic (9.4%), non-Hispanic white (9.0%), and Asian/Pacific Islander (8.7%) [<xref rid="pone.0245064.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. There is also substantial state-to-state variation in rates of PTB, with the lowest rates in the northeastern and northwestern states and the highest rates in the southeastern states [<xref rid="pone.0245064.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. States with higher percentages of non-Hispanic black women have higher rates of PTB even after adjusting for state-specific rates of poverty, obesity, smoking, and teen birth [<xref rid="pone.0245064.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. There is a growing recognition of the adverse child health effects associated with early term birth (37-0/7 weeks through 38-6/7 weeks), including elevated rates of infant mortality and long-term neurological morbidity [<xref rid="pone.0245064.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0245064.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Both late-term (41-0/7 weeks through 41-6/7 weeks) and post-term birth (42-0/7 weeks and beyond) are associated with an increased risk for stillbirth and perinatal death; additional fetal risks of post-term births include macrosomia, neonatal seizures, and meconium aspiration [<xref rid="pone.0245064.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0245064.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Limited published data have investigated risk factors for early-term, late-term, and post-term births, although a 2014 analysis demonstrated that racial disparities exist in rates of early-term delivery among US women [<xref rid="pone.0245064.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p>
              <p>The observed disparities in rates of gestational age at birth by race/ethnicity and geography are theorized to be related in part to differences in individual-level socioeconomic status (SES) [<xref rid="pone.0245064.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Those of lower SES have a higher burden of a range of adverse health outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0245064.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and across various measures of individual-level SES (including maternal level of education and income, marital and employment status, and type of health insurance) there is a consistent social gradient in the risk of PTB [<xref rid="pone.0245064.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Differences in individual-level SES do not adequately account for racial/ethnic disparities in PTB, however [<xref rid="pone.0245064.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. A substantial body of research has focused on the role of stress and racism, revealing that racial discrimination is an important source of stress for black women and that physiological responses to chronic stress contribute to their excess rates of PTB [<xref rid="pone.0245064.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0245064.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. More recently, neighborhood-level markers of SES have been explored in relation to PTB [<xref rid="pone.0245064.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0245064.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], as they have been conceptually linked to adverse birth outcomes via pathways mediated by individual-level health behaviors, psychosocial factors, social support, stress, and access to quality health care, healthy food, and recreational facilities [<xref rid="pone.0245064.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p>

              <title>Objective</title>
              <p>In 2016, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) launched the Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) program to investigate the influence of early life environmental exposures on child health and development. ECHO funds existing pediatric cohorts throughout the United States (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nih.gov/echo/pediatric-cohorts">https://www.nih.gov/echo/pediatric-cohorts</ext-link>) that have observed children for many years. Participating cohorts underwent a competitive application process to become part of the ECHO consortium of cohorts, with the goal of enrolling and following more than 50,000 children from diverse racial, geographic, and sociodemographic backgrounds. The application and selection process required that cohorts commit to both integrating data already collected via extant study protocols and to collecting new data collected through the ECHO-wide cohort data collection protocol [<xref rid="pone.0245064.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The ECHO Data Analysis Center (DAC) initiated collective analyses, an innovative adaptation of meta-analysis, as a strategy to speed early research productivity by allowing cohorts to combine extant data using extant data and to accelerate a collaborative research environment among the ECHO cohorts and components [<xref rid="pone.0245064.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. These collective analyses allowed for cohorts to combine data from across their cohort sites without having to share individual-level participant data, which was not permissible in most cases due to the extant data representing data collected under cohort-specific consent processes that did not specify sharing across cohorts or with the DAC. New data collected through the ECHO-wide cohort data collection protocol is being done under consent processes that do allow for sharing of individual-level participant data.</p>
              <p>This collective analyses capitalizes on the extant data available from cohorts participating in the ECHO program to: 1) examine the association between both individual-level (maternal education) and neighborhood-level (census tract [CT] urbanicity, percentage of black population in CT, and percentage of population below the federal poverty level in CT) markers of SES and categories of gestational age at birth, stratifying by maternal race/ethnicity; and 2) determine whether associations between individual- and neighborhood-level markers of SES and gestational age at birth are modified by US geographic region. In addition, this study serves as a demonstration of the collective analysis process within a consortium of pediatrics when identifiable participant-level data could not be shared.</p>

                <title>Study population</title>
                <p>The study population consisted of women enrolled in an ECHO cohort who delivered a liveborn singleton infant for whom the following exposure and covariate information was available: maternal prenatal education and residential address or geographic region during the prenatal period for the biological mother, mother’s age at delivery, and child’s birth sex. Cohorts were excluded from initial consideration if their cohort-specific selection criteria restricted child enrollment based on gestational age (e.g., only PTB), or if no gestational age or maternal prenatal education information was collected. Forty-four cohorts, representing 230 recruitment sites, contributed data on 34,155 mother-infant pairs for consideration of inclusion in this analysis. Twenty-six cohorts representing 110 recruitment sites and 25,526 mother-infant pairs contributed to these analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0245064.g001">Fig 1</xref>) after excluding three cohorts missing information on maternal prenatal education, one cohort lacking heterogeneity in maternal prenatal education, one cohort missing address information, four cohorts missing parity, five cohorts missing marital status, and four cohorts with small sample size (e.g., ≤ 30 participants having information on all required covariates). For each cohort that contributed data, the local institutional review board reviewed and approved the protocol for collecting data; all cohort participants provided written informed consent.</p>

                <title>Gestational age at birth</title>
                <p>Gestational age at birth was categorized as defined by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists: preterm (22-0/7 weeks through 36-6/7 weeks), early-term (37-0/7 weeks through 38-6/7 weeks), full-term (39-0/7 weeks through 40-6/7 weeks, the reference category), late-term (41-0/7 weeks through 41-6/7 weeks), and post-term (42-0/7 weeks and beyond) [<xref rid="pone.0245064.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Late and post-term births were collapsed due to small sample sizes. Gestational age was captured according to an accepted hierarchy [<xref rid="pone.0245064.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0245064.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and was ascertained using the following methods: crown rump length of an early ultrasound or dating based on <italic>in vitro</italic> fertilization (20.7%), ultrasound taken in the second trimester with fetal biparietal diameter dating within 2 weeks of sure last menstrual period (LMP) (7.9%); ultrasound taken in the second trimester with unsure or no LMP date (1.3%); report from obstetrical medical record reporting “consensus” estimated date of delivery (55.5%); dating by LMP with a third trimester ultrasound dating within 2 weeks of estimated date of delivery by LMP dating (0.03%); dating from LMP date only (5.5%); reported by mother (8.8%). Only 0.43% of participants were missing method of ascertainment of gestational age. Within participating cohorts, individuals were excluded if gestational age was missing (n = 500) or if gestational age at birth was &lt;22 weeks or &gt;44 weeks (n = 10).</p>

                <title>Maternal level of education</title>
                <p>Maternal prenatal level of education, by self-report, served as the individual-level measure of SES and was categorized as high school diploma, GED, or less; some college, associate’s degree, vocational or technical training (the reference category); and bachelor’s degree, graduate school, or professional degree.</p>
                <p>We used the categorical variable of maternal level of education as the main individual-level measure of SES based on existing research among US populations that support that education is the dimension of SES that most strongly and consistently predicts health, especially for women and children [<xref rid="pone.0245064.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0245064.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Also, maternal level of education as a categorical variable was more available across the ECHO cohort extant data. Paternal level of education was less often collected by the cohorts or, when collected, was oftentimes missing. Similarly, household income was less available across cohorts in that either entire cohorts did not collect this data or the variable response was missing within cohorts. Also, in order to be meaningfully interpreted income in relation to the federal poverty line, household income must be combined with household density, which was also not uniformly available across cohorts and/or was missing within cohort extant data. Furthermore, even when using the federal poverty thresholds, the meaning of the various income groupings varies a great deal across states and according to rural/urban status.</p>

                  <title>Geocoding</title>
                  <p>Primary residential address of the biological mother during pregnancy was ascertained from the earliest address collection during pregnancy. Decentralized Geomarker Assessment for Multi-Site Studies (DeGAUSS) was used to geocode the prenatal residential address for each cohort locally. Information regarding the DeGAUSS software has been described elsewhere [<xref rid="pone.0245064.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. DeGAUSS, a freely available distributed geocoding system, facilitates reproducible geocoding and geomarker assessment in multi-site studies while maintaining the confidentiality of protected health information by enabling the sites access to a single embedded geocoding engine that uses the same nationwide street address data base (the Census Bureau’s Topologically Integrated Graphical Encoding and Referencing, TIGER, data) and matching code without having to share address data. The DeGAUSS geocoder used current (at the time of the study) TIGER street centerline address range files to convert residential addresses into geographical coordinates and provided assessment of qualitative precision for the geocodes [<xref rid="pone.0245064.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Using the latest TIGER street centerline address range files was appropriate because of improvements to street and address ranges made by census bureau over time. After geocoding, the resulting latitude/longitude coordinates were joined to the TIGER 2000 Census Tract boundaries. Since census tracts are revised only every ten years, the TIGER 2000 Census Tract boundaries were needed in order to correctly match the census tract for geocoded addresses to the 2005–2009 American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year estimates, which used the same census tract identifiers as the 2000 TIGER census tract layer. We chose the ACS 2005–2009 dataset because for births prior to 2005–2009 there is not a corresponding five-year ACS file that contains estimates for every CT (2005–2009 is the first available release of this data) and, during the analysis planning stage, 2008 seemed to be the approximate mid-point of participant enrollment. Geocodes of addresses that matched to street segments or street centers were included. There were 166 participants with missing addresses. Addresses that matched to intersections of streets, zip code centroids, or cities and addresses that failed to map to a valid latitude and longitude were excluded (n = 870). The percentage of text match between the residential address and the geocoded result was calculated for each observation. Records with less than 60% text match were excluded (n = 1071). For cohorts that did not wish to use DeGAUSS, the ECHO Data Analysis Center (DAC) offered options to supply 1) high-quality GPS-based latitude/longitude coordinates or 2) latitude/longitude coordinates generated by commercial or other high-quality geocoders (e.g., ArcGIS) that had been manually examined and corrected. The Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) codes were then determined based on valid geocodes using the DeGAUSS geocoder as CT identifiers. A total of 23,419 participants from 26 cohorts provided addresses that were successfully geocoded (92% of the address records). Twenty-three cohorts geocoded maternal prenatal address using DeGAUSS; two cohorts used ArcGIS, and one cohort provided high-quality GPS-based latitude/longitude coordinates.</p>

                  <title>Neighborhood-level SES variables</title>
                  <p>CT variables are aggregated individual characteristics within a CT and are used to represent the neighborhood sociodemographic environment. For participants whose prenatal residential address was successfully geocoded (n = 23,419), their neighborhood-level characteristics were obtained by linking the FIPS codes to the 2005–2009 ACS 5-Year Estimate [<xref rid="pone.0245064.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] for three CT level markers of SES: urbanicity (rural vs. urban [reference category]), percentage black population in CT (as a measure of segregation), and percentage population living below the 100% federal poverty line in CT (as a measure of poverty) [<xref rid="pone.0245064.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The continuous measures of percent black population and percent population living below the federal poverty line in the CTs were dichotomized as “below national average” and “above or equal to national average,” where the national averages were defined as the median percent of the tract population among all US CTs for each variable of interest. The neighborhood-level variables were coded as missing for those with missing geocoded addresses; those with missing geocoded addresses still participated in descriptive analyses overall and by race/ethnicity but were excluded from adjusted analyses. The number of CTs per cohort ranges from 32 to 592, with an average of 257 CTs per cohort. The mean number of observations per CT ranges from 1 to 9.7, with an average of 3.7.</p>
                  <p>We selected the three CT level markers of SES based on past research that investigated the relationship between census tract markers of SES and preterm birth, which found that the single-measure variable of percentage of persons below the poverty level performed as well as more complex, composite measures of economic deprivation [<xref rid="pone.0245064.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] in conjunction with our a priori interest in exploring CT markers of rural/urban status and segregation in conjunction with poverty. Specifically, Carmichael et al. [<xref rid="pone.0245064.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] found that the single-measure of percent of the CT population below the poverty level correlated well with an eight-measure index of CT variables (r = 0.86) and resulted in the same conclusions. We chose to consider SES measures at the level of CT based on literature showing that CT-level analyses resulted in maximal geocoding linkage (i.e., the highest proportion of recorded geocoded and linked to census-defined geography) and that measures of economic deprivation at the CT-level were most sensitive to expected socioeconomic gradients in health among non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic white, and Hispanic men and women [<xref rid="pone.0245064.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0245064.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. We used five-year data releases from ACS as only the five-year releases are guaranteed to have estimates for every CT in the United States, with the 2005–2009 five-year release being the first release available. In this disseminated meta-analysis, addresses were geocoded at the cohort level using DeGAUSS as participant address could not be shared with the DAC; disseminating analytical code to the cohorts to run locally using time-weighted averages for each woman was not possible across all of the participating cohorts.</p>

The ECHO DAC provided cohorts with a data dictionary with variable names and definitions, which cohorts used to create a standardized data set, and a common statistical code, which cohorts used to perform a standardized analysis upon their cohort-specific dataset. This approach standardizes the statistical methods as individual cohorts conduct the same analyses. The code was designed to automatically save all estimates and variance-covariance matrices needed to perform the meta-analysis. The code also included quality control measures. Any errors in the cohort-specific dataset stopped the program and flagged errors to the cohort. Errors needed to be rectified for the program to successfully run. The ECHO DAC received and reviewed cohort-specific metadata and descriptive statistics, including information about any data discrepancies and worked with the cohort to resolve any errors, to create the data set for disseminated meta-analysis.</p>

                  <p>All statistical models were performed on non-imputed data and imputed data. A conservative approach was taken in that regressions were only run if there were at least 30 complete observations in each cohort. We pooled the exposure estimates from cohorts with at least five observations in both the reference category and the corresponding level of interest for the outcome and exposure. Therefore, the number of cohorts contributing to each association varied based on these sample size constraints. We employed this restriction to address concern regarding unstable estimates due to small sample sizes. Results were similar between non-imputed and imputed data; therefore, final analyses were based on the imputed data since parameter estimates were more stable.</p>

Of the 25,526 mother-infant pairs, 14,813 (58.0%) delivered full-term; 1,864 delivered preterm (7.3%), 6,191 delivered early-term (24.3%), and 2,658 (10.4%) delivered late- or post-term. The largest percentage of participating women were non-Hispanic white (48.7%), with a bachelor’s degree or above (42.7%), and were married (69.8%). The mean maternal age at child’s birth was 30 years old. Most of the women (72.2%) reported receiving prenatal care. Tobacco and alcohol were used by 10.8% and 19.1% of the women during pregnancy, respectively. Most women were parous with 1–2 (47%) or ≥3 (9.1%) prior births; only 2.9% of the women had a history of a prior PTB. In the index pregnancy, 12.8% experienced a cardiometabolic complication of pregnancy, 8.8% an obstetrical complication, 4.1% a prenatal urinary tract infection, and 5.1% a reproductive tract infection. The largest percentage of women lived in the West (33.9%), followed by the Northeast (25.8%), Midwest (22.2%), and the South (18.0%). Fifty-one percent of pregnant women lived where the percentage of the CT population that was black was below the national average of 3.6% (based on the median of the county-level characteristic from the 2005–2009 ACS), and 54% of the pregnant women lived in a CT where the percentage of the tract population that was below 100% of the federal poverty line was below the national average of 11.5% (based on the median of the county-level characteristic from the 2005–2009 ACS) [<xref rid="pone.0245064.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].

                <p>In unadjusted analyses, there were significant differences in the odds of preterm, early-term, and late-post-term relative to full-term birth according to maternal race/ethnicity. Compared to non-Hispanic white women, women of all other races/ethnicities had a significantly increased odds of preterm or early-term birth (<xref rid="pone.0245064.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Non-Hispanic black women had the highest odds of PTB (crude odds ratio [cOR] 2.00, 95% CI: 1.65–2.42) and early-term birth (cOR 1.36, 95% CI: 1.14–1.61) compared to Non-Hispanic white women. Regarding late- or post-term birth, non-Hispanic black women (cOR 0.76, 95% CI: 0.61–0.95) and non-Hispanic women of other race/ethnicity (cOR 0.84, 9% CI: 0.72–0.98) had significantly decreased odds compared to non-Hispanic white women. A detailed breakdown of the race and ethnicity frequencies of mothers included in the study by gestational age at birth category is available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0245064.s002">S2 Table</xref>.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Using extant data available from the ECHO cohorts, this study found that, among women overall, level of maternal prenatal education was associated with gestational age at birth category. Specifically, for women overall, maternal education of a bachelor’s degree or above, compared to some college, was associated with a significantly decreased odds of PTB whereas a high school education or less was associated with an increased odds of early-term birth compared to full-term birth. Among non-Hispanic white women, the relationship between a bachelor’s degree or higher remained associated with a significantly decreased odds of PTB and, furthermore, was associated with a significantly decreased odds of early-term birth. There were no significant associations between maternal education and gestational age at birth category among women of racial/ethnic groups other than non-Hispanic white.</p>
              <p>The relationship between higher maternal level of education and lower PTB risk has been previously documented in the United States [<xref rid="pone.0245064.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0245064.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Although our results were not significant for women of all racial/ethnic groups, point estimates suggested an association between increased levels of maternal education and decreased odds of PTB. Lack of statistical power may have been due to smaller sample sizes for the race/ethnicity-specific strata. It is also possible that the effect of maternal level of education is not as related to PTB among women of race/ethnicity other than non-Hispanic white. One explanation for the persistence of racial/ethnic disparities after accounting for measures of SES, such as maternal education, is that specified levels of SES are not equivalent across racial/ethnic groups [<xref rid="pone.0245064.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0245064.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. At every level of education, African American women have lower earnings and less accumulated wealth than white women and face higher average costs for housing, food, and insurance while having more people dependent on their incomes, making racial/ethnic groups not comparable at a given level of SES [<xref rid="pone.0245064.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>].</p>
              <p>In this study, the association between maternal education and gestational age at birth varied according to US region, with higher levels of maternal education associated with a decreased odds of PTB in the Midwest and South but not associated with gestational age at birth in the Northeast and West. According to the US Census Bureau, the Midwest and South have the lowest percentages of individuals attaining college education [<xref rid="pone.0245064.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Few studies have directly evaluated how the relationship between antecedent factors, such as socioeconomic and maternal health factors, vary across US geography and according to race/ethnicity [<xref rid="pone.0245064.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Across the United States there is wide variation in policies that affect women’s and children’s access to and utilization of health care and other human services; reports by the Center for American Progress outline policy solutions to improve maternal and infant health outcomes and summarize policy-level information at the state-level [<xref rid="pone.0245064.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0245064.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Policies related to state-level earned income tax credit laws have also been shown to affect maternal health behaviors and infant health outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0245064.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. In regard to the neighborhood-level measures of SES, non-Hispanic white women residing in a rural CT compared to an urban CT had an increased odds of PTB. The ability to detect associations between neighborhood-level measures of SES and gestational age by race/ethnicity and US region was limited due to small sample sizes within select strata. It is likely that the prevalence of factors influencing PTB risk differs for urban versus rural regions, and the magnitude of the effects of individual risk factors also may differ by urban versus rural residence; thus, it is possible that neighborhood-level measures of SES could be conflated with geographic region. Based on 2000–2005 data on live births from the US National Center for Health Statistics, the prevalence of PTB did not vary between urban versus less populated areas; however, the impact of sociodemographic factors on PTB was limited to urban areas [<xref rid="pone.0245064.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. In an investigation of traffic-related air pollution, nitrogen dioxide concentrations were associated with higher PTB rates but only in urban regions [<xref rid="pone.0245064.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Moreover, efforts to reduce PTB may differentially impact rural pregnancies; for example, in Alabama, PTB rates in urban areas have decreased since 2006, but this trend has not been observed in rural areas [<xref rid="pone.0245064.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Thus, future studies of diverse populations such as non-Hispanic black women, Native American and Alaskan Native women, who have the highest rates of PTB [<xref rid="pone.0245064.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>], will be needed to elucidate urban-rural and racial/ethnic differences, and the causes of any observed disparities have the potential to identify opportunities for targeted prevention interventions.</p>
              <p>The lack of association between CT percent poverty and CT percent black and gestational age at birth category may be due to heterogeneity within our study population in regard to the association of these CT level measures with lack of health care, discrimination, or other factors; alternately (or in addition), the lack of association may stem from inadequate power. Despite this study’s relatively large sample size, some categories remained small when we examined the interplay of multiple factors. Neighborhood-level measures of SES have been assessed to investigate disparities in PTB in previous studies with mixed findings. In one study, neighborhood deprivation, as measured by eight census variables, was associated with PTB in four US states between 1995–2001 [<xref rid="pone.0245064.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Likewise, living in CTs with high unemployment, low education, and high poverty was associated with increased odds of PTB among non-Hispanic white and non-Hispanic black women, with larger effect sizes among non-Hispanic white women [<xref rid="pone.0245064.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. A study from California of the black-white disparity in PTB found that SES, measured by both maternal level of education and CT poverty, contributed to disparate rates, especially for births less than 32 weeks’ gestation [<xref rid="pone.0245064.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Additional studies have found associations between PTB and CT-level median household income in Louisiana (1997–1998) [<xref rid="pone.0245064.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and very high gentrification (percent change in education level, poverty level, and median household income) in New York City (2008–2010) [<xref rid="pone.0245064.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In contrast, one study found no increased risk of PTB with CT-level median household income in Massachusetts (1996–2002) [<xref rid="pone.0245064.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and another using a composite variable for neighborhood-level SES derived from seven census variables found no association between low neighborhood SES and PTB among a sample of 6,390 US black women after adjustment for individual-level characteristics [<xref rid="pone.0245064.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. A meta-analysis of 42 studies found that the association between segregation and PTB differed by race, with segregation being associated with an increased odds of PTB primarily among non-Hispanic black women [<xref rid="pone.0245064.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p>
              <p>Further, a growing body of research has assessed area-based measures of SES in conjunction with environmental exposures to investigate PTB from an environmental justice perspective. Such studies have found that exposures to air pollution and water pollution increase the risk for PTB, particularly among neighborhoods of low SES [<xref rid="pone.0245064.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0245064.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Future studies should consider the effects of these potential explanatory factors on gestational age at birth outcomes for women according to race/ethnicity and geography.</p>
              <p>In our analysis, the inclusion of additional covariates related to maternal health conditions and behaviors did not meaningfully affect the associations between maternal level of education or neighborhood-level measures of SES and gestational age at birth. The number of cohorts contributing information on the additional covariates of interest was limited, thereby reducing our statistical power. Our results suggest, however, that both individual- and neighborhood-level measures of SES exert their influence partly through pathways that are not directly related to health status and/or behaviors, which might include pathways mediated by psychosocial factors, social support and stress, environmental exposures, and access to health care, healthy food, and recreation [<xref rid="pone.0245064.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0245064.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0245064.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>].</p>

                <title>Strengths and limitations</title>
                <p>This study addresses an important gap in the literature, namely the limited data on racial/ethnic and geographic variation in individual- and neighborhood-level measures of SES and gestational age at birth. A strength of the ECHO-wide cohort is its heterogeneity in race/ethnicity, geographic variation covering multiple states and rural/urban areas, and SES. Another strength of the ECHO-wide cohort data is the availability of maternal address at the cohort level, which allowed for geocoding and assignment of neighborhood-level measures of SES at the CT level. Publicly-available birth record data does not allow for discernment of geography to the level of CT. Within the published literature, there is not another study that has brought together extant data from multiple pediatric cohorts across multiple states to address whether individual- and neighborhood-level markers of socioeconomic status associate with gestational age at birth across the United States. Existing literature that has considered individual- and neighborhood-level markers of socioeconomic status have mostly focused within a single state or has been carried out at a geographic level larger than CT (such as city or county). An additional strength of the ECHO cohort data is the availability and wealth of data on maternal antecedent health conditions and pregnancy complications that are linked with gestational age at birth outcomes. This rich data available across the ECHO cohorts offer a unique opportunity to expand on the analyses of geographic variation in gestational age outcomes based on natality files. Conversely, this heterogeneity of the ECHO cohorts also presents limitations. There was considerable variability in the nature of measurement of the different variables, and thus there is the potential for misclassification of outcomes (particularly given the variability in the range of methods that could be used to classify gestational age at births across participating cohorts) and exposures. A limitation related to the assignment of CT level variables via ACS is that we used a single 5-year file across all cohorts (the 2005–2009 five-year release) including for birth years before or after that period, which could have resulted in some misclassification given that there could have been temporal changes in the SES indicators in some areas that would not have been captured by using the 2005–2009 year period. For births before 2005–2009, there is not a corresponding five-year ACS file that contains estimates for every CT (2005–2009 is the first available release of this data). While there is a five-year release for data after that period, we chose the ACS 2005–2009 dataset because, during the analysis planning stage, 2008 seemed to be the approximate mid-point of participant enrollment. Furthermore, it was deemed infeasible for us to use multiple five-year data releases as this would have required complex revisions and additions to the DeGAUSS tool, dissemination of analytic code to the cohorts to run locally using time-weighted averages, as well as extensive training of local cohort personnel.</p>
                <p>This analysis was a disseminated meta-analysis, undertaken among extant data available within participating ECHO cohorts in order to facilitate team science without the need to share data outside of a given cohort. Since cohorts with only births in one gestational age outcome category (e.g., preterm-only cohorts) could not participate in this disseminated meta-analysis, this resulted in an under-representation of PTBs in the extant ECHO data and also prohibited the subclassification of PTBs into subcategories, which are known to have different antecedents [<xref rid="pone.0245064.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. In addition, the analytical approach to the analysis including model specifications, selection of covariates to include in the models, and missing data approaches all needed to be specified prior to sending the statistical code to the cohorts. This did not allow for flexibility and changes in the analysis and analytical approaches. Small cohort-specific sample sizes rendered some estimates unstable and therefore could not be used in the meta-analysis and resulted in varying numbers of cohorts contributing to each exposure-outcome combination.</p>
                <p>This study did not examine maternal life course exposure to neighborhood-level SES. Neighborhoods that a mother has lived in throughout her life, encompassing childhood, adolescence, and adulthood, may have significant effects on her health later in life. Living in a poorer neighborhood as a youth may expose a mother to chronic stress that later increases her risk of giving birth to a preterm baby [<xref rid="pone.0245064.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. A study of African American, white, and Latina births in California in 1982–2011 found that living in neighborhood poverty at early life and adult time points was associated with a mother being at higher risk of PTB compared to living in a high-opportunity neighborhood throughout the life course [<xref rid="pone.0245064.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. An additional limitation is that paternal level of education was not a variable that was widely available across the participating cohorts and was not included in this analysis. Paternal level of education has been independently associated with risk for PTB [<xref rid="pone.0245064.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>].</p>
                <p>A final limitation of the present study is its inability to investigate the effect of racism on racial/ethnic disparities in gestational age at birth in the United States. This is an important limitation considering that individual- and neighborhood-level measures do not adequately account for observed disparities. A systematic review of the literature including 15 studies published between 2009 and 2015 observed that racial discrimination is a significant risk factor for delivering preterm [<xref rid="pone.0245064.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. A multi-state analysis using PRAMS data for 2004 through 2012 observed that for non-Hispanic black women, experiences of racism were significantly associated with greater odds of delivering preterm [<xref rid="pone.0245064.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Maternal experiences of racism and discrimination may more directly affect a pregnant woman’s stress levels, and ultimately gestational age at birth. These experiences may include microaggressions over a lifetime and long-term exposure to chronic stress over time. A study of African-American women in Detroit, Michigan, in 2009–2011 found that perceived racial microaggressions in the past year were associated with higher risk of PTB [<xref rid="pone.0245064.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Another study of non-Latino white and black births in California from 2011–2014 found that chronic worry about racial discrimination was associated with increased risk of PTB. After adjusting for chronic worry about racial discrimination, the disparity in PTB among black and white mothers was noticeably attenuated [<xref rid="pone.0245064.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>].</p>

                <title>Next steps and future directions</title>
                <p>These data suggest that interventions that promote higher educational attainment among women of reproductive age could contribute to a reduction in PTB in the United States, particularly in the South and Midwest. Future ECHO studies will involve individual-level data analyses examining gestational age as a continuous variable across all ECHO cohorts. Individual-level analyses will allow preterm cohorts to participate, increasing PTB sample size and our ability to evaluate subcategories of PTB. Further, individual-level data analyses will enable the investigation of the likely complex interrelationships among maternal education, neighborhood-level factors and additional factors across the life course and gestational age at birth outcomes and how these vary according to maternal race/ethnicity and US geography.</p>

              <p>Reviewer #1: This article examines differences in preterm birth risk by maternal individual-level (education) and neighbourhood-level (various census tract indicators), race/ethnicity and geographic region in ECHO Cohorts. Maternal education emerged as a predictor of preterm birth risk, and additional findings were detected by race/ethnicity, geographic region, and neighbourhood-level SES indicators. Overall, this is a very clear and well-written paper that uses a novel participant pool (ECHO cohorts) to address an important question. Specific comments are below.</p>
              <p>Could the authors provide more information on ECHO cohorts and how a specific cohort could be included? Given the epidemiology nature of these analyses, the focus on broad geographic regions, and that more than 20 cohorts are represented, I was surprised that the sample size was relatively small (~ 25,000). For example, I am aware of epidemiology cohorts that are representative of wide geographic regions and that would meet the author’s inclusion criteria and that have at least 1,000,000 or more participants each. Given that sample size was cited as a potential limitation and reason for why some effects were not detected, it would be valuable for the authors to provide more context for the ECHO project, and the novel use of ECHO project data relative to this question specifically.</p>
              <p>The authors focused on maternal education as an indicator of individual-level SES. Could the authors comment on whether they would expect different or similar patterns of findings if other SES indicators were available? For example, one strategy is to get mother and partner SES indicators, and take the highest as the indicator (even if mothers have low education, the status of their more-educated partner could increase their status by proxy), but only mother education level is available here. Other studies focus on income and occupation status as individual-level indicators. Given that the authors discuss how the benefits of education can vary by race/ethnicity, e.g. lower salary despite equivalent education attainment for Black individuals, it would be valuable to comment on this.</p>
              <p>The census-level tract analyses were interesting. Could the authors provide more justification or context for their use of those particular indicators? For example, I thought that percent Black population per census tract was an interesting choice, especially given that non-Black, non-White races/ethnicities were also considered. Is percent Black individuals a particularly valuable indicator of neighbourhood-level SES for other non-White races/ethnicities, or would percent of other races/ethnicities also potentially matter?</p>
              <p>Once criticism that I have seen of using a categorical approach to education is that racial/ethnic distributions within each category might not be equivalent. For example, when grouping bachelors or higher individuals, even within that category White individuals could be higher SES (e.g. more likely to have post-graduate training) compared to Black individuals (more likely to have a bachelor’s degree). Using continuous variables could reduce the risk of this potential confound. Why did the authors chose to use categorical rather than continuous variables? And why were these specific categories chosen?</p>
              <p>The authors used a stratification approach to look at differences in the association between education and gestational length by race/ethnicity, geographic region, etc. Did the authors test any interaction terms or conduct any omnibus tests to determine if, overall, these differences in groups or moderating effects were statistically significant?</p>
              <p>Given that differences did emerge for the Non-Hispanic Other Race category, could the authors provide a detailed racial/ethnic breakdown of this group in the supplemental materials? Although the focus has traditionally been on Black and Hispanic racial/ethnic groups, this information could be helpful for researchers examining health disparities in other racial/ethnic groups.</p>
              <p>There were some interesting findings by geographic region and rurality of residence, but my first thought was how much overlap is there in these constructs? Could neighbourhood SES indicators be conflated by geographic region? It would be helpful if the authors included breakdowns of race/ethnicity and neighbourhood-level SES indicators by geographic region, at least in supplemental materials. Or if the authors included other SES indicators as covariates in regional analyses, that should be clearly stated in conclusions.</p>
              <p>Could the authors provide more comment on the regional differences detected in the discussion? For example, are there regional differences in terms of laws or regulations that affect access to health care or education? Are there differences in societal or governmental wealth between these regions, or urban verses rural? And could these factors be relevant? The authors note that college education is rarer in the Midwest and South – are they suggesting that, as a consequence, individuals who do attain a college education in these regions are comparatively more privileged and affluent than similarly educated people in the West or Northeast?</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: This manuscript examined the association between maternal education (individual-level) and neighborhood level SES (urbanicity, %black, %poverty at census tract level) and gestational age at birth. My main concerns include the use of census tract instead of census block groups to examine neighborhood SES, the lack of use on residential history, and the use of only a single 5-year ACS estimates.</p>
              <p>1. Introduction: There are many existing studies focusing on SES and preterm delivery. More details are needed to explain what added values this study brings to the field and what limitations from previous studies this study can address.</p>
              <p>2. Geocoding: is residential history during pregnancy available? Why only using the earliest address collected during pregnancy?</p>
              <p>3. Neighborhood-level SES variables: census tract is not ideal to assess SES as numerous findings have shown that there can be large heterogenities in SES within a census tract. Please use census block group instead.</p>
              <p>4. Line 225: why only 2005-2009 ACS was used? The selection of specific ACS data should correspond to women's pregnancy period: e.g., you can use the middle year of the 5-year ACS as the index year, and generate time-weighted averages for each woman.</p>
              <p>5. Lines 225-226: it is unclear why only three varaibles were used. Several well-established SES indices such as the Neighborhood Deprivation Index or Area Deprivation Index can be used to characterize SES, which are usually derived based on dozens of variables.</p>
              <p>6. Covariates: why income was not included? In addition, is there any information on gestation week when prenatal care started? The binary prenatal care status won't tell much as the majority of women received prenatal care. The covairates selection should be guided by DAG.</p>
              <p>7. Statistical modeling: it is unclear why the authors run seperate analsyes on each indivdiual cohort and then pool the results together using a meta-analysis. This is usually done when people don't have direct access to the raw data from each site. The authors may confirm whether this is the case. Otherwise, the authors should use a mixed effects model including data from all sites with random intercepts by cohort and by census block group.</p>
              <p>8. In addition to the multinomial logistic regression, the authors may also treat the gestational age as a continuous outcome and model it use linear regression.</p>
              <p>9. Limitation: Another limitation is the potential selection bias. It is not clear how representative the study samples are. There is no site in TX and FL, the states with the second and third most population in the US.</p>

              <p>Reviewer #1 Comments to the Author</p>
              <p>1. Could the authors provide more information on ECHO cohorts and how a specific cohort could be included? Given the epidemiology nature of these analyses, the focus on broad geographic regions, and that more than 20 cohorts are represented, I was surprised that the sample size was relatively small (~ 25,000). For example, I am aware of epidemiology cohorts that are representative of wide geographic regions and that would meet the author’s inclusion criteria and that have at least 1,000,000 or more participants each. Given that sample size was cited as a potential limitation and reason for why some effects were not detected, it would be valuable for the authors to provide more context for the ECHO project, and the novel use of ECHO project data relative to this question specifically.</p>
              <p>Response: In the Objective section of the Revised Manuscript (page 7), we have added more information to describe the ECHO consortium of cohorts and how they were selected (and reference an article that goes into more detail on this topic). We also added language to the Objective section (pages 7 &amp; 8) to introduce that ECHO uses both extant data (in collective analyses, such as this) and a common protocol to collect new data. </p>
              <p>2. The authors focused on maternal education as an indicator of individual-level SES. Could the authors comment on whether they would expect different or similar patterns of findings if other SES indicators were available? For example, one strategy is to get mother and partner SES indicators, and take the highest as the indicator (even if mothers have low education, the status of their more-educated partner could increase their status by proxy), but only mother education level is available here. Other studies focus on income and occupation status as individual-level indicators. Given that the authors discuss how the benefits of education can vary by race/ethnicity, e.g. lower salary despite equivalent education attainment for Black individuals, it would be valuable to comment on this.</p>
              <p>Response: In the Introduction section of the Revised Manuscript (page 6) we provided a statement indicating that the literature supports that across “various measures of individual-level SES (including maternal level of education and income, marital and employment status, and type of health insurance) there is a consistent social gradient in the risk of preterm birth.”</p>
              <p>Author Response to Editor’s Requests</p>
              <p>1. Please amend your current ethics statement to include the full name of the ethics committee/institutional review board(s) that approved your specific study.</p>
              <p>Response: We can amend our current ethics statement (SmartForm) to include the information below, which provides the name of each Institutional Review Board for the cohorts involved in this research. </p>
              <p>In the Methods section of the Revised Manuscript (page 10), we also added the following language: “We used the categorical variable of maternal level of education as the main individual-level measure of SES based on existing research among US populations that support that education is the dimension of SES that most strongly and consistently predicts health, especially for women and children (references 35, 36). Also, maternal level of education as a categorical variable was more available across the ECHO cohort extant data. Paternal level of education was less often collected by the cohorts or, when collected, was oftentimes missing. Similarly, household income was less available across cohorts in that either entire cohorts did not collect this data or the variable response was missing within cohorts. Also, in order to be meaningfully interpreted income in relation to the federal poverty line, household income must be combined with household density, which was also not uniformly available across cohorts and/or was missing within cohort extant data. Furthermore, even when using the federal poverty thresholds, the meaning of the various income groupings varies a great deal across states and according to rural/urban status.” </p>
              <p>3. One criticism that I have seen of using a categorical approach to education is that racial/ethnic distributions within each category might not be equivalent. For example, when grouping bachelors or higher individuals, even within that category White individuals could be higher SES (e.g. more likely to have post-graduate training) compared to Black individuals (more likely to have a bachelor’s degree). Using continuous variables could reduce the risk of this potential confound. Why did the authors chose to use categorical rather than continuous variables? And why were these specific categories chosen?</p>
              <p>Response: See our Response to Reviewer #1, Comment #2, in which we address this issue (and page 10 of the Revised Manuscript). To summarize, the extant data on level of education available from the participating cohorts was collected data as a categorical variable, thus, categorical data is what was available across cohorts. The categorization of maternal education data reflected how cohorts collected and categorized the data, and is based on accepted categories of attainment (including those references in the manuscript that pertain to research within US populations).</p>
              <p>4. The census-level tract analyses were interesting. Could the authors provide more justification or context for their use of those particular indicators? For example, I thought that percent Black population per census tract was an interesting choice, especially given that non-Black, non-White races/ethnicities were also considered. Is percent Black individuals a particularly valuable indicator of neighbourhood-level SES for other non-White races/ethnicities, or would percent of other races/ethnicities also potentially matter?</p>
              <p>Response: In the Methods section of the Revised Manuscript (page 11), we have inserted parenthetical phrases indicating that we included the percentage black population in the census tract as a measure of segregation and the percentage population living below the poverty line as a measure of poverty. Also, in the Methods section of the Revised Manuscript (page 12) we have explained and referenced our rationale for selecting the single indicator measure of neighborhood-level SES rather than more complex indices. Specifically, we modeled our selection of census tract variables on the paper by Carmichael et al. (2017), who investigated the association between percent of the tract population with household income below the poverty level (as measure of neighborhood-level deprivation) and percent of the tract population that was black (as a measure of segregation) and preterm birth; in their analysis, the Carmichael paper also created an index that incorporated eight census tract variables representing multiple aspects of socioeconomic level following methods of Messer et al. (2006). The Carmichael paper found that the single measure of tract poverty correlated well with the multi-measure index (r = 0.86) and resulted in the same conclusions. Therefore, we chose to focus on the single indicator measures, rather than on the more complex indices, as in Carmichael et al. (2017), Krieger et al. (2003 and 2005), and Rehkopf et al. (2006). </p>
              <p>5. The authors used a stratification approach to look at differences in the association between education and gestational length by race/ethnicity, geographic region, etc. Did the authors test any interaction terms or conduct any omnibus tests to determine if, overall, these differences in groups or moderating effects were statistically significant?</p>
              <p>Response: We did not test the significance of interaction terms nor conduct omnibus tests to determine if, overall, the observed differences were statistically significant. An interaction between maternal education, gestational age and region was not possible as most participating cohorts contributed to one geographic region only. No individual-level data was available to the ECHO Data Analysis Center (DAC) so all analyses needed to be conducted successfully at each specific cohort, and then meta-analyzed at the DAC. In the Revised Manuscript, in the Objectives and Methods sections, we have emphasized that this analysis reflects a disseminated meta-analysis of extant data from the ECHO cohorts performed before individual-level data could be shared across cohorts. </p>
              <p>6. Given that differences did emerge for the Non-Hispanic Other Race category, could the authors provide a detailed racial/ethnic breakdown of this group in the supplemental materials? Although the focus has traditionally been on Black and Hispanic racial/ethnic groups, this information could be helpful for researchers examining health disparities in other racial/ethnic groups.</p>
              <p>Response: In the Revised Manuscript we reference and include a Supplemental Table (S2; page 21), which is a detailed racial distribution by gestational age category, to include the following race categories: White, Black, Asian, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, American Indian or Alaska Native, Multiple race, other race. We did not calculate race/ethnicity-specific effect estimates for these additional categories as our cohort-specific sample sizes were too small resulting in unstable estimates. We have also included information providing the ethnicity distribution by gestational age category. </p>
              <p>7. There were some interesting findings by geographic region and rurality of residence, but my first thought was how much overlap is there in these constructs? Could neighbourhood SES indicators be conflated by geographic region? It would be helpful if the authors included breakdowns of race/ethnicity and neighbourhood-level SES indicators by geographic region, at least in supplemental materials. Or if the authors included other SES indicators as covariates in regional analyses, that should be clearly stated in conclusions.</p>
              <p>Response: In the Results section of the Revised Manuscript (page 25), we have included reference to a Supplemental Table (S4), which displays the distribution of race/ethnicity and neighborhood-level SES by geographic region. We did not include other SES indicators as covariates in regional analyses. To the Discussion section of the Revised Manuscript (page 26), we also noted that it is possible that neighborhood SES is conflated by geographic region. In the Discussion section, we also note that future ECHO analyses utilizing individual-level participant data will allow these complex relationships to be explored.</p>
              <p>8. Could the authors provide more comment on the regional differences detected in the discussion? For example, are there regional differences in terms of laws or regulations that affect access to health care or education? Are there differences in societal or governmental wealth between these regions, or urban verses rural? And could these factors be relevant? The authors note that college education is rarer in the Midwest and South – are they suggesting that, as a consequence, individuals who do attain a college education in these regions are comparatively more privileged and affluent than similarly educated people in the West or Northeast?</p>
              <p>Response: To the Discussion section of the Revised Manuscript (page 26), we have added a brief discussion and citations to full reports that discuss how the variation in state-level policies that relate to maternal and child health and health outcomes.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2 Comments to the Author</p>
              <p>1. Introduction: There are many existing studies focusing on SES and preterm delivery. More details are needed to explain what added values this study brings to the field and what limitations from previous studies this study can address.</p>
              <p>Response: In the Objective section of the Revised Manuscript (pages 7 &amp; 8), we have added narrative to further emphasize the importance of combining extant data across ECHO cohorts to examine associations by varying US region as well as the innovativeness of using the collective analyses (disseminated meta-analysis) process to combine extant data across cohorts when individual-level data cannot be shared. The Discussion section (Strengths and Limitations part) includes a discussion of the strengths and contributions of this literature to the existing literature, which may be better interpreted now that the Revised Manuscript better describes the ECHO cohorts and the use of extant data. </p>
              <p>2. Geocoding: is residential history during pregnancy available? Why only using the earliest address collected during pregnancy?</p>
              <p>Response: Most of the cohorts participating in this disseminated meta-analysis of extant data did not collect residential history during pregnancy, but only collected the earliest address during pregnancy. We chose to use the earliest address during pregnancy because it was more available across participating cohorts. </p>
              <p>3. Neighborhood-level SES variables: census tract is not ideal to assess SES as numerous findings have shown that there can be large heterogenities in SES within a census tract. Please use census block group instead.</p>
              <p>Response: In the Methods section of the Revised Manuscript (page 12), we provide an explanation and citations for our use of census tract level measures of SES. Briefly, we chose to base our neighborhood-level SES measures on census tract based on the existing literature that shows that among non-Hispanic Black, non-Hispanic White, and Hispanic men and women, measures of economic deprivation were most sensitive to expected socioeconomic gradients in health, with the most consistent results and maximal geocoding linkage evident for tract-level analyses. Furthermore, census tract–level analyses yielded the most consistent results with maximal geocoding linkage (i.e., the highest proportion of records both geocoded and linked to census-defined areas) (Krieger et al., 2003; Krieger et al., 2005). </p>
              <p>Furthermore, we chose to use DeGAUSS system for geocoding for the following reasons: it is a freely available distributed geocoding system that used the same nationwide underlying street address database (the Census Bureau’s Topologically Integrated Graphical Encoding and Referencing “TIGER” data); a single geocoding engine (embedded in DeGAUSS) resulting in all cohorts using the same underlying address matching code; and a single, uniform underlying street database (TIGER). A centralized DAC geocoding process was not possible since the DAC did not have access to individual-level data. Purchasing, installing, and executing a commercially-available geocoder at all cohort locations was not possible. </p>
              <p>4. Line 225: why only 2005-2009 ACS was used? The selection of specific ACS data should correspond to women's pregnancy period: e.g., you can use the middle year of the 5-year ACS as the index year, and generate time-weighted averages for each woman.</p>
              <p>Response: To the Methods section of the Revised Manuscript (page 12) we also added narrative to describe why we chose to use the five-year ACS data for the period 2005-2009. </p>
              <p>5. Lines 225-226: it is unclear why only three variables were used. Several well-established SES indices such as the Neighborhood Deprivation Index or Area Deprivation Index can be used to characterize SES, which are usually derived based on dozens of variables.</p>
              <p>Response: See our response to Reviewer #1, Comment #4. </p>
              <p>6. Covariates: why income was not included? In addition, is there any information on gestation week when prenatal care started? The binary prenatal care status won't tell much as the majority of women received prenatal care. </p>
              <p>Response: See our response to Reviewer #1, Comment #2. Also, across the extant data available within the cohorts, the gestational week at which prenatal care was initiated was not widely available and/or was not collected in a similar manner (by self-report vs. by medical record abstraction). </p>
              <p>7. Statistical modeling: it is unclear why the authors run separate analyses on each individual cohort and then pool the results together using a meta-analysis. This is usually done when people don't have direct access to the raw data from each site. The authors may confirm whether this is the case. Otherwise, the authors should use a mixed effects model including data from all sites with random intercepts by cohort and by census block group.</p>
              <p>Response: In the Objective section of the Revised Manuscript (pages 7 and 8), we have added more information to describe the ECHO consortium’s plan to utilize collective analyses (disseminated meta-analysis) to combine data across cohorts for hypothesis-testing when identifiable participant-level data could not be shared. The authors did not have access to individual-level data, therefore each cohort performed cohort-specific analyses based on specifications provided to them by the DAC, and the DAC pooled the results together using a meta-analysis.</p>
              <p>8. In addition to the multinomial logistic regression, the authors may also treat the gestational age as a continuous outcome and model it use linear regression.</p>
              <p>Response: In the Discussion section of the Revised Manuscript, we did add a statement specifying that in the future ECHO studies will involve individual-level data analyses examining gestational age as a continuous variable (page 30). Because this study represents a disseminated meta-analysis in which no participant-level data was held by the Data Analysis Center (DAC), the DAC only received the point estimates and variance/co-variance matrix from each cohort’s own local analysis. The a priori analysis specified the use of categorical gestational age to estimate the associations. </p>
              <p>9. Limitation: Another limitation is the potential selection bias. It is not clear how representative the study samples are. There is no site in TX and FL, the states with the second and third most population in the US.</p>

              <p>Reviewer #1: This article examines differences in preterm birth risk by maternal individual-level (education) and neighbourhood-level (various census tract indicators), race/ethnicity and geographic region in ECHO Cohorts. Maternal education emerged as a predictor of preterm birth risk, and additional findings were detected by race/ethnicity, geographic region, and neighbourhood-level SES indicators. Overall, this is a very clear and well-written paper that uses a novel participant pool (ECHO cohorts) to address an important question. All my comments have been addressed.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: The authors did not address my concerns very well. The current analyses did not fully leverage the potential of the ECHO study. The same analyses can be easily done using birth certificate data with larger sample sizes and minimal selection bias. Again, it is unclear what the added value this study brings to the field. The idea of collective analysis is not new. It has been widely used in other settings: e.g., pooled time-series analyses on air pollution studies. Below are my detailed comments.</p>
              <p>1) Regarding the neighborhood SES variables: the authors stated that "census tract–level analyses yielded the most consistent results with maximal geocoding linkage (i.e., the highest proportion of records both geocoded and linked to censusdefined areas)". This is confusing. If the geocoding was performed using residential address, I don't understand why you can find the corresponding census tract but not the census block group.</p>
              <p>2) The authors did not address my question why only the 2005-2009 ACS was used. ACS starts to provide 5-year estimate data since 2005-2009, and the latest data available is 2014-2018. There can be large temporal changes in the SES indicators in certain areas across the years, which cannot be addressed if only one 5-year estimate data is used.</p>
              <p>3) The authors did not answer my question why only 3 variables were selected, and why other well-established SES indices were not used.</p>

              <p>1. Reviewer 2: The current analyses did not fully leverage the potential of the ECHO study. The same analyses can be easily done using birth certificate data with larger sample sizes and minimal selection bias. It is unclear what the added value this study brings to the field. The idea of collective analysis is not new. It has been widely used in other settings: e.g., pooled time-series analyses on air pollution studies. </p>
              <p>Author Response: We respectfully disagree with this Reviewer comment for the following reasons: </p>
              <p>(1) The same analysis cannot easily be done with birth certificate data because in using publicly-available birth certificate data (available for all states via the National Center for Health Statistics) it is not possible to obtain a unit of geography smaller than county or zip code of maternal residence (and these are only for units with population &gt; 100,000). Specifically, maternal census tract of residence (the geographic level of interest for this manuscript) is not publicly-available through National Center for Health Statistics, prohibiting the conduct of census-tract level analyses on a multi-stage large-scale basis with publicly available data, which we were able to accomplish with the ECHO data. While for a given state it would be possible to make a request to the state’s department of public health to obtain and enter into a data use agreement to use census tract-level geocodes for that state, this would be very time-consuming to accomplish across multiple states and, furthermore, many states simply do not share geocodes at the census tract-level. Thus, we believe that this analysis using census tract-level data available within the ECHO cohort makes a substantial contribution to the literature. </p>
              <p>(2) Within the published literature, there is not another disseminated meta-analysis that has brought together extant data from existing pediatric cohorts to address the research question of how individual- and neighborhood-level markers of socioeconomic status associate with gestational age at birth across the United States. Existing literature that has considered individual- and neighborhood-level markers of socioeconomic status have mostly focused in a single state or smaller geography of the United States, rather than including multiple regions across the United States, as this multi-cohort research does. </p>
              <p>In summary, we believe that this work does represent a unique manner of collaboration in which the existing pediatric cohorts came together through ECHO to perform a disseminated meta-analysis upon their extant data under the guidance of a central Data Analysis Center. Thus, both the findings of this research, around the role of individual- and neighborhood-level markers of socioeconomic status on gestational age at birth, as well as the methods of the use of data from multiple cohorts that do not yet have permission to share data, are of interest to readership. </p>
              <p>However, to address this important concern of the Reviewer, we have added a statement to the Discussion section of the R2 Manuscript (pages 28-29): “Another strength of the ECHO-wide cohort data is the availability of maternal address at the cohort level, which allowed for geocoding and assignment of neighborhood-level measures of SES at the CT level. Publicly-available birth record data does not allow for discernment of geography to the level of CT. Within the published literature, there is not another study that has brought together extant data from multiple pediatric cohorts or across multiple states to address whether individual- and neighborhood-level markers of socioeconomic status associate with gestational age at birth across the United States. Existing literature that has considered individual- and neighborhood-level markers of socioeconomic status have mostly focused within a single state or has been carried out at a geographic level larger than CT (such as city or county).”</p>
              <p>2. Reviewer 2: Regarding the neighborhood SES variables: the authors stated that "census tract–level analyses yielded the most consistent results with maximal geocoding linkage (i.e., the highest proportion of records both geocoded and linked to census defined areas)". If the geocoding was performed using residential address, I don't understand why you can find the corresponding census tract but not the census block group.</p>
              <p>Author Response: In our previous Response to Review and R1 manuscript, we included this statement: “We chose to consider SES measures at the level of census tract based on literature showing that among non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic white and Hispanic men and women, measures of economic deprivation were most sensitive to socioeconomic gradients in health with the most consistent results and maximal geocoding evidence for census tract-level analyses (Krieger et al., 2003; Krieger et al., 2005).” This statement, about the maximal geocoding linkage, was referring to the experience of the authors of those manuscripts (not to our experience in the ECHO data). Also, this referenced statement was intended to provide rationale for why we chose to focus our analysis at the level of census tract (i.e., that literature supports that measures of economic deprivation at that level were most consistently associated with gradients in health outcomes).</p>
              <p>To clarify any confusion and address this Reviewer concern further, we have edited this statement in the Methods section of the R2 Manuscript (pages 12-13) to more clearly convey those ideas: “We chose to consider SES measures at the level of CT based on literature showing that CT-level analyses resulted in maximal geocoding linkage (i.e., the highest proportion of records geocoded and linked to census-defined geography) and that measures of economic deprivation at the CT-level were most sensitive to expected socioeconomic gradients in health among non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic white and Hispanic men and women (Krieger et al., 2003; Krieger et al., 2005).</p>
              <p>3. The authors did not answer my question why only 3 variables were selected, and why other well-established SES indices were not used.</p>
              <p>Author Response: In our previous Response to Review, we had replied to this question with the following narrative addition to the R1 Manuscript (page 12),: “We selected the three CT level markers of SES based on past research that has investigated the relationship between census tract markers of SES and preterm birth, which found that the single-measure variable of percentage of persons below poverty performed as well as more complex, composite measures of economic deprivation [23] in conjunction with our a priori interest in exploring census tract markers of rural/urban status and segregation in conjunction with poverty.” </p>
              <p>In the R2 Manuscript (page 12) we have added further detail to that previous response (the underlined stanza) to more thoroughly clarify our rationale for not using an established index: “We selected the three CT level markers of SES based on past research that investigated the relationship between census tract markers of SES and preterm birth, which found that the single-measure variable of percentage of persons below the poverty level performed as well as more complex, composite measures of economic deprivation [23] in conjunction with our a priori interest in exploring CT markers of rural/urban status and segregation in conjunction with poverty. Specifically, Carmichael et al. [23] found that the single-measure of percent of the CT population below the poverty level correlated well with an eight-measure index of CT variables (r=0.86) and resulted in the same conclusions.”</p>
              <p>4. The authors did not address my question why only the 2005-2009 ACS was used. ACS starts to provide 5-year estimate data since 2005-2009, and the latest data available is 2014-2018. There can be large temporal changes in the SES indicators in certain areas across the years, which cannot be addressed if only one 5-year estimate data is used.</p>
              <p>Author Response: In our previous Response to Review we did reply to this question by including a narrative response in the R1 manuscript (page 13): “We used five-year data releases from ACS as only the five-year releases are guaranteed to have estimates for every CT in the United States. In this disseminated meta-analysis, addresses were geocoded at the cohort level using DeGAUSS since participant address could not be shared with the DAC; disseminating analytical code to the cohorts to run locally using time-weighted averages for each woman was not possible across all of the participating cohorts.” </p>
              <p>We acknowledge, however, that this response did not completely capture the concern of the Reviewer. As such, in the R2 Manuscript, we have done the following:</p>
              <p>a. To the Methods Section of the R2 Manuscript (pages 10-11), we have added further detail to our rationale for using the DeGAUSS tool for the disseminated geocoding across multiple cohorts and specifically detailed why we choose the 2005-2005 ACS 5-year release (pages 10-11), which now reads as follows: “DeGAUSS, a freely available distributed geocoding system, facilitates reproducible geocoding and geomarker assessment in multi-site studies while maintaining the confidentiality of protected health information by enabling the sites access to a single embedded geocoding engine that uses the same nationwide street address data base (the Census Bureau’s Topologically Integrated Graphical Encoding and Referencing, TIGER, data) and matching code without having to share address data. The DeGAUSS geocoder used current (at the time of the study) TIGER street centerline address range files to convert residential addresses into geographical coordinates and provided assessment of qualitative precision for the geocodes [(37)]. Using the latest TIGER street centerline address range files was appropriate because of improvements to street and address ranges made by census bureau over time. After geocoding, the resulting latitude/longitude coordinates were joined to the TIGER 2000 Census Tract boundaries. Since census tracts are revised only every ten years, the TIGER 2000 Census Tract boundaries were needed in order to correctly match the census tract for geocoded addresses to the 2005-2009 American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year estimates, which used the same census tract identifiers as the 2000 TIGER census tract layer. We chose the ACS 2005-2009 dataset because for births prior to 2005-2009 there is not a corresponding five-year ACS file that contains estimates for every CT (2005-2009 is the first available release of this data) and, during the analysis planning stage, 2008 seemed to be the approximate mid-point of participant enrollment.”</p>
              <p>b. To the Discussion/Limitations Section of the R2 Manuscript (page 29) we have added text acknowledging that a limitation of our approach is the use of a single 5-year estimate across all births for a given cohort: “A limitation related to the assignment of CT level variables via ACS is that we used a single 5-year file across all cohorts (the 2005-2009 five-year release) including for birth years before or after that period, which could have resulted in some misclassification given that there could have been temporal changes in the SES indicators in some areas that would not have been captured by using the 2005-2009 year period. For births before 2005-2009, there is not a corresponding five-year ACS file that contains estimates for every CT (2005-2009 is the first available release of this data). While there is a five-year release for data after that period, we chose the ACS 2005-2009 dataset because, during the analysis planning stage, 2008 seemed to be the approximate mid-point of participant enrollment. Furthermore, it was deemed infeasible for us to use multiple five-year data releases as this would have required complex revisions and additions to the DeGAUSS tool, dissemination of analytic code to the cohorts to run locally using time-weighted averages, as well as extensive training of local cohort personnel.”</p>
              <p>We believe that the strengths of the study far outweigh this limitation and the work represents a meaningful contribution to the literature in that within the published literature, there is not another disseminated meta-analysis that has brought together extant data from existing pediatric cohorts to address the research question of how individual- and neighborhood-level markers of socioeconomic status associate with gestational age at birth across the United States. Existing literature that has considered individual- and neighborhood-level markers of socioeconomic status have mostly focused in a single state or smaller geography of the United States, rather than including multiple regions across the United States, as this research does. </p>
