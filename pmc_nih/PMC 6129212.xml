                <p id="P1">Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) extends longevity in experimental organisms, raising interest in its impact on human health. De novo NAD+ biosynthesis from tryptophan is evolutionarily conserved yet considered supplanted among higher species by biosynthesis from nicotinamide (Nam). Here we show that a bottleneck enzyme in de novo biosynthesis, quinolinate phosphoribosyltransferase (QPRT), defends renal NAD+ and mediates resistance to acute kidney injury (AKI). Following murine AKI, renal NAD+ fell, quinolinate rose, and QPRT declined. QPRT<sup>+/−</sup> mice exhibited higher quinolinate, lower NAD+, and higher AKI susceptibility. Metabolomics proposed elevated urinary quinolinate/tryptophan (uQ:T) as an indicator of reduced QPRT. Elevated uQ:T predicted AKI and other adverse outcomes in critically ill patients. A Phase 1 placebo-controlled study of oral Nam demonstrated dose-related increase in circulating NAD+ metabolites. Nam was well-tolerated and was associated with less AKI. Impaired NAD+ biosynthesis may therefore be a feature of high-risk hospitalizations for which NAD+ augmentation could be beneficial.</p>

It is also a substrate for non-redox enzymes that consume NAD+ such as polyADP ribose polymerases (PARPs), sirtuins, and ectonucleotidases.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Chronic deficiency of Nam or nicotinic acid, vitamin B<sub>3</sub> analogs that are NAD+ precursors, affects several metabolically active organs. Deficiency of a third NAD+ precursor, tryptophan, can develop from inherited defects in a neutral amino acid transporter and also impairs metabolically active organs. Although the biosynthesis of NAD+ proceeds through distinct routes depending upon the dietary precursor, evidence from patients with dietary Nam deficiency or tryptophan transporter defects demonstrates that supplementation with one precursor can effectively treat deficiency of the other.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> More recently, NAD+ metabolism (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1a</xref>) has been suggested as a therapeutic target for diverse diseases ranging from diet-induced obesity to neuronal degeneration and glaucoma, conditions that share substantial metabolic stress.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>–<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> NAD+ preservation may also prevent age-related declines in health and even extend lifespan.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Critically ill patients are often subjected to severe metabolic stress—arising from systemic inflammation and ischemia—and are susceptible to an array of age-associated complications. One such complication, acute kidney injury (AKI), affects 3–10% of all hospitalized adults, can be deadly, and lacks a specific treatment.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup></p>

                <title>Renal and urinary quinolinate elevation in ischemic AKI</title>
                <p id="P3">To study AKI, we conducted an unbiased metabolomics screen on the urine of mice with AKI induced by transient renal ischemia (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1b</xref>). Of 204 metabolites measured (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Table 1</xref>), 27 were more than two-fold increased in post-ischemic urines compared to controls including several sugars and amino acids, a pattern consistent with tubular impairment (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Table 2</xref>). Among these metabolites was quinolinate, an intermediate in the de novo NAD+ biosynthetic pathway from tryptophan (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1c</xref>). After normalizing for tryptophan, urinary quinolinate elevation persisted (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1d</xref>). To assess whether excess urinary quinolinate reflected intrarenal processes rather than filtration into urine from extrarenal sources, we then measured kidney tissue levels. Both renal quinolinate and the ratio of renal quinolinate to renal tryptophan were strongly related to renal function and post-ischemic injury (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1e–h</xref>). This suggested a reduction in AKI of renal QPRT, an enzyme that connects the initial steps of tryptophan’s pyrrole ring opening to the final steps of NAD+ biosynthesis (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1a</xref>). Whereas quinolinate can only be transformed to penultimate NAD+ precursors, tryptophan and other upstream metabolites have multiple metabolic fates, thus making quinolinate the first fully committed NAD+ precursor in de novo biosynthesis (genome.jp/kegg). Renal NAD+ and renal NADP+ were also significantly reduced by AKI (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1i,j</xref>).</p>

                <title>QPRT mediates resistance to AKI</title>
                <p id="P4">Data from public repositories demonstrated selective enrichment of human and mouse QPRT in the kidney and liver among the body’s major organs (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Fig 1a,b</xref>). Within the kidney, QPRT protein was abundant in the epithelium of the proximal tubule, its most metabolically active cellular compartment (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Fig 1c</xref>). Renal QPRT expression was attenuated by transient renal ischemia (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2a</xref>), attenuated in mice hypersensitive to renal ischemia, and induced in mice resistant to renal ischemia (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Fig 1d</xref>).<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup></p>
                <p id="P5">Involvement of QPRT in AKI has not been previously described. We therefore created QPRT+/− mice by CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing and studied several founder lines (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Fig 2</xref>). Loss of one allele recapitulated the extent of QPRT reduction associated with AKI (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2b</xref>). Urinary quinolinate and urinary quinolinate/tryptophan ratio (uQ:T) were elevated in QPRT+/− mice even in the absence of renal injury. This corroborated the specificity of the AKI metabolite profile for reduced QPRT that was originally suggested by the biochemistry, namely that quinolinate is only known to be made and utilized in this single pathway of de novo NAD+ biosynthesis (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1c–e</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Table 3</xref>). QPRT reduction lowered NAD+ in the kidney among several metabolically active organs (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2f</xref>). This result suggested that the kidney utilizes de novo NAD+ biosynthesis for maintenance of normal NAD+ content. Based upon the renal NAD+ deficiency, we hypothesized that QPRT+/− mice would be more vulnerable to acute ischemic stress. Renal function and injury to tubular cells (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2g,h</xref>) 24 hours after transient renal ischemia was indeed worse in QPRT+/− mice. We then tested the role of QPRT-independent augmentation of NAD+ metabolism via salvage biosynthesis by administering Nam in this model.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Nam overcame the sensitivity of QPRT+/− mice to transient renal ischemia (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2g</xref>). Together, these data showed that impairment of the de novo NAD+ biosynthetic pathway at QPRT not only characterizes AKI, but that this single enzymatic change lowers NAD+ in the kidney and increases susceptibility to local ischemic stress in an NAD+-dependent fashion.</p>

                <title>uQ:T elevation in human AKI</title>
                <p id="P6">In both mice and humans, quinolinate is only generated by spontaneous non-enzymatic cyclization of its immediate precursor in de novo NAD+ biosynthesis, 2-amino-β-carboxymuconate-ε-semialdehyde (2-ACMS), and quinolinate is only utilized as a substrate by QPRT (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3a</xref>). The metabolic pathways therefore suggest that elevated quinolinate should be a highly specific indicator for the effect of reduced QPRT on flux through this pathway, and the results of <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figs 1</xref>,<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> support this biochemical prediction. In a prospectively enrolled cohort of patients exposed to renal ischemia by on-pump cardiac surgery (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Table 4</xref>), we therefore performed a nested case-control study to assess relationships between metabolites of the de novo pathway and AKI (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Table 5</xref> and <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Fig 3</xref>). Measurement of sequential metabolites of the de novo pathway in the urine revealed a transition to higher urinary quinolinate levels among those individuals who subsequently developed AKI compared to those free of post-operative AKI (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3b–e</xref> and <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Fig 4</xref>). Similarly, elevated uQ:T developed shortly after the operation and persisted through post-operative day 5 (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3f</xref>). These results suggested that the ischemic human kidney shares de novo NAD+ biosynthetic impairment with its murine counterpart and that this can be non-invasively monitored by uQ:T.</p>
                <p id="P7">In low-income countries, AKI may affect 40–50% of <bold><italic>all</italic></bold> hospitalized individuals; even in high-income countries, AKI affects 30% of intensive care unit (ICU) patients.<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Compared to the more homogeneous stressor of cardiac surgery, AKI in the ICU often arises from ischemia compounded by toxic drugs and severe infections. Thus, to assess the generalizability of our findings from the cardiac surgery cohort, we next studied uQ:T in a heterogeneous ICU population (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Table 6</xref>).<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Among 215 subjects from a prospectively collected cohort of 329 ICU subjects (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Fig 5</xref>) who had urine samples available by a median of 2.5 days prior to the development of AKI, urinary quinolinate and uQ:T were higher than those who did not develop AKI (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3g,h</xref>). Further, serial quartiles of uQ:T were associated in a monotonic fashion with increased risk of incident AKI in univariate analyses and in multivariable models adjusted for major confounders including baseline renal function (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3i</xref>). The most stringent of these models (Model 3) adjusted for age, gender, race, baseline kidney function, hypertension, diabetes, and severity of illness as measured by type of ICU, need for mechanical ventilation, and a severity of illness score termed APACHE (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation). Even in this model, higher uQ:T levels were was associated with significantly increased probability of a spectrum of adverse outcomes, including hospital mortality (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3j</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Table 7</xref>). These results suggested that humans at risk for AKI develop a block at QPRT just as mice do, and that a non-invasive metabolic signature of reduced QPRT may help identify this biological disturbance in clinically relevant settings.</p>

                <title>QPRT-independent NAD+ precursor treatment</title>
                <p id="P8">If transient NAD+ biosynthetic deficiency is a risk factor for AKI, then NAD+ augmentation could be beneficial. Among several NAD+ precursors, we chose to test Nam because (A) Nam’s ability to increase NAD+ is independent of QPRT (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1a</xref>); (B) systemic Nam increases renal NAD+;<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> (C) Nam administration overcame the sensitivity of QPRT+/− mice to renal ischemia (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2h</xref>); and (D) Nam is reported to be well-tolerated at high doses administered chronically.<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>–<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> We first tested a three-day regimen of 3 gm/day of oral Nam among healthy volunteers in order to confirm that the pharmaceutical supply of Nam led to measurable changes in circulating Nam (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Table 8</xref>). We were able to detect elevation of circulating Nam, consistent with a previous report of oral Nam obtained from different manufacturers (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Fig 6a</xref>).<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Serum creatinine did not change among recipients, ruling out potential interference of high circulating Nam levels with the creatinine determination methodology (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Fig 6b</xref>).</p>
                <p id="P9">We then designed a Phase I pilot study of oral Nam administration among adults undergoing cardiac surgery (Clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT02701127, <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4a,b</xref>). The primary endpoint compared blood Nam levels between blinded participants randomized to receive placebo, 1 gm/day Nam, or 3 gm/day Nam once daily by mouth or orogastric tube on days −1, 0, and +1 relative to surgery. The treatment groups were well-balanced across 37 baseline demographic, clinical, and laboratory features (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Tables 9,10</xref>). Nam administration significantly increased blood and urine Nam (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4c,d</xref>). Nam can either contribute to de novo NAD+ biosynthesis through the intermediate Nam mononucleotide (NMN) or undergo methylation to N1-methyl-Nam (MNA) followed by irreversible oxidation to waste products. Nam administration at the 3 gm/day regimen increased NMN whereas either Nam regimen increased MNA relative to placebo (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4e</xref>,<bold>f</bold>). Nam administration was not associated with increased adverse events compared to placebo. Serious adverse events were uncommon, were distributed evenly across the study arms, and were independently adjudicated to be unrelated to study participation (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p>
                <p id="P10">Given (A) that either Nam treatment arm yielded significant higher exposure to Nam than the placebo arm, (B) the comparable safety of either Nam dose to placebo, and (C) the comparable effect on serum creatinine of either Nam dose, we also combined the two Nam arms into one treatment group. One of the safety assessments evaluated whether Nam increased perioperative cardiac injury. Nam treatment was associated with <bold><italic>lower</italic></bold> blood levels of the cardiac injury marker troponin T as compared to placebo (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4g,h</xref>). In a second safety assessment, we examined renal function since cardiac surgery increases AKI risk. Nam was associated with better estimated renal function compared to placebo (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4i,j</xref>). AKI events were significantly lower with Nam treatment than placebo (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Table 11</xref> and <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Fig 7</xref>). Taken together, short-term Nam administration increased Nam levels and appeared to be well-tolerated among cardiac surgery patients. Safety assessments linked Nam administration to lower AKI risk.</p>

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p id="P11">The present studies investigated the metabolic changes associated with AKI by applying a localized injury model in mice and unbiased metabolomic screening. A highly specific indicator of reduced QPRT emerged. Mimicking this acquired defect by gene editing demonstrated that reduced QPRT lowers renal NAD+, raises urinary quinolinate, and exacerbates AKI susceptibility. These results established QPRT as a mediator of renal stress resistance. We then conducted four independent human studies to investigate quinolinate’s utility as a urinary indicator of diminished de novo NAD+ biosynthesis and the potential for QPRT-independent NAD+ augmentation: (1) urine metabolites from the de novo NAD+ biosynthetic pathway in a cardiac surgery discovery cohort (n = 12); (2) urine metabolites from an independent prospectively collected ICU cohort (n = 329); (3) oral Nam at the highest tested dose administered to healthy volunteers (n = 8); and (4) a Phase 1 pilot study of oral Nam in cardiac surgery patients (n = 41). The results propose that de novo NAD+ biosynthesis becomes impaired during human AKI and that augmentation of NAD+ metabolism may be safe and potentially beneficial.</p>
              <p id="P12">These findings move the growing field of NAD+ metabolism research into a human disease context. Among metabolically active organs, kidney function peaks at approximately age 30, and then steadily declines for unclear reasons. When AKI develops in an elderly patient, the acute event may take place against a backdrop of diminished NAD+ biosynthetic reserve. Yet the majority of patients suffering transient metabolic stressors do not develop AKI. Those spared from AKI may have superior NAD+ metabolism from better nutrition, a diminished tendency toward stress-dependent suppression of QPRT, or both. Elevating NAD+ metabolism may have several beneficial mechanisms of action, such as post-ischemic augmentation of fatty acid oxidation—for which NAD+ levels are rate-limiting<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>—to the provision of substrate for cytoprotective sirtuin enzymes.<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> NADP+ may also be critical in AKI as its reduced form, NADPH, promotes detoxification of reactive oxygen species.<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Parsing a singular kidney-protective mechanism downstream of NAD+ augmentation may be challenging given the ~400 redox reactions involving NAD+/NADH, ~50 reactions involving NAD+ consumption, and ~30 redox reactions involving NADP+/NADPH throughout the cell.<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup></p>
              <p id="P13">The de novo NAD+ biosynthetic pathway has been considered a minor contributor to intracellular NAD+ levels in mammals. However, a recent study identified rare loss-of-function mutations in two other de novo enzymes, 3-hydroxyanthranilate-3,4-dixoygenase (HAAO) and kynureninase (KYNU) that reduced NAD+ in humans. Not only did this study independently corroborate the quantitative contribution of de novo biosynthesis to NAD+ metabolism, but affected individuals exhibited major renal anomalies.<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> This report identified a pivotal role for de novo NAD+ biosynthesis during human <bold><italic>development</italic></bold> and proposed the therapeutic potential of “orthogonal” NAD+ augmentation during gestation, i.e., independent of the de novo pathway. In the present context of <bold><italic>acquired</italic></bold> de novo NAD+ impairment related to reduced QPRT, there is a striking parallel in that kidney involvement is one of the most common complications suffered by critically ill patients and may also respond to orthogonal NAD+ augmentation. The present data propose both a mechanism of locally diminished NAD+ biosynthesis triggered by metabolic stressors such as ischemia and an inexpensive strategy for its therapeutic replenishment. Further, acquired impairments in the de novo pathway associated with aging or chronic kidney disease—two major AKI risk factors—may reduce renal NAD+ and thereby enhance susceptibility to AKI.</p>
              <p id="P14">The transcriptional co-activator PPAR-gamma-coactivator-1-alpha (PGC1α) coordinates expression of QPRT and other de novo enzymes in the kidney both at baseline (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Fig 1d</xref>) and during ischemic AKI, but other QPRT regulators may also be important. For example, enrichment of QPRT expression in the kidney and liver may relate to their shared blood detoxification function. Shortage of NAD+ in the kidney as a consequence of QPRT reduction could also be a deleterious side effect of an otherwise adaptive response to injury. Since reduced QPRT would favor the accumulation of earlier metabolites in the de novo pathway such as kynurenine, reduction of QPRT may offer the injured kidney a chemical mechanism to modulate local signaling responses in a manner that affects subsequent tissue repair.<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>–<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup></p>
              <p id="P15">Several areas require further investigation. First, upstream regulators of QPRT need to be identified. We found that PGC1α induces QPRT expression, but the relevant transcriptional partner(s) remain elusive. Second, the present results suggest that renal and urinary quinolinate derive from impaired renal QPRT action, but this could also reflect renal accumulation from extrarenal sources that respond to renal ischemia. For example, QPRT’s expression is highest in the liver, where it should be studied further. Third, if QPRT is an important link between AKI and risk factors such as aging and chronic kidney disease, then one or more mechanisms implicated in aging and/or CKD may be important. Proposed mechanisms and effectors of aging include autophagy, redox balance, telomere shortening, epigenetic changes, and stem cell function.<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> QPRT may be affected by or may impact several of these processes. Finally, the urinary metabolomic profiles of AKI and QPRT deficiency share 24 differentially regulated metabolites— approximately 40% of each profile. The non-overlapping metabolites may illuminate novel QPRT-independent metabolic stressors in AKI and/or actions of QPRT outside the scope of post-ischemic AKI.</p>
              <p id="P16">The clinical studies propose both a new non-invasive indicator of NAD+ metabolism in the context of AKI and a novel set of targets for future therapeutic studies. Several important limitations should be noted. Because quinolinate is considered unique to the de novo NAD+ biosynthesis pathway, the evidence implicating uQ:T in clinical AKI strongly suggests that NAD+ metabolism is important in the human AKI context. While verification of this signal in a larger, prospectively collected ICU cohort helped to answer questions of confounding and over-fitting in the discovery study, future studies will need to address the timing and amplitude of uQ:T deflection in different AKI populations before considering this metabolite signature an AKI biomarker. Second, routine safety assessments of renal and cardiac function in the high-risk cardiac surgery population yielded signals suggesting benefit. But larger studies powered for these and related endpoints are clearly needed to address safety and efficacy. In this light, the present results provide valuable guidance for future trials. For example, since the 3 gm/day dose was well-tolerated and led to higher levels of circulating NMN than the 1 gm/day dose, this regimen may be more effective for increasing NAD+ metabolism. The severity of AKI was modest in our Phase 1 pilot study. Severe AKI after cardiac surgery is uncommon and would require much larger interventional studies to accumulate a sufficient number of severe events for analysis.<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> Nonetheless, the incidence of AKI and the average post-operative rise in creatinine we observed in the placebo arm were comparable to large Phase 3 trials.<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup></p>
              <p id="P17">Third, the optimal method to boost NAD+ remains to be determined. Although our choice of Nam was based upon its extensive human safety record, we also considered Nam’s ability to inhibit stress-activated PARPs as a possible adjunctive benefit.<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> But Nam can also inhibit the cytoprotective enzyme sirtuin-1. Both Nam and another natural NAD+ precursor, nicotinamide riboside (NR), have been shown to increase intracellular NAD+; however, NR may also augment sirtuin activity more effectively than Nam.<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> Complementary to orthogonal NAD+ supplementation, an add-on therapeutic strategy could also involve increasing flux through the de novo pathway—e.g., by administering de novo precursors or inhibiting enzyme(s) that deplete this pathway. Finally, compared to other metabolically active organs such as the brain or heart that are affected by aging or metabolic stressors, kidney function can be assessed quantitatively, reproducibly, and simply. Therefore, renal endpoints may become useful for future trials related to aging. More broadly, recognizing that age-dependent loss of resistance to acute metabolic stressors may be an aging phenotype suggests that exploratory interventional studies on aging could be conducted in a cost-efficient, acute context. In short, the biology of NAD+ should be examined in multiple clinical contexts.</p>
              <p id="P18">To summarize, the present results demonstrate that impairment in de novo NAD+ biosynthesis characterizes patients at risk for AKI, a common and morbid complication of critical illness for which no specific treatment exists. Urinary measurement of de novo precursors in at-risk humans implicates impairment in this pathway and, furthermore, predicts adverse outcomes. The orthogonal NAD+ precursor Nam may be safe to administer among high-risk patients. Novel treatments to restore NAD+ could constitute an important advance for patients at risk of AKI. Further studies are needed to verify these findings.</p>

                <p>A.P.M. and K.R.K. were co-PIs on the Phase 1 pilot study of oral Nam in cardiac surgery patients for which V.W., J.M., A.L., and M.E.T. were co-investigators. S.J.H. served as the independent medical monitor for this trial. K.M.R., N.S.-T., and A.H.B. analyzed samples and data from all human studies. A.H.B. developed targeted metabolic assays and conducted all related measurements. M.T.T. conducted mouse studies and analyzed results with assistance from N.S.-T. and M.R.L. D.E.L. and S.S.W. enrolled the ICU cohort, created that repository, and performed statistical analyses of the uQ:T results in the ICU cohort. A.K. and S.H.K. enrolled the discovery cohort of cardiac surgery patients and created that repository with guidance from S.M.P. C.C.K., E.P.R., and R.I.T. developed and conducted the trial of oral Nam in healthy volunteers. E.P.R. also conducted metabolomic screening of mouse samples on the platform developed in C.B.C.’s laboratory with input from C.B.C. A.P.M., M.T.T., K.M.R., and S.M.P. assumed primary responsibility for writing the manuscript. All authors reviewed, provided substantive input, and approved of the final manuscript.</p>
