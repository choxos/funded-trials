                <p id="Par1">PD-1 blockade (nivolumab) efficacy remains modest for metastatic sarcoma. In this paper, we present an open-label, non-randomized, non-comparative pilot study of bempegaldesleukin, a CD122-preferential interleukin-2 pathway agonist, with nivolumab in refractory sarcoma at Memorial Sloan Kettering/MD Anderson Cancer Centers (NCT03282344). We report on the primary outcome of objective response rate (ORR) and secondary endpoints of toxicity, clinical benefit, progression-free survival, overall survival, and durations of response/treatment. In 84 patients in 9 histotype cohorts, all patients experienced ≥1 adverse event and treatment-related adverse event; 1 death was possibly treatment-related. ORR was highest in angiosarcoma (3/8) and undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (2/10), meeting predefined endpoints. Results of our exploratory investigation of predictive biomarkers show: CD8 + T cell infiltrates and PD-1 expression correlate with improved ORR; upregulation of immune-related pathways correlate with improved efficacy; Hedgehog pathway expression correlate with resistance. Exploration of this combination in selected sarcomas, and of Hedgehog signaling as a predictive biomarker, warrants further study in larger cohorts.</p>

              <p id="Par3">Sarcomas are diverse malignancies comprising more than 100 subtypes of bone and soft tissue origin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Each year, up to 16,000 patients are diagnosed in the United States<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. In the metastatic setting, there are no good treatment options: front-line chemotherapy is associated with low objective response rates (ORR, averaging ~18%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> and second-line treatments have lower efficacy still<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. In other cancers, the use of monoclonal antibodies that block immune checkpoints such as programmed death 1 (PD-1; PDCD1) are effective alternative therapies to mobilize the immune system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, but in sarcoma their activity has been modest<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Studies that could elucidate this low response by characterizing the tumor microenvironment in sarcoma are limited.</p>
              <p id="Par4">High tumor mutational burden (TMB), tumor PD-L1 (CD274) expression, and increased tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) are biomarkers of response to checkpoint inhibitors in multiple cancer types that have been found to be low across most sarcoma subtypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Prior studies in sarcoma have associated the presence of TlLs with improved clinical outcome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. These markers correspond to an immune-sensitive phenotype labeled “immune-hot.” In soft tissue sarcomas (STS) classified by gene expression analysis as immune-hot, with high expression of CD8 + T cells, tertiary lymphoid structures, and B cell markers, patients had improved response to PD-1 blockade<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par5">Novel approaches are needed to improve the effectiveness of PD-1 blockade while identifying predictive biomarkers of treatment response and resistance. We recently showed that combining talimogene laherparepvec via intratumoral injection with pembrolizumab in metastatic sarcoma led to immune conversion and correlated with improved clinical efficacy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Bempegaldesleukin, a CD122-preferential interleukin-2 (IL-2) pathway agonist, is associated with increased proliferation and activation of TILs among patients with solid tumors, providing the rationale to explore this agent in sarcoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par6">We hypothesized that bempegaldesleukin would improve the efficacy of nivolumab PD-1 blockade. In this open-label, non-comparative pilot clinical trial (NCT03282344), we perform an integrated genetic, transcriptomic, and immunopathologic analysis to uncover the immune landscape in sarcoma at baseline and after treatment to differentiate which patients are most likely to respond. Here, we show that CD8 + T cell infiltrates and PD-1 expression correlate with improved ORR; that upregulation of immune-related pathways correlates with improved efficacy; and that Hedgehog pathway expression correlates with resistance.</p>

              <p id="Par27">There remains an unmet clinical need to optimize immunotherapeutic strategies for patients with metastatic sarcoma. We performed this clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of bempegaldesleukin and nivolumab in predefined histological cohorts and obtained serial biopsy specimens to help provide insight into predictive biomarkers of response and resistance. We identified variations in ORR based on the cohort; there were no responses in osteosarcoma, conventional chondrosarcomas, and dedifferentiated liposarcomas, while 3 of 8 (38%) patients with non-cutaneous angiosarcoma and 2 of 10 (20%) patients with UPS obtained durable responses, thereby meeting predefined study endpoints and suggesting that additional study may be warranted. The clinical efficacy in non-cutaneous angiosarcoma is surprising and interesting; efficacy seen in UPS remains consistent with previously published studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. The trial design emphasized the importance of histology-specific cohorts because of the heterogeneity of this disease; this heterogeneity also highlights the need for larger cohorts to better define the clinical efficacy of this therapeutic combination and validate the status of Hedgehog signaling status as a predictive biomarker.</p>
              <p id="Par28">We sought to identify genomic and immune correlates of clinical benefit from this combination by conducting immunohistochemistry, whole exome sequencing, and RNA sequencing analyses. In our study cohorts, we did not identify any putative genetic drivers that correlated with response or resistance. Further, genomic markers such as TMB, neoantigen load, and loss of heterozygosity did not correlate with clinical benefit. Elevated TMB and resultant dominant UV signature mutations have been found to be potential predictive biomarkers of benefit in cutaneous, head, and neck angiosarcomas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Despite the low TMB identified in our analyzed cohort, 3 of 8 (38%) patients with non-cutaneous angiosarcoma derived prolonged clinical benefit with this drug combination, suggesting that conventional genomic markers alone may not suffice to identify suitable patients.</p>
              <p id="Par29">The presence of increased numbers of CD8 + T cells and higher PD-1 expression (by IHC and gene expression) at baseline and on-treatment were associated with improved ORR and prolonged PFS, consistent with previous reports in other solid tumors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. At baseline, our clustering analysis identified three groups of tumors (Group A: “immune-hot”; Group B: intermediate with higher neutrophils; Group C: “immune-cold”). Myeloid cells, including neutrophils, have been shown to suppress T cell responses, providing a potential explanation for the predominance of response in Group A versus Groups B and C<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. On-treatment analysis identified only 2 groups, A and C. Convergence into 2 groups presumably highlights the changes induced in the immune microenvironment during treatment. Notably, Petitprez et al. recently classified sarcomas into five phenotypes that correlated with ORR and OS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. While the clustering by Petitprez et al. was conducted in primary resected specimens, our cohort only includes treated metastatic specimens. Further, the variability of sarcoma subtypes and overall lower numbers within each subtype may also explain the differences between our results.</p>
              <p id="Par30">In sarcoma, bempegaldesleukin did not appear to improve efficacy to checkpoint blockade; other mechanisms may be driving resistance to immunotherapy. Our GSEA identified the upregulation of mesenchymal transition and Hedgehog signaling pathway expression as associated with lack of benefit. Hedgehog signaling has been implicated in the development of resistance to systemic therapies such as cytotoxic chemotherapy, targeted agents, and radiation therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. The Hedgehog signaling pathway can also regulate the immune response and aberrant Hedgehog signaling has been shown to drive tumor growth through a number of pathways including enhanced immunosuppressive mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. We have shown that the presence of CD8 + T cells and the reduced expression of the Hedgehog signaling pathway led to the best clinical outcome. Interestingly, in basal cell carcinoma, inhibition of Hedgehog signaling with vismodegib and sonidegib has led to reduction in tumor burden and durable clinical benefit for some patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. In the setting of tumor regressions due to Hedgehog inhibitors, favorable changes to the immune microenvironment have been shown, including upregulation of MHC class I expression and infiltration of CD8 + T cells into tumors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. The interplay of Hedgehog signaling and the immune microenvironment warrants further investigation in sarcoma.</p>
              <p id="Par31">Limitations of this study include the low ORR across each cohort, which precluded robust correlative analyses. Further, the non-randomized nature limits the ability to identify the additive benefit of bempegaldesleukin. Sarcoma is a complex heterogeneous disease and each histological subtype can have variable behavior and response to systemic therapy, prompting the need to enroll patients onto cohorts based on subtype. Without well-defined biostatistical endpoints within each cohort, drawing definitive conclusions regarding efficacy is also not feasible. The goal instead was to identify a signal of efficacy that would potentially lead to expansions and further study. Similarly, our correlative studies identified interesting observations that will require additional evaluation in larger histology-specific cohorts.</p>
              <p id="Par32">This combination has limited activity in most sarcoma subtypes, other than in angiosarcoma where additional study may be warranted. Our data highlights the potential role of CD8 + T cell infiltration in driving immune responses to checkpoint inhibition, as has been described in other malignancies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. While upregulation of Hedgehog signaling seems to correlate with lack of efficacy, a predictive biomarker of immune conversion remains to be defined and further evaluation of the relevance of Hedgehog signaling status is necessary.</p>

                <p id="Par33">This was a multi-center, open-label, non-randomized, non-comparative pilot trial conducted at MSK and MDA (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03282344). Eligible patients were ≥12 years and had advanced or metastatic sarcoma measurable per RECIST v1.1, ECOG performance status of 0 or 1, an estimated life expectancy of ≥3 months, previous receipt of ≥1 systemic therapy for metastatic disease (if applicable), and adequate kidney, liver, and bone marrow function. A sample size of 10 patients was planned for 7 of the histological cohorts (LMS, UPS/MFS, chondrosarcoma, DDLPS, osteosarcoma, angiosarcoma and ASPS), and a sample size of 15 patients was planned for the SBRCT/synovial sarcoma and other cohorts to account for their heterogeneity. A minimum of 28 days was required between any previous systemic therapy and initiation of bempegaldesleukin and nivolumab. Key exclusion criteria were active brain metastases or history of autoimmune diseases. Prior therapy with anti-PD-1 was permitted. The first participant enrolled on September 14, 2017, and the last enrolled on January 17, 2020.</p>
                <p id="Par34">Study protocol (Supplementary Note 1) was approved by review boards at MSK and MDA. The study was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki and the Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice. Each participant signed an IRB-approved, protocol-specific informed consent in accordance with federal and institutional guidelines. This study was monitored for accrual, safety, and the primary endpoint, at least twice annually, by the Data and Safety Monitoring Board, a standing committee at MSK. Since RECIST remains the standard approach to assess efficacy on therapeutic trials, in deviation from the protocol, we opted to not perform irRECIST reads as it would not change our interpretation of the data or alter our conclusions.</p>

                <p id="Par36">Tumor assessments were performed at baseline and every 8 weeks thereafter and were not subject to central radiology review. Patients experiencing PD were permitted to continue study treatment beyond initial PD if the patient had evidence of clinical benefit and tolerated study treatment. Dose reductions were not permitted; however, dose interruptions for up to 6 weeks were allowed. If treatment was discontinued due to adverse events, patients were followed until disease progression or initiation of different therapy for &gt;30 days after the last dose of bempegaldesleukin and nivolumab. Laboratory tests were performed at baseline and every 2–3 weeks as per the treatment schedule. Adverse events were graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 4.0 during treatment and ≥30 days after treatment discontinuation. Mandatory biopsies prior to treatment and during week 3 were obtained in the same anatomic site unless not medically feasible. In addition, research blood tests were obtained at baseline and pretreatment on day 1 of cycles 8, 16, 24, 46, and at the time of progression.</p>

                <p id="Par37">The primary endpoint was confirmed ORR within each histology cohort based on RECIST v1.1 during protocol-directed treatment. Confirmation of response was required 4 weeks following initial response. Confirmed ORR was estimated as the number of patients with a CR or PR divided by the number of evaluable patients. Secondary outcomes were toxicity, clinical benefit rate, duration of response, PFS, OS, and duration of treatment. Clinical benefit rate was defined as best objective status (CR, PR, or SD) at a given time point while receiving protocol treatment, divided by the number of patients receiving treatment at the same time point. Duration of response was defined as the time from first CR or PR to date of PD. PFS was defined as the time from start of treatment to date of PD or death. Patients who discontinued treatment for reasons other than PD, such as adverse events, were censored at the date of their most recent disease evaluation prior to receiving any later systemic treatment regimens. OS was calculated as the time between start of treatment and date of death. Patients lost to follow-up were censored for survival at the date last known to be alive. Patients remaining in active treatment were censored for duration of treatment on their most recent date of treatment. All analyses excluded any data collected beyond the date of withdrawal for patients having withdrawn consent. After discontinuation of protocol treatment, survival status was assessed every 3 months for a year after the last dose.</p>

Truncating mutations were defined as those that create a stop codon or were an out-of-frame indel. Clonality differences between baseline and on-treatment samples were calculated by estimating the uncertainty of the baseline variant allele frequency using the Wilson 95% CI on the binomial probability. If the on-treatment variant allele frequency was not within the 95% CI, it was considered discordant.

The PD-L1 and Ki-67 assays were evaluated by measuring the percentage of cells staining in the following fashion: 0 (no staining), 1 + (weak staining), 2 + (moderate staining) and 3 + (strong staining). To calculate the H score, the following formula was used: (3 x % cells staining at 3 + ) + (2 x % cells staining at 2 + ) + (1 x % cells staining at 1 + ). Other cell types were also evaluated using maximum staining intensity (Max SI) which included evaluation of normal adjacent tissue, endothelia, smooth muscle, fibroblasts, stroma, inflammatory cells, and nerve. Not all samples were able to be tested for all markers: 84 samples were tested for PD-1 (48 baseline, 33 on-treatment, 3 progression), 93 for PD-L1 (53 baseline, 37 on-treatment, 3 progression), 81 for CD8 (47 baseline, 32 on-treatment, 2 progression), 84 for FOXP3 (48 baseline, 34 on-treatment, 2 progression).

Barcoded samples were pooled equimolar and sequenced on a MiSeq, NextSeq 500, or NovaSeq 6000 in a PE150 run, using the MiSeq Reagent Kit v3 (300 cycles), NextSeq 500/550 Mid Output Kit v2.5 (300 cycles), or NovaSeq 6000 S3 Reagent Kit (300 Cycles) (Illumina). Each sample yielded on average 3.2 M reads and fastq files were uploaded to the Archer Analysis bioinformatics suite for processing.</p>
                <p id="Par56">Archer delivered trimmed and deduplicated fastqs, which were then used to quantify TCR diversity for the 4 TCRs analyzed by the platform (<italic>α</italic>, <italic>β</italic>, <italic>γ</italic>, and <italic>δ</italic>). The MiXCR pipeline was used to process, align, assemble, and export clones for each TCR type separately<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref></sup>. Next, the VDJtools pipeline<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref></sup> was utilized to calculate basic statistics including TCR diversity. Differences in TCR diversity were compared by two-sided <italic>t</italic>-test between each response group (PR, SD, or PD) vs. others.</p>
