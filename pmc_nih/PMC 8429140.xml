                  <p id="P23">Aromatase inhibitors are effective in lowering breast cancer incidence among postmenopausal women, but adverse events represent a barrier to their acceptability and adherence as a preventive treatment. This study aims to assess whether lowering exemestane schedule may retain biological activity while improving tolerability in breast cancer patients.</p>

                  <title>Methods/design:</title>
                  <p id="P24">We are conducting a, pre-surgical, non-inferiority phase IIb study in postmenopausal women with newly diagnosed estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. Participants are randomized to receive either exemestane 25 mg/day or 25 mg/three times-week or once a week for 4 to 6 weeks prior to surgery.</p>
                  <p id="P25">The primary endpoint is the percentage change of serum estradiol concentration between baseline and surgery comparing the three arms. Sample size of 180 women was calculated assuming a 6% non-inferiority of the percent change of estradiol in the lower dose arms compared with the 80% decrease predicted in the full dose arm, with 80% power and using a one-sided 5% significance level and a two-sample <italic>t</italic>-test.</p>
                  <p id="P26">Main secondary outcomes are: safety; change in Ki-67 in cancer and adjacent pre-cancer tissue, circulating sex hormones, adipokines, lipid profile, insulin and glucose changes, in correlation with drug and metabolites concentrations.</p>

                  <title>Results and discussion:</title>
                  <p id="P27">The present paper is focused on methodology and operational aspects of the study. A total of 180 participants have ben enrolled. The trial is still blinded, and the analyses are ongoing.</p>
                  <p id="P28">Despite the short term duration, results may have relevant implications for clinical management of women at increased risk of developing a ER positive breast cancer.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="P29">The pre-surgical - window of opportunity - trial design has successfully been used to streamline drug development and check tumor sensitivity to a given drug [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The treatment effect on the adjacent intraepithelial neoplasia, including ductal or lobular carcinoma in situ (DCIS, LCIS) and atypical hyperplasia can be a reliable readout for the preventive activity generating new insight into new preventive strategies [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p>
              <p id="P30">Despite the strong positive findings in breast cancer prevention with tamoxifen, the attitude towards preventive medicine remains ambivalent, and the associated side effects, particularly hot flashes and sexual disturbances, hamper the drug uptake by high-risk women who could benefit from it [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p>
              <p id="P31">Among the strategies to overcome tamoxifen side effects, our group has intensively investigated alternative low doses of tamoxifen in several phase II studies [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>–<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], and in two phase III studies [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] in women at increased risk of breast cancer.</p>
              <p id="P32">Likewise, aromatase inhibitors (AIs) have proven their capability to lower cancer incidence in postmenopausal high risk women. The Mammary Protocol 3 (MAP.3) trial [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial with exemestane 25 mg/day for 5 years, at a median follow-up of 35 months, showed a 65% relative reduction in the annual incidence of invasive breast cancer compared with placebo (0.19% vs 0.55%; HR 0.35, 95% CI 0.18–0.70; <italic>p</italic> = 0.002). Similar results were obtained in the IBIS II Prevention trial where high-risk postmenopausal women were randomly assigned to receive either anastrozole 1 mg daily or placebo for 5 years. After a median follow-up of 5 years, 2% of women in the anastrozole group vs. 4% in the placebo group developed breast cancer (HR 0.47 95% CI 0.32, 0.68; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Musculoskeletal adverse events (AEs) were common in the anastrozole group and vasomotor symptoms were present in both groups, but the incidence was higher in women on anastrozole. In the adjuvant setting it has been reported that approximately one in four women adhere sub-optimally to anastrozole therapy during the first year, and that adherence may drop up to 62% at the third year [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In the prevention setting, quality of life (QoL) is even more relevant: in the MAP.3 study a worsening of menopausal symptoms determined a discontinuation rate up to 80% irrespective of treatment arm [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p>
              <p id="P33">A significant step forward to promote breast cancer prevention in postmenopausal women is certainly to improve QoL by seeking to determine the minimally active AIs dose and using an intermittent schedule. Previous studies have shown the possibility to use lower or intermittent dose of letrozole, alternative doses as lower as 1 mg three times a week showed similar estradiol reduction compared to standard dose [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Colleoni at al showed a similar disease-free survival between continuous versus intermittent letrozole schedules [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Exemestane is a steroidal, irreversible AI. This drug is highly specific and inhibits peripheral conversion of androstenedione to estrogen down to 98%. Importantly, the estradiol suppression persists for at least 5 days after administration of a single dose [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Despite the shorter half-life, compared to anastrozole and letrozole, exemestane shows a long-lasting inhibitory effect on aromatase, which is attributable to tight binding to the enzyme [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This suggests the possibility to reduce the dose and the frequency, while still maintaining a significant estradiol reduction. A study of 10 patients found that women who took a daily dose of 10 mg of exemestane achieved equivalent estradiol suppression as women who took a dose of 25 mg daily [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p>
              <p id="P34">For this purpose we designed a pre-surgical phase IIb, randomized, double-blind, multi-center study for postmenopausal women with histologically confirmed estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer (Stage 0-II) comparing the exemestane standard daily dose regimen versus two alternative, less frequent dose regimens.</p>

                <p id="P35">This is a multicenter, pre-surgical double-blind non-inferiority phase IIb study in which participants have been randomized to receive either exemestane 25 mg/day or 25 mg/ three times a week or a single dose of 25 mg/week for 4 to 6 weeks. Participants with an histologically-confirmed ER-positive (ER expression ≥10% by immunohistochemistry [IHC]) breast cancer, candidate for breast surgery have been accrued. Complete physical exam and safety lab tests were performed at baseline and at end of treatment. Phone contacts have been made at day 1 of treatment and a week before surgery. Blood samples were collected at baseline and the final visit; tissue biomarkers will be assessed from the diagnostic biopsy and the surgical specimen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>).</p>

                <p id="P39">Main inclusion criteria: Postmenopausal patients defined as: women ≥60 years of age, or amenorrhea ≥12 months, or bilateral oophorectomy, or hysterectomized patients with FSH in the menopausal levels as per local institutional guidelines if &lt;60 years old; histologically-confirmed ER-positive (≥ 10%) primary breast cancer stage cT<sub>0–2</sub>, cN<sub>0–1</sub>, M<sub>x</sub>. Patients with larger tumors who refused neoadjuvant chemotherapy and/or endocrine therapy were also eligible. Blood tests within the normal limits or with no clinical relevance.</p>
                <p id="P40">Main exclusion criteria were: body mass index (BMI) &lt; 18.5 Kg/m<sup>2</sup>; previous treatment for breast cancer; uncontrolled intercurrent illness; other co-existing invasive malignancies (with the exclusion of basal cell carcinoma or skin squamous cell carcinoma) diagnosed during the last 2 years before randomization; history of severe osteoporosis; use of systemic hormone replacement therapy in the last 30 days prior to the randomization; use of any chemopreventive agents (selective estrogen receptor modulators or AIs) in the last 3 months; concomitant use of CYP3A4 inducer medication (rifampicin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and St. John’s wort).</p>

                <title>Study procedures</title>
                <p id="P41">Dedicated personnel proposed the trial to the incoming postmenopausal patients with a newly diagnosed ER-positive in situ or invasive breast cancer, or a highly suspicious lesion. For those who agreed, a baseline visit was scheduled. The Italian centers were allowed a screening visit with a dedicated informed consent to determine the histology nature of the lesion. At the baseline visit, medical history, physical exam, concomitant medication, tobacco/alcohol use, and any symptoms have been evaluated together with a self-reported questionnaire (MENQOL) [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] (by Mapi Research Trust, France) and blood collection for safety and circulating biomarkers. Participants who fulfilled the requirements were randomized. Treatment could be started the day of visit or the following days to allow for the appropriate timing from start of treatment to surgery. The participants were advised to take one tablet per day after dinner, approximately at 8 PM, starting from day 1 till the night before surgery. If the start date was different from the randomization day a telephone contact was performed as a reminder for the patient. To monitor compliance, concomitant medications, and toxicity a telephone contact was also scheduled a week before surgery (+3 days).</p>
                <p id="P42">Given the weekly drug schedule participant has to undergo breast surgery exactly at the 29th or 36th or 43rd day, and the final visit occurred the same day or the day before. Final visit included physical exam, toxicity assessment, concomitant medications, blood collection, compliance/review of pill diary, and self-reported MENQOL questionnaire. The blood withdrawal schedule in this study is crucial to respect the timing since last active pill intake for each arm (range of 12 h, 1.5–2.5 days and 5.5–6.5 days).</p>
                <p id="P43">If a toxicity “possibly”, “probably” or “definitely” related to the investigational drug was reported, it was monitored by a telephone call at 20–30 days after surgery.</p>
                <p id="P44">The enrollment was steady throughout the study. Due to its short treatment plan no specific retention strategies were applied, except for a telephone contact a week before surgery.</p>
                <p id="P45">The three double blind treatment arms were: arm 1, one tablet of exemestane 25 mg per week; arm 2, one tablet of exemestane 25 mg three times a week; arm 3, one tablet of exemestane 25 mg a day.</p>
                <p id="P46">Tablets were packaged in blister card packaging, each blister card containing 7 tablets. Participants received two wallets of 3 blister cards each (6 blister cards for up to 6 weeks of treatment). Tablets within the blister were numbered from 1 to 7 to clearly mark the order to be taken by the participants. Based on the arm, the blister contained 7 active tablets 1 through 7; or three active tablets corresponding to days 1, 3 and 5 and four placebo tablets at days 2, 4, 6 and 7; or one active tablet at day 1 and 6 placebo in the remaining 6 days (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, as an example). If for any reason they skipped a tablet they were instructed to leave it behind and take the next of the corresponding day.</p>
                <p id="P47">To be compliant, a participant had to have taken ≥80% of the active scheduled pills overall and also specifically in the last 7 days before surgery. Compliance has been measured using subject pill diary and tablets count. The main measure of compliance is the number of tablets taken (i.e. [number of tablets given minus number of tablets returned]) divided by the number of tablets that should have been taken during that period of time. Since the blister may have a mix of placebo and active pills, the position of any missed pill in each blister has been recorded to allow the unblinded statistician to determine the final compliance of active pills.</p>
                <p id="P48">Each participant received a 42 day diary to facilitate tracking and recording of pill intake. Each participant was told to write Yes/No in the corresponding day of the diary and to register the time of drug intake. The diary had some additional space for participant’s notes (to mark symptoms or other clinical issues). Each pill diary has been collected at the final visit. In cases where the tablets were not returned, the compliance was calculated only from the pill diary and vice versa.</p>
                <p id="P49">Due to the short treatment time and the evaluation of drug level as secondary endpoint we did not choose to use an electronic devise to monitor the compliance, even if it may improve adherence to the treatment.</p>

                <p id="P50">Biological samples are serum and whole blood, collected at baseline and final visits and tissue sample collected from the diagnostic biopsy and the surgical specimen. Symptoms/toxicity and quality of life were also collected at baseline and final visits. The study procedures are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>.</p>
                <p id="P51">The primary endpoint, i.e., the percent change in serum unconjugated estradiol concentration will be measured by high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) detection using a solid-phase extraction followed by derivatization. Duplicate standard curves, water blanks, and four assay control pools will be processed with samples to assess accuracy and precision of the assay. The lower limit of quantification is 1.0 pg/mL. The low detection limit of this method will enable us to effectively detect estradiol concentrations at the very lowest levels, a characteristic of older postmenopausal women and in patients treated with AIs. Since lowering estradiol is the most direct action of the drug, this was chosen as primary endpoint.</p>

Toxicity has been evaluated using the NCI terminology criteria (CTCAE version 4.0.3, published 06/14/2010). For grade 1 or 2 toxicity the participant remains on treatment irrespective of attribution to the study drug. In case of grade 3 toxicity unrelated or unlikely related to study treatment, participant may remain on treatment as per physician judgment. Women who experience probable, possible or definite related to study treatment grade 3 or any grade 4 adverse events will be removed from the study.

                <p id="P61">Statistical analysis will be performed according to intention to treat principle and then a subgroup analysis will be restricted to women who are “compliant”, such as participants who have taken ≥80% of the active scheduled pills, and notably, due to the different arm schedule, ≥ 80% of the active pills has to be reached also in the last 7 days before surgery. The primary objective of this study is to assess if the reduction in unconjugated estradiol with the lower doses is comparable with the standard dose. Thus, the primary endpoint is the percentage change of serum estradiol concentration from baseline and we will compare the median change and percentage changes among arms. We choose the percentage change as the primary endpoint because it will improve generalization of results, given the wide variability among different subjects, and because we predict that a large percentage of participants will have the final values of estradiol below the detectable level.</p>
                <p id="P62">Differences by arms of percentage change, absolute change and final values will be tested considering <italic>t</italic>-test and ANCOVA models. Unconjugated estradiol at baseline will be included as explanatory variable together with other possible confounders such as BMI, age and time since last dose. Normal distribution of residuals from full model will be checked and, if needed, a transformation will be considered. We will carry out the two comparisons with the standard dose considering alfa = 0.025.</p>

A total sample size of 162 participants (54 participants per arm), enables us to achieve 80% power with a margin of equivalence of −6% in the mean percentage changes from baseline at the lower dose compared to the standard dose. The true difference between the means percentage changes is assumed to be 0.0%. The significance level of the test is 0.025 to take into account multiple comparisons (we will compare the changes at the two low doses with the standard dose) [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].

In order to minimize the imbalance among arms, participants have been stratified according to center and BMI (&lt;25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> versus ≥25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). BMI was chosen as possible variable for estrogen concentration, hence the exclusion of underweight women (BMI &lt;18.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>).

              <p id="P69">Cancer incidence, morbidity, and mortality have a dramatic impact on public health worldwide; and the increasing number of patients and treatment costs will reach an unaffordable level in the near future [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. For these reasons the development and promotion of more effective cancer prevention programs are needed.</p>
              <p id="P70">Awareness and education on cancer prevention should be implemented at all levels, from health care professionals to the general population. Risk perception, information and counselling are crucial elements to be discussed between physician and at-risk individual, considering that personal preferences and values have to be strongly supported in the field of prevention, [<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p>
              <p id="P71">The individual risk level may lead to the different breast cancer risk reduction options, including life-style changes, preventive medicine, and prophylactic surgery, in case of hereditary cancer syndromes.</p>
              <p id="P72">In breast cancer preventive medicine we have obtained remarkable results in terms of feasibility and drug acceptability by lowering tamoxifen dose in healthy at-risk women and in patients with intraepithelial neoplasia [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In our recent publications we have shown that there is no difference in serious adverse events using 5 mg per day of tamoxifen compared to placebo [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The low toxicity profile achieved with low-dose tamoxifen showed the same compliance compared to placebo whereas the adherence to treatment is lower with 20md/day standard dose [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p>
              <p id="P73">The present study aims to investigate the biological activity of two alternative exemestane schedules compared to the standard daily dose. Secondary endpoints, particularly the Ki67 evaluation, may provide an important sign of evidence of clinical efficacy. Whereas, due to the short time of treatment, the evaluation of toxicity/QoL will only assess short-term effects. Drug efficacy will be also evaluated according to BMI and other participants baseline characteristics.</p>
              <p id="P74">If a significant estradiol reduction will be confirmed with these doses/schedules, further trials to investigate directly the clinical activity and QoL should be developed. The final goal is to achieve new strategies for cancer prevention and treatment. The target population can be postmenopausal women either healthy at increased risk or with a previous breast intraepithelial neoplasia diagnosis. A lighter drug schedule and better QoL may improve the acceptability and the adherence to the treatment. We aim to pursue further phase II and III trials to validate a low-dose/intermittent exemestane, ideally versus standard dose or eventually low dose tamoxifen based on our previous study [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p>
