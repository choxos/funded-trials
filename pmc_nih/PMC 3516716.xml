                <p>12/15-Lipoxygenases (LOXs) in monocytes and macrophages generate novel phospholipid-esterified eicosanoids. Here, we report the generation of two additional families of related lipids comprising 15-ketoeicosatetraenoic acid (KETE) attached to four phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs). The lipids are generated basally by 15-LOX in IL-4-stimulated monocytes, are elevated on calcium mobilization, and are detected at increased levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from cystic fibrosis patients (3.6 ng/ml of lavage). Murine peritoneal macrophages generate 12-KETE-PEs, which are absent in 12/15-LOX-deficient mice. Inhibition of 15-prostaglandin dehydrogenase prevents their formation from exogenous 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid-PE in human monocytes. Both human and murine cells also generated analogous hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid-PEs. The electrophilic reactivity of KETE-PEs is shown by their Michael addition to glutathione and cysteine. Lastly, both 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid-PE and 15-KETE-PE activated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ reporter activity in macrophages in a dose-dependent manner. In summary, we demonstrate novel peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ-activating oxidized phospholipids generated enzymatically by LOX and 15-prostaglandin dehydrogenase in primary monocytic cells and in a human Th2-related lung disease. The lipids are a new family of bioactive mediators from the 12/15-LOX pathway that may contribute to its known anti-inflammatory actions <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Lipoxygenases (LOXs)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN2"><sup>2</sup></xref> are non-heme iron lipid-peroxidizing enzymes that catalyze the oxygenation of polyunsaturated fatty acids to their corresponding hydroperoxy derivatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Although LOXs are best known for generation of free acid eicosanoids, we showed that they also generate four phospholipid-esterified eicosanoids comprising hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HETE) attached to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) that regulate cytokine generated in monocytes and macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). These lipids also act as regulators of PE-binding protein 1 to induce mitogen-activated protein kinase activation in epithelial cells and recently were shown to orchestrate clearance of apoptotic cells during inflammation and maintain immunologic tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Thus, phospholipid-esterified lipids from this pathway are distinct from free eicosanoids and are significant signaling molecules in their own right.</p>
              <p>In terms of free eicosanoids, LOXs generate hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HpETEs) as primary products that are reduced by cellular glutathione peroxidase to secondary products, including HETEs. These can be further oxidized to form electrophilic ketoeicosatetraenoic acids (KETEs). This oxidation of the primary alcohol to a carbonyl is catalyzed by 5-hydroxyeicosanoid dehydrogenase, generating 5-KETE in neutrophils and 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH), which generates 15-KETE in monocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>) Electrophilic eicosanoids are currently of significant interest because they contain an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl and can readily adduct to proteins via Michael addition, resulting in transcriptional activation, <italic>e.g.</italic> of PPARγ and Nrf2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Certain non-enzymatically generated oxidized phospholipids, including hexadecyl azelaoyl phosphatidylcholine, also undergo Michael addition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Thus, we sought to discover whether LOXs could be a source of enzymatically generated electrophilic phospholipid oxidation products specifically containing KETEs as functional groups.</p>
              <p>Herein, a targeted lipidomic strategy was used to identify, characterize, and quantify four KETE-PE lipids generated by human and murine monocytic cells. The lipids were observed <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> in human lung disease, and along with HETE-PEs, we also show that they can activate PPARγ transcriptional activity. Thus, they represent a new class of oxidized phospholipid generated enzymatically by primary cells that could contribute to the immune regulatory actions of mammalian LOXs in health and disease.</p>

                    <title>Isolation and Activation of Murine Peritoneal Macrophages</title>
                    <p>All animal experiments were performed in accordance with the United Kingdom Home Office Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act, 1986. Wild-type female C57BL/6 mice (8–12 weeks) were from Charles River, UK; kept in constant temperature cages (20–22 °C); and given free access to water and standard chow. Naïve peritoneal macrophages were isolated by lavage into 2 ml of ice-cold PBS. 4 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml of Krebs buffer (50 m<sc>m</sc> HEPES, 100 m<sc>m</sc> NaCl, 5 m<sc>m</sc> KCl, 1 m<sc>m</sc> NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 1 m<sc>m</sc> CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 m<sc>m</sc> glucose) were stimulated with A23187 (10 μ<sc>m</sc>) at 37 °C for 15–180 min. For reduction reactions, cells were incubated at room temperature with 1 m<sc>m</sc> SnCl<sub>2</sub> for 10 min.</p>
                    <p>Peritoneal macrophages were also isolated from PPRE-EGFP transgenic mice generated as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>); PPRE-EGFP consists of three tandem consensus peroxisome proliferator-response element sites (AGGACAAAGGTCA) coupled to the gene encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). Mice were injected intraperitoneally with 2 ml of sterile thioglycolate (3%, w/v). Peritoneal exudates were collected after 3 days by lavage as described above.</p>

                    <p>The use of healthy human monocytes was approved by the School of Medicine Research Ethics Committee, Cardiff University. Human monocytes were isolated from buffy coats (Welsh Blood Service) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). 4 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml of Krebs buffer were stimulated with A23187 (10 μ<sc>m</sc>) at 37 °C for 15–180 min. For reduction, cells were incubated at room temperature with 1 m<sc>m</sc> SnCl<sub>2</sub> for 10 min. In some experiments, 15-LOX induction was not required, and monocytes were recovered by scraping following adhesion. For some experiments, 15-HpETE-PE or 15-HETE-PE (1 μ<sc>m</sc>) and 15-PGDH inhibitor CAY10397 (100 μ<sc>m</sc>) were added to cells prior to or following activation of cells. In some experiments, cells were homogenized with a manual glass Teflon homogenizer using 10 strokes.</p>

                    <p>1,2-Dimyristoyl-PE (10 ng) and 15-HETE-<italic>d</italic><sub>8</sub> (10 ng) were added to each sample before extraction as an internal standard. Where stated, hydroperoxides were reduced to the corresponding alcohol by adding 1 m<sc>m</sc> SnCl<sub>2</sub> or 1 m<sc>m</sc> triphenylphosphine for 10 min at room temperature. Lipids were extracted by adding 1 <sc>m</sc> acetic acid, 2-propanol, hexane (2:20:30, v/v) to the sample at a ratio of 2.5 ml of solvent to 1 ml of sample; vortexing; and then adding 2.5 ml of hexane. Following vortexing and centrifugation (1500 rpm for 5 min), lipids were recovered in the upper hexane layer. The samples were then re-extracted by the addition of an equal volume of hexane followed by further vortexing and centrifugation. The combined hexane layers were then dried under vacuum and analyzed for HpETE-PE, HETE-PE, and KETE-PEs using LC/MS/MS (as described below and in Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>).</p>

For CD36 expression on human monocytes, 4.5 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/well were seeded in 24-well plates in culture medium and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h for monocytes to adhere. Non-adherent cells were removed using medium. Cells were stimulated for 6 h with SAPE, 15-HETE-PE, or 15-KETE-PE at 2.5 μ<sc>m</sc> or vehicle control (methanol). Wells were washed two times with PBS, and lysates were generated for each well individually. Protein concentration was determined by nanodrop, and 20 μg was loaded onto a 4–12% polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane; blocked with 5% milk in PBS, 0.05% Tween; and incubated overnight with anti-human CD36 (R&amp;D Systems) or anti-human β-actin. Blots were incubated with the relevant secondary antibody conjugated to HRP and developed to film.</p>

                    <p>Lipid extracts from IL-4-treated human monocytes activated for 15 min with calcium ionophore were analyzed using precursor scanning LC/MS/MS for <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 317.2, the carboxylate anion of KETE [M − H]<sup>−</sup>. This revealed several major ions, including <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 780, 764, 762, and 736 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>A</italic>). These correspond to the predicted KETE adducts of PE analogous to 15-HETE-PEs reported previously in terms of sn1 fatty acid composition, namely 18:0a, 18:0p, 18:1p, and 16:0p/KETE-PE (<xref ref-type="scheme" rid="S1">Scheme 1</xref>) where two are acyl-linked and two are plasmalogen-linked at sn1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). A second series was also observed (<italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 754, 782, and 798) that corresponds to analogous HpETE-PEs because the hydroperoxide group readily loses water during collision-induced dissociation to yield an ion with <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 317.2 (not shown). A fourth HpETE-PE is expected at <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 780 isobaric with 18:0a/KETE-PE. To confirm proposed KETE-PE structures, standards were synthesized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Both HPLC retention times and product ion spectra of 18:0a, 18:0p, 18:1p, and 16:0p/15-KETE-PE standards matched those of monocyte-derived products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, <italic>B–E</italic>). Multiple daughter ions arising from KETE were detected, including 317.2, 219.2, 113.1, and 273.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) (<xref ref-type="scheme" rid="S1">Scheme 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 780.6 shows a daughter ion at 283 (18:0a), whereas sn1 fatty acids are absent in the others consistent with their proposed plasmalogen structures (<xref ref-type="scheme" rid="S1">Scheme 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). All spectra show ions generated by neutral loss of the KETE carboxylate anion [M − 318]<sup>−</sup> or of the KETE ketene [M − 300]<sup>−</sup>. These are observed as product ions for parents with <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 780.6 at <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 762 and <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 480, respectively, and further confirm the predicted structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="scheme" rid="S1">Scheme 1</xref>).</p>

In contrast to esterified 15-KETE, the free eicosanoid continued to increase in concentration, reaching an average of 2.16 ± 0.12 ng/10<sup>6</sup> cells after 3 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>E</italic>). Notably, at 15 min, total esterified KETE levels (2.2 ng/10<sup>6</sup> cells) were higher than non-esterified 15-KETE (1.2 ng/10<sup>6</sup> cells). Thus, esterified but not free KETEs appear to be metabolized by the cells from 15 min onward.</p>

                    <p>Lipid extracts from murine peritoneal lavage were extracted and analyzed using precursor scanning LC/MS/MS as for human monocytes.

As before, ions corresponding to HpETE-PEs were also detected (754, 780, 782, and 798). To confirm the identity of the KETE-PEs, 18:0a/-, 18:0p/-, 18:1p/-, and 16:0p/12-KETE-PEs were generated as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>).

                    <p>In monocytes, 15-PGDH catalyzes oxidation of free 15-HETE to 15-KETE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>).

Monocyte lysates were utilized because HETE-PEs are not well incorporated into intact cells during short time frames, and it was important to ensure access to intracellular enzyme (data not shown). After 15 min, lipids were extracted, and conversion of 18:0a/15-HETE-PE to 18:0a/15-KETE-PE was determined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref><italic>A</italic>).

Thus, the electrophilic reactivity of 15-KETE-PE was characterized by following the reaction with glutathione.

                    <p>In macrophages, activation of 12/15-lipoxygenases generates PPARγ ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Thus, it is of interest to study whether esterified eicosanoids such as 15-KETE-PE and 15-HETE-PE similarly elicit PPARγ transcriptional activity.

                    <p>Our previous studies showed that human monocytes and murine macrophages generate 15-HETE- and 12-HETE-PE lipids, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). However, in those studies, lipid extracts had been reduced using SnCl<sub>2</sub> so that the total flux of LOX-dependent esterified H(p)ETE-PE was determined. To determine HpETE-PE <italic>versus</italic> HETE-PE levels, temporal generation of HETE-PE by both human and murine monocytic cells was compared with and without chemical reduction. Thus, HpETE-PE levels would be indicated by the difference between levels before and after SnCl<sub>2</sub> treatment. Reduction caused a 2- or 4–5-fold increase in HETE-PE for human monocytes or murine macrophages, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref>, <italic>A–H</italic>).

Human monocytes were isolated from buffy coats by adhesion. 360 ng of 18:0a/15-HpETE-PE was added to either Krebs buffer (<italic>B</italic>) or Krebs + cells (4 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml) (<italic>C</italic>) in the presence or absence of 100 μ<sc>m</sc> butylated hydroxytoluene (<italic>BHT</italic>) and 100 μ<sc>m</sc> diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (<italic>DTPA</italic>).

Multiple reaction monitoring transitions 798.6 → 317.2 (15-HpETE-PE) and 782.6 → 219.1 (15-HETE-PE) were monitored, and the lipid recovered was quantified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” <italic>Error bars</italic> represent S.E.</p>

                    <p>Next, HpETE-PE was directly measured. First, 18:0a/15-HpETE-PE was synthesized and found to be detected to a high degree of sensitivity using <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 798.6 → 317.2 by LC/MS/MS (not shown). However, using this assay, very low and variable levels of HpETE-PEs were detected in monocytes or macrophages that were considerably less than expected based on calculations from data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref> (not shown). To probe the reasons for this discrepancy, 18:0a/15-HpETE-PE (360 ng) was added either to Krebs buffer or monocytes (not IL-4-treated), and then lipids were extracted and analyzed using LC/MS/MS. When added to Krebs buffer, only ∼20 or 40 ng was recovered in the absence or presence of chelators/antioxidants (diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid and butylated hydroxytoluene), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9</xref><italic>B</italic>). Furthermore, if added to cells during extraction, virtually all the HpETE-PE decomposed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9</xref><italic>C</italic>). Reduction using SnCl<sub>2</sub> prior to extraction increased the levels of HETE-PE detected, although these (around 90 or 120 ng without or with diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid/butylated hydroxytoluene, respectively) were still only around 50% of added hydroperoxide. Unreduced samples contained small amounts of HETE-PE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9</xref><italic>C</italic>, <italic>left bar</italic>). While stored in methanolic solution, our standard shows a total absence of HETE-PE (when scanning in Q1 for <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 782.6); thus, decomposition (including its conversion to the small amount of HETE-PE noted herein) starts as soon as the lipid is added to aqueous solvent (in the 2–5 min before reduction is initiated) and is further accelerated during extraction, particularly in the presence of cellular material. These losses are unlikely to be due to low extraction efficiency because HETE- and KETE-PEs are extracted using this protocol with 94 and 78% efficiencies, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Instead, we suggest that HpETE-PE is unstable in aqueous medium and that its decay is further accelerated by cell lysates. Thus, its direct measurement will significantly underestimate the flux of HpETE-PE generation in immune cells. In conclusion, we suggest that the SnCl<sub>2</sub>-reducible pool generated on activation, which accounts for 50% of the total HETE-PE detected, is instead HpETE-PE that does not survive solvent extraction.</p>

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>Herein, generation of four new oxidized phospholipids that contain a KETE functional group attached to PE is shown (<xref ref-type="scheme" rid="S1">Scheme 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Along with HETE-PEs, they were found to activate PPARγ transcriptional activity in intact cells. KETE-PEs are generated by human IL-4-treated monocytes and murine peritoneal macrophages and were detected in bronchoalveolar lavage from cystic fibrosis (CF) patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>, <italic>B–E</italic>). Acute pulmonary inflammation in CF is associated with neutrophil influx and proinflammatory cytokine generation with bone marrow-derived and alveolar macrophages and eosinophils exacerbating this inflammatory response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Both these cell types express 15-LOX and thus are potential sources of 15-KETE-PEs <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). 15-LOX is also induced by the Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13, which are also elevated in CF airways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Recent studies indicate that activation of PPARγ-dependent gene expression in CF mice ameliorates disease severity in mice, suggesting that electrophilic 15-LOX products might potentially act to dampen down inflammation in this disorder and that these or homologous molecules may be of therapeutic benefit in treating acute and chronic airway inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). In our studies, esterified HETEs are almost exclusively found in PE with little or none contained in phosphatidylcholine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). This is likely due to the enzymatic nature of their generation, which appears selective for one class of phospholipid.</p>
              <p>Our studies show that esterified eicosanoids are functionally distinct from their free acid isomers; thus, characterization of esterified KETEs as distinct to their free acid analogs is novel in terms of understanding the immunomodulatory roles of LOXs. Chemically, KETEs are very different from HETEs with the potential to adduct to amino acid residues through Michael addition. In the case of an esterified KETE, this could generate a lipid capable of membrane anchoring. Thus, the identification and characterization of esterified KETEs as a family of lipid signaling mediators in their own right is relevant for macrophage biology and inflammation.</p>
              <p>The requirement for 15- and 12/15-LOX in KETE-PE generation is indicated by their regiospecificity and their absence in peritoneal lavage from mice deficient in 12/15-LOX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and data not shown). The discovery of this new class of lipids adds to the growing list of esterified eicosanoids generated by LOXs that includes 5-, 12-, and 15-HETE-PEs and -phosphatidylcholines in neutrophils, platelets/murine macrophages, and monocytes, respectively, and 14-hydroxydocosahexanoic acid-PE from thrombin-stimulated human platelets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). These lipid families display diverse bioactivities, including enhancing coagulation, suppressing Toll-like receptor signaling, dampening neutrophil responses, and as shown herein for 15-KETE and 15-HETE-PE activation of PPARγ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>).</p>
              <p>KETE-, HETE-, and HpETE-PEs generated by 12/15-LOXs are basally detected in monocytes and macrophages but are elevated by ionophore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). In contrast, esterified eicosanoids are not detected in neutrophils and platelets prior to agonist activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Several lines of evidence suggest that 12/15-LOXs are involved in homeostatic processes, including wound healing and inflammation resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). Our observations of basal continuous enzyme turnover in resting cells along with PPARγ stimulation activity are consistent with this.</p>
              <p>Previously, we showed that HETE-PEs form via direct oxidation of PE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). To determine whether generation of KETE-PEs was also via direct oxidation or required arachidonate release and re-esterification of newly formed KETE, we examined its generation in the presence of H<sub>2</sub><sup>18</sup>O, looking for analogs with +2 atomic mass units. However, these are isobaric and were found to co-elute with 15-[<sup>16</sup>O]HETE-PE of which a small amount also forms on macrophage activation (data not shown). However, we note that macrophage activation in H<sub>2</sub><sup>18</sup>O did not result in formation of less 12-[<sup>16</sup>O]KETE-PE. Thus, it is very likely that the KETE-PEs form through direct oxidation of PE without requirement for phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> hydrolysis. Analogous KETE-PEs were not detected in human platelets or neutrophils, indicating that these cells do not further oxidize esterified 12- or 5-HETE-PE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>) (data not shown). This infers that the neutrophil 5-PGDH capable of oxidizing 5-HETE to 5-KETE may not be active in utilizing complex substrates such as phospholipid adducts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Herein, we showed that inhibition of 15-PGDH partially blocks generation of 15-KETE-PE from exogenous 15-HETE-PE. This suggests that KETE-PEs may form through oxidation of preformed HETE-PE by the enzyme rather than esterification of newly generated KETE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref><italic>A</italic>). However, because inhibition was only partial, we cannot rule out that at least some is generated via homolytic cleavage of the peroxide group via LOX-catalyzed hydroperoxidase activity. We also note that conversion of HETE-PE to KETE-PE is stimulated by ionophore activation of cells before lysis. The mechanism is unknown but could include calcium-dependent post-translational modification of PGDH.</p>
              <p>The precursor for KETE-PE generation, HETE-PE, is generated through glutathione peroxidase-dependent reduction of the primary LOX product, HpETE-PE. We previously found that neutrophils and platelets efficiently convert the majority of HpETE-PEs to the more stable HETE-PEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). In contrast, in monocytes/macrophages, up to 50% was not endogenously reduced, suggesting slower rates of glutathione peroxidase activity in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref>). The difficulty in analyzing HpETE-PEs due to their instability during extraction is a major problem when trying to accurately estimate the levels generated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9</xref>). In monocytes, HETE-PEs form by oxidation of intact phospholipid, whereas in platelets and neutrophils, generation involves rapid esterification of a newly synthesized free HETE into the phospholipid pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). We also note that the fate of esterified 12/15- or 15-LOX products in monocytic cells is different from that formed by 12- or 5-LOX in platelets or neutrophils. Specifically, 12- or 5-HETE-PEs are relatively long lived species with little metabolism occurring up to 3 h following generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). In activated monocytes/macrophages, HETE-, HpETE-, and KETE-PEs reach a maximal concentration for 30 min with levels returning close to base line by 3 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). Potential metabolic events accounting for this short half-life that were discounted included (i) conversion of oxidized PE to phosphatidylcholine or phosphatidylserine via headgroup interconversion, (ii) chain elongation of the sn2 acyl group by addition of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>), and (iii) hydrolysis of esterified eicosanoid derivatives by endogenous phospholipases (not shown). Levels of free 15-KETEs, which were acutely generated by human monocytes within 15 min, continued to increase over 3 h of activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). This indicates distinct metabolic pathways for free <italic>versus</italic> esterified KETEs in monocytes.</p>
              <p>Recent studies have indicated an important role for electrophilic free acid lipids in mediating anti-inflammatory signaling through the formation of Michael adducts with proteins via histidine or cysteine. Activation of transcription factors, including PPARγ and Nrf2, by lipids such as 15-deoxyprostaglandin J<sub>2</sub>, nitrolipids, and carbonyl-containing short and long chain species has been extensively characterized and is proposed to be an important part of the cell response to oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). KETE-PEs contain an α,β-unsaturated ketone in the sn2 fatty acid. Thus, a functionally significant reaction that KETE-PE species can undergo is Michael addition with cellular nucleophiles such as the thiol of GSH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>) or protein cysteine and histidine residues. Although 15-KETE-PE readily adducted to GSH <italic>in vitro</italic>, we were unable to increase the rate of reaction at physiological pH using glutathione <italic>S</italic>-transferase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref> and data not shown). Furthermore, in <italic>ex vivo</italic> test systems, it did not activate Nrf2 or PPARγ through direct ligand binding (data not shown). This suggests that the electrophilic centers may be inaccessible to cytosolic thiols or that phospholipid esterification sterically limits interaction of the electrophilic fatty acid with the multiple reactive thiols of Keap1 and the ligand binding domain Cys-285 of PPARγ. This does not exclude potential electrophilic reactions of KETE-PEs with additional protein targets, notably those of integral membrane or membrane-associated proteins.</p>
              <p>Both 15-HETE-PE and 15-KETE-PE dose-dependently activated PPARγ when added to intact cells; thus, they may act indirectly either through phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> hydrolysis to release free PPARγ ligands or through upstream modulation of PPARγ expression. Previous reports indicated that oxidized free acid lipids generated by LOXs can activate PPARγ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). The current thinking is that a number of lipids can act as low affinity physiological activators and that PPARγ steady state activity is a function of the total concentration of all ligands present at any one time in the cell. PPARγ can be activated by many fatty acids, eicosanoids, and other oxidized fatty acids with the more potent lipid stimuli appearing to act via electrophilic addition to the protein (<italic>e.g.</italic> nitrolipids and 15-deoxyprostaglandin J<sub>2</sub>) and synthetic agonists (<italic>e.g.</italic> rosiglitazone) giving the highest activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). In the case of LOX, several known activators could be present in monocytes, including free HETEs, hydroxyoctadecadienoic acids, and both HETE- and KETE-PEs as shown here. We note that the negative control (SAPE) did not activate PPARγ; thus, this was specific for the oxidized analogs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref><italic>A</italic>). Monocytes generate ∼2.2 ng of KETE-PEs/10<sup>6</sup> cells. As average monocyte volumes are 250 μm<sup>3</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>) and all the endogenously generated lipids remain cell-associated, we calculate that this equates to a cellular concentration of up to 11 m<sc>m</sc>, which is clearly considerably higher than that added to the cells. Several oxidized phospholipids, including 15-HETE-PE, can attenuate inflammatory signaling through inhibition of TLR4, a known inhibitor of PPARγ expression and activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). The mechanism involves binding to accessory proteins such as CD14 and LPS-binding protein. In this way, dampening down TLR4 may result in elevated PPARγ signaling as noted herein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>).</p>
              <p>In summary, this study identifies the cell and organ generation of novel families of esterified eicosanoids acutely generated by 12/15-LOXs. The study highlights a new class of electrophilic α,β-unsaturated ketone-containing phospholipids generated by immune cells that are expected to mediate adaptive anti-inflammatory signaling actions, including the activation of PPARγ-dependent gene expression.</p>
