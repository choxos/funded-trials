                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">We report the primary outcomes from a randomized clinical trial testing a novel culturally-adapted patient education intervention to increase engagement of Hispanic patients in depression treatment. The Depression Education Fotonovela (DEF), <italic>Secret Feelings</italic>, incorporates popular images, cultural norms, and vivid pictures embedded within a soap opera narrative to increase depression knowledge and dispel myths about treatment. We then assessed engagement in a integrated care treatment model in response to the education intervention and subsequent changes in depression symptoms in a large community-based clinic whose patient population is majority Hispanic.</p>

                  <title>Method</title>
                  <p id="Par2">The sample included 150 adult Hispanic patients with a confirmed diagnosis of depression who were randomly assigned to either: [1] integrated care + fotonovela; or [2] integrated care + standard education. Differences between treatment groups were examined as were changes in depression, anxiety, depression knowledge, and stigma scores over time and engagement in treatment.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">Results indicated that while depression scores significantly decreased over time for participants (F [2.811, 416.054] = 197.69, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, η<sup>2</sup> = .572), no differences between the two education groups were found (F [1, 148] = 0.70, <italic>p</italic> = .403, η<sup>2</sup> = .005). At 12-month follow-up, 101 patients (80.8%) reported a 50% of greater reduction in depression scores from baseline.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p id="Par4">We found little difference between the two education groups, suggesting that either may helpful for engaging Hispanic patients into care. Better tailoring of patient education, with the fotonovela or similarly adapted tools, will require more directly addressing the stigma associated with antidepressant medication.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par19">The prevalence of depression among the US Hispanic population is estimated to be 27% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Response to treatment is slow, and relapse rates are high [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Hispanic patients often voice fears about the addictive and harmful properties of antidepressants, worries about taking too many pills, and the stigma attached to taking medications, which may explain the early discontinuation of medication without consulting their provider [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Patient education has been associated with better management of chronic disease, increased patient engagement, and improved health outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], however, less is known about education to proactively address barriers to depression treatment for Hispanic patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par20">In Latin America, the <italic>fotonovela</italic> is a popular comic-book style pamphlet that portrays a dramatic story using photographs and dialogue bubbles and has become an effective tool for increasing knowledge about public health issues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The Depression Education Fotonovela (DEF), <italic>Secret Feelings</italic>, developed by Cabassa, Molina and Baron [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] differs from typical patient education materials by incorporating popular images, cultural norms and vivid pictures embedded within a soap opera narrative to increase depression knowledge and dispel myths about treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. <italic>Secret Feelings</italic> has demonstrated significant improvements in depression knowledge and reductions in stigma toward antidepressants and treatment in a community education setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], and preliminary success in a pilot study in a community-based, primary care setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par21">In the current study we report the primary outcomes from a randomized clinical trial aimed to test a novel culturally-adapted patient education intervention to increase engagement of Hispanics in depression treatment. Specifically, we hypothesized the <italic>fotonovela</italic> would increase knowledge of depression, decrease stigma, and increase engagement in treatment better than standard education (SE) among Hispanic primary care patients within an integrated care setting. Secondarily, we assessed changes in symptoms of depression and anxiety over time as a result of receiving the education intervention and subsequent treatment in an integrated care setting.</p>

                <p id="Par22">METRIC was a randomized controlled trial that took place in a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) in a large metropolitan area in Texas (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/">www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>: NCT02702596). The FQHC operates three locations that provide a full range of comprehensive primary and preventive services to a low-income, Hispanic population. A detailed description of the study setting and methods has been previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The study was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Texas at Arlington.</p>

                <p id="Par23">Study recruitment took place between February 2016 and February 2018. All adult primary care patients were universally screened for depression using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] as part of normal clinical practice. Patients who screened positive for depression (score greater than or equal to 5) were referred to the Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW) and invited to participate in the one-year study if they met inclusion criteria: confirmed diagnosis of depression, self-identified as Hispanic, and not currently receiving treatment for depression. The study adheres to CONSORT guidelines, see Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> for the study flow diagram. During the recruitment period, 181 patients were referred for possible enrollment. Of those, 21 did not meet eligibility criteria and 10 declined enrollment, leaving a final sample of 150 participants. After agreeing to participate in the study, participants signed an informed consent document and completed the remaining baseline measures in English or Spanish depending on patient preference.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>METRIC study flow diagram</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12888_2021_3641_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>
                <p id="Par24">After collection of baseline measures, participants were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups: (1) DEF + integrated care; or (2) SE + integrated care. Within 1 week of their enrollment, participants returned to the clinic to complete their educational intervention session (either DEF or SE) and study measures. Bilingual social work students were trained as research assistants (RA) to deliver one of the educational interventions. Research follow up visits were conducted at the following time points: 1 month post education visit, 6 months post enrollment, and 12 months post enrollment. Participants were compensated with a Walmart gift card after the completion of study measures at each visit.</p>

                  <p id="Par32">Three measures developed by Interian et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] were used to assess stigma towards depression treatment: Stigma Concerns about Mental Health Care (SCMHC), Social Distance Scale (SDS), and the Latino Scale for Antidepressant Stigma (LSAS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Previous psychometric research has shown support for the use of the measures among Spanish-speaking primary care patients in measuing unique constructs of stigma toward mental health and treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The SCMHC is a 3-item scale that assesses an individual’s anticipated stigma if they were to seek treatment for depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Possible scores on the measure range from 0 to 3, with higher scores indicating greater stigma. The Social Distance Scale (SDS) is a 6-item scale that measures social distance desirability from someone with a history of depression treatment. Total scores range from 0 to 12, with lower scores indicating greater desired social distance (i.e., greater stigma). Finally, the LSAS is a 7-item scale that assesses perceived stigma towards the use of antidepressant medication. Possible scores for the scale range from 0 to 14, with higher scores indicating greater stigma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p>

                <title>Statistical analyses</title>
                <p id="Par34">Bivariate statistical analyses were used to examine both differences between intervention groups (i.e., SE and DEF) and those completing treatment compared to those dropping out of the study before completing the 12-month follow-up. These tests included <italic>t</italic>-tests and 𝜒2 analyses, depending on the measure with effect size metrics of Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> or Cramer’s <italic>V</italic>, respectively. An intention-to-treat approach using a last-observation-carried-forward method was used to analyze outcome data whereby the last available measurement for all participants was then used for all time points through the 12-month final follow-up. Missing data was handled using this carry-forward method. Repeated-measures ANOVA model was used to examine both within-subjects (i.e., over time) and between-subjects (i.e., between intervention groups) differences in depression, anxiety, depression knowledge, and stigma scores over four or five time points, depending on the measure. Partial eta-squared (η<sup>2</sup>) scores were used as metrics of effect size.</p>
                <p id="Par35">The study was adequately powered. A total of 150 participants were randomly assigned to the treatment and control groups. We estimated that 60 participants were required in each of the intervention and control groups with five measurement points to have an 80% chance, with a 5% significance level, of detecting an effect size of <italic>d</italic> = .258 between the two groups, a lower effect than reported in other studies of the fotonovela [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. This assumed sample size was greater than the obtained sample at 12-month follow-up.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par46">In this trial of a unique, culturally adapted patient education tool designed to increase knowledge of depression, decrease stigma, and increase engagement of Hispanic patients in treatment, we found no difference in patients who received the <italic>fotonovela</italic> intervention compared to patients who received usual patient education, with both groups demonstrating greater knowledge of depression across all timepoints. We also found no differences in engagement in treatment or clinical outcomes between groups after the education intervention. In fact, treatment in an integrated care model led to significant improvement in depression and anxiety symptoms, regardless of education group during a one-year intervention period among a mostly female, Spanish-speaking sample of Hispanic patients in a large community-based clinic.</p>
              <p id="Par47">The characteristics of the sample were essentially uniform across the two education intervention groups, including their severity of depression, however, the <italic>fotonovela</italic> group had greater baseline depression knowledge prior to receiving any education intervention. This imbalance among the groups subsequently held across all timepoints and was greatest immediately after the delivery of the educational intervention. Depression knowledge increased over time in both groups, suggesting a surge in knowledge after education which was sustained regardless of the intervention group .</p>
              <p id="Par48">In the current sample, stigma towards medication did not improve over time and, in fact, was greater among the recipients of the <italic>fotonovela</italic> but, interestingly, did not act as a deterrent to engaging in treatment. Virtually the entire patient sample engaged in treatment of some kind, with more than half receiving a combination of medication and counseling. Increased stigma toward antidepressant use may reflect knowledge gained via the <italic>fotnovela</italic> which reinforced fears about side effects and stigmatizing attitudes toward medication in general, and are similar to findings from our pilot feasability study of the <italic>fotonovela</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. While these attitudes are not unique among Hispanic patients receiving treatment who frequently articulate fear of being stigmatized and deep concerns about depression medication being addictive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], we conclude the <italic>fotonovela</italic>, <italic>Secret Feelings</italic>, likely requires further tailoring to better address known side effects of antidepressants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p>

                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p id="Par49">The current study’s findings are limited by the study design and methodology as well as the relatively small, homogenous sample. It is possible that the robust nature of both education interventions led to no significant differences between groups. However, the structure of a clinical trial required comparison to an alternative treatment and we chose an enhanced treatment as usual condition. As with every randomized clinical trial, the process of randomization may have not produced equivalent groups, as evidenced by the <italic>Fotonovela</italic> group having higher DKM scores on baseline, which may have extended to other participant factors not measured in the current study. Additionally, the LCSW not being blinded to the intervention condition of participants as well as the use of non-blinded assessors may have led to additional threats to internal validity such as measurement bias or diffusion effects. Finally, study participants were predominantly female and Spanish speaking, suggesting results may not be generalizable to male and English-speaking Hispanic populations.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p id="Par50">Contrary to our study hypothesis, we found little difference between the two education conditions, a culturally adapted tool and standardized depression education. Racial and ethnic minorities continue to experience persistent gaps in access to quality depression care, and those disparities in receipt of treatment are on the rise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Since stigma towards medication did not improve over time and, in fact, was greater among the recipients of the <italic>fotonovela,</italic> further tailoring of patient education may require more directly addressing patient level barriers which pose considerable challenges to treatment, often lead to subtherapeutic doses of medication, poor treatment adherence, and quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p>
