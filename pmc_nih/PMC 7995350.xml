                  <title>Purpose</title>
                  <p>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of assessing quantitative longitudinal fluid dynamics and total retinal fluid indices (TRFIs) with higher-order optical coherence tomography (OCT) for neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD).</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>A post hoc image analysis study was performed using the phase II OSPREY clinical trial comparing brolucizumab and aflibercept in nAMD. Higher-order OCT analysis using a machine learning−enabled fluid feature extraction platform was used to segment intraretinal fluid (IRF) and subretinal fluid (SRF) volumetric components. TRFI, the proportion of fluid volume against total retinal volume, was calculated. Longitudinal fluid metrics were evaluated for the following groups: all subjects (i.e. treatment agnostic), brolucizumab, and aflibercept.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Mean IRF and SRF volumes were significantly reduced from baseline at each timepoint for all groups. Fluid feature extraction allowed high-resolution assessment of quantitative fluid burden. A greater proportion of brolucizumab participants achieved true zero and minimal fluid (total fluid volume between 0.0001 and 0.001mm<sup>3</sup>) versus aflibercept participants at week 40. True zero fluid during q12 brolucizumab dosing was achieved in 36.6% to 38.5%, similar to the 25.6% to 38.5% during the corresponding q8 aflibercept cycles. TRFI was significantly reduced from baseline in all groups.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>Higher-order OCT analysis demonstrates the feasibility of fluid feature extraction and longitudinal volumetric fluid burden and TRFI characterization in nAMD, supporting a unique opportunity for fluid burden assessment and the impact on outcomes.</p>

                  <title>Translational Relevance</title>
                  <p>Detection and characterization of disease activity is vital for optimal treatment of nAMD. Longitudinal assessment of fluid dynamics and the TRFI provide important proof of concept for future automated tools in characterizing disease activity.</p>

              <p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first published report that provides a quantitative and longitudinal analysis of retinal fluid volumes and the TRFI in an nAMD clinical trial data set using novel higher-order OCT assessment. This higher-order OCT post hoc exploratory analysis successfully demonstrated the reduction in fluid volumes in all treatment groups and across dosing strategies. This platform also enabled enhanced-level characterization of fluid burden, including true zero and anatomically minimal fluid. In addition, using the potentially novel OCT biomarker TRFI, this analysis was able to estimate the proportion of IRF and SRF volume against total retinal volume. The assessment of the OSPREY study demonstrated a significant reduction in fluid volume during the matched q8 dosing phase and a similar effect between brolucizumab q12 and aflibercept q8 dosing. The higher-order OCT analysis of the OSPREY data set is consistent with the previously published OSPREY anatomic data.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> In addition, the analysis demonstrated that with two nonindividualized consecutive q12 dosing cycles in the brolucizumab group, the observed overall reduction in fluid volume from baseline was maintained, supporting the HAWK and HARRIER phase III study results, which demonstrated the anatomic effect of brolucizumab.<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref></p>
              <p>In many clinical trials, evidence of disease activity on OCT has been identified as the presence of IRF, SRF, and/or sub-RPE fluid.<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref><sup>–</sup><xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> Clinically, retinal fluid is considered a key parameter used to measure disease activity and inform treatment decisions in nAMD.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> It has been shown that patients with nAMD who have a dry retina following treatment tend to maintain visual acuity,<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> whereas vision loss is more likely to occur with new onset of fluid.<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> The current quantitative volumetric analysis using higher-order OCT demonstrated capabilities for variable volumetric thresholds, which may have implications for interval tolerance and outcomes. In this analysis, more participants had true zero fluid in the brolucizumab q8 group compared to the aflibercept q8 group (59.0% versus 25.6%) at week 40, with a corresponding greater reduction in fluid percentage from baseline in the brolucizumab group, consistent with the anatomic data reported by Dugel and colleagues.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> In addition, in the OSPREY phase II study, all brolucizumab-treated participants were extended to q12 dosing.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> Even with a nonindividualized q12 extension, there was a ≥ 93% reduction in total fluid (IRF and SRF combined), and &gt; 36% of brolucizumab-treated participants had true zero fluid at the end of each q12 cycle.</p>
              <p>Beyond fluid volumes, the RFI is a novel biomarker that has recently been used in a similar analysis of the VISTA study in diabetic macular edema.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> In the current analysis of nAMD, both IRF and SRF were taken into consideration. TRFI is a potentially important OCT biomarker because it takes into account the retinal tissue and is the percentage of space from the RPE to the internal limiting membrane made up of SRF or IRF. Following one treatment of brolucizumab or aflibercept, the TRFI at week 4 in the central subfield decreased dramatically from 13.93% at baseline to 1.62% and from 11.19% to 3.98%, respectively. Use of TRFI is conceptually attractive as it provides contextual information regarding the relative proportion of fluid to retinal tissue. This may represent an important biomechanical feature assessment that is an early marker of underlying atrophy and retinal tissue reserve. Indeed, this novel OCT biomarker needs further exploration as a biomarker for response and outcomes in a larger data set.</p>
              <p>The relationship between functional and anatomical parameters is of interest. Many clinical studies have shown that a zero tolerance to fluid is associated with improved visual outcomes; however, other studies have suggested a difference between IRF and SRF factors on final visual acuity.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref><sup>–</sup><xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> The current post hoc analysis of the OSPREY study demonstrated a negative correlation between IRF volume and BCVA at baseline, consistent with the notion that the presence of IRF may be a major factor for visual acuity. Interestingly, following treatment, the correlation of IRF volume and SRF volume with BCVA was no longer significant. Many eyes had dramatic reductions in fluid metrics and this likely contributed to the loss of correlation given the wide variability in vision. Examining thresholds for fluid volumes and impact on visual acuity should be considered for future studies. As expected, there was a correlation between CST and fluid volumes at baseline and various timepoints. However, the relationship was fairly weak, suggesting that there is a disconnect between CST and volumetric fluid parameters. Further research is needed to explore whether volumetric fluid parameters may be a more sensitive marker of disease activity.</p>
              <p>Several other approaches to automated fluid segmentation have been described, such as custom software, graph-search–based assessment, supervised learning/dimension reduction, and machine learning enhancements.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref><sup>–</sup><xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> To date, these tools have remained primarily for research. Having a more efficient and precise way to quantify and characterize fluid may facilitate treatment optimization. In this study, higher-order OCT assessment with an automated machine learning−augmented analysis platform for SD-OCT scans provides quantification of IRF and SRF. This has the potential to provide insights into disease characteristics and imaging biomarkers, which may be helpful in predicting optimal response to treatment and identifying the best dosing regimens.</p>
              <p>There are important limitations of the current analysis that should be acknowledged. The post hoc exploratory nature of this analysis and the small sample size used to demonstrate statistical significance for the higher-order OCT assessment in quantifying fluid volume are the main limitations, although the primary focus was the feasibility of fluid feature assessment. Conducting similar analyses on a larger data set in the future should provide further validation of the clinical relevance of these features. These opportunities are currently being explored. However, this data set represents an important proof of concept for preliminary longitudinal analysis of the presence of fluid at numerous timepoints, as it allows for fluid volume quantification in response to treatment in a prospective, randomized nAMD clinical trial. The analysis provides additional information to supplement the fluid segmentation literature as well as insights into the treatment of nAMD with anti-VEGF agents.</p>
              <p>The higher-order OCT post hoc exploratory analysis successfully demonstrates the feasibility of longitudinal volumetric fluid quantification and TRFI characterization in nAMD. Utilizing an emerging technology, fluid features were successfully extracted and analyzed for resolution extent and tempo. This study supports the clinical trial evidence demonstrating that brolucizumab dramatically reduces fluid in the retina with the potential to extend to a q12 dosing interval. Future studies will focus on further exploration of fluid compartment thresholds for functional outcomes, volatility of quantitative exudative metrics, and larger data sets to explore outcomes and implications for these assessments.</p>
