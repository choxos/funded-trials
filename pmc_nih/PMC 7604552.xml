              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic immune-mediated disease with large heterogeneity in clinical presentation and course. The unpredictable course of MS on an individual level complicates treatment choicesâin particular, deciding whether to escalate therapy over time or implement early aggressive induction therapy. For this reason, there is a clinical need for biomarkers that are able to identify underlying disease severity and predict long-term outcomes.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-1352458519885613" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bibr2-1352458519885613" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p>

                  <p>Continuous variables were described by mean and standard deviation, except NfL that is described by median and interquartile ranges; categorical variables by counts and percentages. Correlations between longitudinal NfL concentrations and their associations with clinical and radiological assessments were calculated using Spearmanâs rank correlation coefficients and analysis of variance (<italic>F</italic> test). The association of NfL concentration (separated into tertiles by NfL concentration) with cumulative incidence of progression to an EDSS score of 6.0 was conducted using Fisherâs exact test and Wald chi-square test based on Firthâs penalized univariate logistic regression. To explore the potential additive value of NfL concentration and brain atrophy, patients with both NfL concentrations and brain atrophy data were divided into four groups based on their CSF or serum NfL and BPF 2-year change values (below or above median for both serum NfL and BPF change). Mean NfL concentrations (mean of two time points when both measurements were available, and single value when only one measurement was available) were used for stratification to increase the number of measurements. Analyses were adjusted for age, and the results were similar between the analyses with and without adjustment for age. Therefore, we presented results not adjusted for age. All analyses were performed using R statistical software (R Foundation for Statistical Computing) and SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc.) on an HP-UX platform (Hewlett Packard). GraphPad Prism 7 software (GraphPad Software, Inc.) was used for graphical representation.</p>

              <p>Here we provide evidence in a large cohort of RRMS patients that CSF and serum NfL concentrations are associated with long-term clinical and MRI outcomes. The design of the MSCRG study, available data from the long-term follow-up studies, and well-preserved samples allowed the evaluation of CSF and serum NfL concentration in well-characterized patients with long-term clinical and radiological data. Our results also show that NfL can be assessed in CSF and serum samples stored for more than 20âyears, in line with previous experience on the stability of this protein.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-1352458519885613" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="bibr21-1352458519885613" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Both CSF and serum NfL concentrations were associated with short- and long-term clinical disability and brain atrophy. At baseline and after 2âyears of follow-up, CSF NfL concentrations correlated with measures of MRI disease activity (Gd+ lesions), and MS disease burden (T2 lesion volume), corroborating earlier findings.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-1352458519885613" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="bibr22-1352458519885613" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="bibr23-1352458519885613" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr24-1352458519885613" ref-type="bibr"/>â<xref rid="bibr25-1352458519885613" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> The value of CSF and serum NfL measurements to predicting longer-term prognosis was comparable to MRI predictors such as early brain atrophy and breakthrough disease activity.<sup><xref rid="bibr16-1352458519885613" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="bibr17-1352458519885613" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Our findings add to earlier studies that investigated the prognostic value of CSF NfL in smaller cohorts. In a study of 95 patients with MS over 14âyears of follow-up, higher CSF NfL concentration was associated with faster conversion to secondary progressive MS.<sup><xref rid="bibr26-1352458519885613" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="bibr27-1352458519885613" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> In a study of 41 patients with clinically isolated syndrome or RRMS, clinical and MRI disease activity were best predicted by CSF NfL concentration after 2âyears of follow-up.<sup><xref rid="bibr28-1352458519885613" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> Recently, a study by Chitnis et al.<sup><xref rid="bibr29-1352458519885613" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> based on the data from 122 patients reported an association of averaged serum NfL concentrations during the first few years after clinical onset of MS with 10-year MRI brain lesion load and atrophy. To our knowledge, ours is the first study that demonstrates associations of serum NfL with not only long-term brain atrophy but also with other clinically meaningful long-term outcomes in MS, such as EDSS. In addition, this study demonstrated the prognostic ability of a single NfL measurement.</p>
              <p>Correlations between CSF NfL concentration and measures of disease activity and progression were more robust in patients treated with IFNÎ²-1a than placebo. We hypothesize that the presence of disease activity on treatment, and consequent elevation in NfL levels, would be more meaningful than on placebo as demonstrated in the previous publication in the same cohort.<sup><xref rid="bibr17-1352458519885613" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> These data suggest that increased serum NfL levels in patients receiving disease-modifying therapies could indicate suboptimal response to therapy and the potential need of a therapy change.</p>
              <p>In this study, combining NfL concentrations with short-term brain atrophy produced a more robust prediction for long-term progression of EDSS score than NfL concentrations alone. This finding suggests that serum NfL concentrations might complement MRI measurements, such as brain atrophy rates, in predicting long-term outcome. Further studies using prospective data in a validation cohort could confirm the improved predictability of such a combined model.</p>
              <p>The invasive nature of lumbar punctures limits the value of CSF NfL in routine clinical settings. Previous studies have demonstrated associations between serum and CSF NfL concentrations, as well as serum NfL association with clinical and radiological measures of disease activity in RRMS.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-1352458519885613" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="bibr12-1352458519885613" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> In this study, serum NfL at Year 3 correlated with brain atrophy and EDSS change over 8âyears and was associated with reaching EDSS 6.0 by Year 8. The inconsistency in the strength of these associations in samples derived at different time points likely reflects the heterogeneity in the natural history of the patients recruited and the relatively small number of subjects in each analysis. For example, patients are likely to have changed treatments over the follow-up period, which may have altered their longer-term outcomes. Future work in prospective cohorts should correct for factors that may influence natural disease course such as treatment changes.</p>
              <p>Limitations of this study include its retrospective design, the variable number of samples available at various time points, availability of serum samples at Year 3 and Year 4 only, and the lack of complete follow-up at 8 and 15âyears.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>The prognosis of individual patients with MS is a challenge. Despite decades of research, there are no accurate quantitative metrics to predict long-term outcome in patients with MS. Notably, brain atrophy measures have been shown to be predictive in patient populations, but to date, these metrics have not been widely applied in the clinical practice setting.<sup><xref rid="bibr16-1352458519885613" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="bibr17-1352458519885613" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> In addition, reliable prognostic body fluid biomarkers, especially blood-based ones, are lacking.<sup><xref rid="bibr30-1352458519885613" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> This inability to predict disease course is problematic because neurologists now have a wide range of treatment options, ranging from less effective but very safe treatments to higher-efficacy drugs with potentially serious side effects. Choosing the most appropriate treatment for individual patients would be informed by accurate quantitative prognostic markers that could be used early in the disease, when treatment is likely most effective. Of great importance is establishing a comprehensive database of normative NfL values to generate age-related reference values and to quantify the impact of comorbidities on NfL as a prerequisite to establish sNfL as a standard biomarker in clinical practice. Furthermore, commutability of values across the different assay protocols and platforms needs to be established. Based on results from this study, NfL appears to be an attractive candidate biomarker for disease severity stratification in MS, and warrants further evaluation in larger well-characterized cohorts of patients.</p>
