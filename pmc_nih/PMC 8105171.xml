                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">GU√çA development occurred in five overlapping phases: formative research, content development, stakeholder/community member input, user interface design, and web application development. Development was informed by formative qualitative research involving parents (<italic>N</italic>‚Äâ=‚Äâ22) whose children underwent genomic testing. Participants enrolled in the NYCKidSeq pilot study (<italic>N</italic>‚Äâ=‚Äâ18) completed structured feedback interviews post‚Äìresult disclosure using GU√çA. Genetic specialists, researchers, patients, and community stakeholders provided their perspectives on GU√çA‚Äôs design to ensure technical, cultural, and literacy appropriateness.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">NYCKidSeq participants responded positively to the use of GU√çA to deliver their children‚Äôs results. All participants (<italic>N</italic>‚Äâ=‚Äâ10) with previous experience with genetic testing felt GU√çA improved result disclosure, and 17 (94%) participants said the content was clear.</p>

                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p id="Par4">GU√çA communicates complex genomic information in an understandable and personalized manner. Initial piloting demonstrated GU√çA‚Äôs utility for families enrolled in the¬†NYCKidSeq pilot study. Findings from the NYCKidSeq clinical trial will provide insight into GU√çA‚Äôs effectiveness in communicating results among diverse, multilingual populations.</p>

              <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
              <p id="Par5">Rapid technological advancements in genomic sequencing (GS) in the past two decades have escalated the use of genomic data for diagnosing, predicting, and preventing disease, resulting in an increasing integration of genomic information in clinical decision-making. The shifting landscape of genetic testing has had a substantial impact on the practice of genetic counseling. Results from GS can reside along a spectrum of pathogenicity, from benign to ambiguous to pathogenic, and interpretation of results can change over time as evidence for pathogenicity accumulates. There is also the possibility of identifying findings unrelated to the primary purpose of the testing, and findings that may have peripheral impact upon family members, who are likely to have the limited genetics expertise of the general population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> For all these reasons, genomic information is challenging to convey effectively. Despite this, GS is increasingly offered in a diversity of clinical settings, contributing to a greater demand for genomic medicine services across a variety of health-care specialties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> With the expansion of GS, genetic counselors (GCs) are challenged to scale services to meet the needs of a wide array of providers, patients, and their families.</p>
              <p id="Par6">Innovations in other technologies, including smartphones, artificial intelligence, and digital communication, are increasingly playing an important role in health systems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> While genomic technology is driving the proliferation of inexpensive and accessible genetic tests, communication technology has also had a substantial impact on the practice of genetic counseling. Some technological solutions aim to bridge the barrier of access to counseling services. These include telehealth platforms, decision support tools, and genetic counseling aids such as educational videos and interactive web-based learning.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> Artificial intelligence solutions like chatbots are emerging as tools to help patients navigate genetic testing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> There are also self-service platforms designed for consumers available through commercial laboratory websites that include self-guided educational modules, results delivery, and the option to speak with a GC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> Other models like My46, a web-based tool that allows individuals to manage their genetic results, and Genomics ADvISER, an online, interactive decision aid to help patients in selecting secondary findings, have been born out of research initiatives to facilitate education and support¬†patients outside of clinic walls.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup></p>
              <p id="Par7">While these digital¬†tools may help to improve access by streamlining the genetic counseling workflow, most of the patient-facing educational content is designed to address patients‚Äô pretest educational needs or tailored to consumer-driven genetic testing. Current technological¬†solutions are not designed to enhance the delivery of genomic results in routine clinical care, nor are they designed to increase understanding of the results and associated medical recommendations. Furthermore, there is a paucity of research on alternative delivery models and technological solutions for delivering genomic medicine and counseling services in diverse populations. Large scale, national research programs, such as the All of Us Research Program,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> the eMERGE Network,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> and the Clinical Sequencing Evidence-Generating Research (CSER) consortium,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> are exploring methods for implementing genomic medicine across diverse populations and settings. Outcomes from these studies will help to inform best practices for delivering genomic medicine services.</p>
              <p id="Par8">We created the Genomic Understanding, Information and Awareness (GU√çA, Spanish for ‚Äúguide‚Äù) application, a novel digital platform designed to facilitate the delivery of GS results and related clinical information to participants and families of diverse backgrounds enrolled in the NYCKidSeq Project. GU√çA allows GCs to walk patients through their genomic test results in a personalized, highly visual, and narrative manner. GU√çA was developed based on the perspectives and input of providers, patients, and community stakeholders as part of the NYCKidSeq Project. NYCKidSeq is jointly funded by the National Human Genome Research Institute and the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities, and is one of seven national clinical sites that are part of the CSER consortium. The development of GU√çA occurred in five overlapping phases, including a formative study (phase 1), assembly of an expert working group and content development (phase 2), stakeholder and community member input (phase 3), design of the user interface (phase 4), and web application development (phase 5) (Fig.¬†<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). GU√çA was then piloted with 18 participants enrolled in the NYCKidSeq pilot phase.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>GU√çA development timeline.</title><p>GU√çA development occurred in five overlapping phases over a 16-month period.

                  <p id="Par9">We recruited parents, 20 mothers and 2 mother‚Äìfather¬†dyads, of 22 index children who had undergone exome sequencing, targeted gene sequencing, or microarray clinical genetic testing within the previous 12 months to participate in an in-depth interview. Participants were recruited at two major health systems in New York City: Mount Sinai Health System and Montefiore Medical Center. We used a stratified purposive sampling approach to recruit a diverse group of participants: five Black/African American (AA), ten Hispanic/Latinx (H/L), five White/European American (EA), and two who self-reported as more than one race or ethnicity (MR). We also stratified the sample to ensure representation of different testing results: ten negative, seven uncertain, and five positive results.</p>

                  <title>Analysis</title>
                  <p id="Par11">Analysis was conducted by a multidisciplinary team including GCs, a medical geneticist, and qualitative methods experts. First, individuals conducted case-based analyses to identify ‚Äúrepeating ideas‚Äù as a first step in codebook development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> Then, team members independently applied the codebook to an interview to identify areas of (dis)agreement across coders, to develop code definitions and clarify labeling of emergent themes. Groups of two coders (1 GC‚Äâ+‚Äâ1 non-GC) then applied the codebook to a single interview until consensus was achieved on current and new code applications. Using grounded theory‚Äôs constant comparative method,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> this process was repeated until all interviews were coded by the 2-person groups. Full-team meetings were held to resolve issues and to discuss higher order theme development across the entire data set.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> Findings were communicated to the Expert Working Group and the Genomics Community Board to inform GU√çA content development.</p>

                <title>Expert Working Group</title>
                <p id="Par12">The¬†Expert Working Group (EWG) was formed with transdisciplinary expertise in the development of educational and medical genetics content. The group included four GCs, three medical geneticists, a pediatric cardiologist, a population geneticist, and a sociologist. The EWG led the development of the overall design of GU√çA and the development of the content.</p>

                <p id="Par13">Members of the GU√çA EWG met regularly with the Mount Sinai Genomics Community Board (GCB). The GCB is made up of community leaders, patients, and clinicians predominantly from Harlem and the Bronx who self-report as Black, African, African American, Afro-Latinx, or Afro-Caribbean.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> The GCB contributed to the conceptual design of GU√çA, and¬†reviewed development plans, prototypes, and final versions of visuals and text throughout the development process.</p>

              <sec id="Sec9">
                <title>User interface and content design of GU√çA</title>
                <p id="Par14">The EWG developed the design of the interface to ensure the application encompassed relevant genetic counseling components. The EWG consulted with experts in data visualization and user interface (UI) design to draft the design specifications that included personalization (displaying name and preferred gender pronoun); text, illustrations, and hyperlinks on web pages; ability to display designated pages, data points, and illustrations based upon result type; tiered complexity of information; easy navigation; bilingual capability; option to export as a PDF and print full content; and compatibility for desktop and tablet. Using Zeplin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> collaborative design software, the EWG and a UI designer collaborated to produce a final set of wireframes (page schematics) and visual designs, which were used as the basis for the personalized result templates.</p>
                <p id="Par15">A bilingual version of each wireframe was generated that displayed both English (small font) and Spanish text (large font). The only text not translated to Spanish was the navigation button, as this was not a priority for the research study. We aimed to ensure that the Spanish text was understandable to patients who speak different dialects of Spanish, therefore, the translation team included individuals representing five Spanish dialects: Spanish, Mexican, Cuban, Dominican, and Puerto Rican. Discrepancies in the translated text were discussed and resolved.</p>

                <title>Development of the GU√çA web portal</title>
                <p id="Par16">The EWG, software development team, and UI designer developed a specification for GU√çA development, and established the display logic and the data flow. The back-end database contains a web form through which the GC inputs patient specific information to populate the patient-facing front-end application. The database includes a library of template text including over 5,000 variables and approximately 50 illustrations that are displayed based on patient-specific results. A team of software engineers built the application over a 3-month period, followed by a 4-week user¬†acceptance testing period, during which the EWG performed extensive UI testing to evaluate UI interactions before the platform went live.</p>

                  <p id="Par18">Prior to the results disclosure session, GCs built a participant‚Äôs case in GU√çA by inputting case details, such as the child‚Äôs genomic test results, condition-specific details, recommendations for medical management, and patient resources. Case details were input as both structured and free text. Structured text can be displayed in both English and Spanish. Spanish free text was generated using Google Translate, and Spanish-speaking staff reviewed the translations for accuracy. GCs used GU√çA via an iPad during the in-person results disclosure session. Families did not have access to GU√çA outside of the counseling session. Families were provided with a PDF printout of the full GU√çA content in addition to the laboratory report. Feedback was solicited from four GCs regarding their experience using GU√çA during the pilot phase.</p>

                  <p id="Par19">We developed a brief, structured feedback guide to explore parent-participants‚Äô reactions to GU√çA. The guide contained 14 questions designed to capture general and specific reactions to GU√çA content and design elements. Research coordinators interviewed parents in English or Spanish directly following disclosure of their child‚Äôs genomic results using GU√çA. Feedback interviews were audio-recorded and parent-participants were provided with a $40 gift card. A separate research coordinator reviewed the audio recordings and extracted structured and narrative details of the parent-participants‚Äô responses. These responses were reviewed for themes relating to the GU√çA interface, including layout, language, images, health literacy, and navigation.</p>

                <p id="Par21">One core theme is that parents often feel overwhelmed by the amount of information and details provided during a result disclosure session. There is considerable variability in what information parents want about genetics, genetic testing, and the results, and in how much depth. To accommodate a variety of educational preferences, we developed GU√çA to present information in increasing levels of complexity and on different web pages, so that patients can modulate how many and in which order they access pages. For instance, for positive results, the overall, ‚Äúbig picture‚Äù details of the result are presented on the top page, and further genetic and condition details are displayed on separate tabs (Supplementary Fig.¬†<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>; Supplemental Table¬†<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).</p>
                <p id="Par22">Parents‚Äô primary concern was improving health outcomes for their child. Consequently, parents were more interested in understanding how genetic results affected their child‚Äôs care than understanding technical details. We therefore designed GU√çA to prominently display follow-up care recommendations on the Next Steps page. Parents expressed confusion about the labels of genetic test results. For example, negative results were sometimes described as ‚Äúnormal‚Äù and were confused with the child‚Äôs symptoms. GU√çA clearly defines the result category (positive, uncertain, negative) on both the Learn about Genome Sequencing page and the Result Summary page.</p>
                <p id="Par23">Another theme identified was that parents who received uncertain results adapted to the uncertainty when the provider explained that genomic medicine is a developing science and knowledge of the genetic cause of disease will increase over time. We included language addressing this in GU√çA. Additionally, drawing complex concepts and showing illustrations to parents were appreciated. Parents expressed the desire to take home drawings made by a provider to revisit with family members. Thus, illustrations are integrated throughout the application, including on the Education pages, the Genetic Results pages, and the Inheritance pages.</p>

                <title>Phase 2: content development</title>
                <p id="Par24">The EWG first identified discrete components of a typical pediatric genetic counseling result disclosure session, as shown in the schema in Supplementary Fig.¬†<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>. GU√çA addresses the following components: genetic education, primary (related to¬†the primary indication for testing) and secondary (unrelated to the primary indication for testing) results disclosure, clinical implications, inheritance and family implications, and resources. Contracting and psychosocial counseling are addressed through the interpersonal interaction between the counselor and the patient/family.</p>
                <p id="Par25">To facilitate readability and comprehension, all text was written in the active voice and at the lowest possible reading level. We calculated the reading grade level by averaging the Flesch‚ÄìKincaid grade level of four randomly identified cases representing the three primary results categories (positive, negative, and, uncertain) and a positive secondary finding result. While our goal reading level was fifth grade, as recommended by the Joint Commission for patient education materials,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> the inclusion of genetic terminology meant that we could only decrease the reading level to an average ninth grade level.</p>

                <title>Phase 3: stakeholder and community member input</title>
                <p id="Par26">Throughout the development of GU√çA, we met with the GCB to discuss how a web-based application could be enhanced for the provision of genetic counseling for historically underserved populations, and to receive input on the content and design. Examples of specific implications for the application include using illustrations inspired by biology textbooks to help explain complex concepts, ensuring images were culturally appropriate and resonated with the target audience, defining results categories clearly, simplifying pages by removing superfluous text, and including referrals to appropriate support services (see Supplemental Table¬†<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref> for GCB feedback).</p>

                <title>Phase 4‚Äì5: web application design and development</title>
                <p id="Par27">We designed GU√çA to have a user-friendly interface with a visual design that is meant to make information communicated during the result disclosure easier to understand. GU√çA enables GCs to guide patients through the distinct components of a traditional result disclosure session while catering to patients‚Äô diverse learning styles. Using GU√çA can be a counselor- or patient-driven experience and its modular design permits users to control the order in which information is accessed. If desired, the user can follow a proposed linear flow by using the navigation arrows at the bottom of each page, or they can navigate to different pages of the application from the Home page or the navigation panel. The user can toggle between Spanish/English or English only text by clicking the language button. Illustrations accompanied by plain language text are incorporated throughout the application to convey key concepts, such as inheritance patterns, and demonstrate aspects specific to the patient‚Äôs condition, such as affected organ systems.</p>
                <p id="Par28">The GU√çA sitemap (Supplementary Fig.¬†<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) displays the structure of the application, which consists of 9 distinct pages with subtabs to access educational modules, primary and secondary results, inheritance information, and resource links. A high-level summary page provides key takeaways for the patient including results, next steps, and links to additional resources. Figure¬†<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> shows the GU√çA Home page (a)¬†in English, and the Result Summary page (b) and Family page (c) in Spanish/English for a positive genetic result. The Condition and Genetic Details subtabs on the Result Summary page are personalized for the patient and populated with relevant information garnered from the genetic test report and from the GC‚Äôs research into the patient‚Äôs genetic condition. At the end of the counseling session, the entire GU√çA experience or individual pages can be converted to a PDF file format for the patient‚Äôs use outside of the session.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>Images of the GU√çA digital platform.</title><p>Images show the GU√çA Home page displayed in English only (<bold>a</bold>), the Result Summary page for a positive result displayed in Spanish/English (<bold>b</bold>), and the Family page for a positive result displayed in Spanish/English (<bold>c</bold>).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41436_2020_1063_Fig2_HTML" id="d32e1020"/></fig></p>

                <p id="Par30">During the result disclosure session, GU√çA was used by both the parent-participant and counselor to guide the delivery of information. After the result (positive, negative, or uncertain) was disclosed by the GC, parent-participants were asked which component they would like to focus on next. Of the 18 feedback participants, ten sessions were reported as GC-driven, seven as both GC- and parent-driven, and one was not indicated.

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p id="Par34">We describe the design, development process, and evaluation of GU√çA, a novel web-based platform for communicating GS results. Digital health tools like GU√çA have the potential to reduce disparities in access to genomic services by broadening the reach of genetics specialists in diverse and underserved settings and simplifying genomic medicine delivery for nongenetics providers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> GU√çA allows highly technical information to be communicated in an understandable, personalized, and digestible manner. It enables patients to actively engage with their results and control the speed and depth of information delivery. Participants in the NYCKidSeq pilot phase responded positively to the use of GU√çA in their result disclosure session, and all parents with prior genetic testing experience expressed that receiving genomic results with GU√çA was superior. These findings provide preliminary evidence of families‚Äô satisfaction with the integration of this novel application into genetic counseling. The utility of GU√çA to improve parental outcomes will be thoroughly investigated through the NYCKidSeq clinical trial where participants across a variety of clinical settings will be randomized to genetic counseling using GU√çA versus traditional genetic counseling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup></p>
              <p id="Par35">The clinical utility of genomic information is inherently linked to understanding of results and adherence to medical recommendations. Traditionally, genetic specialists communicate findings from genetic testing; however, there is a relative scarcity of medical geneticists and GCs in the United States and worldwide.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> Proposed methods to scale genomic medicine services include training additional genetics professionals and training nongenetics professionals in genomic communication.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> Technological solutions can also be leveraged to increase access to genomic medicine services.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> Research in this space has explored different modalities for scaling genetic counseling services, such as using web-based decisional aids and educational modules for patients to review prior to their appointment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> These efforts have primarily focused on pretest genetic counseling, likely due to the amount of education typically occurring during the initial appointment, and are not designed to improve patient understanding of their genetic results. Findings from this preliminary evaluation suggest that GU√çA may be well positioned to support the growth of applied GS in that it facilitated result disclosure and was favorably reviewed by participants and GCs alike.</p>
              <p id="Par36">Currently, the clinical utility of GS tests is limited in historically underserved populations, mainly due both to reduced access to GS tests and an underrepresentation of non-European ancestry populations in genomic databases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> Large-scale research efforts are actively addressing this disparity by expanding genomic databases to better represent diverse populations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> The fruits of these efforts will increase the frequency with which GS tests provide conclusive results to patients of diverse ancestral backgrounds, and this improvement in clinical utility will further propel the application of GS. To ensure this improvement in accuracy promulgates health equity, equal attention must also be paid to accessibility to and communication of genomic health information.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> Digital communication tools that are culturally aware and multilingual will be needed to best serve diverse communities. Stakeholders, including genetics and medical professionals, patients and their families, and community members, contributed to¬†the development of GU√çA, helping to assure cultural appropriateness and understandability for patients, and functionality for providers. Testing GU√çA with the diverse participant population enrolled in NYCKidSeq will provide insights into the value of the application in delivering genomic medicine services. Furthermore, as the use of GS increases, nongenetics providers are increasingly required and challenged to interpret and discuss GS results with their patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> Future research could explore the impact of GU√çA on nongenetic provider outcomes and methods for implementing GU√çA to support the disclosure¬†of results in nongenetics clinics.</p>
              <p id="Par37">There were some limitations in this study. The pilot evaluation of GU√çA described here was carried out in a small, all-female cohort, which might limit the generalizability of the findings. Since the cohort consisted of participants in an ongoing study, their reflections on GU√çA may have been influenced by pretest counseling, familiarity with the genetic testing process, and repeated interactions with study staff. This study demonstrates the benefits of the development of technological solutions for communicating genomic information by medical professionals; however, this nonstandard software development environment imposes pragmatic limitations on feature development, portability, and long-term sustainability. For now, GU√çA is only available in English and Spanish, with limited utility to families with a different primary language. In a diverse city like New York, where over 34% of citizens speak a different language in their home, this may curtail the utility of the tool.</p>
              <sec id="Sec21" sec-type="conclusion">
                <title>Conclusion</title>
                <p id="Par38">To realize the full benefit of genomic medicine, patients and families must understand their genomic results and make informed decisions utilizing this information. Genomic information must be rendered accessible to all individuals regardless of health literacy and English language fluency. GU√çA was developed by a multidisciplinary group of stakeholders as a bilingual communication tool to support a large and varied population beginning with the diverse NYCKidSeq participants. Preliminary evidence suggests that GU√çA will be well-received and valued by patients, research participants, families, and providers.</p>
