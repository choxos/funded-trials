              <abstract>
                <p>Invasion and subsequent metastasis is the major cause of death from most cancers including prostate cancer. Herein we report on the potential tumor suppressive properties of Rab7, a GTPase that regulates trafficking of lysosomes. The movement of lysosomes to the cell surface in response to environmental cues increases the secretion of proteinases and cell invasion. We determined that Troglitazone and other members of the Thiazolidinedione family inhibit cell-surface directed lysosome trafficking and cathepsin B secretion through a Rab7-dependent mechanism. Moreover, Rab7 shRNA expressing cells were found to be more invasive <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Increased invasiveness was accompanied by elevated expression of the c-Met receptor and prolonged downstream signaling, thereby supporting a role for Rab7 as a mediator of signaling down-regulation. Taken together, these results suggested that Rab7 acts as a negative regulator of prostate tumor growth and invasion, providing further evidence for its potential as a tumor suppressor.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Formation of metastatic foci from an invasive primary tumor is the pivotal event in the process leading to cancer-associated deaths. Mortality rates for late-stage prostate cancer (metastatic disease) have not improved significantly over the past decade; therefore, an understanding of the mechanisms underlying tumor invasion and metastasis, and the development of therapies to prevent tumor progression are urgently needed. The hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-Met signaling axis is an important regulator of tumor cell invasion and metastasis <xref rid="pone.0087882-Benvenuti1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Ligand-induced c-Met signaling is known to induce an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in which epithelial cells lose cell-cell adhesions and take on a more motile, mesenchymal phenotype <xref rid="pone.0087882-Yilmaz1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. The induction of EMT is thought to enhance tumor cell migration and invasion through basement membranes. In addition to Met signaling, other factors within the tumor microenvironment such as hypoxia, aerobic glycolysis, and acidic extracellular pH (pHe) can increase tumor cell invasion <xref rid="pone.0087882-Gatenby1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087882-Moellering1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p>
              <p>Tumor invasion often requires the secretion of proteolytic enzymes, although some forms of cell migration/invasion are protease-independen <xref rid="pone.0087882-Friedl1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087882-Friedl2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Although proteinase secretion can occur via the constitutively active secretion pathway, major roles for lysosome-localized proteases have been demonstrated in tumor cell invasion <xref rid="pone.0087882-Sloane1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087882-Roshy1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. We have previously demonstrated that acidic pHe and HGF induce the trafficking of lysosomes to the cell surface, resulting in increased cathepsin B secretion <xref rid="pone.0087882-Steffan1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087882-Steffan2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. This is significant as altered cathepsin B and D localization is detected in breast and melanoma models in response to Ras transformation or changes in pHe <xref rid="pone.0087882-Nishimura1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087882-Rozhin1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. In previous publications, we have demonstrated that the spatial location of lysosomes in tumor cells is important for cell invasion <xref rid="pone.0087882-Steffan2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087882-Steffan3" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. When lysosomes are positioned closer to the cell surface, an increase in secreted proteases and cell invasion is detected; whereas, when lysosomes are located nearer the cell nucleus (away from the cell surface; i.e. juxtaposed to the cell nucleus) tumor cells secrete fewer proteinases and are significantly less invasive.</p>
              <p>Lysosomes are trafficked throughout cells along microtubules and/or actin filaments utilizing molecular motor proteins such as dyneins, kinesins, and/or myosin family members <xref rid="pone.0087882-Cordonnier1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. In addition, several GTPases such as RhoA, Rab7, Rab27, and Arf family members regulate motor protein activity or recruitment, thus regulating the distribution of lysosomes and other endocytic vesicles <xref rid="pone.0087882-Bagshaw1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087882-Jordens1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p>
              <p>Rab7 is a regulator of intracellular endocytic/membrane trafficking and is involved in many disease states including cancer and several infectious diseases (reviewed in <xref rid="pone.0087882-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>). Rab7, with one of its effectors, RILP (Rab7-interacting lysosomal protein), recruit the dynein-dynactin motor complex to lysosomes facilitating lysosome trafficking along microtubules towards the cell nucleus <xref rid="pone.0087882-Jordens2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Moreover, in addition to its recognized role in vesicle trafficking, Rab7 has recently garnered attention as a regulator of apoptosis in response to growth factor withdrawal <xref rid="pone.0087882-RomeroRosales1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> and has been proposed to function as a tumor suppressor protein <xref rid="pone.0087882-Edinger1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.</p>
              <p>Inhibitors of sodium-proton exchangers (NHEs) have been shown to be very effective in preventing cell-surface directed lysosome trafficking, thereby decreasing protease secretion and cell invasion <xref rid="pone.0087882-Steffan1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087882-Steffan2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087882-Steffan3" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. EIPA (5-(<italic>N</italic>-ethyl-<italic>N</italic>-isopropyl)-amiloride) has been shown to prevent acidic pHe and HGF-induced cell surface-directed lysosome trafficking; whereas, members of the thiazolidinedione family of compounds have been shown to prevent acidic pHe-induced cell surface-directed lysosome trafficking. Our previous work determined the compounds troglitazone and EIPA both utilize a Rab7-dependent mechanism to induce juxtanuclear lysosome aggregation (JLA) <xref rid="pone.0087882-Steffan3" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Troglitazone is one of several members of the thiazolidinedione (TZD) family of synthetic high-affinity ligands for the transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR- γ). However, these compounds, including ciglitazone (Cig), rosiglitazone (Rosi; Avandia), and pioglitazone (Pio; Actos), exhibit PPAR- γ independent effects, and our laboratory has demonstrated the potent effect of troglitazone on acidic pHe-induced lysosome distribution to be independent of PPAR- γ but requiring Rab7 (TZDs reviewed in <xref rid="pone.0087882-Kopelovich1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>). In fact, it was recently demonstrated that lysosomes traffic to the cell surface in cells expressing Rab7 shRNA (independent of external stimulus) suggesting that Rab7 is a negative regulator of cell surface-directed lysosome trafficking <xref rid="pone.0087882-Steffan2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. In addition, Rab7 shRNA expressing cells exhibited increased levels of secreted proteases and were more invasive <italic>in vitro</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0087882-Steffan2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087882-Steffan3" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p>
              <p>Herein, we present several lines of evidence demonstrating that Rab7 may play a suppressive role in tumor growth and progression, suggesting for the first that Rab7 is a putative tumor suppressor <italic>in vivo</italic>. Troglitazone required Rab7 to prevent HGF-induced protease secretion and tumor cell invasion <italic>in vitro.</italic> In addition, Rab7 shRNA expressing cells formed larger tumors <italic>in vivo</italic>, which exhibited increased proliferation, decreased apoptosis, and increased invasive capacity into surrounding tissues. Finally, shRNA mediated reduction of Rab7 led to an increase in c-Met <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> providing a possible mechanism to account for these changes.</p>

In order to determine if Troglitazone can also prevent HGF-induced cell surface-directed lysosome trafficking, DU145 prostate tumor cells were co-treated with 10 µM Troglitazone and 33 ng/µl HGF for 16 hrs, after which lysosomes were visualized by I.F. microscopy using LAMP1 (lysosome-associated membrane protein-1) as a previously established lysosome marker <xref rid="pone.0087882-Steffan1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Representative I.F. images shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0087882-g001">Figure 1A</xref> demonstrate that HGF induced the trafficking of lysosomes to the cell surface as previously published and that Troglitazone not only prevented HGF-induced cell surface-directed trafficking, but also induced the retrograde trafficking and coalescence of lysosomes adjacent to cell nuclei.

                    <p>A) I.F. microscopy was performed on DU145 prostate tumor cells expressing either a non-target (scrambled) shRNA or a Rab7-directed shRNA to visualize lysosomes (red), actin (green), and nuclei (blue). Rab7 shRNA expression prevents Troglitazone-induced juxtanuclear lysosome clustering and causes lysosomes to traffic to the cell surface independent of HGF. B) Quantitation of the spatial distribution of lysosomes is shown as mean distance from individual cell nuclei for each treatment condition. Error bars represent the s.e.m of 30 cells from at least three independent experiments. C) NT and Rab7 shRNA expressing DU145 cells were treated for 24 hrs with Troglitazone and/or HGF and the amount of Cathepsin B secreted into the culture media was detected utilizing a cathepsin B activity assay (see methods and materials). Cathepsin B secretion is increased and Troglitazone no longer prevents secretion in the Rab7 knockdown cells. Inset indicates LAMP-1 and Rab7 expression in the nontarget (NT) or Rab7 shRNA (KD) stable cell lines by Western blot. D) NT and Rab7 shRNA expressing DU145 cells were seeded onto Matrigel-coated transwell inserts and allowed to invade for 24 hrs. Treatments indicated were added to both the top and bottom of the insert. *Statistical significance (p&lt;0.001) versus NT control; **Statistical significance (p&lt;0.01) versus NT control. Scale bars: 10 µm.</p>

                <p>Similar to the distribution of lysosomes, Rab7 shRNA expressing cells demonstrated increased cathepsin B secretion in the absence of HGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0087882-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Moreover, Troglitazone was unable to prevent HGF-induced cathepsin B secretion in cells expressing Rab7 shRNA. Similar results were obtained for cell invasion. Troglitazone prevented the HGF-induced increase in tumor cell invasion in NT shRNA control cells, but not in the Rab7 knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0087882-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). Moreover, Rab7 shRNA expressing cells were significantly more invasive compared to NT shRNA cells in the absence of any stimulus. Taken together these data suggest that i.) Rab7 expression is required for Troglitazone to prevent HGF-induced lysosome trafficking and ii.) Rab7 acts as a negative regulator of cell surface-directed lysosome trafficking, cathepsin B secretion, and tumor cell invasion.</p>

                <p>Paraffin embedded tumor sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and visualized at two different magnifications. As stated above, during surgical removal of the tumors, the adjacent murine tissues and skin were left intact. Representative cross-sections of the H&amp;E stain are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0087882-g004">Figure 4</xref>. Control (NT shRNA expressing) tumors show overall tissue integrity with a thin layer of skin overlying a much thinker layer of organized, intact tissue (striated cells; indicated by the arrows). Few tumor cells can be detected invading into this tissue layer in control tumors. In contrast, the Rab7 shRNA expressing tumors displayed a much more aggressive phenotype. The integrity of the surrounding murine tissue was severely compromised and numerous tumor cells were found interspersed within the murine tissue or in most cases, the striated architecture of the surrounding tissue was entirely compromised. Therefore, we conclude that not only were the Rab7 shRNA expressing tumors larger, they had increased capacity to remodel and invade into the surrounding tissue.</p>

                <title>Rab7 mRNA is Down-regulated in Prostate Cancer Epithelial Cell Biopsies, but not in the Surrounding Stromal Cells, nor in BPH</title>
                <p>Since Rab7 down-regulation increased tumor growth <italic>in vivo</italic> and increased invasive capacity <italic>in vitro</italic>, the <italic>ONCOMINE</italic> database was searched to determine the differential mRNA levels of Rab7 in human prostate cancer. Analysis of the differential regulation of Rab7 in prostate cancer revealed six datasets spanning nine different prostate tissue subsets. As seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0087882-t001">Table 1</xref>, several studies showed a significant fold decrease in Rab7 mRNA expression ranging from −2.501 to −1.128; however, two studies were equivocal with one probe detecting an increase and a second probe detecting a decrease of Rab7 mRNA in prostate tumor samples, and one study did not detect any change in Rab7 mRNA expression. Furthermore, an analysis of PIN lesions also showed a significant −1.939 fold decrease in Rab7, whereas two separate analyses of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) failed to show a reduction in Rab7. Taken together, a trend appears whereby Rab7 is down-regulated early in prostate tumor development (PIN lesions) and remains down-regulated during tumor progression, but is not down-regulated in benign conditions such as BPH.</p>

                <title>Rab7 Knockdown Causes an Increase in c-Met Levels</title>
                <p>To begin to determine the mechanisms regulating an increase in tumor proliferation and invasion in cells containing reduced Rab7, we examined the levels and activation of c-Met in vector control and Rab7 shRNA expressing cells. The addition of HGF to control cells resulted in increased c-Met phosphorylation and activation of downstream signaling pathways followed by a gradual decrease over the next few hours. In contrast, the addition of HGF to Rab7 knockdown cells resulted in a more robust increase in c-Met phosphorylation and a slower loss of activated Met and downstream signaling partners over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0087882-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Consistent with these data, analysis of total c-Met protein in control and Rab7 knockdown cells indicated that c-Met levels were higher in cells with less Rab7 and that the HGF-mediated loss of c-Met was also attenuated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0087882-g005">Figure 5B</xref>).</p>

                    <p>A) Nontarget (NT) vector control or Rab7 shRNA expressing DU145 cells were exposed to HGF for the indicated times. Whole cell lysates were collected and c-met, Akt, and Erk phosphorylation was detected by Western blotting. B) Cells were treated with HGF for the indictated time periods and levels of total c-Met protein were determined by Western blot analysis. Densitometry from three independent experiments was used for graphical representation of c-Met loss over time. C) Cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of HGF for 30 minutes followed by Western blot analysis of the indicated proteins. D) Protein lysates of xenograft tumors were harvested and levels of total c-met and Rab7 protein were detected by Western blot. The bar graph represents the average c-met and Rab7 expression of seven tumors per treatment group as determined by densitometry of Western blot. * = p&lt;0.0007 compared to NT shRNA Rab7. ** = p&lt;0.03 compared to NT shRNA c-met.

                <p>Since c-Met levels were higher in Rab7 knockdown cells, we predicted that these tumor cells would be more responsive to lower concentrations of HGF. As indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0087882-g005">Figure 5C</xref>, Rab7 knockdown cells responded to lower concentrations of HGF as measured by activation of c-Met, Akt and Erk.</p>
                <p>Finally, to determine if c-Met levels were decreased in Rab7 knockdown mouse xenografts, protein from frozen xenograft tumor tissue was harvested and prepared for Western blot analysis. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0087882-g005">Figure 5D</xref> indicates that tumors formed from vector control DU145 cells on average contained more Rab7 and less c-Met than tumors formed from the Rab7 knockdown cells. This demonstrates that the Rab7 knockdown phenotype is maintained during tumor growth and that the concurrent overexpression of c-Met remains stable in tumors.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Prostate cancer is a clinically heterogeneous disease, ranging from relatively indolent primary tumors to lethal metastatic disease. Mortality rates of late stage, metastatic prostate cancer remain high and there is no definitive treatment. Therefore, understanding the molecular genetics and biology of aggressive prostate cancer is urgently needed in order to identify new drug targets and biomarkers. In previous studies, we explored the atypical trafficking of lysosomes in tumors of various tissue origin <xref rid="pone.0087882-Steffan1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Noteworthy, lysosomes are being considered as a valuable target for cancer therapeutics <xref rid="pone.0087882-Wright1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. We and others have shown increased cathepsin B secretion and tumor cell invasion in response to factors within the tumor microenvironment including acidic pHe and HGF <xref rid="pone.0087882-Sloane1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087882-Roshy1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087882-Steffan1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087882-Steffan2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087882-Nishimura1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087882-Steffan3" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087882-Rozhin2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. In fact, our conclusion that lysosome distribution can regulate cell invasion is supported by studies in invasive brain cancer <xref rid="pone.0087882-Rempel1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087882-Koblinski1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. In this report, we demonstrate for the first time that Troglitazone and other members of the Thiazolidinedione family differentially prevent HGF-induced lysosome trafficking. In addition, Rab7 down-regulation increased tumor cell invasion and prevented the action of Troglitazone. Thus, taken together these studies suggest that NHE inhibitors such as EIPA <xref rid="pone.0087882-Steffan1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087882-Steffan2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> and now Troglitazone prevent HGF- and acidic pHe-induced lysosome trafficking, which requires the GTPase Rab7. It could be argued that Troglitazone is acting via multiple mechanisms to prevent cell invasion in addition to the effects on lysosome trafficking, as Troglitazone also activates the transcription factor PPAR-γ, and the MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways <xref rid="pone.0087882-Steffan3" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087882-Wei1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087882-Weng1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. For this reason, we focused the rest of the study on the role of Rab7 in tumorigenesis, independent of Troglitazone or other Thiazolidinediones.</p>
              <p>Herein we report that Rab7 is a negative regulator of cell-surface directed lysosome trafficking and cathepsin B secretion, and reduction of Rab7 protein results in increased cell invasion. Furthermore, this is the first report to our knowledge demonstrating that tumors derived from Rab7 shRNA expressing cells grew faster and exhibited an increased invasive phenotype <italic>in vivo</italic>. This result was unexpected as the proliferation rate of Rab7 shRNA expressing cells <italic>in vitro</italic> is unchanged compared to vector control cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0087882.s002">Figure S2</xref>). In addition to increased proliferation and decreased apoptosis <italic>in vivo,</italic> H/E staining detected an increase in tumor cell invasion into the adjacent murine tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0087882-g004">Figure 4</xref>) from tumors derived from Rab7 shRNA expressing cells. However, upon tumor dissection, we did not visually detect overt invasion into the abdominal wall, thus further studies using other mouse models of metastasis or orthotopic models are needed to further define the role of Rab7 in tumor cell invasion and metastasis.</p>
              <p>One possible mechanism for the increased proliferation and decreased apoptotic rates seen <italic>in vivo</italic> is the regulation of growth factor receptors through endocytosis, which is often deregulated in cancer <xref rid="pone.0087882-Mosesson1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Rab7 is a key player in the down regulation of growth factor-induced signaling by regulating endocytic trafficking of internalized receptor tyrosine kinases, including c-Met, whereby Rab7 regulates the fusion of late endosomes to lysosomes, inducing the degradation of the receptor, which is essential for regulation of growth factor receptor signaling <xref rid="pone.0087882-Progida1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Thus, Rab7 could be considered a negative regulator of many pro-survival signals from the cell surface. In fact, Sakane <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0087882-Sakane1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> have shown that the Rab7 effector Rabring7 (Rab7-interacting RING-finger protein) is an E3 ligase involved in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) degradation.</p>
              <p>Interestingly, we observed that total c-Met protein levels were increased in cells with reduced Rab7 expression, a phenotype that was maintained throughout xenograft tumor growth (Figure5). Rab7 is known to mediate endosome/lysosome fusion, a process that is necessary for the normal turnover and degradation of many proteins, including receptor tyrosine kinases <xref rid="pone.0087882-Mosesson1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. A reduction in Rab7 protein may possibly slow the basal degradation rate of c-Met, thus increasing the half life of the protein and allowing for accumulation of c-Met in tumor cells. In support of this mechanism, we found that total c-Met protein was degraded more slowly in response to HGF stimulation in cells expressing Rab7 shRNA when compared to the NT shRNA control, indicating that Rab7 is indeed controlling c-Met degradation in our system. Additionally, deregulated c-Met endosomal trafficking in the Rab7 knockdown cells may also contribute to prolonged signaling and increased sensitivity to HGF. By disrupting normal c-Met endosomal/lysosomal trafficking via depletion of Rab7, c-Met may be maintained in the endosome allowing for sustained signaling and/or recycled back to the plasma membrane resulting in increased signaling by those c-Met receptors that would normally be targeted for degradation. In support of a role for Rab7 regulating c-Met, Rab7 is also known to control the trafficking and regulate the signaling of other receptor tyrosine kinases in a variety of cell systems, including the oncogenic EGFR <xref rid="pone.0087882-Ceresa1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087882-Saxena1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087882-BasuRay1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087882-BasuRay2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087882-Skorobogata1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Thus, the increased invasion and proliferation observed in the Rab7 knockdown cells <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0087882-g003">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0087882-g004">4</xref>) may not be solely due to peripheral lysosome trafficking, but may also be the result of increased c-Met expression and activity. It is interesting to note that Rab7 shRNA expressing cells proliferate and undergo apoptosis at rates similar to NT shRNA control cells <italic>in vitro</italic>, but proliferate more rapidly <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0087882.s002">Figure S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0087882-g003">Figure 3</xref>). This discrepancy may be attributed to c-Met activation from murine HGF <italic>in vivo</italic>, whereas HGF was not added to determine the proliferation rates of Rab7 knockdown cells <italic>in vitro</italic>. Thus, not only does Rab7 knockdown increase invasion by promoting anterograde lysosome trafficking and protease secretion, this phenotype also results in higher levels of c-Met, prolonged signaling, and an increased sensitivity to HGF that may contribute to pro-survival and pro-invasive signals in tumor cells.</p>
              <p>In support of this mechanism, the Edinger group <xref rid="pone.0087882-RomeroRosales1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087882-Edinger2" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> has demonstrated that Rab7 is activated and induces apoptosis (involving PKCδ) under conditions of growth factor withdrawal, suggesting that Rab7 activation limits growth factor-independent cell survival. Put another way, Rab7 is pro-apoptotic thus; the down-regulation or inactivation of Rab7 supports cell proliferation and survival. The complete underlying mechanisms of Rab7 in cell survival, apoptosis, and tumorigenesis are not yet completely understood, and this remains an active area of study. Furthermore, modulation of Rab7 activity may also be of benefit in other research areas including infectious diseases, osteoporosis, and autophagy. The role of Rab7 in these processes has recently been reviewed <xref rid="pone.0087882-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.</p>
              <p>Although, Rab7 has been reported to be overexpressed in diffuse malignant peritoneal mesothelioma and autonomous thyroid adenomas <xref rid="pone.0087882-Davidson1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087882-CroizetBerger1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, we searched the <italic>ONCOMINE</italic> database to determine the levels of Rab7 mRNA in prostate tumor biopsies (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0087882-t001">Table 1</xref>). Taken together the analysis suggests a trend by which Rab7 mRNA levels are decreased in the transition from normal prostatic epithelium to PIN and remains low in prostate adenocarcinoma. It is important to note that several datasets did not reflect significant down regulation of Rab7 in prostate tumors or that the mRNA levels were equivocal. As human prostate biopsy samples contain both tumorigenic epithelial cells and the surrounding stromal cells, it is interesting to note that the tumor samples in the studies demonstrating a reduction in Rab7 were enriched for high epithelial cell content (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0087882-t001">Table 1</xref>). Therefore, since the studies demonstrating low or non-significant Rab7 down-regulation also contained stromal cells in the analysis, it is tempting to speculate that the presence of stromal cells in the analysis may actually mask the potential down-regulation of Rab7; contributing to false negative results in the datasets. In fact, prostate epithelia and stromal cells are known to have different gene signatures <xref rid="pone.0087882-Tomlins1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. None-the-less, the fact that prostate carcinoma and PIN tissue demonstrate decreased Rab7 mRNA, but not the BPH samples suggests that Rab7 be commonly down regulated during prostate tumor progression. It is of note that a single prostate cancer cell line was utilized for the work in this research as it was ideal for our <italic>in vivo</italic> model; however, the influence of Rab7 on lysosome transport has been documented in numerous cell lines. This, along with the correlations identified in the oncomine analysis, suggest the results herein will be expanded to numerous epithelial cancer models.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, our results add to the increasing evidence that Rab7 functions as a prostate tumor suppressor and raises the interesting possibility that drugs which promote Rab7 activity may be possible cancer therapeutics. It is tempting to speculate that members of the thiazolidinediones may activate Rab7 and serve as parent compounds for medicinal chemists to modify, creating less toxic derivatives that increase Rab7 activity.</p>
