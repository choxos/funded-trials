                <p>Approximately 10–15% of individuals infected with <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> will develop ulcer disease (gastric or duodenal ulcer), while most people infected with <italic>H. pylori</italic> will be asymptomatic. The majority of infected individuals remain asymptomatic partly due to the inhibition of synthesis of cholesteryl α-glucosides in <italic>H. pylori</italic> cell wall by α1,4-GlcNAc-capped mucin <italic>O</italic>-glycans, which are expressed in the deeper portion of gastric mucosa. However, it has not been determined how cholesteryl α-glucosyltransferase (αCgT), which forms cholesteryl α-glucosides, functions in the pathogenesis of <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection. Here, we show that the activity of αCgT from <italic>H. pylori</italic> clinical isolates is highly correlated with the degree of gastric atrophy. We investigated the role of cholesteryl α-glucosides in various aspects of the immune response. Phagocytosis and activation of dendritic cells were observed at similar degrees in the presence of wild-type <italic>H. pylori</italic> or variants harboring mutant forms of αCgT showing a range of enzymatic activity. However, cholesteryl α-glucosides were recognized by invariant natural killer T (<italic>i</italic>NKT) cells, eliciting an immune response <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Following inoculation of <italic>H. pylori</italic> harboring highly active αCgT into <italic>i</italic>NKT cell-deficient (Jα18<sup>−/−</sup>) or wild-type mice, bacterial recovery significantly increased in Jα18<sup>−/−</sup> compared to wild-type mice. Moreover, cytokine production characteristic of Th1 and Th2 cells dramatically decreased in Jα18<sup>−/−</sup> compared to wild-type mice. These findings demonstrate that cholesteryl α-glucosides play critical roles in <italic>H. pylori</italic>-mediated gastric inflammation and precancerous atrophic gastritis.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>The gastric pathogen <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> is a bacterium that infects over 50 percent of the world's population <xref rid="pone.0078191-Marshall1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. If untreated, this infection leads to chronic gastritis and development of pyloric gland atrophy, peptic ulcer, intestinal metaplasia, gastric carcinoma, and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma <xref rid="pone.0078191-Peek1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p>
              <p>The initial host response to <italic>H. pylori</italic> is strong neutrophilic recruitment, which leads to gastric epithelial damage and is followed by chronic inflammation <xref rid="pone.0078191-Kobayashi1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0078191-Sipponen1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Such chronic inflammation is associated with infiltration of lymphocytes and plasma cells, forming MALT. In this process, venules in the gastric lamina propria begin to exhibit a high-endothelial venule (HEV)-like phenotype, which likely facilitates immune cell infiltration. Indeed, we have shown that induction of HEV-like vessels is associated with recruitment of mononuclear cells to inflammatory sites, and that eradication of <italic>H. pylori</italic> with antibiotics and treatment with proton pump inhibitors leads to disappearance of HEV-like vessels and diminished mononuclear cell infiltration <xref rid="pone.0078191-Kobayashi1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p>
              <p>After infection, <italic>H. pylori</italic> primarily colonizes surface mucosa of the stomach and rarely reaches deeper portions of the gastric mucosa <xref rid="pone.0078191-Hidaka1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0078191-Nakayama1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, although a more invasive and intracellular infection has also been proposed <xref rid="pone.0078191-Dubois1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Gastric mucins are divided into surface and gland mucins <xref rid="pone.0078191-Ota1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. The latter, consists of MUC6, are found in deeper regions of the stomach and are characterized by expression of α1,4-linked <italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosamine (α1,4-GlcNAc) attached to core 2-branched <italic>O</italic>-glycans, which is absent in the surface mucin, MUC5AC <xref rid="pone.0078191-Nakayama1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0078191-Nordman1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. It is known that MUC6 is exclusively expressed in mucous neck cells and pyloric glands of the gastric mucosa, while MUC5AC is expressed in gastric surface mucous cells in the stomach <xref rid="pone.0078191-Karasawa1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. These two types of mucins form a surface mucous gel layer exhibiting an alternating laminated array <xref rid="pone.0078191-Kobayashi2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Since this differential distribution coincides with distribution of <italic>H. pylori</italic>, we previously examined the antibiotic activity of α1,4-GlcNAc mucin and found that α1,4-GlcNAc-containing mucins inhibit <italic>H. pylori</italic> growth by blocking synthesis of cholesteryl α-glucosides <xref rid="pone.0078191-Kawakubo1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, the major component of <italic>H. pylori</italic> cell wall lipids <xref rid="pone.0078191-Hirai1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Moreover, mutant mice deficient in α1,4-<italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosaminyltransferase exhibit adenocarcinoma, indicating that α1,4-GlcNAc-containing mucins function as tumor suppressors <xref rid="pone.0078191-Karasawa1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Significantly, <italic>H. pylori</italic> lacks cholesterol and must incorporate it from surrounding host epithelial cells <xref rid="pone.0078191-Wunder1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Cholesteryl α-glucosyltransferase (αCgT) adds an α-glucosyl residue to cholesterol <xref rid="pone.0078191-Hoshino1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, forming cholesteryl α-glucoside (αCGL). αCGL is further derivatized in <italic>H. pylori</italic> to form cholesteryl acyl α-glucoside (αCAG), cholesteryl phosphatidyl α-glucoside (αCPG), and cholesteryl phosphatidyl monoacyl α-glucoside (αCPG (monoacyl)) <xref rid="pone.0078191-Hirai1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. We previously cloned αCgT using the shotgun method <xref rid="pone.0078191-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> and showed that its activity is inhibited by core 2 <italic>O</italic>-glycan capped by α1,4-GlcNAc residues <xref rid="pone.0078191-Lee2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. However, the function of cholesteryl α-glucosides in the pathogenesis of <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection has not been determined.</p>
              <p>Invariant natural killer T (<italic>i</italic>NKT) cells are recognized as immune cells that react with glycolipids. <italic>i</italic>NKT cells express the T cell receptor (TCR) encoded by Vα24-Jα18 and Vα14-Jα18 rearrangements in human and mouse, respectively <xref rid="pone.0078191-Taniguchi1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0078191-Tupin1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. These TCRs recognize glycolipid antigen presented by CDld, a non-classical MHC class I-like antigen distinct from c-type lectins that mediate leukocyte and lymphocyte adhesion <xref rid="pone.0078191-McEver1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0078191-Rosen1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. <italic>i</italic>NKT cells exhibit unique aspects of both innate and adaptive immunity, distinguishing them from innate immune natural killer (NK) cells <xref rid="pone.0078191-Jonsson1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0078191-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Both activated <italic>i</italic>NKT and NK cells can rapidly produce large amounts of various cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-4, interferon-γ (IFN-γ), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and IL-17, which likely stimulate different immune cell populations with diverse functions <xref rid="pone.0078191-Tupin1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. The potent TCR antigen of <italic>i</italic>NKT cells is α-galactosylceramide but also includes galactosyl diacyl glycerol present in Lyme disease-causing <italic>Borrelia burgdorferi</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0078191-Kinjo1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0078191-Kumar1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, α-galacturonic ceramide from <italic>Sphingomonas spp</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0078191-Kinjo2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, and α-glucosyldiacylglycerol from <italic>Streptoccocus pneumonia</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0078191-Kinjo3" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. However, how <italic>i</italic>NKT cells respond to these bacteria during the course of infection in human patients is not known.</p>
              <p>Here, to characterize αCGL function in the innate immune response, we first isolated the αCgT gene from <italic>H. pylori</italic> retrieved from stomach tissues of <italic>H. pylori</italic>-infected patients. We found that the activity of cloned αCgT from clinical isolates positively correlates with the atrophy score of stomach tissue. We then constructed recombinant <italic>H. pylori</italic> harboring αCgT from different clinical isolates and found that αCgT activity is positively correlated with susceptibility to <italic>i</italic>NKT cells. Moreover, <italic>H. pylori</italic> containing highly active αCgT were recovered from <italic>i</italic>NKT cell-deficient mice at levels dramatically higher than from wild-type (WT) mice. <italic>In vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> analysis identified αCPG (monoacyl) is the most potent antigen for <italic>i</italic>NKT cells among <italic>H. pylori</italic> cell components. These findings demonstrate that cholesteryl α-glucosides induce an immune response by <italic>i</italic>NKT cells, thus causing stomach inflammation due to <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection.</p>

                <title><italic>H. pylori</italic> αCgTs isolated from Japanese patients show varying levels of activity relative to αCgT from <italic>H. pylori</italic> 26695</title>
                <p>To determine the role of cholesteryl α-glucosides in <italic>H. pylori</italic> pathogenesis in the stomach, αCgT genomic DNA was isolated from clinical <italic>H. pylori</italic> isolates from the stomachs of 24 <italic>H. pylori</italic>-infected Japanese patients. Amino acid sequences deduced from various αCgT genomic sequences showed at least 20 different amino acid substitutions compared to αCgT from control WT <italic>H. pylori</italic> 26695, whose whole genome has been sequenced <xref rid="pone.0078191-Tomb1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078191-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). DNA encoding αCgT <italic>H. pylori</italic> 26695 WT was mutated by site-directed mutagenesis to create sequences corresponding to clinical isolates, and mutant proteins were expressed in a bacterial expression vector <xref rid="pone.0078191-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> and their activities measured. Some enzymes showed activity higher than WT αCgT from <italic>H. pylori</italic> 26695, while others showed decreased activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078191-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), as indicated in yellow and blue, respectively, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078191-g001">Figure 1A</xref>.</p>

                    <p>(A) The αCgT amino acid sequence from 24 clinical isolates was compared to that of <italic>H. pylori</italic> 26695, whose whole genome sequence has been reported. Only variant residues are shown. Residues in yellow and blue represent substitutions that yield higher and lower αCgT activity, respectively, relative to αCgT from <italic>H. pylori</italic> 26695. Proteins, of which amino acid residues shown in white boxes were substituted, were not soluble as a recombinant protein in a bacterial expression system and therefore enzyme activity was not assayed. (B) cDNA encoding the amino acid sequence of αCgT from <italic>H. pylori</italic> 26695 in an expression vector was mutated by site-directed mutagenesis to reproduce residues seen in <italic>H. pylori</italic> clinical isolates. Bacterially expressed αCgT was assayed using [<sup>3</sup>H]UDP-glucose and cholesterol as described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0078191.s009">File S1</xref>. (C) The entire αCgT sequence in the expression vector was replaced with sequences from <italic>H. pylori</italic> clinical isolates and activity of expressed αCgT was assayed. The assay was performed in triplicate and repeated twice in both (A) and (B). Representative results are shown.</p>

                </fig>
                <p>The amino acid sequence of αCgTs derived from clinical isolates of 18 European and 5 Indian patients was also determined (data not shown). A tyrosine substitution for WT histidine at position 41, which is an activating mutation, is observed in all Japanese isolates; that mutation was only occasionally seen in isolates of European and Indian origin (data not shown), indicating that protein sequences from Japanese patients are more uniform than those isolated from Indian and European individuals. Moreover, all <italic>H. pylori</italic> isolates from Japanese patients harbored genes encoding the most toxic form of <italic>cagA</italic> and <italic>vacA</italic> (<italic>cagA</italic>-positive and <italic>vacA</italic> s1/m1, data not shown) <xref rid="pone.0078191-Allen1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0078191-Higashi1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. However, more than half of the Indian and European clinical isolates harbored the much less toxic <italic>vacA</italic> s1/m1 or non-toxic <italic>vacA</italic> s2/m2, and about a quarter of the European <italic>H. pylori</italic> specimens lacked <italic>cagA</italic> (data not shown). Due to this diversity, for the remainder of the experiments reported here, we analyzed <italic>H. pylori</italic> from Japanese patients only.</p>
                <p>To determine the effect of amino acid substitutions seen in different <italic>H. pylori</italic> clones, the entire αCgT sequence in <italic>H. pylori</italic> 26695 was replaced with sequences present in the 16 different patterns of substitutions of αCgT amino acids and expressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, and the mutant αCgT proteins were purified. The activity of those recombinant proteins showed significant variation among clinical isolates, and more than half of the αCgT variants showed increased activity relative to WT <italic>H. pylori</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078191-g001">Figure 1C</xref>).</p>
                <p>To determine potential effects of amino acid substitutions on αCgT structure, we firstly attempted to determine the αCgT crystal structure. However, since we could not accomplish this task due to αCgT hydrophobicity, we searched databases for enzymes of similar structure <xref rid="pone.0078191-Jaroszewski1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Our search clearly identified αCgT as a member of the GT-4 family. GT-4 proteins exhibit two Rossmann-fold domains with the active site in a cleft between the two domains. The best hit with a known 3-dimensional structure was phosphatidylinositol mannosyltransferase from <italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis</italic> (PDB code 2GEJ) <xref rid="pone.0078191-Guerin1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. In this case, sequence identity was only 17%, but a “Z-score” of −65.2 indicated high structural similarity (a value of −9.5 indicates 97% confidence) <xref rid="pone.0078191-Jaroszewski1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. There was only one major gap in the primary sequence of αCgT: a 12-residue insertion in a loop far from the GDP-mannose binding site. We next built a 3-dimensional model using 2GEJ as template (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078191-g002">Figure 2</xref>). The model was of high quality as judged by the distribution of hydrophobic residues in the protein core and hydrophilic residues on the surface. Moreover, analysis of the UDP-glucose binding pocket revealed that most of the critical binding residues were identical, including residues implicated in catalysis <xref rid="pone.0078191-Guerin1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Notably, all of the αCgT amino acid substitutions from Japanese patients are located in the surface region of the αCgT sterical structure and are absent in the UDP-Glc binding pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078191-g002">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

                <p>We next used homologous recombination to replace the <italic>H. pylori</italic> 26695 αCgT sequence with sequences from <italic>H. pylori</italic> harboring αCgT of higher (αCgT<sup>high</sup>, strain #10) and lower (αCgT<sup>low</sup>, strain #17) activity or to create <italic>H. pylori</italic> lacking the αCgT gene altogether (αCgT<sup>Δ</sup>) in order to compare these variants with parental <italic>H. pylori</italic> 26695 (αCgT<sup>cont</sup>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0078191.s001">Figure S1</xref> and Table S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0078191.s009">File S1</xref>). As anticipated, <italic>H. pylori</italic> αCgT<sup>high</sup> synthesized greater amounts of cholesteryl α-glucosides than did <italic>H. pylori</italic> αCgT<sup>low</sup>, while <italic>H. pylori</italic> lacking αCgT synthesized no cholesteryl α-glucosides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078191-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Among different cholesteryl α-glucosides, αCGL was the most abundant in products of <italic>H. pylori</italic> αCgT<sup>low</sup>, most likely because αCGL was not converted to αCAG or αCPG.</p>

                <p>We then asked if αCgT levels, and thus those of cholesteryl α-glucosides, were correlated with pathogenesis of <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection. Histological grading of 24 human biopsy samples of the gastric mucosa collated together with the 24 Japanese <italic>H. pylori</italic> strains were judged by five different criteria using the updated Sydney System <xref rid="pone.0078191-Dixon1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>: <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection load, recruitment of neutrophils, infiltration of mononuclear cells, glandular atrophy (antrum and corpus), and intestinal metaplasia, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0078191.s002">Figure S2A and B. </xref>These criteria were evaluated each as four grades scored from 0 to 3: normal (score 0), mild (1), moderate (2), and marked (3). In general, more advanced atrophy was characterized by a decrease in the number of pyloric glands in the antrum and fundic glands in the corpus (data not shown). More advanced atrophy was also associated with recruitment of mononuclear cells and formation of intestinal metaplasia (data not shown). Histological assessment of the gastric mucosa was undertaken based on pathology reports, which were reviewed by one senior pathologist (J.N., <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0078191.s002">Figure S2B</xref>). When αCgT activity of all strains was plotted against these parameters, activity was highly correlated with the total atrophy score (antrum and corpus) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078191-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Replotting of those data, as indicated by the dotted rectangle in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078191-g004">Figure 4A</xref>, showed that the total atrophy score is positively correlated with mononuclear cell recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078191-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Moreover, the number of <italic>H. pylori</italic> colonies was inversely correlated with αCgT activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078191-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). These results strongly suggest that cholesteryl α-glucosides induce an immune response causing increased inflammation, yet that response decreases the number of surviving <italic>H. pylori</italic>. Furthermore, the atrophy score was correlated with intestinal metaplasia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078191-g004">Figure 4D</xref>), a precancerous phenotype <xref rid="pone.0078191-Yuasa1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, indicating that a high atrophy score predicts progression to gastric carcinoma.</p>

                <title>Cholesteryl α-glucosides are responsible for an <italic>i</italic>NKT cell immune response</title>
                <p>To determine which immune cells play a critical role in <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection, we first assayed phagocytosis by macrophage-like differentiated THP-1 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0078191.s003">Figure S3A</xref>) and antigen presentation by dendritic cells (DCs) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0078191.s003">Figure S3B</xref>). Phagocytosis was observed in all αCgT clones, regardless of αCgT activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0078191.s003">Figure S3A</xref>). Activation of DCs was measured by the expression of 3 markers, CD86, HLA-DR, and CD40. CD86 and HLA-DR are known antigen-presentation markers and CD40 is a differentiation marker of mature DCs. None of αCgT clones exhibited a significant difference in terms of recognizing <italic>H. pylori</italic> expressing αCgT<sup>high</sup>, αCgT<sup>low</sup>, or αCgT<sup>Δ</sup>, in antigen presentation by DCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0078191.s003">Figure S3B</xref>). This result suggests that generally all αCgT clones analyzed are similarly recognized by macrophages and DCs.</p>
                <p>We then tested the possibility that <italic>i</italic>NKT cells exert a differential response to <italic>H. pylori</italic> expressing αCgT<sup>high</sup> or αCgT<sup>Δ</sup>. Upon recognition of WT <italic>H. pylori</italic>, a mouse hybridoma <italic>i</italic>NKT cell line produced significant amounts of IL-2, an indicator of <italic>i</italic>NKT cell activation. Those levels were roughly equivalent to stimulation by α-galactosylceramide, a bona fide antigen for <italic>i</italic>NKT cells. By contrast, <italic>H. pylori</italic> lacking αCgT were barely recognized by the same <italic>i</italic>NKT hybridoma based on failure to elicit an IL-2 response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078191-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). These results indicate that <italic>i</italic>NKT cell immune responses are largely due to recognition of cholesteryl α-glucosides.</p>

                <p>Cholesteryl α-glucosides constitute 25% of total <italic>H. pylori</italic> lipids and comprise three major forms and one minor form (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0078191.s004">Figure S4</xref>) <xref rid="pone.0078191-Hirai1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. All four forms were synthesized and their structure confirmed by NMR. When we evaluated the three major forms of synthetic cholesteryl α-glucosides <italic>in vitro</italic>, cholesteryl phosphatidyl α-glucoside (αCPG) elicited the highest <italic>i</italic>NKT cell response when glycolipids were initially dissolved in DMSO (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0078191.s005">Figure S5A</xref>), although the response toward αCPG was significantly less robust than to α-galactosylceramide. This observation is consistent with a generally weak interaction of the glycolipid with CD1d (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0078191.s005">Figure S5B</xref>) and/or the T-cell receptor. Cholesteryl β-glucoside (βCGL) was not recognized by <italic>i</italic>NKT cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0078191.s005">Figure S5A</xref>). In other experiments, DCs were isolated from bone marrow and differentiated using GM-CSF. These immature DCs were then incubated with the four synthetic forms of cholesteryl α-glucosides and injected intraperitoneally into WT mice. The presence of <italic>i</italic>NKT cells in liver, where they are more abundant than in other tissues, was evaluated 16 hours later. Interestingly, the monoacylated form of αCPG, which is reportedly a minor component of cholesteryl α-glucosides <xref rid="pone.0078191-Lebrun1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, was the most potent antigen in the <italic>in vivo</italic> assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078191-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). Consistently, an isoelectrofocusing assay showed that αCPG (monoacyl) was the only lipid that interacted with CD1d (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0078191.s005">Figure S5B</xref>). These results suggest that fatty side chain(s) in cholesteryl α-glucosides are potentially important for CD1d recognition.</p>

Ten days after the 3rd inoculation, mice were sacrificed and the stomach was excised.

Indeed, histochemical analysis showed that surface mucosa from <italic>H. pylori</italic>-infected Jα18<sup>−/−</sup> and WT mice was indistinguishable and only a few mononuclear cells, neutrophils or macrophages had been recruited by the 10 day time point (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0078191.s006">Figure S6A and B</xref>). Under these same conditions, αCgT<sup>high</sup>
<italic>H. pylori</italic> were recovered at lower levels from the stomach of WT mice than from αCgT<sup>cont</sup>
<italic>H. pylori</italic>-infected WT mice. Furthermore, recovery of αCgT<sup>high</sup>
<italic>H. pylori</italic> was five times greater in Jα18<sup>−/−</sup> than in WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078191-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). Such a substantial increase relative to WT mice was not observed when αCgT<sup>Δ</sup>

Significantly, increased mRNA expression of <italic>i</italic>NKT cells (Table S2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0078191.s009">File S1</xref>) were expressed in the stomach and/or underwent proliferation upon inoculation of αCgT<sup>high</sup>

                <p>To evaluate the consequences of an <italic>i</italic>NKT response upon <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection, we examined levels of mRNAs encoding cytokines. Following infection of mice with αCgT<sup>high</sup> bacteria, IFN-γ, IL-12p40, and IL-4 transcript levels were significantly decreased in Jα18<sup>−/−</sup> relative to WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078191-g006">Figure 6C, D, and E</xref>).

These results indicate that <italic>i</italic>NKT cell activation by <italic>H. pylori</italic> cholesteryl α-glucosides promotes proliferation and/or recruitment of cells producing Th1 cytokines (IFN-γ, IL-2, and IL-12p40) <xref rid="pone.0078191-Hafsi1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-5), and a regulatory cytokine (IL-10) <xref rid="pone.0078191-Pulendran1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>.

We also observed increased RORγt expression as well as that of IL-10, which encodes an inducer of regulatory T cells (Tregs), in stomach tissue from WT infected mice, both indicators of <italic>i</italic>NKT cell activation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0078191.s008">Figure S8E and G</xref>).

These results indicate that recognition of cholesteryl α-glucosides by <italic>i</italic>NKT cells stimulates immune cell responses in various cell lineages, including Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells, and that these responses are associated with decreased recovery of <italic>H. pylori</italic>.</p>

              <p>Infection of the stomach with <italic>H. pylori</italic> induces an acute immune response mediated predominantly by neutrophil infiltration, but the subsequent innate response promotes chronic inflammation mediated by various immune cells. This long-term phase apparently induces HEV-like vessels in gastric mucosa, facilitating T and B lymphocyte recruitment to inflammatory sites in the stomach. We previously found that the presence of <italic>H. pylori</italic> in the stomach is necessary to facilitate lymphocyte recruitment, and that <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication abrogated HEV-like vessels and dramatically decreased the number of mononuclear cells <xref rid="pone.0078191-Kobayashi1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Similarly, we found recently that gastric MALT lymphoma is associated with the appearance of HEV-like vessels that express MECA-79 negative sialyl Lewis X <xref rid="pone.0078191-Kobayashi3" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, suggesting that non-sulfated sialyl Lewis X recruits lymphocytes during progression of gastric MALT-lymphoma.</p>
              <p>Here we show that cholesteryl α-glucosides in <italic>H. pylori</italic> play a critical role in the early phase of inflammation in <italic>H. pylori</italic>-infected mice. Moreover, we observed highly significant diversity in αCgT amino acid sequences depending on clinical isolates and found that αCgT activity was highly correlated with progression of gastric mucosal atrophy. αCgT amino acid substitutions were not seen at the UDP-Glc binding site, which is located at an inner hydrophobic pocket of αCgT. This observation supports our conclusion that αCgT is essential for <italic>H. pylori</italic> growth and that mutations that alter UDP-Glc binding abolish <italic>H. pylori</italic> viability. Amino acid substitutions that we observed in αCgT from the clinical isolates likely result in αCgT conformational changes, resulting in increased or decreased αCgT activity.</p>
              <p>It has been reported that <italic>H. pylori</italic> is one of the most diverse and variable bacterial species studied. Genetic variation can be generated in a bacterial population by mutation and/or recombination between different strains. As a result, <italic>H. pylori</italic> exhibits extensive genetic variation, so that almost every infected individual carries their own <italic>H. pylori</italic> clinical strain. <xref rid="pone.0078191-Suerbaum1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. To investigate the effect of genomic diversity on αCgT activity, we analyzed 24 clinical isolates from Japanese patients, as well as samples from 5 Indian and 18 Europe individuals. Genotyping analysis of <italic>H. pylori cagA</italic> and <italic>vacA</italic>, which encode toxic factors <xref rid="pone.0078191-Allen1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0078191-Higashi1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, showed that isolates from all Japanese patients contained toxic forms of these genes (<italic>cagA</italic>-positive, <italic>vacA</italic>; s1/m1), while some <italic>H. pylori</italic> isolates from European and Indian patients showed <italic>cagA</italic>-negative or weakly toxic or non-toxic <italic>vacA</italic> subtypes. Moreover, substitution of the histidine residue at position 41 with tyrosine activated αCgT relative to wild-type <italic>H. pylori</italic>. That substitution was observed in all clinical isolates from Japanese patients, while only a fraction of European and Indian patients harbored that substitution. This finding, together with the presence of CagA and the toxin known as VacA, may account for the high prevalence of gastric cancer in Japan. Additional large-scale examination of <italic>H. pylori</italic> isolates from patients in different countries such as European nations is necessary to support this hypothesis.</p>
              <p>The present study revealed that αCgT activity is higher in <italic>H. pylori</italic> isolated from patient clinical isolates. As biospecimens were isolated upon diagnosis, the specimens used in this study came from patients who had been infected for varying periods of time. It is noteworthy that αCgT activity is highly correlated with glandular atrophy, regardless of infection history. The degree of atrophy is also correlated with intestinal metaplasia, a putative precancerous condition, supporting the idea that the inflammatory response leads to gastric cancer <xref rid="pone.0078191-Houghton1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. Moreover, unlike normal gastric mucosa, which shows stable expression of α1,4-GlcNAc residues in gastric glands, it is reported that expression of α1,4-GlcNAc residues containing <italic>O</italic>-glycans in <italic>H. pylori</italic>-associated intestinal metaplasia is significantly reduced <xref rid="pone.0078191-Ferreira1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. This fact suggests that disappearance of core 2 <italic>O</italic>-glycans capped by α1,4-GlcNAc residues may function in the process of intestinal metaplasia. Although previous studies demonstrate a role for <italic>i</italic>NKT cells in various chronic infection-inflammation states, our work demonstrates that <italic>i</italic>NKT cell-mediated chronic inflammation is directly correlated to disease progression in human patients.</p>
              <p>Here, we generated recombinant <italic>H. pylori</italic> in which only the αCgT gene was replaced with forms seen in clinical isolates. We found that <italic>H. pylori</italic> harboring αCgT<sup>high</sup> grows more efficiently than does <italic>H. pylori</italic> expressing αCgT<sup>low</sup>. Moreover, some <italic>H. pylori</italic> lacking αCgT exhibited a coccoid morphology. These results demonstrate that αCgT is critical for <italic>H. pylori</italic> growth. However, forms of <italic>H. pylori</italic> that express different amounts of cholesteryl α-glucosides did not induce a differential response toward macrophages and DCs, supporting the idea that cholesteryl α-glucosides are antigens recognized by <italic>i</italic>NKT cells. Notably five-fold greater levels of <italic>H. pylori</italic> αCgT<sup>high</sup> were recovered from Jα18<sup>−/−</sup> than from WT mice. This difference was much greater than differences observed in WT and Jα18<sup>−/−</sup> mice infected with either αCgT<sup>cont</sup> or αCgT<sup>Δ</sup>
<italic>H. pylori</italic>. These results clearly show that excess cholesteryl α-glucosides are recognized by <italic>i</italic>NKT, reducing <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection. Our findings differ from a previous report showing that cholesteryl α-glucosides protect <italic>H. pylori</italic> from immune cell attack <xref rid="pone.0078191-Wunder1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. That work relied on only one <italic>H. pylori</italic> mutant lacking cholesteryl α-glucosides. Thus, anomalies in that mutant <italic>H. pylori</italic> may have perturbed the immune response.</p>
              <p>Among three major <italic>H. pylori</italic> cholesteryl α-glucosides, αCPG was identified as the most potent antigen for <italic>i</italic>NKT cells based on an <italic>in vitro</italic> assay, even though the response toward αCPG was less potent than toward α-galactosylceramide. It has been shown that CD1d has two pockets at the α-galactosylceramide binding site and that the two acyl chains of the latter fit into these pockets <xref rid="pone.0078191-Koch1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. It is possible that two acyl chains of αCPG similarly fit into these pockets. When these different cholesteryl α-glucosides are presented from DCs, αCPG (monoacyl) is the best antigen <italic>in vivo</italic>. Therefore, <italic>in vivo</italic> one acyl chain and cholesterol with a side chain may be the optimal antigen for <italic>i</italic>NKT interaction with the CD1d pocket.</p>
              <p><italic>i</italic>NKT cells reportedly produce cytokines that stimulate different immune cells <xref rid="pone.0078191-Tupin1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Under the experimental conditions used, an increase in mononuclear cells was not observed 10 days after infection <xref rid="pone.0078191-Algood1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. <italic>i</italic>NKT cells constitute less than 3% of all T lymphocytes in many tissues <xref rid="pone.0078191-Heller1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. Because of their low abundance, an increase in <italic>i</italic>NKT cells was not observed in either WT or Jα18<sup>−/−</sup> mice. It has been reported that <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection leads to Th1 cell activation <xref rid="pone.0078191-Hafsi1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. However, Th2 cell activation has not been well described <xref rid="pone.0078191-OKeeffe1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. The present work shows that 10 days after <italic>H. pylori</italic> inoculation, the Th2 cell response is as robust as the Th1 cell response, and that those responses largely depend on <italic>i</italic>NKT cells. Since Th2 cells play a role in the tolerogenic response <xref rid="pone.0078191-Pulendran1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, Th2 cell activation by <italic>H. pylori</italic> may promote long-lasting attenuation of the immune response, which might underlie the chronic nature of <italic>H. pylori</italic> infections. In our present study, we did not detect an increase in Tregs ten days after infection, while a recent study reports that Tregs increase during influenza virus infection in the presence of <italic>H. pylori</italic> or αCAG <xref rid="pone.0078191-Chang1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. Our findings suggest that the increase in Th2 cells induced by excess cholesteryl α-glucosides may promote a tolerogenic effect following <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection through <italic>i</italic>NKT cell activation.</p>
