                <p id="P3">The ability of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) to decrease transmission by blocking the acquisition of colonization has been attributed to herd immunity. We describe the role of mucosal IgG to capsular polysaccharide (CPS) in mediating protection from carriage, translating our findings from a murine model to humans. We used a flow-cytometric assay to quantify antibody-mediated agglutination demonstrating that hyperimmune sera generated against an unencapsulated mutant was poorly agglutinating. Passive immunization with this antiserum was ineffective to block acquisition of colonization compared to agglutinating antisera raised against the encapsulated parent strain. In the human challenge model samples were collected from PCV and control vaccinated adults. In PCV-vaccinated subjects IgG levels to CPS were increased in serum and nasal wash (NW). IgG to the inoculated strain CPS dropped in NW samples after inoculation suggesting its sequestration by colonizing pneumococci. In post-vaccination NW samples pneumococci were heavily agglutinated compared to pre-vaccination samples in subjects protected against carriage. Our results indicate that pneumococcal agglutination mediated by CPS specific antibodies is a key mechanism of protection against acquisition of carriage. Capsule may be the only vaccine target that can elicit strong agglutinating antibody responses, leading to protection against carriage acquisition and generation of herd immunity.</p>

              <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
              <p id="P4">The human nasal mucosa forms the first line of defence against respiratory pathogens. Some of these pathogens such as <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> (the pneumococcus) can asymptomatically colonise the upper respiratory tract (the carrier state). <sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Although most episodes of pneumococcal carriage do not result in disease, the organism may gain access to normally sterile sites in its human host from its niche on the mucosal surfaces of the upper airways. <sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Mucosal immune responses, therefore, play a critical role in the defence against pneumococcal infections as they dictate the outcome of host-pathogen interactions at the mucosa.</p>
              <p id="P5">Murine models have demonstrated that once carriage is established the generation of mucosal antibodies is ineffective at clearing the organism. <sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> However, mucosal antibody, if present before stable colonization occurs, may block acquisition through its agglutinating activity, a mechanism dependent on its multi-valency and independent of Fc, complement and opsonophagocytosis. <sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> The ability of agglutinating antibody to inhibit the establishment of mucosal colonization could be attributed to more efficient mucociliary clearance of larger particles and the requirement for a larger colonizing dose. Since pneumococci enzymatically inactivate the agglutinating activity of human IgA1, the most abundant form of immunoglobulin on the airway surface, the prevention of colonization requires sufficient mucosal levels of other subclasses such as IgG. <sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> The ability of the pneumococcus to target and evade human-specific components of humoral immunity emphasizes the need to examine the mechanisms of mucosal protection in the natural host.</p>
              <p id="P6">The serotype-specific success of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) in reducing rates of carriage of vaccine-type strains in immunized populations indicates that anti-capsular antibodies reduce transmission by blocking the acquisition of colonization.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> PCV vaccination induces high levels of serum IgG that access the mucosal surface in vaccinated children, however, the exact mechanism by which this vaccine mediates mucosal protection has not been described. <sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> We recently reported that PCV conferred a 78% reduction in carriage acquisition compared to a control group following inoculation of adults with live type 6B pneumococci in an experimental human pneumococcal carriage (EHPC) study. <sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup></p>
              <p id="P7">In this report, we utilize a flow cytometric assay to quantify the agglutinating effect of anti-pneumococcal antibodies. This assay allowed us to examine the role of pneumococcal surface antigens and demonstrate the importance of antibodies to its immunodominant antigen, capsular polysaccharide (CPS), in eliciting agglutinating IgG that protects from the acquisition of colonization. This assay was then used to investigate the role of mucosal antibodies to capsule antigens in mediating agglutination and protection against acquisition of pneumococcal carriage in the natural host in an EHPC study of PCV.</p>

                <title>A flow cytometric assay to quantify pneumococcal agglutination by antibody</title>
                <p id="P8">To quantify bacterial agglutination, we developed and optimized a flow cytometric assay. After a brief incubation of pneumococci with type-specific antibody, there was a dose-dependent increase in the shift in forward scatter (FSC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). At higher concentrations, there was also an increase in side scatter (SSC). Samples were then analysed under similar conditions using an Amnis Imaging Flow Cytometer to visualize the individual events detected by the laser. The change in particle size, as detected by shift in FSC, and complexity, as detected by shift in SSC, correlated with a progressive bridging of particles to form longer chains (threading reaction) by antibody. <sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> As the concentration of antibody was increased further these formed into aggregates of increasing size. Furthermore, divalent F(ab’)<sub>2</sub> fragments generated from this antibody<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> caused a similar shift in FSC and corresponding visual agglutination of bacteria, unlike an equivalent concentration of monovalent Fab fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Together these data confirm that flow cytometry is a sensitive method to detect and quantify bacterial agglutination by antibody.</p>

                <title>Capsule is the major agglutinating antigen and leads to enhanced protection</title>
                <p id="P9">Using this flow cytometric assay for agglutination, we examined which pneumococcal surface antigens could generate agglutinating antibodies. We raised hyperimmune rabbit anti-sera against whole-cell heat-killed P1121, a type 23F isolate (P2109, encapsulated strain), and a genetically-modified mutant of P1121 lacking the capsular antigen (unencapsulated strain). Immunisation with these strains led to a robust antibody response, and the ELISA IgG titers to whole bacteria were not significantly different whether antiserum was raised against the encapsulated or unencapsulated strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). As expected, only antiserum raised to the encapsulated strain contained antibody recognising purified type 23 CPS by ELISA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). Using these rabbit antisera, we then compared agglutination using the flow cytometric assay and found that only antiserum raised against the encapsulated strain was able to agglutinate the wild-type encapsulated bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). In contrast, the antiserum raised against the isogenic strain lacking the capsular antigen showed minimal agglutination of either the encapsulated or the unencapsulated strains. This suggests that while the array of non-capsular antigens underlying the capsule is able to induce a strong immune response, antibody to these antigens is relatively poorly agglutinating. Therefore, capsular antigens may be the only antigens that can efficiently promote agglutination. To confirm the requirement for the capsular antigen in agglutination, isogenic strains in which the capsule-type was genetically switched were compared using the flow cytometric assay. Pneumococcal agglutination required type-specific antibody regardless of genetic background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). There did not appear to be a significant contribution of other constituents determined by genetic background to agglutination. The agglutinating ability of antibodies has been shown to protect from the acquisition of colonization. <sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> We used a murine model of colonization to compare the antisera raised to the isogenic encapsulated and unencapsulated strains. After intranasal challenge with strain P1121, mice that had been passively immunized with antisera against the encapsulated strain were more protected from colonization compared to mice immunized with the antisera against its unencapsulated mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>).

Only 5 out of 48 subjects vaccinated with PCV became colonized following pneumococcal inoculation (carriage+).

A similar pattern was observed in NW samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). Interestingly, amongst carriage+ subjects, only one volunteer had increased IgG levels in NW Post-V.

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p id="P17">Our study provides insight into the mechanisms of mucosal defence against pathogens and how humoral immunity generated through vaccination contributes to protection. We demonstrate that the ability of antibody to block the establishment of colonization in the human host, the first step in pathogenesis of disease caused by <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>, correlates with its agglutinating activity. <sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Our focus was on IgG because it is generated in high concentrations in response to systemic immunization and has been shown to be sufficient to promote agglutination on the mucosal surface.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> We have measured both IgA1 and IgA2 in NW samples pre- and post-inoculation with pneumococcus and IgA1 was the dominant IgA subclass in the nasal mucosa (data not shown). Secretory antibodies are unlikely to be sufficient factor in agglutination due to the activity of pneumococcal IgA1 protease and the moderated increase of S-IgM levels post-vaccination.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup></p>
              <p id="P18">This study required a sensitive method to quantify agglutination. Through use of technology that simultaneously provides images of individual events detected during flow cytometric analysis, we confirmed that flow characteristics were a sensitive and specific measure of the magnitude of antibody-induced agglutination. By comparing hyperimmune sera generated to isogenic strains differing only in expression of CPS amount and type, we showed that type-specific antibody to CPS was necessary for agglutination. Data from the EHPC study with parenterally-administered PCV confirmed that anti-CPS IgG is protective from colonization and is sufficient to generate mucosal agglutinating activity. This observation provided mechanistic understanding of the effectiveness of CPS-based immunity in reducing rates of mucosal infection and conferring herd immunity in the population<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. This same mechanism may be applicable to vaccines using the CPSs of other encapsulated pathogens that also impact mucosal colonization.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> In our study using whole pneumococci, only antibody to CPS was agglutinating. Yet, it remains possible that a sufficient amount of antibody to another pneumococcal target or combination of targets could elicit agglutinating antibody. It also remains possible, however, that CPS is the only pneumococcal target that may elicit agglutination by specific antibodies. CPS is a highly abundant surface antigen and capable of inducing high levels of immunoglobulin, particularly when conjugated to an immunogenic protein carrier. Additionally, CPS variably shields underlying surface antigens from recognition by antibody. However, even when equivalent amounts of antibody to whole pneumococci were compared, only sera containing antibody to type-specific CPS elicited detectable agglutination. Thus, the amount of bound antibody does not appear to be the only factor contributing to agglutination.</p>
              <p id="P19">Using an experimental model of human pneumococcal carriage, we previously demonstrated that PCV is highly protective against 6B pneumococcal carriage acquisition, conferring a 78% reduction in carriage acquisition.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> We now document that in protected adults, PCV induced high levels of IgG to 6B CPS at the nasal mucosa. Nasal washes collected post PCV vaccination had increased pneumococcal agglutination capacity compared to nasal wash samples collected before vaccination. Agglutination levels correlated with levels of IgG to 6B CPS. Interestingly, while levels of IgG to 23F CPS were unaltered in nasal wash after inoculation, levels of IgG to 6B CPS were reduced – this suggests that antibodies to 6B CPS were sequestered onto the bacterial surface in the nasal lumen following inoculation. Thus, the immunogenicity of PCV is sufficient to generate levels of IgG that reach the mucosal surface in amounts that bind to and agglutinate pneumococci when the host is exposed to the pathogen. Optimal protection may require the presence of agglutinating levels of antibody at the time of first exposure on the mucosal surface potentially explaining why the vaccine may prevent new carriage events but does not impact pre-existing colonization. It remains unknown whether humoral immunity generated by natural carriage generates protective agglutinating antibody that affects subsequent type-specific exposure to the organism. In previous EHPC studies we have shown that pneumococcal carriage protects healthy adults against subsequent carriage following re-exposure to the homologous strain<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> but not against acquisition of a heterologous strain type.<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> More recently we have shown that high baseline levels of circulating memory B-cells secreting IgG to CPS, but not to protein antigens, were associated with protection against carriage acquisition in unvaccinated adults.<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Taken together our findings suggest that anti-capsular IgG-mediated agglutination is a key mechanism of protection against pneumococcal carriage acquisition, in particular in subjects with high antibody titers, such as those vaccinated with PCV.</p>
              <p id="P20">Our findings have several implications for vaccine development. Current anti-pneumococcal vaccines are limited by a serotype-specific approach and the diversity of pneumococcal types. Most of the effectiveness of pneumococcal vaccines, however, results from their ability to reduce transmission by decreasing rates of colonization in the population.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Thus, for any novel vaccine containing more conserved target(s) to be as effective it would need to similarly impact carriage, and our study suggests that this would require the generation of agglutinating antibody on the mucosal surface of the upper airways.</p>
