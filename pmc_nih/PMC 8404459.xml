                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Diet, shown to impact colorectal cancer (CRC) risk, is a modifiable environmental factor. Fibre foods fermented by gut microbiota produce metabolites that not only provide food for the colonic epithelium but also exert regulatory effects on colonic mucosal inflammation and proliferation. We describe methods used in a double-blinded, randomised, controlled trial with Alaska Native (AN) people to determine if dietary fibre supplementation can substantially reduce CRC risk among people with the highest reported CRC incidence worldwide.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analyses</title>
                  <p>Eligible patients undergoing routine screening colonoscopy consent to baseline assessments and specimen/data collection (blood, urine, stool, saliva, breath and colon mucosal biopsies) at the time of colonoscopy. Following an 8-week stabilisation period to re-establish normal gut microbiota post colonoscopy, study personnel randomise participants to either a high fibre supplement (resistant starch, n=30) or placebo (digestible starch, n=30) condition, repeating stool sample collection. During the 28-day supplement trial, each participant consumes their usual diet plus their supplement under direct observation. On day 29, participants undergo a flexible sigmoidoscopy to obtain mucosal biopsy samples to measure the effect of the supplement on inflammatory and proliferative biomarkers of cancer risk, with follow-up assessments and data/specimen collection similar to baseline. Secondary outcome measures include the impact of a high fibre supplement on the oral and colonic microbiome and biofluid metabolome.</p>

                  <title>Ethics and dissemination</title>
                  <p>Approvals were obtained from the Alaska Area and University of Pittsburgh Institutional Review Boards and Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium and Southcentral Foundation research review bodies. A data safety monitoring board, material transfer agreements and weekly study team meetings provide regular oversight throughout the study. Study findings will first be shared with AN tribal leaders, health administrators, providers and community members. Peer-reviewed journal articles and conference presentations will be forthcoming once approved by tribal review bodies.</p>

                  <p>Compliance of participants in the study has been excellent, due in part to the directly observed consumption of the supplementation or visualisation using real-time video via smartphone technologies.</p>

                <list-item>
                  <p>We have a strong and dedicated study team and a participant population very interested in helping to prevent colorectal cancer (CRC).</p>
                </list-item>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Diet is an environmental factor shown to impact colorectal cancer (CRC) risk by its effects on the colonic epithelium.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Dietary fibre decreases CRC risk, whereas animal fat and red meat increase CRC risk.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> The human gut contains trillions of bacterial cells composing the gut microbiota.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Dependent on food residues for survival and metabolism, gut microbiota play an important role in human health and metabolic homeostasis through their production of metabolites. Diets high in fat stimulate bile acid production in the liver. While the vast majority of bile acids are reabsorbed at the terminal ileum, approximately 5% are excreted into the colon. In the colon, primary bile acids are converted by gut bacteria into secondary bile acids that exhibit neoplastic properties. Conversely, fermentation of fibre by gut bacteria produces metabolites. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), including acetate, propionate and butyrate, not only provide food for the colonic epithelium but also exert regulatory effects on colonic mucosal inflammation and proliferation.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 5</xref></p>
              <p>Age-adjusted annual CRC incidence among Alaska Native (AN) people is the highest reported worldwide,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> with an annual Alaska-wide rate of 89/100 000.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> This rate is nearly double that of African Americans (45/100 000 per year), who have the second highest incidence in the USA and stands in stark contrast to other populations, such as rural Africans (RAs), with less than 5/100 000 new cases annually.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Remarkably, the high CRC incidence reported in AN people is relatively recent, as chronic diseases were rarely documented a mere 65 years ago.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> While cancer case reporting as well as healthcare and life expectancy have improved over this time period,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9–11</xref> the very high incidence of CRC signals an urgent need for research to identify probable causes and propose important solutions to reduce AN CRC rates and risks.</p>
              <p>AN people have faced and adapted to vast cultural and lifestyle changes, not the least of which have been dramatic dietary changes.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12–14</xref> These changes have resulted in a transition away from traditional, nutrient-dense subsistence foods to commercially prepared, high-energy foods and beverages low in nutritional value.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15–19</xref> Importantly, fibre, which plays a major role in establishing and maintaining colon health, is a key ingredient missing in what is described as a ‘westernised’ diet. Recent dietary studies conducted with AN people demonstrating a very low intake of approximately 13 g fibre daily<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 17 19 20</xref> led us to collect self-reported diet intake and analyse stool contents in two groups of AN people living in two regions of the state: urban south central Alaska and the rural remote Arctic Slope region.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p>
              <p>In that study, participants scheduled for routine screening colonoscopy collected morning faecal and urine sample for metabolite analysis, then underwent colonoscopy.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Results were compared with RA subjects enrolled separately, demonstrating clear differences between the two populations. While polyps were detected among 50% of AN participants, none were detected in the RA participants. The metabolic profiles of both urine and faecal samples were also significantly different. Levels of the faecal SCFA acetate, propionate and butyrate were significantly lower in the AN than the RA samples, while levels of the faecal primary bile acids (cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid) and secondary bile acid deoxycholic acid were significantly greater in AN, compared with RA samples.</p>
              <p>Based on our knowledge of fibre and operating under the assumption that diet intake determines colon microbiota composition, the Alaska Native Medical Center (ANMC) and the University of Pittsburgh (U Pitt) designed the Alaska Fiber Intervention Research Study randomised clinical trial to demonstrate the effects of supplemented diet achieving at least 50 g/day of dietary fibre on CRC risk in AN study volunteers. We describe study methods to achieve our following study aims: (1) determine if high fibre intake can induce clinically meaningful suppression of proliferative and inflammatory colonic biomarkers of cancer risk (primary outcome) and (2) investigate our hypothesis that the high risk of colon cancer in AN people is a consequence of insufficient fibre intake leading to butyrate deficiency.</p>

                <title>Study design overview</title>
                <p>Using a parallel fibre and control group design, randomised by minimisation,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22 23</xref> we are measuring the effects of a 4-week fibre (resistant starch) supplement compared with a 4-week placebo (digestible starch) supplement to participants’ normal diet on proliferative changes in colonic mucosal cells. We anticipate the fibre supplement group will demonstrate significantly reduced proliferative biomarkers in biopsies obtained after the 4-week resistant starch supplement than the control group (primary endpoint). We will additionally measure and compare colonic microbiota composition, activity and the metabolome between groups to investigate the mechanisms responsible for differences in biomarkers.</p>
                <p>The study is tied to usual care. Patients undergoing a routine screening colonoscopy, who are eligible and willing to participate, receive baseline assessments and specimen/data collection at the time of colonoscopy (see <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>). This enrolment process is followed by an 8-week stabilisation period intended to re-establish normal gut microbiota post colonoscopy. At the end of stabilisation, study personnel randomise participants to either the fibre or placebo condition. During the next 28 days, each participant consumes their usual diet plus the supplement (fibre or placebo). After 4 weeks of supplement, participants voluntarily undergo a flexible sigmoidoscopy (flex sig) with specimen/data collection to test outcomes.</p>

We will also have more than adequate power for secondary endpoints described in <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> We anticipate enrolling up to 100 participants to achieve 60 study completions, with attrition due to postcolonoscopy ineligibility, participant scheduling conflicts, losses to follow-up and supplement intolerance. The enrolment phase consists of baseline data and procedures collected the day before, day of, during and after colonoscopy before randomisation (see <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>).</p>

                  <title>Day before colonoscopy</title>
                  <p>Participants are usually prepped for colonoscopy the evening before colonoscopy. A study team member observes intake of the polyethylene glycol (PEG) solution that is free of sulfates, which are harmful to colon microbiota. No pre-prep instructions are required. Prior to prep ingestion, study personnel obtain participant height (via study stadiometer) and weight (via study scale) then calculate baseline body mass index (BMI) per the standard formula (weight in kilograms divided by height in metres, squared). Study personnel assess colonic fermentation measuring hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) and methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) production via a breath sample, which they analyse on collection using a commercial analyzer (Quintron BreathTracker SC). Participants are also asked to provide a urine sample, from which 33 mL is aliquotted and stored in −80°C for later analysis of microbial metabolites. Participants then consume 2.0–2.5 L of the sulfate-free PEG solution in 30–60 min.</p>
                  <p>During the next few hours, study personnel collect and aliquot the first solid stool passed (which will be analysed for faecal microbes and metabolites), placing it in −80°C and collect remaining participant evacuate for the next 3 hours. Once the 3-hour evacuate is collected (which will be analysed for total colonic microbiota and their metabolites), study staff weigh, homogenise, aliquot and freeze specimens at −80°C; the 3-hour evacuate collection period provides sufficient time to obtain a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) developed and validated for use with AN study participants<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> and a baseline bowel function assessment. The FFQ is intended to provide a list of foods and approximate proportions consumed within the past year. In addition to commercial foods, the FFQ contains common AN subsistence foods, including Alaska fish and seafood, wild game and birds, bird eggs and tundra berries and greens traditionally prepared and preserved. The standardised bowel function assessment<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> (assessing usual bowel habits, frequency, consistency) has been employed in prior U Pitt studies.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 26</xref> On completion of the prep and precolonoscopy procedures, participants have nothing more by mouth and report to the surgery suite at their designated time with an escort.</p>

                <p>While participants in the placebo group also continue their usual diet, supplement packets for this group (also prepared by Ingredion) contain 35 g of fully digestible starch (ie, corn starch), weighed, analysed, prepared and presented in the same way. Fibre and placebo supplements are equal in calories, packaged identically in daily dose packets and appear and taste similar, thus maintaining the double blind. Due to the substantial increase of fibre from 13 to 55 g/day, previous tolerance tests with AN volunteers prior to this study were performed and demonstrated the supplement was well tolerated as a single or divided dose mixed into 300 mL water taken for a period of a week.</p>
                <p>Ingredion sends complete batches of single-dose packets of each supplement type to U Pitt, where U Pitt Study staff apply assignment code labels corresponding to the codes generated by the electronic minimisation programme, plus a daily sequence number (day 1–day 35). Batches of 35 labelled packets are shipped in advance to the ANTHC Study team. Once participants are randomised and assigned a supplement code, ANTHC Study staff locate the packet batch. An additional week of packets are available should a flex sig procedure be unexpectedly delayed.</p>
                <p>Each participant is provided a shaker bottle and instructions (with in-person demonstration, as needed) for mixing the supplement packet with 300 mL water (or other preferred liquid). Study staff work closely with each participant to plan 28 consecutive days where each participant is directly observed mixing and drinking the supplement, which can be done in-person or via FaceTime or Google Duo and includes weekends and holidays. The first supplement is done in the presence of study staff for quality assurance, reserving a 5 mg sample to validate content and requesting participants assume usual diet and take the supplement about the same time each day.</p>
                <p>Study staff also provide instruction on completing a daily food log and daily bowel function form and provide collection supplies for the first stool the next week. At the completion of each week, study staff collect all completed daily food logs, bowel function forms and an end-of-week stool sample. Participants are reweighed and given their weekly stool sample collection kit and the next week’s supply of supplement. Participant weight and supplement tolerance are thus monitored throughout the supplementation period. Any participant with a 2 kg change in weight or gastrointestinal complaints during the supplementation phase is referred to the study dietician for evaluation. On completion of all weekly supplement intake, assessment forms, weight and sample collections, each participant receives a $75 gift card.</p>
                <p>On entering the fourth week of supplementation, study staff prepare for the study flex sig procedure. Measurements (except height) and specimens collected pre colonoscopy are repeated. Participants revisit the CRC clinic preoperatively and prior to starting the sulfate-free PEG prep solution, study staff collect a saliva sample. The rest of the flex sig prep is conducted similarly to the baseline colonoscopy.</p>
                <p>Previous studies show changes in the sigmoid mucosa reflect changes in the proximal colon.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26 35</xref> A flex sig is thus sufficient for postsupplementation biopsies. Three biopsies from normal appearing mucosa in two regions of the colon, the sigmoid (25 cm from the anal verge) and the splenic flexure (or the furthest region easily accessed), are obtained by an ANMC surgeon/endoscopist. On procedure completion, participants receive a $300 gift card in appreciation for their participation.</p>

                <title>Data entry/specimen storage and transfer to U Pitt</title>
                <p>The large number of procedures performed and specimens/data collected throughout this trial require detailed documentation, accurate labelling and strict attention to protocol. Working with ANMC providers and staff in clinics, preop and endoscopy suites and laboratory and pathology departments, ANMC and U Pitt Study teams created more than 90 standard operating procedures and clinical report forms (CRFs) contained in the study manual of operations. Because procedure data and biospecimen collection do not all occur in a set location with reliable access to Wi-Fi or the internet, much of the documentation is initially charted on paper forms and maintained in participant folders. All data and specimens collected are associated with only an anonymous study identification number and accessible only to the ANTHC Study team.</p>
                <p>Study team members enter all CRF data into Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) databases housed within protected servers at ANTHC and U Pitt, each containing different data elements. REDCap is a secure, web-based, data capture application designed for research studies.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> The U Pitt database, made accessible to the ANTHC Study team, houses data relevant to biospecimens (blood, urine, stool and saliva aliquots and biopsy samples), which study staff batch and ship to U Pitt for analysis throughout the study. All but the formalin preserved tissue samples are frozen at −80°C and housed first in ANTHC Study freezers then shipped overnight on dry ice by FedEx to U Pitt. A second REDCap database created by the ANTHC Study team captures CRF information, including laboratory and anthropometry data, daily food intake and bowel function information and breath and saliva sample collection data. A third database (also housed at ANTHC), directly captures FFQ data collected during the baseline colonoscopy prep period. Institutional database administrators set individual data access to specific data and the level of access (eg, data entry, data download, view only), including access for external collaborators.</p>

                <title>Proposed analyses</title>
                <p>Study analyses are designed to test the hypothesis that the risk of CRC in AN people is primarily a consequence of fibre intake less than the recommended 30 g/day. The primary outcome measured in our study is colonic epithelial proliferation rate measured by Ki67 staining of proliferative cells to determine whether a high fibre diet can induce clinically meaningful (ie, &gt;20% the difference distinguishing high from low risk populations, termed ‘responders’) suppression of this proliferative cancer risk biomarker.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 37</xref> In addition, secondary outcomes include inflammatory markers of the gut mucosa and the impact of a high fibre diet on expression of host genes responsive to diet and microbial metabolites, clinical blood labs, faecal and oral microbiome and faecal, blood and urine metabolome. We will explore the impact of the gut and oral microbiome and faecal, urine and blood metabolome on host biomarkers and host-microbe cometabolism. We will assess postsupplement changes in markers by generalised linear models. The nature of the data will determine whether these models are linear, logistic, Poisson or require further transformation. <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> contains more detailed information regarding the measured endpoints.</p>

                <p>The U Pitt and Alaska Area institutional review boards (IRBs) reviewed and approved this study. Boards of directors for ANTHC and Southcentral Foundation (SCF) provided tribal review and approval. ANTHC and SCF are tribal health organisations (THOs) operating the ANMC located in Anchorage, Alaska. While IRBs focus on the protection of human participants in research, THOs focus attention on protecting AN communities and culture.

                <title>Study oversight</title>
                <p>All clinical trials supported by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) require monitoring. Monitoring should reflect the degree of risk involved in participation of the clinical trial. We established a data safety monitoring board (DSMB), fully executed institutional material transfer agreements with all collaborators and created an internal investigator team, providing these additional layers of study oversight distinct from the IRB and tribal review process.</p>
                <p>The DSMB is comprised of three external experts in nutrition and gastrointestinal research, the study principal investigator, the ANTHC project director and the NCI programme officer. Meeting annually, the DSMB reviews an annual report of research activities and addresses analyses performed, preliminary outcome data, adverse side effects or toxicity caused by treatments, inclusion and exclusion criteria, enrolment procedures and modifications to any elements of the study.</p>
                <p>Signed material transfer agreements between all collaborating institution clearly state the terms under which tribal data and specimens will be shared, maintained and destroyed and results reported. U Pitt and ANTHC investigators and study staff meet weekly (virtually or by teleconference) to discuss study progress and address challenges. Additional attendees are present on request (eg, U Pitt biostatistician, data managers).</p>

                <p>Tribal review of research findings is the first step in results dissemination, per ANTHC research policy. We will provide early reports and presentations of the findings to ANTHC and SCF Board members, health administrators and healthcare providers. As these study findings most directly affect AN people, dissemination plans include mass media announcements and messaging through ANTHC’s Marketing Department. Because this study will demonstrate important findings relevant to other populations having transitioned to a westernised diet, we will inform the scientific community through professional presentations and peer-reviewed journal articles that have received tribal review and approval prior to submission.</p>
