                  <title>Objectives</title>
                  <p>We aimed to assess mobility patterns and reasons for high mobility among young women engaged in sex work within a randomised controlled trial to gauge how mobility may hinder access to health services and enhance HIV risk in a highly vulnerable population.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Setting</title>
                  <p>Participants were recruited from a clinic in Kampala, Uganda set up for women at high risk of HIV infection.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Participants</title>
                  <p>Adolescent girls and young women engaged in sex for money and/or commodities are at particular risk in countries with high HIV prevalence and high fertility rates. High mobility increases exposure to HIV risk. Women participants were eligible for the parent study if aged 15–24 years, HIV negative and engaged in sex work. For this substudy, 34 qualitative interviews were held with 14 sex workers (6 HIV positive, 8 HIV negative), 6 health worker/policy makers, 3 peer educators, 5 ‘queen mothers’ and 6 male partners</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Measures</title>
                  <p>Participants used Google Maps to identify work venues at 12-month and 18-month study visits. We also conducted 34 interviews on mobility with: high-risk women, male partners, health workers and sex-worker managers. Topics included: distance, frequency and reasons for mobility. We used Python software to analyse mapping data.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Interviews found in depth narratives describing lack of education and employment opportunities, violence, lack of agency, social, sexual and familial support networks and poverty as a complex web of reasons for high mobility among young sex workers.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>Young women at high risk are highly mobile. Reasons for mobility impact access and retention to health services and research activities. Strategies to improve retention in care should be cognisant and tailored to suit mobility patterns.</p>

              <p>Adolescent girls and young women engaged in sex in exchange for money and/or commodities are at particular risk in countries with high HIV prevalence and high fertility rates.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1–3</xref> Young women may differentiate between commercial and transactional sex work based on stigma or relationship status.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 5</xref> In some cases, sex work is the only source of family income, and in others, women use transactional sex to supplement income.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Transactional sex may thus be situational or temporary, and associated with acute shortfalls in cash, need for school fees or food insecurity.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 8</xref> Sex work is often socially stigmatising,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> whereas informal transactional sex may be socially accepted in some, situations, or contexts.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Globally, female sex workers (FSW) of all ages are over 10 times more likely to be living with HIV than women in the general population.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> In sub-Saharan Africa in 2012, the average HIV prevalence among FSW was &gt;35%,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> with 20%–40% of FSW entering sex work as adolescents with a mean age of entry of 16 years or younger.</p>

                <p>This study was based within the Good Health for Women Project clinic in Kampala, Uganda. This was an independent clinic established in 2008 to provide HIV and other STI prevention, care and treatment to FSW, their partners and their children in a safe location. Since inception, the clinic has been a site for conducting research on the context and underlying factors of HIV risk.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 18 35–40</xref> The clinic offered routine HIV counselling and testing, syndromic management of STIs, family planning, antenatal care, free condoms, risk reduction counselling, counselling for excessive alcohol use, tuberculosis screening and treatment, ART and co-trimoxazole/dapsone preventive therapy. Enrolled women attended quarterly visits for HIV prevention and treatment services and study visits every 6 months. This clinic generally saw about 50 sex workers per day during the time of the study. To protect the confidentiality and safety of participants, it was located in an accessible area of central Kampala not identifiable to the general public as a place frequented specifically by participants at high risk of HIV infection.</p>

                  <p>The first aim of this substudy was to explore the dynamics of the social and sexual networks, mobility and context of YWHR in Kampala. Work venues of our RCT participants have been mapped in two ways: qualitative and quantitative data collection using key informant interviews of four categories of participants in urban Kampala: YWHR, peer educators, sex worker managers and male partners. In-depth interviews of YWHR study participants explored where, why, how, when, how frequently and for how long they move using interview guides.</p>

An exploratory analysis using Python and Pandas library was conducted to gain a better understanding of the data aspects such as the main features of the data. Python is a programming language. Pandas stands for ‘Python Data Analysis Library’. It takes data and creates a python object with rows and columns forming a data frame that acts very similar to tables in statistical software packages like Excel and SPSS. This was then used to store the data after pre-processing. Finally, descriptive statistics were tabulated.</p>
                    <p>Community mapping of work venues identified areas sometimes termed ‘hot spots’ where HIV high-risk youth congregate. Mapping was dynamic as new ‘hotspots’ were discovered over time and new information built onto data obtained from community members and the study field team who had strong relationships with participant community members over &gt;10 years. The interviews, lasting about 1 hour, took place in secure and private spaces at the study clinic offices with only researcher and participant present.</p>

A ‘queen mother’ is the term used by participants and can roughly translate as a sex work manager. The inclusion criteria for peer educators were: must be a sex worker who was influential in the sex worker community, knew the sex workers within her community (hot spot), has been working within the hot spot for at least a year, knew how to communicate well to participants and study staff. The median age of YWHR sample at baseline was 20.5 years, 46% of whom were 15–19 years of age. With regard to educational level, 7% of YWHR had reached A-level or beyond and about half had some primary education (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>).</p>

                <p>By 15 March 2020, of the 236 participants who attended both 12-month and 18-month follow-up visits, 193 (82)% identified different work venues across these time points.</p>
                <p>Work venues span distances from Sudan, Kenya and Rwanda, rural Uganda and Kampala. The median distance travelled was 5 km with an IQR of 4–10 in active Kampala work venues like Makindye and Bwaise, with the clinic coordinates as reference point. Most (85%) of the movement was within a radius of 15 km from Kampala. Fifteen per cent of the movements were beyond 15 km from Kampala (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>).</p>

                <p>More older women (aged 20–24 years) travelled farther (&gt;15 km) compared with YWHR aged 15–19 years. Some participants described frequenting up to 12 workplaces in the previous month. Seven YWHR participants had seroconverted at their 6-month visit, three at 12 months and three at 18 months.</p>
                <p>In interviews we asked YWHR (HIV positive and negative), male partners, bar managers and owners, health workers and ‘queen mothers’ reasons for high mobility. Five basic themes emerged: lack of education and employment opportunities, violence, lack of agency, social/sexual/familial networks and poverty (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2</xref>).</p>

                  <title>Lack of education and employment options leading to mobility</title>
                  <p>With little or no education or job training, participants narrated life stories that they described as ‘failed dreams’. One participant, the 10th child in her family, described her dream as a young girl wishing to become a doctor. With insufficient money to continue her education, she had a second dream of hotel management. As this dream did not materialise, she described survival strategies that included moving from place to place performing sex work. Changing dreams led to changing locations. Another participant, the ninth child in her family, recounted her story of deciding to quit school to help her parents stop worrying about her school fees. She said: (when teachers), “<italic>chase you from school [meaning force you to leave school due to lack of school fees] and you spend a week at home</italic>”, it was very difficult on the whole family. Some YWHR mentioned stealing money as a way to survive without a job and running from one place to another not to be caught by police or by the people they stole from.</p>

                    <p>You go to a club in Wandegeya [a Kampala quarter] and meet a man who gives you 20 000/= [~6 USD] to go and buy beer… It is at that point that you get out of the club and move to another bar…You disappear… When you go to [another bar] and meet someone who gives you 10 000/= to buy beer, you also leave… By the end of the day, all you have done is cheat them of their money without much effort (YWHR, early 20s).</p>
                  </disp-quote>
                  <p>Some young women noted that there are educated sex workers, however, but they often work under different circumstances described as escort services that earn more money and are in less dangerous conditions.</p>

                  <title>Violence between YWHR and customers and between themselves</title>
                  <p>YWHR described situations where violence was a ‘normal’ part of their lives inflicted by customers neglecting to wear condoms. One YWHR narrating her experiences working on the Ssese Islands: “<italic>You may ask a man to wear a condom and those are automatic punches</italic>”. Other YWHR describe how regular partners find them in bars unexpectedly and beat them for that.</p>
                  <disp-quote>
                    <p>You may sometimes be at work and he finds you, ‘What are you doing here at night?’ he asks. He beats you up… You are definitely forced to leave that place because he has embarrassed you before your customers. (YWHR, early 20s)</p>
                  </disp-quote>
                  <p>Physical violence, or the threat of violence, perpetrated by boyfriends, colleagues or pimps was reported as a reason for frequent mobility; sometimes as a response to what may have been thought of as wrongdoing:</p>
                  <disp-quote>
                    <p>….when we steal from customers… should he find you, he can box you (Laughs heartedly)… Should he get you, he can beat you up. So, you have to be really witty. Some men have families and they budget how much they are to spend on a prostitute … say about 5000/= [~1.30 USD]… you come and take it all, you also take his phone. Should he find you, he can surely beat you up (YWHR, early 20s)</p>
                  </disp-quote>
                  <p>A YWHR, whose parents had both died when she was under 10 years old and who was raised by her uncle, narrated her experience of leaving that home soon after her parents died and starting sex work under 15 years of age. She described how customers in bars would often give young women too much alcohol so that they would get very drunk and then force them to have sex without payment; if the woman refused, she would either have to run or be beaten up. A second YWHR recounted the story of a friend who was sold to an overseas sex worker-dealer and broke her legs when she was thrown off a balcony.</p>
                  <disp-quote>
                    <p>Sometimes you might even be put in a room with twenty men and you're to sleep with all of them in one night … (young sex worker, HIV positive, early 20s)</p>
                  </disp-quote>
                  <p>One male partner described that some relationships between YWHR may become violent. Sex workers themselves discussed how the competition for customers and jealousy regarding success between them can lead to violence and movement.</p>
                  <disp-quote>
                    <p>They are so violent. They fight too much …one gets to a point where they cannot live with anyone … Alcohol and the things they use [other drugs]… fighting also causes them to move … they are drunk full-time (Male partner)</p>
                  </disp-quote>
                  <p>Drug use, tension and infighting among YWHR and between them and customers were all reasons for mobility.</p>

                  <title>Lack of agency in relation to mobility</title>
                  <p>Some participants noted that YWHR do not often have full control over their lives and the movement in their lives. They could be at the mercy of clients, queen mothers, whoever is providing housing, the police, bar owners or managers. One male partner noted that some bars bring a group of young women, about 10, on the weekends, take them back to rural areas on Monday, and bring a new group the following weekend.</p>
                  <disp-quote>
                    <p>They have to keep on moving because it’s not good when the clients get used to their faces… Clients only give good money to fresh faces… With time they go back to the places they’ve been before. They just keep on rotating [moving] (Bar owner)</p>
                  </disp-quote>
                  <p>Some young women work under a manager who has control over their mobility; when, where, how frequently and for how long they work in certain locations. A male partner described how negotiations take place between the manager and the venue owner regarding the young women who are brought from rural areas to work in some locations in Kampala.</p>
                  <disp-quote>
                    <p>It’s the boss [the pimp/queen mother] for those [girls]… they go anywhere she tells them to (Male partner)</p>
                  </disp-quote>
                  <p>In other situations, as sex work is illegal, law enforcement will regulate young women’s movements by coercing money out of them or forcing them to move. Some women mentioned how during seasons when police may need money, they will harass YWHR; this will be another reason for their mobility.</p>
                  <disp-quote>
                    <p>Sometimes the police come and search for us and they do not want you there… Like Christmas season…they round you up; we get little money and they want some of it …You run to some place where they do not know you,… (YWHR, early 20s).</p>

                  <title>How social networks and social support relate to mobility</title>
                  <p>Participants described home environments where there is no emotional, social or financial support. In some cases, YWHR have had to move from home to home or to leave school due to the death of parents. These situations can lead to mobility to escape an unstable or unhealthy setting.</p>
                  <disp-quote>
                    <p>They don’t have parents. Some have caretakers who aren’t their biological parents; they have faced many social issues. They keep on moving from one place to another …Their needs are not met… they are out of school… (Health worker, aged 45 years)</p>
                  </disp-quote>
                  <p>YWHR described how they preferred to stay close to their friends, who may be emotionally replacing a family network, so that when a friend moves from one place to another they follow along and go together. One participant also explained how YWHR count on each other for safety, that they ‘<italic>have to be there for each other’</italic>. Participants have also noted that their connections to one another are similar to a business partner where if a customer requests a quality such as size or beauty, a participant may connect her associate to that customer. One health worker also mentioned peer pressure as a factor leading to mobility; ‘she might have a colleague in Bwaise who will convince her to move (there) when they talk to each other’; citing higher payment in another location.</p>

                  <title>Poverty leads to mobility</title>
                  <p>The overarching reason for why participants constantly move was financial. One participant mentioned that they travel to different towns to target market days. Other illustrations of this association included descriptions of accommodations that are daily rate lodges where one has to leave if she cannot pay for the night. Searching for bars where they could have loyal or regular, customers, leaving venues that were already claimed by other sex workers; or going to a place where customers pay higher prices were all situations connecting poverty and mobility.</p>
                  <disp-quote>
                    <p>The reason we kept leaving, was money. They may be buying sex workers here for 5000/= and elsewhere they are buying them at 10 000/= or 15 000/= (YWHR, early 20s)</p>
                    <p>The biggest reason we left that place was that there were colleagues that had specific customers and they would tell us to look for our customers that were dedicated and attached to us… The reason [for mobility] was to get a new place (YWHR, early 20s)</p>
                  </disp-quote>
                  <p>In addition to the reasons for mobility, we asked about frequency of travel and distances travelled. The farthest distances travelled included Mombasa, Mauritius, Dubai, Juba and Canada.</p>
                  <p>Reasons for participants’ mobility concentrated around the themes of lack of education and employment opportunities sometimes related to seasons including the festive season, violence, lack of agency, limited family support/social networks as well as poverty. Subthemes and connections between these themes show a complex web of drivers of mobility potentially leading to high-risk sexual behaviour.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Our findings highlight that YWHR in Kampala are highly mobile, with multiple push and pull factors associated with mobility. We found that participants were far more mobile than we anticipated, with both greater distances, greater frequency and destinations of movement.</p>
              <p>Access to sexual and reproductive health services: previous studies dating back to early 2000s, showed that a number of factors were associated with initiating sex work in Uganda and the region; including low levels of education, broken family systems, limited job market and low access to sexual and reproductive health services and these factors are similar to the factors we have found that influence mobility.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42 43</xref> Limited access to sexual and reproductive health for AGYW is an important factor related to the high level of unexpected pregnancies among this age group. Maternal mortality is the second largest cause of death among adolescent girls aged 15–19 years globally. Of all annual births, around 16 million are among girls in this age range; about 2 million are among girls under the age of 15 years.<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> In addition, 41% of young women aged 20–24 years and nearly half of those who experienced sexual violence, were pregnant, the highest rate in sub-Saharan Africa.<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> With limited education, and very high national unemployment, many young women have very few options in making enough money to feed themselves and their children. This of course is exacerbated with the current COVID-19 crisis. Often the constellation of factors leading young women into sex work are the factors that push them into steady mobility.</p>
              <p>Violence motivates mobility: some sex worker studies conducted in sub-Saharan Africa have highlighted how migration into urban areas to sell sex has resulted in conflicts and violence with local sex workers.<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> Our participants also described how they often moved in order not to compete with other women or to find a venue where they could cultivate loyal clients. Violence and fear of violence has been reported as closely intertwined with mobility, poverty, substance abuse and risk for HIV in India.<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47 48</xref> Intimate partner violence (IPV) is highly associated with risk for HIV and Ugandan women and female sex workers report extremely high rates of reported IPV (45%–75% globally).<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17 49 50</xref> Among Ugandan women, aged 20–24 years, 40% have experienced sexual violence.<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51 52</xref> In our study, violence was reported as perpetrated by police, regular and non-regular partners, other sex workers and managers or pimps, and was a reason for mobility. The reasons were to run from a conflictual or violent situation or towards a potentially more peaceful situation. Ramesh <italic>et al</italic> demonstrated that participants who were more mobile were more likely to report violence and that sex workers reporting both mobility and violence were more likely to be infected with HIV.<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> There are many studies globally reporting correlation between violence and increased risk for HIV.<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> Physical, sexual and psychological violence increase susceptibility to HIV among women and girls often through a clustering of factors that include poverty, substance use, social, gender norms that weave into an intractable pattern of higher risk environment.<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></p>
              <p>Relationship between mobility and HIV prevention: the proposed pathways showing higher mobility associated with HIV risk in other studies demonstrate that female sex workers who travel more often reported less consistent condom use, have higher STI symptoms and greater perceived risk for HIV acquisition even after controlling for demographic and socioeconomic factors including violence.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29 53–55</xref> In our study, over 80% of the participants were mobile, and we do note that reasons for mobility are qualitatively related to high-risk sexual behaviour and are strong obstacles for HIV prevention behaviour including consistent adherent condom use and use of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) medication.</p>
              <p>Limitations and strengths: our study was not originally powered to statistically measure the relationship between mobility and STI, HIV or unplanned pregnancy. We noted the high mobility on assessing the reasons for difficulty in retaining our study participants. This became a substudy and we were then able to discuss, in-depth, the frequency, distances, reasons and context surrounding our participants’ mobility.</p>
              <p>To improve our understanding of the dynamic and complex nature of movement, sexual behaviour and the relationships between populations and disease transmission, Cassels <italic>et al</italic> proposed a network-dyadic conceptual model to interpret previous studies and inform the development of services and research.<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref> They propose that the transmission of HIV is dependent on movement and people’s behaviour which is influenced by the connecting of local subepidemics, and the effects on both sending and receiving communities.<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref> We propose that the intricate, dynamic and complex nature of relationships between both formal and informal sex work, poverty, substance use, family members, friends/colleagues and queen mother relationship networks, violence and mobility are constantly changing and impacting on each other in different and convoluted ways. How public health intervention development and implementation features into the complex interactions of the lives of participants is complex, delicate and the greater understanding we acquire into how mobility impacts on our ability to intervene the more effective these interventions will likely become. Study retention strategies and healthcare services should be informed by a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the complicated and tenuous lives of participants and services, and interventions should be tailored to suit mobility patterns. Peers, bar/lodge managers who have influence on YWHR lives and mobility should be involved in research activities if retention of YWHR is to be attained. We must build a mindful PrEP intervention appreciating that our beneficiaries are constantly on the move. This may look very different from a traditional clinic-based service that expects all clients to come on a regular basis for follow-up visits. A mobile clinic, conducted within active work venues, has been piloted to assess its feasibility for reducing the transport burden on highly mobile participants and increasing retention in care. We have attempted to understand whether and how mobility influences the effectiveness of HIV prevention services specifically with YWHR and the utility of identifying appropriate approaches and methods, inclusive of mobile populations, which are desperately needed at this critical moment in the HIV epidemic.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></p>
