                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">The mental health treatment gap—the difference between those with mental health need and those who receive treatment—is high in low- and middle-income countries. Task-shifting has been used to address the shortage of mental health professionals, with a growing body of research demonstrating the effectiveness of mental health interventions delivered through task-shifting. However, very little research has focused on how to embed, support, and sustain task-shifting in government-funded systems with potential for scale up. The goal of the <italic>Building and Sustaining Interventions for Children (BASIC)</italic> study is to examine implementation policies and practices that predict adoption, fidelity, and sustainment of a mental health intervention in the education sector via teacher delivery and the health sector via community health volunteer delivery.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">BASIC is a Hybrid Type II Implementation-Effectiveness trial. The study design is a stepped wedge, cluster randomized trial involving 7 sequences of 40 schools and 40 communities surrounding the schools. Enrollment consists of 120 teachers, 120 community health volunteers, up to 80 site leaders, and up to 1280 youth and one of their primary guardians. The evidence-based mental health intervention is a locally adapted version of Trauma-focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, called <italic>Pamoja Tunaweza.</italic> Lay counselors are trained and supervised in <italic>Pamoja Tunaweza</italic> by local trainers who are experienced in delivering the intervention and who participated in a Train-the-Trainer model of skills transfer. After the first sequence completes implementation, in-depth interviews are conducted with initial implementing sites’ counselors and leaders. Findings are used to inform delivery of implementation facilitation for subsequent sequences’ sites. We use a mixed methods approach including qualitative comparative analysis to identify necessary and sufficient implementation policies and practices that predict 3 implementation outcomes of interest: adoption, fidelity, and sustainment. We also examine child mental health outcomes and cost of the intervention in both the education and health sectors.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">The BASIC study will provide knowledge about how implementation of task-shifted mental health care can be supported in government systems that already serve children and adolescents. Knowledge about implementation policies and practices from BASIC can advance the science of implementation in low-resource contexts.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par33">Eighty percent of the world’s population lives in low and middle-income countries (LMICs), yet very few of the world’s mental health resources are in LMICs. Mental health disorders are now estimated to be first (32.4%) in the global burden of disease for years lost to disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. With low tax bases and high population needs, governments in LMICs spend less than 2% of their health budgets on mental health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], with most resources targeting care for the adult, seriously mentally ill population. A critical need exists to identify strategies to address the mental health treatment gap for children in LMICs that can be scaled up without substantial new resources, yet limited implementation research has occurred in global mental health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par34">One commonly used strategy for addressing the shortage of mental health professionals in LMICs and reducing the mental health treatment gap is task-shifting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Task-shifting involves using non-specialists or paraprofessionals (lay counselors) with little to no prior mental health training or experience to deliver care, under supervision. A growing body of research and a recent Cochrane review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] provide evidence that task-shifted mental health care is an effective strategy to address the mental health treatment gap. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) across culturally diverse LMICs (e.g., Zambia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], Uganda [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], India [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], Southern Iraq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]) and populations of focus (e.g., adults, adolescents, displaced persons, rural areas) indicate that evidence-based treatments (EBTs) can be effectively delivered. Effect sizes for primary treatment outcomes are typically medium to large (with a range of comparison conditions). Some studies also have shown effectiveness for broader outcomes (e.g., infant health in rural Pakistan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] when maternal depression was treated). Outcomes appear to be sustained in trials that included follow-up (e.g., 6–12 months) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Research indicates provider and client acceptability and satisfaction with EBTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. These studies suggest that EBT delivery via task-shifting is acceptable and can be effective, although there are some concerns about feasibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], including the necessary ongoing support for lay counselors and their organizations to successfully implement mental health interventions.</p>
              <p id="Par35">The World Health Organization (WHO) suggests “beginning with the end in mind,” only considering solutions that might be candidates for scale-up and sustainability within the low-resource context (i.e., limited funding, few mental health professionals). Task-shifting is a promising strategy, however, very limited research has focused on how to embed, support, and effectively sustain EBTs via task-sharing in government-funded systems in which they could be scaled up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The lack of research and knowledge in this area is a substantial barrier to bridging the mental health treatment gap and improving population health and wellbeing.</p>

                <p id="Par36"><italic>“Building and Sustaining Interventions for Children (</italic><bold><italic>BASIC</italic></bold><italic>): Task Sharing Mental Health Care in Low-Resource Settings”</italic> builds on our 15-year history of collaborations with Ace Africa in Kenya, and recent work evaluating the effectiveness of Trauma-focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] (“<italic>Pamoja Tunaweza</italic>”) with children who experienced parental death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and have mental health impact. Our goal is to identify locally sustainable implementation policies and practices (IPPs) that lead to effective implementation of task-shifted EBT delivery (<italic>Pamoja Tunaweza</italic> in this study) in 2 governmental sectors in Kenya, identified by our Kenyan partners as potential platforms for scale-up—Education (via teacher delivery) and Health (via community health volunteer [CHV] delivery). Both Education and Health may be viable sectors for mental health care delivery, but the IPPs that predict implementation success and intervention effectiveness in either/both sectors are unknown. In this study, we identify contextually relevant, practical, and actionable IPPs that can inform implementation planning. We also assess child outcomes and intervention costs in both sectors.</p>
                <p id="Par37">In 2016, Betancourt and Chambers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] proposed 5 specific areas to advance implementation science knowledge around mental health delivery in LMICs (see Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Our past work addressed the first 2 areas: identifying treatment providers and addressing training and support. Informed by a theoretical model of effective training (the Training Transfer Conceptual Model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]), we used implementation strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] including making training dynamic, modeling and simulating change, and providing clinical supervision. BASIC extends this work by broadening attention to include other organizational factors that may influence lay counselor EBT delivery in either the Education or Health sector (latter 3 areas in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

                <p id="Par40">We use Weiner and colleagues’ organizational theory of implementation effectiveness (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), which posits that effective implementation (e.g., consistent, high-quality delivery of EBT) depends on the extent to which EBT deliverers experience a positive implementation climate, that is, a shared understanding that EBT delivery is expected, supported, and rewarded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The extent to which implementation climate is positive depends, in turn, on the implementation policies and practices (IPPs) put into place to support EBT delivery. IPPs can include a wide range of structures and processes such as workload adjustment, resource provision, and rewards and/or incentives. The number, type, and strength of IPPs put into place depends on the organization’s readiness for change.

                <title>Trial design</title>
                <p id="Par41">We employ an incomplete stepped wedge, cluster randomized controlled trial (SW-CRT) design and mixed methods. For reporting, we follow the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) for stepped wedge cluster-randomized trial designs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) guidelines (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. We conduct a Hybrid Type II Implementation-Effectiveness trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] in both the Education and Health sectors in Bungoma South Sub-County in Kenya. All 137 primary schools in Bungoma South agreed to participate, and 40 schools were randomly selected. The surrounding community in which each school is nested is the health sector setting for the trial. The school and the surrounding community are considered a “village cluster.” Each of the 40 “village clusters” has 1 team of teachers and 1 team of CHVs delivering Pamoja Tunaweza (TF-CBT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]). The CHV role in the Kenyan Health sector is that of extending health services from health facilities to communities, under the supervision of a community health extension worker (CHEW). We randomly order the 40 clusters and begin with 10 clusters in the first of 7 sequences of the SW-CRT (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), with 3 teachers and 3 CHVs in each cluster (totaling 240 providers) and up to 16 youth per sector per cluster (totaling 1280 youth) over the 7 sequences. The sample size of 40 schools and 40 surrounding communities is selected to allow for examining outcomes at the site/organization level. This sample size also provides sufficient numbers of counselors by type (teachers, CHVs) and youth so that we are sufficiently powered to answer study questions (see Aim 3; Power/Sample Size Calculation section).

                <title>Overview of study aims</title>
                <p id="Par42">In Aim 1, we investigate TF-CBT implementation in the first sequence of the SW-CRT to identify actionable (i.e., modifiable) IPPs associated with successful implementation in schools and communities with different attributes (see Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). We then use these findings to inform implementation facilitation for subsequent sites (clusters that initiate intervention in sequences 2–7; 5 schools and communities per cluster) with BASIC collaborative teams (BCTs) comprised of Ace Africa staff and selected teachers/CHVs. To facilitate implementation, we leverage aspects of community development team models by Chamberlain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] and Aarons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] in the United States (US). In Aim 2, we test identified IPPs from the initial sequence, and other IPPs that emerge in subsequent sequences, as mechanisms of adoption and fidelity. We also examine IPPs that predict sustainment for the subset of sites (20 in each sector) that are followed for at least 2 years after the initial implementation year. In Aim 3, we examine TF-CBT effectiveness (child outcomes) and cost for each sector.

                <p id="Par43">In 2010 the Kenyan government began a decentralization process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Kenya is divided into 47 counties that have significant political decision-making, organizational power, and funding. Kenya’s newly enacted National Mental Health Policy demonstrates a commitment to mental health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Bungoma County is the third most populated county in Kenya with 1.7 million residents. Within Bungoma County, the study takes place in Bungoma South Sub-County (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), which contains both urban and rural areas. Important for population health, nearly 50% of Bungoma County’s population are children <underline>&lt;</underline> 15 years. Mental health professionals are largely unavailable. In the Bungoma Township, there are 2 psychiatric nurses and 1 psychiatrist.

                <title>Intervention description</title>
                <p id="Par44">We selected TF-CBT, a child/adolescent EBT for psychosocial sequelae of trauma exposure (e.g., posttraumatic stress [PTS], depressive symptoms, anxiety), as it has the strongest empirical base [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. There are over 15 RCTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], including 1 in Zambia by team members[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. A feasibility study in Tanzania demonstrated initial acceptability of TF-CBT for lay counselors, guardians, and children, with promising clinical outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In this feasibility study and the recently completed RCT in Tanzania and Kenya, The <italic>Pamoja Tunaweza</italic> intervention was 12 weeks in duration. Each week, 8 children and 1 of their guardians met concurrently and separately, with joint child-guardian activities in the final 4 sessions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. TF-CBT was delivered via 3-counselor teams, with 2 counselors leading the child group, and 1 leading the guardian group. TF-CBT components (psychoeducation, parenting, relaxation, affective modulation, cognitive coping, in vivo exposure planning, and grief-specific skills) were delivered in groups, and 2 to 3 individual sessions mid-group were used for the imaginal exposure component (i.e., talking about/processing traumatic events).</p>

                  <p id="Par45">More recent work (2015–16) involved testing a shortened 8-session version of TF-CBT (vs. 12 sessions) in Bungoma South, to be responsive to calls in implementation science and global health for greater intervention efficiency with the idea that simpler, shorter interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] may be better candidates for scale-up, even if they come with a drop in effect size. This 8-session version, designed collaboratively with the Ace Africa counselors, includes all TF-CBT elements integrated into fewer sessions. A pilot study with 63 youth provided preliminary support for using the 8-session version in the BASIC trial, with BASIC providing a rigorous test.</p>

Following an initial BASIC sensitization meeting with each site, Ace Africa works with site leadership to recruit 3 lay counselors. Sites begin delivering TF-CBT at different times, given the SW-CRT design. We recruit one leader at each site to participate in the study but not to deliver TF-CBT (i.e., head teachers and sometimes deputy teachers in schools; community health extension workers [CHEWs] in the health facility to which the CHVs are connected). Teachers who participate are selected based on being viewed as good with children experiencing difficulties, and ideally are not teachers of potential participants (to minimize any discomfort for children due to teaching and counseling overlap). Teachers deliver TF-CBT during the school week, in classrooms, during a 1-hour games time slot. CHVs are selected using similar criteria (i.e., good with children experiencing difficulties) and deliver TF-CBT at a time convenient for them. Delivery can occur in schools or other community spaces.</p>

The lists are then divided by sex. Within each sex, children are randomly ordered to be screened for PTS and prolonged grief using the same established brief screener and eligibility scores from the prior RCT. Children can screen in from child- or guardian-reported PTS symptoms or child-reported prolonged grief symptoms. TF-CBT groups are single sex, with up to 8 children per group. Once 16 children within a single sex screen in (or list has been exhausted), the study investigators use a computerized random number generator to randomize children to receive TF-CBT through Education or Health. The random assignment lists are then shared with the local interviewers who enroll and consent participants, and those interviewers call participants to inform participants of the group to which they have been randomly assigned, along with corresponding logistical details.

Adoption is defined as delivery of 2 on-site 8-session TF-CBT groups by a 3-counselor team and is measured by counselor self-report (and confirmed by supervisors). Fidelity includes assessment of adherence and competency and is primarily measured by supervisors’ observations of TF-CBT groups using 1–6 ratings on adherence and 1–6 ratings on competence. Each week, even when live observation does not occur, the supervisor completes the same adherence and fidelity ratings (1–6) based on review of counselor reports and supervision interactions with the counselors. Based on studies that examined sustainment of other health interventions in African countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] and sustainment reviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], we define sustainment as maintained delivery 2 years after the study intervention period (2 groups delivered within a calendar year, with at least 80% capacity as compared to their group enrollment during initial implementation).</p>

Direct costs to the Education sector include teacher salaries, administrative salaries, supplies provided, salary of teachers who fill-in for the teachers providing the intervention, communication costs, transportation costs for trainings and supervision, and any incidentals that they may provide to caregivers or children. Direct costs to the Health sector are similar with the added cost of a stipend for the CHVs. Indirect costs to the Education and Health sectors that will need to be covered in the future are the costs of the salaries and benefits of local trainers, supervision, and the training costs including training time and venue rental.</p>

At the organizational level, covariates include staffing (number of teachers or CHVs), size (number of children in the school; size of the community), and existing programs. Organizational information is mostly collected via interviews with the site leader (head teacher/deputy teacher or CHEW) using a measure designed for the purposes of this study. We also use standardized measures designed to capture organizational readiness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] and implementation climate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] that were reviewed for appropriateness by Kenyan partners and translated/back-translated to ensure construct validity. At the leadership-level, we assess general leadership [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] and implementation-specific leadership [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>], also using standardized measures for which we followed similar procedures as the organizational measures. At the counselor-level, we capture demographics (e.g., age, sex), background characteristics (e.g., years in role, education), any training in, or past experience with mental health, and participation in supervision (e.g., dose). When possible, we also assess other implementation constructs using existing measures developed for use in low-resource contexts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] and/or standardized measures reviewed and translated for appropriateness to assess intervention acceptability, feasibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>], and perceived intervention effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. For theorized important constructs for which existing scales are not available or are not relevant (i.e., behavioral control, behavioral intentions, self-efficacy, appropriateness, innovation-values fit), we followed measure construction guidelines from the Theoretical Domains Framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>].</p>

The BCT includes Ace Africa, UW, and Duke study members and local trainers, selected counselors and leaders from high-performing sites in Sequence 1, and other stakeholders (Ministry officials). The Ace Africa team presents results from Sequence 1 sites, orients the BCT to goals (provide future sites with support), and presents identified barriers and IPPs, including attention to variation by sector and site (urban/rural). Members split into Education and Health teams to discuss identified IPPs and generate additional ideas for actionable IPPs that would be practical in their setting. Ace Africa members facilitate this work, ensuring the focus remains on actionable IPPs (i.e., practical and feasible strategies; not those requiring new funding or resources). BCT members also collaborate on developing the appropriate timeline for implementation facilitation visits (i.e., frequency, timing), materials to guide facilitation (called "coaching" locally) for each visit, which IPPs should be prioritized (among those used in Sequence 1 sites), and which IPPs need to be addressed at which visits. By the end of the retreat, we have a list of IPPs for each sector from which sites could select IPPs for their own implementation planning, and a plan for facilitation visit frequency (6 meetings) and timing (e.g., before TF-CBT training, immediately post-training, early in delivery, planning for sustainment).</p>

We measure costs of the intervention for improvement in children’s mental health outcomes.

              <p id="Par76">This study is the next step in our research agenda of testing the effectiveness of EBTs in successive stages that systematically increase local expertise and responsibility and decrease external expert involvement. The goal is to learn what makes an “enabling” context—that is, what policies and practices are necessary for supporting the delivery of mental health interventions. Our ultimate goal is to enhance knowledge around effective, feasible, and sustainable implementation strategies in low-resource contexts globally. We leverage the increasing body of evidence supporting community-based, collaborative approaches to provide implementation support, given their substantial promise for local ownership, oversight, and fit with the cultural context. These approaches offer a potentially sustainable avenue in low-resource settings where budgets are constrained and monetary incentives are low. To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine questions related to scale-up and sustainability of a child-focused EBT in both Education and Health, and one of few global implementation studies that includes an organizational focus and a focus on sustainment. In a sustainability review of health interventions in Sub-Saharan Africa, <italic>none</italic> focused on mental health and most focused on <italic>what</italic> was sustained, not <italic>by whom or how</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par77">The rollout of TF-CBT in Education and Health to date has been welcomed, with all sites expressing interest in TF-CBT training and adoption. From early qualitative interviews and responses on quantitative scales from the first 10 clusters beginning implementation in Sequence 1, teachers and CHVs trained in TF-CBT seem to find the intervention acceptable, believe it will have benefits for children, and have noted the applicability of the skills for their own lives and community. We have observed inter-ministerial collaboration that appears to support implementation, with ministries working together to provide TF-CBT to their community (e.g., schools offering classrooms to CHVs for holding groups; CHVs supporting teachers with outreach to guardians in the community). Ace Africa supervisors have creatively used technology to facilitate supervision and lessen the need and cost of in-person supervision by using short message service (SMS) and WhatsApp to communicate, and sometimes to review counselors’ practice (e.g., reviewing an audio recording of counselors’ practice role play, uploaded using WhatsApp). The implementation facilitation teams initiated facilitation smoothly after the BCT, and Ace Africa supervisors anecdotally report that the facilitation intervention, initiated for Sequence 2 clusters, seems to be beneficial.</p>
              <p id="Par78">However, there have been practical challenges, including higher than expected costs for a few implementation activities. Hosting training for teachers and CHVs (training venue, catering, transportation reimbursements) has been more expensive than expected. Transportation for supervisors to meet with their counselors in-person on occasion, and to observe groups, has also been costly. Due to our focus on children who are parentally-bereaved, small schools with fewer students do not always have as many orphaned children in need of mental health care and groups may consist of fewer than 8 children, lowering the overall child sample in our study. Finally, while expected from the literature and our own experience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], guardian attendance at groups has been more inconsistent than child attendance, given that many guardians are busy with livelihood-generating activities, and some send children to schools that are not their village school (if another school has better academic performance). Thus, guardians may not be in close walking distance to schools, hindering participation in TF-CBT sessions. To engage guardians, counselors often do more outreach and provide individual make-up sessions for guardians. While this addresses the clinical challenge, it adds burden to counselors, increasing the time they spend delivering TF-CBT.</p>
              <p id="Par79">The potential promise of task-sharing for closing the mental health treatment gap goes unrealized if evidence-based guidance to inform scale-up and sustainment is unavailable. Results from the BASIC trial should provide information that will be beneficial for organizations, their leaders, ministry officials, and policy makers looking to implement mental health therapies into existing systems. Our focus on identifying policies and practices that support implementation in two different sectors within a low-resource context should generate pragmatic guidance for how to support mental health service delivery that could be broadly applicable.</p>
