                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Treatment with corticosteroids is recommended for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) patients to slow the progression of weakness. However, chronic corticosteroid treatment causes significant morbidities. Vamorolone is a first-in-class anti-inflammatory investigational drug that has shown evidence of efficacy in DMD after 24 weeks of treatment at 2.0 or 6.0 mg/kg/day. Here, open-label efficacy and safety experience of vamorolone was evaluated over a period of 18 months in trial participants with DMD.</p>

                  <title>Methods and findings</title>
                  <p>A multicenter, open-label, 24-week trial (VBP15-003) with a 24-month long-term extension (VBP15-LTE) was conducted by the Cooperative International Neuromuscular Research Group (CINRG) and evaluated drug-related effects of vamorolone on motor outcomes and corticosteroid-associated safety concerns. The study was carried out in Canada, US, UK, Australia, Sweden, and Israel, from 2016 to 2019. This report covers the initial 24-week trial and the first 12 months of the VBP15-LTE trial (total treatment period 18 months). DMD trial participants (males, 4 to &lt;7 years at entry) treated with 2.0 or 6.0 mg/kg/day vamorolone for the full 18-month period (<italic>n =</italic> 23) showed clinical improvement of all motor outcomes from baseline to month 18 (time to stand velocity, <italic>p =</italic> 0.012 [95% CI 0.010, 0.068 event/second]; run/walk 10 meters velocity, <italic>p &lt;</italic> 0.001 [95% CI 0.220, 0.491 meters/second]; climb 4 stairs velocity, <italic>p =</italic> 0.001 [95% CI 0.034, 0.105 event/second]; 6-minute walk test, <italic>p =</italic> 0.001 [95% CI 31.14, 93.38 meters]; North Star Ambulatory Assessment, <italic>p &lt;</italic> 0.001 [95% CI 2.702, 6.662 points]). Outcomes in vamorolone-treated DMD patients (<italic>n =</italic> 46) were compared to group-matched participants in the CINRG Duchenne Natural History Study (corticosteroid-naÃ¯ve, <italic>n =</italic> 19; corticosteroid-treated, <italic>n =</italic> 68) over a similar 18-month period. Time to stand was not significantly different between vamorolone-treated and corticosteroid-naÃ¯ve participants (<italic>p =</italic> 0.088; least squares [LS] mean 0.042 [95% CI â0.007, 0.091]), but vamorolone-treated participants showed significant improvement compared to group-matched corticosteroid-naÃ¯ve participants for run/walk 10 meters velocity (<italic>p =</italic> 0.003; LS mean 0.286 [95% CI 0.104, 0.469]) and climb 4 stairs velocity (<italic>p =</italic> 0.027; LS mean 0.059 [95% CI 0.007, 0.111]). The vamorolone-related improvements were similar in magnitude to corticosteroid-related improvements. Corticosteroid-treated participants showed stunting of growth, whereas vamorolone-treated trial participants did not (<italic>p &lt;</italic> 0.001; LS mean 15.86 [95% CI 8.51, 23.22]). Physician-reported incidences of adverse events (AEs) for Cushingoid appearance, hirsutism, weight gain, and behavior change were less for vamorolone than published incidences for prednisone and deflazacort. Key limitations to the study were the open-label design, and use of external comparators.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>We observed that vamorolone treatment was associated with improvements in some motor outcomes as compared with corticosteroid-naÃ¯ve individuals over an 18-month treatment period. We found that fewer physician-reported AEs occurred with vamorolone than have been reported for treatment with prednisone and deflazacort, and that vamorolone treatment did not cause the stunting of growth seen with these corticosteroids. This Phase IIa study provides Class III evidence to support benefit of motor function in young boys with DMD treated with vamorolone 2.0 to 6.0 mg/kg/day, with a favorable safety profile. A Phase III RCT is underway to further investigate safety and efficacy.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Vamorolone is an anti-inflammatory steroidal drug that differs from all 33 drugs in the corticosteroid class by lacking an 11-carbon oxygen group (hydroxyl or carbonyl) that is 1 of 5 molecular contact sites with the glucocorticoid receptor [<xref rid="pmed.1003222.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003222.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In vitro pharmacology and pre-clinical in vivo studies have shown that vamorolone retains the anti-inflammatory activity of steroid drugs, while lacking the adverse effects (AEs) associated with these drugs (stunting of growth, bone morbidities, muscle atrophy) in these models [<xref rid="pmed.1003222.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003222.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Many corticosteroids, including prednisone and deflazacort, are agonists of the mineralocorticoid receptor, leading to increased blood volume and pressure via the reninâangiotensin pathway. In contrast, vamorolone is a potent antagonist of the mineralocorticoid receptor, similar in activity to eplerenone and spironolactone [<xref rid="pmed.1003222.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The differential mechanism of action of vamorolone compared to traditional corticosteroid anti-inflammatory drugs is attributed to the loss of gene transcriptional activities associated with glucocorticoid response element binding and activation, potent antagonist activity for the mineralocorticoid receptor, superior membrane stabilization properties, and retention of the distinct NFÎºB inhibitory (anti-inflammatory) activities [<xref rid="pmed.1003222.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003222.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>â<xref rid="pmed.1003222.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]). Activation of NFÎºB-related cell damage pathways is recognized as one of the earliest molecular pathologies of dystrophin-deficient muscle in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) patients, and both vamorolone and corticosteroids inhibit these pathways [<xref rid="pmed.1003222.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p>
              <p>Vamorolone clinical studies have been conducted in adult male volunteers [<xref rid="pmed.1003222.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and in boys with DMD, a disorder in which skeletal muscle is in a chronic inflammatory state [<xref rid="pmed.1003222.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Two consecutive open-label dose-ranging studies in 48 DMD patients aged 4 to &lt;7 years (corticosteroid-naÃ¯ve) were conducted (Phase IIa, VBP15-002; Phase IIa, VBP15-003). Doses were tested over a 24-fold dose range (0.25, 0.75, 2.0, and 6.0 mg/kg/day), with 12 participants per group. The first multiple ascending dose (MAD) cohort trial tested pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety for 2 weeks of drug dosing followed by a 2-week washout (VBP15-002) [<xref rid="pmed.1003222.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Vamorolone treatment in this study showed no dose-limiting toxicities, and PK demonstrated a short half-life similar to corticosteroids (~2 hours), no drug accumulation, similar PK on day 1 and day 14, and PK similar to that of healthy adult male volunteers (VBP15-001) [<xref rid="pmed.1003222.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003222.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>â<xref rid="pmed.1003222.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. All DMD participants completed the MAD study and then continued on the same dose for a 24-week dose-finding (efficacy and safety) extension study (VBP15-003). Oral administration of vamorolone at all doses tested was safe and well tolerated over the 24-week treatment period. Participants in the 2 higher dose groups (2.0 and 6.0 mg/kg/day) generally showed clinical improvement of motor outcomes, with suggestion of dose-related improvements in all motor outcomes tested [<xref rid="pmed.1003222.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003222.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, the 24-week trial period did not allow for adequate evaluation of adverse effects associated with longer-term chronic corticosteroid exposure in children. A 24-week study also does not allow for assessing the longer-term efficacy of vamorolone.</p>
              <p>After completion of the 24-week dose-finding study (VBP15-003), participants had the opportunity to enroll in a 24-month long-term extension study (VBP15-LTE) that permitted dose escalations and de-escalations. All trial participantsâ parents and physicians requested continued access to vamorolone, rather than transition to standard of care (prednisone or deflazacort). Here, we report the initial experience from the 24-week VBP15-003 trial and the first 12 months of the 24-month VBP15-LTE trial (total 18 months of treatment). Change in motor function and safety outcomes are also compared to data from group-matched corticosteroid-treated and corticosteroid-naÃ¯ve participants enrolled in the Cooperative International Neuromuscular Research Group (CINRG) Duchenne Natural History Study (DNHS) [<xref rid="pmed.1003222.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003222.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Safety endpoints (linear growth, body mass index) are also compared with data from a 12-month trial of daily prednisone (0.75 mg/kg group) in similar-aged boys with DMD [<xref rid="pmed.1003222.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p>

                <title>Trial participants</title>
                <p>Three consecutive clinical trials of vamorolone treatment of DMD were conducted by CINRG (VBP15-002 [NCT02760264]; VBP15-003 [NCT02760277]; VBP15-LTE [NCT03038399]). A total of 48 participants (ages 4 to &lt;7 years) were initially enrolled into VBP15-002, with a study start date of June 2016, with trial participants completing month 12 of the 24-month VBP15-LTE study by April 2019. Participants were recruited in the US, Canada, UK, Sweden, Israel, and Australia.</p>
                <p>VBP15-002 (Phase IIa; 2 weeks on drug, 2 weeks off drug) enrolled 48 corticosteroid-naÃ¯ve participants with DMD, and all 48 participants completed the study and enrolled into VBP15-003 (Phase IIa extension; 24-week treatment). Forty-six of 48 participants completed the VBP15-003 study (2 participants withdrew from VBP15-003 for reasons not related to study drug) [<xref rid="pmed.1003222.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. All participants (46/46) opted to enroll in the 24-month long-term extension study, VBP15-LTE. This current report focuses on the 12-month interim time point in the 24-month VBP15-LTE protocol (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1003222.s004">S1 Protocol</xref>). This study is reported as per the Transparent Reporting of Evaluations with Nonrandomized Designs (TREND) guideline (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1003222.s001">S1 TREND Checklist</xref>).</p>
                <p>The consecutive vamorolone trials (VBP15-002, VBP15-003, VBP15-LTE) were open-label with no placebo comparator. Corticosteroid-naÃ¯ve and corticosteroid-treated DMD participant comparators were group-matched participants from the CINRG DNHS (NCT00468832). The CINRG DNHS was an observational, prospective caseâcontrol study of 551 participants (440 with DMD, 111 healthy peers), with a study start date of December 2005, and study completion date of November 2016 [<xref rid="pmed.1003222.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003222.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. For group matching between vamorolone-treated participants and CINRG DNHS participants, pre-specified criteria were defined for matching within the interim statistical analysis plan (iSAP) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1003222.s003">S1 iSAP</xref>). Two statisticians independent of the sponsor applied the matching criteria to the CINRG DNHS cohort based on age and other characteristics (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1003222.s006">S1 Table</xref>), and the selected participants were harmonized and agreed upon with blinding to outcome data. Age-matched CINRG DNHS participants included those continuously corticosteroid-naÃ¯ve over an 18-month period (<italic>n =</italic> 19) or continuously corticosteroid-treated over an 18-month period (<italic>n =</italic> 68). For the 68 corticosteroid-treated participants, as this was an observational cohort, corticosteroid doses and regimens varied based on clinician discretion [<xref rid="pmed.1003222.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Although all 68 participants were treated for 18 months continuously, the age at initiation of corticosteroids varied. Thus, the total duration of corticosteroid treatment was longer than 18 months for most participants.</p>
                <p>For comparisons of growth trajectories of vamorolone- and corticosteroid-treated participants, we utilized a third external comparator of a CINRG 12-month prednisone clinical trial (daily treated arm, 0.75 mg/kg/day) [<xref rid="pmed.1003222.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. As with the CINRG DNHS comparators, group-matching criteria were pre-specified in the iSAP, and 2 independent statisticians carried out the participant matching. The efficacy data from the CINRG 12-month prednisone trial were not compared to those of the vamorolone-treated participants, as there was no corresponding 12-month assessment in vamorolone-treated participants (assessments of vamorolone-treated trial participants were at 0, 3, 6, and 18 months).</p>

                <title>Measurements</title>
                <p>Assessments of efficacy were motor outcomes (primary outcome: time to stand from supine [TTSTAND]; secondary outcomes: time to run/walk 10 meters [TTRW], time to climb 4 stairs [TTCLIMB], distance covered in 6-minute walk test [6MWT], and the North Star Ambulatory Assessment [NSAA]). 6MWT and NSAA were not assessed in the majority of CINRG DNHS participants and were not compared to vamorolone-treated participants. Clinical evaluators were trained according to standard operating procedures that were harmonized between the CINRG vamorolone, CINRG DNHS, and CINRG prednisone studies. Reliability of these outcomes (percent coefficient of variation) has been reported for the VBP15-002/VBP15-003 studies [<xref rid="pmed.1003222.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Assessments were done at baseline (VBP15-002 entry), 24 weeks (VBP15-003 last visit), and 18 months (VBP15-LTE midpoint assessment at 12 months).</p>
                <p>Standing height and weight were assessed at each study visit. Height <italic>z</italic>-score, body mass index (BMI; kg/m<sup>2</sup>), and BMI <italic>z-</italic>score were calculated centrally. AE reporting was done per protocol in the vamorolone trials.</p>

                <title>Study design</title>
                <p>Only participants completing VBP15-002 and VBP15-003 were eligible to enroll in VBP15-LTE. Participants received vamorolone at 1 of 4 dose levels (0.25, 0.75, 2.0, or 6.0 mg/kg/day), and at the same dose level in both the 4-week VBP15-002 trial and the 24-week VBP15-003 trial. If participants, their families, and their physician wished to continue vamorolone treatment upon exiting the VBP15-003 trial, they were offered participation in the 24-month long-term extension (VBP15-LTE). The last visit of the VBP15-003 trial was commensurate with the first visit of the VBP15-LTE trial. In all studies, study medication was provided as 4% flavored liquid suspension and was dosed according to body weight and given once daily in the morning with food.</p>
                <p>Study visits took place quarterly, including assessment of clinical laboratory results, vital signs, and AEs. All AEs were coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA version 19.0) system for reporting (preferred term and system organ class). Clinical efficacy assessments were performed at baseline of the VBP15-002 study, at 6 months (end of VBP15-003 study), and at the 12-month midpoint visit of the VBP15-LTE study.</p>
                <p>The VBP15-LTE protocol permitted multiple dose escalations to the highest dose (6.0 mg/kg/day) at the discretion of the participantâs family and physician, and also permitted de-escalations. Site investigators were permitted to escalate a participantâs dose to a higher dose level during the VBP15-LTE (6.0 mg/kg/day) with Study Chair and Medical Monitor approval once the participant had been on their initial dose in VBP15-LTE for at least 1 month, the next higher dose was determined to be safe in the VBP15-002 Phase IIa Study, and no safety issues with that dose had emerged in the VBP15-003 Phase IIa study.</p>
                <p>Vamorolone-treated participants were initially enrolled into VBP15-002 and VBP15-003 in 4 dose groups (0.25, 0.75, 2.0, and 6.0 mg/kg/day; groups AâD). Upon entering VBP15-LTE, vamorolone group A participants had 2 or 3 sequential dose escalations, and were treated with 2.0 or 6.0 mg/kg/day for the last 3â9 months of the 18-month period; group B participants had 1 or 2 dose escalations and were treated with 2.0 or 6.0 mg/kg/day for the last 9â11 months; and groups C and D were treated for 18 months at 2.0 or 6.0 mg/kg/day (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1003222.s002">S1 Fig</xref>). We kept this group stratification for further analyses not pre-specified in the iSAP, and for cross-sectional comparisons to the same matched corticosteroid-naÃ¯ve and corticosteroid-treated participants from the CINRG DNHS.</p>
                <p>The current study is the first evaluating longer-term tolerability, efficacy, and safety of vamorolone in DMD. The VBP15-003 dose-finding study suggested that vamorolone doses of 2.0 and 6.0 mg/kg/day showed better efficacy and similar safety profiles in comparison to lower doses [<xref rid="pmed.1003222.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Given the variable timing of dose escalations, we pre-specified that initial analyses of drug-related efficacy and safety would be limited to those participants who had 18 months of treatment with 2.0 mg/kg/day vamorolone or more (dose group C + dose group D; <italic>n =</italic> 23). Outcomes for these participants were compared to a group-matched cohort from the CINRG DNHS over an 18-month period (corticosteroid-naÃ¯ve, <italic>n =</italic> 19; corticosteroid-treated, <italic>n =</italic> 68). Participants were matched for age and treatment period (Â±1 month), matching criteria were pre-specified in the statistical analysis plan, and matching was carried out by 2 independent statisticians (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1003222.s006">S1 Table</xref>).</p>
                <p>Growth trajectories and BMI before/after drug treatment were compared between these CINRG DNHS groups over an 18-month period and were also compared to the cohort of CINRG prednisone clinical trial participants who were treated with daily prednisone for the 12-month treatment period of the trial (<italic>n =</italic> 12). Participants in the corticosteroid-treated CINRG DNHS group were treated for at least 18 months, but total duration, dose, and regimens varied.</p>

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p>An interim statistical analysis plan was written (VBP15-LTE iSAP) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1003222.s003">S1 iSAP</xref>). The VBP15-LTE iSAP pre-specified analyses of the VBP15-LTE midpoint (12-month) assessments and comparisons to external comparators (corticosteroid-treated and corticosteroid-naÃ¯ve participants from CINRG DNHS) [<xref rid="pmed.1003222.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The VBP15-LTE iSAP included all month 12 assessments of the 24-month VBP15-LTE study (ongoing at the time of writing). Software utilized was SAS.</p>
                <p>The statistical analyses were carried out in 2 sequential steps. First, we pre-specified groups and comparisons in the VBP15-LTE iSAP. This iSAP included only those vamorolone-treated participants who had been on 2.0 or 6.0 mg/kg/day for the full 18-month treatment period (dose groups C + D), in order to avoid the confounding variable of multiple dose escalations in dose groups A and B (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1003222.s002">S1 Fig</xref>). The second analysis was conducted post hoc after completion of the VBP15-LTE iSAP analyses, with dose stratification based on initial dose group in VBP15-002 (0.25 [group A], 0.75 [group B], 2.0 [group C], and 6.0 [group D] mg/kg/day).</p>
                <p>Statistical analyses were done on paired longitudinal outcome data using an ANCOVA approach with change from baseline (VBP15-002) to month 18 (midpoint of VBP15-LTE). Baseline response and age were included as covariates. For the vamorolone-treated participants, age was calculated as (date of informed consent minus birthdate)/365.25. For the DNHS participants, age was calculated as (date of baseline visit used minus birthdate)/365.25. The baseline visit for a DNHS participant was the first visit at which the participant met the comparison eligibility criteria for matching and had a non-missing response for at least 1 endpoint of interest. Timed function tests were analyzed as velocity scores to limit the impact of participants who were unable to perform the test (velocity = 0). Velocity measures are variance-stabilizing transformations, suppressing extreme raw outliers from raw values in seconds; these help with distributional assumptions of the statistical models/tests used. Raw data (seconds) are also reported. Velocity scores for TTSTAND (event/second), TTRW (meters/second), and TTCLIMB (event/second) were imputed as 0 at the first response missing due to inability to perform the test. All other data were observed values only, without imputation. No adjustments for multiplicity on inferential statistics were specified in the iSAP.</p>
                <p>For within-group analysis, longitudinal change from baseline to 18 months was analyzed using a paired <italic>t</italic> test. A longitudinal analysis was not performed for efficacy for the participants in the corticosteroid-treated CINRG DNHS study, as there was no baseline (pre-corticosteroid) efficacy assessment.</p>

                <p>Forty-eight DMD participants were enrolled into VBP15-002 and entered into 4 vamorolone treatment groups (dose group A, 0.25 mg/kg/day; dose group B, 0.75 mg/kg/day; dose group C, 2.0 mg/kg/day; dose group D, 6.0 mg/kg/day). All 48 participants completed the 4-week VBP15-002 trial, and 46 participants completed the 24-week VBP15-003 trial at the same doses. All 46 participants completing the 24-week VBP15-003 study then opted to enroll into the 24-month long-term extension study (VBP15-LTE) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1003222.s002">S1 Fig</xref>). Data from the 4-week VBP15-002 study have been published [<xref rid="pmed.1003222.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], as have data from the 24-week VBP15-003 study [<xref rid="pmed.1003222.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The current study is the first evaluating longer-term tolerability, efficacy, and safety of vamorolone in DMD. The VBP15-003 dose-finding study suggested that the 2 higher vamorolone doses showed greater efficacy than the 2 lower doses.</p>
                <p>One participant discontinued the study 1 month before the 12-month assessment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1003222.s002">S1 Fig</xref>; participant 233504). This participantâs 11-month early exit visit data were counted as 12-month study data for this analysis, per the pre-specified iSAP. All participants in the 0.25- and 0.75-mg/kg/day groups in VBP15-003 dose escalated to either 2.0 or 6.0 mg/kg/day. The timing of dose escalations varied between participants and is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1003222.s002">S1 Fig</xref>. Two participants in the 0.75-mg/kg/day VBP15-003 dose group escalated to 6.0 mg/kg/day, then later de-escalated to 2.0 mg/kg/day due to weight gain within the 12-month interim time period (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1003222.s002">S1 Fig</xref>; participants: 233409, 233102).</p>

                <p>Within the VBP15-LTE study, each participant could have his dose of vamorolone increased to a higher dose or decreased to a lower dose by the site investigator as necessitated clinically. Of the 11 participants in the 0.25-mg/kg/day dose group at entry in the VBP15-LTE, the vamorolone dose was increased to 2.0 mg/kg/day for 3 participants and to 6.0 mg/kg/day for 8 participants prior to the 12-month interim assessment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1003222.s002">S1 Fig</xref>). The cumulative exposure to high-dose vamorolone (2.0 or 6.0 mg/kg/day) for those participants who were originally in the 0.25-mg/kg/day dose group ranged from 3 to 9 months (of the 18-month study period). Of the 12 participants in the 0.75-mg/kg/day dose group at entry in the VBP15-LTE, the vamorolone dose was increased to 2.0 mg/kg/day for 6 participants and to 6.0 mg/kg/day for 6 participants. The cumulative exposure to high-dose vamorolone for those participants who were originally in the 0.75-mg/kg/day dose group ranged from 9 to 11 months. Of the 12 participants in the 2.0-mg/kg/day dose group at entry in the VBP15-LTE, the dose remained at 2.0 mg/kg/day for 3 participants and was increased to 6.0 mg/kg/day for 9 participants. Two participants subsequently had their vamorolone dose decreased from 6.0 to 2.0 mg/kg/day due to weight gain. Of the 11 participants in the 6.0-mg/kg/day dose group at entry in the VBP15-LTE, all remained at this dose throughout the study period (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1003222.s002">S1 Fig</xref>).</p>

                <title>Comparative efficacy of vamorolone dose groups</title>
                <p>Participant-level data were analyzed graphically for the 4 vamorolone-treated groups relative to DNHS corticosteroid-naÃ¯ve participants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1003222.g001">Fig 1</xref>; left panels). Groups B, C, and D each showed improvements from baseline after 18 months of treatment in comparison to corticosteroid-naÃ¯ve participants from CINRG DNHS, whereas group A outcomes were similar to those of corticosteroid-naÃ¯ve participants. Of note, group A was treated for only 3 to 9 months with high-dose vamorolone (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1003222.s002">S1 Fig</xref>), and was also had a mean age 0.4 years older than that of the other groups at study entry (Group A, 5.2 Â± 1.0 years; Groups B, C, and D, 4.8 Â± 0.8 years). A cross-sectional comparison was carried out at 5.5â8.5 years of age (end of 18-month treatment period) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1003222.g001">Fig 1</xref>; right panels), with visualization of the mean baseline of each of the 4 vamorolone groups and the DNHS corticosteroid-naÃ¯ve (<italic>n =</italic> 19) and DNHS corticosteroid-treated comparators (<italic>n =</italic> 68). Vamorolone dose groups B, C, and D showed motor function outcomes that were similar to those of corticosteroid-treated DNHS participants. Corticosteroid-naÃ¯ve participants showed poorer performance, as did vamorolone group A. These data suggest that the benefit of vamorolone at 2.0 or 6.0 mg/kg/day may be similar in magnitude to that of corticosteroid at 18 months of treatment.</p>

Vamorolone group A was treated with 2.0 or 6.0 mg/kg/day for the last 3â9 months of the 18-month period, group B was treated with 2.0 or 6.0 mg/kg/day for the last 9â11 months, and groups C and D with 2.0 or 6.0 mg/kg/day for all 18 months. The specific dose of each participant at the end of the 18-month period is indicated (red = 2.0 mg/kg/day; blue = 6.0 mg/kg/day). Dose groups B, C, and D show mean improvements over baseline compared to matched corticosteroid-naÃ¯ve participants from CINRG DNHS (<italic>n =</italic> 19).

                <title>Pre-specified safety evaluation</title>
                <p>Two measures of corticosteroid-associated safety concerns were pre-specified in the iSAP: growth deceleration (stunting of growth measured by change in mean height percentile for age) and body mass index (BMI) <italic>z-</italic>score. At baseline, the 3 groups (vamorolone, DNHS corticosteroid-treated, and DNHS corticosteroid-naÃ¯ve) were generally short for age (mean 20thâ29th height percentile for age). DNHS corticosteroid-naÃ¯ve participants showed no change in growth trajectories over the 18-month period, whereas corticosteroid-treated participants showed the expected deceleration of growth seen with chronic treatment with corticosteroids (â5.63 mean change in height percentile) (<xref rid="pmed.1003222.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Vamorolone-treated participants showed a positive growth trajectory (+6.92 mean change in height percentile); this was not significantly different from the trajectory of the DNHS corticosteroid-naÃ¯ve participants. Comparison of growth velocities of vamorolone-treated to DNHS corticosteroid-treated participants over the 18-month period showed a significant difference (LS mean 15.86 [95% CI 8.51, 23.22], <italic>p &lt;</italic> 0.001), and there was also a significant difference when comparing vamorolone 18-month treatment to prednisone trial 12-month treatment (LS mean 10.37 [95% CI 2.49, 18.25], <italic>p =</italic> 0.012). This suggests that vamorolone treatment does not stunt growth, whereas corticosteroid-related growth stunting is a well-recognized safety concern.</p>
                <p>For BMI <italic>z-</italic>score, the vamorolone-treated group had a normal mean BMI at baseline (<italic>z-</italic>score = 1.03), whereas DNHS corticosteroid-naÃ¯ve and CINRG prednisone trial participants had a lower mean BMI at baseline (<italic>z-</italic>score = 0.70 and 0.61, respectively). CINRG corticosteroid-naÃ¯ve participants showed a decrease in mean BMI over 18 months (change of <italic>z-</italic>score = â0.34). Participants in the CINRG prednisone clinical trial showed an increase of mean <italic>z-</italic>score of 0.46 over 12 months of treatment, and the vamorolone group showed increase of mean <italic>z-</italic>score of 0.41 over 18 months of treatment. CINRG DNHS participants who were treated with corticosteroids over an 18-month time period showed an increase of mean <italic>z-</italic>score of 0.15, but this group did not have measures prior to initiation of corticosteroids. The change in BMI was not significantly different between vamorolone- and corticosteroid-treated groups, whereas comparisons of drug-treated groups to corticosteroid-naÃ¯ve participants showed significant differences (<xref rid="pmed.1003222.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Stratification by original dose groups shows a general doseâresponse of increasing BMI (change from baseline to 18 months of treatment [kg/m<sup>2</sup>]: group B, 0.5; group C, 1.11; group D, 2.55) with increasing vamorolone dose, although this was highly variable within all groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1003222.s008">S3 Table</xref>). This suggests that vamorolone may share the safety concern of weight gain with corticosteroids.</p>

                <title>Physician-reported AEs</title>
                <p>Treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) have been published for the 2-week treatment MAD study (VBP15-002) [<xref rid="pmed.1003222.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and the 24-week dose-finding extension study (VBP15-003) [<xref rid="pmed.1003222.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. TEAEs were reported with similar incidence by participants in all 4 vamorolone groups. Several TEAEs commonly observed with chronic corticosteroid therapy were observed only in the 2.0-mg/kg/day group (abnormal behavior; 1 participant) and 6.0-mg/kg/day group (hypertrichosis [2 participants] and anxiety, abnormal blood cortisol level, Cushingoid habitus, and personality change [1 participant each]). The other reported TEAEs did not exhibit a dose-related incidence.</p>
                <p>A Data and Safety Monitoring Board report on the VBP15-LTE study (3 December 2019; data cutoff 12 November 2019), covering all participants enrolled in the VBP15-LTE study (inclusive beyond the 12-month midpoint assessment) included 3 serious AEs (2 myoglobinuria events [in the same participant] and 1 pneumonia), all deemed unrelated to study drug. For all reported TEAEs, 402 were deemed unrelated to vamorolone, 37 were deemed remotely related, 29 were deemed possibly related, 11 were deemed probably related, and 3 were deemed definitely related. Of the 14 AEs probably and definitely related to vamorolone, 10 were weight gain, 2 were increased appetite, 1 was Cushingoid features, and 1 was irritability. A complete list of all TEAEs is provided for data cutoff beyond the 18-month last participant last visit, based on data cutoff of 12 November 2019 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1003222.s009">S4 Table</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1003222.s002">S1 Fig</xref> for participant-level doses at time of TEAE).</p>
                <p>We determined the incidences of physician-reported AEs typically associated with corticosteroid treatment for participants that had been treated with vamorolone 6.0 mg/kg/day (for any duration), taken from the March 2019 Data Safety Update Report (DSUR) (pharmacovigilance report). Incidence rates of Cushingoid features, weight gain, hirsutism, and behavior change were studied (<xref rid="pmed.1003222.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). These rates were then compared to physician-reported AE incidences in the CINRG DNHS study [<xref rid="pmed.1003222.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and a 12-month clinical trial of prednisone and deflazacort [<xref rid="pmed.1003222.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. This comparison showed that there are lower rates of physician-reported Cushingoid features, weight gain, hirsutism, and behavior change in the vamorolone trial compared to published prednisone and deflazacort trials in boys with DMD.</p>

              <p>A dose-ranging 24-week (6-month) study of vamorolone treatment in 4- to 7-year-old boys with DMD had shown dose-responsive improvements in motor function tests [<xref rid="pmed.1003222.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. After completion of this study, participants were offered enrollment in a 2-year long-term extension study (VBP15-LTE) or transition to corticosteroid standard of care (deflazacort or prednisone). Here, we report interim findings in VBP15-LTE (18 months of vamorolone treatment). All participants (46 of 46) opted to enroll in the vamorolone long-term extension, suggesting high satisfaction with vamorolone treatment. Vamorolone-treated participants showed improvements from baseline in all 5 motor assessments over the 18-month treatment period (TTSTAND, TTRW, TTCLIMB, NSAA, and 6MWT) (<xref rid="pmed.1003222.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). In contrast, group-matched steroid-naÃ¯ve (non-treated) DMD participants in the CINRG DNHS study showed stable disease over a similar 18-month period. Comparisons of vamorolone-treated participants to CINRG DNHS non-treated participants showed that differences for TTSTAND were not significant, but significant vamorolone-related improvements were observed for TTRW velocity (<italic>p =</italic> 0.003) and TTCLIMB velocity (<italic>p =</italic> 0.027); data for NSAA and 6WMT were not available in the CINRG DNHS comparator group. Vamorolone has shown fewer morbidities than corticosteroids in mouse models of disease [<xref rid="pmed.1003222.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003222.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003222.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], but a comparative safety profile for vamorolone versus corticosteroids has not been previously reported in humans. Group-matched steroid-treated participants in the CINRG DNHS showed marked stunting of growthâa well-known safety concern with chronic deflazacort and prednisone treatment of children. In contrast, vamorolone-treated participants did not show any evidence of stunting of growth. Physicians reported fewer other corticosteroid-associated safety concerns in vamorolone-treated participants compared to published studies of deflazacort- and prednisone-treated DMD patients, including Cushingoid appearance, behavior change (mood disturbance), hirsutism, and weight gain.</p>
              <p>While participating in the VBP15-LTE study, participants were permitted dose escalations and de-escalations at the discretion of families and their physicians. Most (74%; 34/46) opted to be treated with the highest dose permitted (6.0 mg/kg/day), and 26% with 2.0 mg/kg/day. There were 2 participants for whom the vamorolone dose was decreased from 6.0 to 2.0 mg/kg/day due to weight gain. DMD trial participants treated with 2.0 or 6.0 mg/kg/day vamorolone for the full 18-month period (<italic>n =</italic> 23) showed clinical improvement of all motor outcomes from baseline to month 18 (TTSTAND, <italic>p =</italic> 0.012; TTRW, <italic>p &lt;</italic> 0.001; TTCLIMB, <italic>p =</italic> 0.001; 6MWT, <italic>p =</italic> 0.001; NSAA, <italic>p &lt;</italic> 0.001). However, DMD patients in this young age range are, on average, stable or improving. Thus, it is important to compare improvements to non-treated participants.</p>
              <p>The vamorolone clinical trials were conducted by the academic clinical trial network CINRG. The CINRG network had previously conducted a longitudinal natural history study of 551 DMD participants and healthy peers (CINRG DNHS) [<xref rid="pmed.1003222.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], with similar clinical evaluator methods and endpoints as utilized in the vamorolone trials. Pre-specified matching criteria were defined to provide group matching of corticosteroid-naÃ¯ve and corticosteroid-treated cohorts selected from the CINRG DNHS to compare to vamorolone-treated participants over an 18-month time period. The comparator groups were similar to the vamorolone-treated groups at baseline, with slightly older ages in the CINRG DNHS study groups. These comparisons showed that DMD participants treated with vamorolone for 18 months (2.0 or 6.0 mg/kg/day) in comparison to corticosteroid-naÃ¯ve participants did not show significant differences for TTSTAND velocity (<italic>p =</italic> 0.088), but did show significant improvement for TTRW velocity (<italic>p =</italic> 0.003) and TTCLIMB velocity (<italic>p =</italic> 0.027) (<xref rid="pmed.1003222.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Vamorolone treatment led to improvements in the 6MWT (mean +62.2 meters) and NSAA (mean +4.7 points), but these outcomes were not measured over an 18-month interval in the CINRG DNHS, and, therefore, there was no group match comparator for these outcomes.</p>
              <p>The cross-sectional graphical comparison of motor outcomes at the end of the 18-month treatment period (participants 5.5â8.5 years of age) shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1003222.g001">Fig 1</xref> suggests that both the vamorolone-treated cohort (1 year or more treatment at 2.0 or 6.0 mg/kg/day: groups B, C, and D) and the CINRG DNHS corticosteroid-treated cohort had similar drug-related benefit relative to the CINRG DNHS corticosteroid-naÃ¯ve cohort. Insufficient data were available to compare motor improvements with vamorolone to those natural history motor outcomes seen with specific corticosteroid regimens (e.g., daily prednisone and daily deflazacort). A multicenter placebo- and active-comparator (daily prednisone 0.75 mg/kg/day) controlled trial is currently being conducted (VBP15-004; NCT03439670).</p>
              <p>Long-term treatment with corticosteroids (deflazacort and prednisone) is associated with a broad range of safety concerns that detract from patient quality of life [<xref rid="pmed.1003222.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003222.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In children, deceleration of linear growth is frequently seen with chronic corticosteroid treatment. Comparison of mean height percentile change over 18 months showed that corticosteroid treatment in CINRG DNHS participants led to stunting of growth (â5.63 percentile), whereas vamorolone treatment did not (+6.92 percentile) (<italic>p &lt;</italic> 0.001) (<xref rid="pmed.1003222.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). A double-blind clinical trial of prednisone versus deflazacort in DMD also found stunting of growth over a 12-month treatment period (â11.43 percentile for deflazacort; â7.04 percentile for prednisone) [<xref rid="pmed.1003222.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The lack of stunting of growth with high-dose vamorolone treatment is consistent with previously published bone turnover biomarker data, showing that corticosteroids lead to reductions in serum osteocalcin, but vamorolone does not [<xref rid="pmed.1003222.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003222.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003222.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. These data suggest that vamorolone does not share stunting of growth with corticosteroids as a safety concern, and this may be a distinct advantage for children requiring chronic corticosteroid treatment. The physician-reported incidence of AEs was compared between the vamorolone trials, the corticosteroid-treated group in the CINRG DNHS [<xref rid="pmed.1003222.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and the prednisone versus deflazacort trial [<xref rid="pmed.1003222.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] (<xref rid="pmed.1003222.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). This comparison suggested a lower incidence of Cushingoid appearance, weight gain, hirsutism/hypertrichosis, and behavior change in vamorolone-treated DMD patients compared to corticosteroid-treated boys. Taken together, the data suggest that vamorolone treatment of DMD patients provides similar efficacy as corticosteroid treatment as assessed by motor function outcomes. Furthermore, this preliminary assessment indicates that vamorolone treatment resulted in a lower incidence of safety concerns typically associated with corticosteroid treatment. The BMI data from the 18-month extension in comparison to natural history data from the CINRG do not indicate that vamorolone-treated participants will be completely spared the side effects of weight gain, and 2 participants on 6.0 mg/kg/day had to de-escalate their dose to 2.0 mg/kg/day.</p>
              <p>A limitation of these studies is their open-label study design and the indirect comparisons to previously published studies. However, long-term placebo arms in a rare pediatric disease such as DMD are considered unethical. Another limitation is that the CINRG DNHS corticosteroid-treated cohort had been on corticosteroids for a variable amount of time prior to the 18-month study interval. A double-blind study of 120 DMD participants enrolled into 4 groups is underway (vamorolone 2.0 and 6.0 mg/kg/day, placebo, and prednisone 0.75 mg/kg/day) (VBP15-004; NCT03439670), and this will provide Class I evidence for vamorolone efficacy and safety.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, we present Class IV evidence that for boys with DMD, vamorolone treatment for 18 months shows possible efficacy compared to a natural history cohort of corticosteroid-naÃ¯ve patients and appears to be well tolerated, with fewer safety concerns than typically seen with long-term standard-of-care corticosteroid treatment.</p>

              <p>On behalf of Clare Stone, PhD, Acting Chief Editor,</p>

              <p>-----------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>Requests from the editors:</p>
              <p>*Please revise your title according to PLOS Medicine's style. Your title must be nondeclarative and not a question. It should begin with main concept if possible. "Effect of" should be used only if causality can be inferred, i.e., for an RCT. Please place the study design ("A randomized controlled trial," "A retrospective study," "A modelling study," etc.) in the subtitle (ie, after a colon). Although the title and abstract currently state the study as an open-label study, this doesn't fully explain the study design (eg, whether randomized or not), and we'd suggest including that per the journal's usual style.</p>
              <p>*Please structure your abstract using the PLOS Medicine headings (Background, Methods and Findings, Conclusions). The Methods and Findings sections should be one single sub-section, âMethods and findingsâ.</p>
              <p>*At this stage, we ask that you include a short, non-technical Author Summary of your research to make findings accessible to a wide audience that includes both scientists and non-scientists. The Author Summary should immediately follow the Abstract in your revised manuscript. This text is subject to editorial change and should be distinct from the scientific abstract. Please see our author guidelines for more information: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/revising-your-manuscript#loc-author-summary">https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/revising-your-manuscript#loc-author-summary</ext-link></p>
              <p>*The referencing style used in the paper doesn't match PLOS Medicine's usual format (the paper uses author name-year system). Please change to numbered referencing in square brackets and then a numbered reference list. </p>
              <p>*One reviewer has said that part of the Results section reads like part of the Methods, however the editors would disagree with this point and would advise you to keep this information within the Results, however it could probably be presented more efficiently. </p>
              <p>*Although primarily designed to help support reporting of randomized trials, we'd still suggest that the authors consider using the CONSORT checklist to help improve reporting of the study. CONSORT checklist is available at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.consort-statement.org/consort-statement/checklist">http://www.consort-statement.org/consort-statement/checklist</ext-link></p>
              <p>-----------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>Comments from the reviewers:</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: See attachment</p>
              <p>Michael Dewey</p>
              <p>-----------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: The abstract is well written.</p>
              <p>The introduction is well written.</p>
              <p>In the subjects and methods section, the obvious weakness of this trial, open label, was acknowledged.</p>
              <p>The specific characteristics used to match the CINRG DNHS boys to the vamorolone trial boys should be spelled out in full, not relegated to the statement, "â¦and other characteristics (Supplemental Table 1)." Otherwise, there is no means to know the composition of the comparator group.</p>
              <p>Results:</p>
              <p> - The first five paragraphs in the Results section read like a Methods section.</p>
              <p> - It remains difficult to read results presented in velocities (however statistically appropriate).</p>
              <p> - Opinion comments are best left to the Discussion section. There are numerous comments throughout the Results section.</p>
              <p>Discussion:</p>
              <p>This is written well.</p>
              <p>It is key that you have mentioned the significant limitations associated with this trial design.</p>
              <p>Figure 1: This is informative.</p>
              <p>Table 1 is well laid out and comprehensively inclusive (mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, maximum). I am not sure all of this information is necessary in the table. Some could be placed in supplementary files.</p>
              <p>Table 2 is well laid out and the numbers easy to see. However, the use of velocity measurements is not easily understood by most readers. Although statistically appropriate, it might be more reasonable to use raw data and discuss that velocity measurements confirmed (or reinforced) the results seen in the untransformed data.</p>
              <p>Table 3 is well laid out and easy to understand.</p>
              <p>New agents for the treatment of dystrophinopathies are important.</p>
              <p>Corticosteroid-like agents, such as vamorolone, with the potential for fewer side effects are needed.</p>
              <p>However, overall, this article is a very difficult read with multiple comparator groups (many of which are historical) and obtuse measurements across these multiple comparator groups.</p>
              <p>-----------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: The authors report on the 18-month safety and efficacy of an open-label trial of vamorolone in young boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy with the aims of describing the safety and efficacy of this compound compared to external steroid naive and treated cohorts over a similar timeframe. Overall this study is useful to the field in providing an early view of signals of efficacy and safety of this compound as an alternative to traditional corticosteroid treatment options.</p>
              <p>Major comments:</p>
              <p>-There is inconsistent naming/labeling of groups/cohorts across text and figures, as well as differences in groups included in analysis that makes it challenging for the reader to easily follow and compare outcomes and safety across groups (specifically Supplemental Table 1). Additionally, the first paragraph states "Given the variable timing of dose escalations, we pre-specified that initial analyses of drug-related efficacy and safety would be limited to those subjects who had 18 months of treatment with 2.0 mg/kg/day vamorolone or more (dose group C + dose group D; n=23)." yet group A and B appear in Figure 1 and group B throughout the reported safety data.</p>
              <p>-I would strongly recommend including steroid-treated functional data across tables and figures. Comparison of functional and safety data to a steroid-naive cohort has some utility, but the overall comparison to steroid-treated groups is more meaningful for clinicians in determining the best treatment options for their patients. While the variability in steroid treatment initiation is stated as the factor for not including this data, it would be preferential to include the data with the caveat that this variability in treatment duration may or may not impact findings. Additionally, it is included as a comparator for safety data and one would expect the same concern to stand for that comparison, yet it is included.</p>
              <p>-Table 3 and the final paragraph of page 11 differs from the text in the previous paragraph on page 11 discussing AE's from the DSMB report (03Dec19). While this specific analysis is favorable for vamorolone, could be misleading to readers as weight gain appears to be quite common as evidenced by 10 AEs and similar increases in BMI. Additionally the authors comment on page 10 "This suggests that vamorolone may share the safety concern of weight gain with corticosteroids, although BMI does not distinguish between bone, muscle, and fat, yet adjusts for height. Each of these variables may be different for vamorolone-treatment and corticosteroid-treatment." The text "although BMI...." through the end of the next sentence should be removed as there is no evidence for this statement included in this study. Lastly, the vamorolone trial is open-label and being compared to randomized trials, so bias has the potential to significantly impact the difference in reporting.</p>
              <p>Additional comments:</p>
              <p>- Improvements in the 6MWT and NSAA are generally expected in this &lt;7 age range. There are other external cohorts to compare these improvements which could be considered. A graph of individual patient improvements should be considered as it may be helpful in interpreting these changes. </p>
              <p>- The graphs on the right of Figure 1 appear to indicate more variability in performance in the vamorolone-treated cohorts than the steroid-treated group which makes the reader question whether there is a more variable response rate to vamorolone treatment than traditional corticosteroids? Could the authors comment on this variability as standard deviations in performance at baseline seem similar to the steroid-naive group.</p>

              <p>------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>Requests from Editors:</p>
              <p>1.Response to Editor Inquiry about interim analysis: [[Q1: Interim reporting: Please clarify whether this analysis was pre-planned, and if not, explain why this report describes only the first 12 months of a 24 month continuation study. On Page 116 (section 9.4) of your study protocol, it states that "No interim statistical analyses are planned." The response to Reviewer #1's question on interim reporting does not clarify this issue.</p>
              <p>A1: As protocols are typically written and issued far ahead of statistical analysis plans (SAPs), it is not uncommon to have aspects of the SAPs at odds with original protocols. Such deviations are discussed by the study team (study chair, sponsor, medical monitor, clinical monitor, statisticians), and a judgement is made as to whether the changes are substantial enough to merit a Protocol Amendment (and re-review by all participating IRBs), or, alternatively, a listing of deviations of SAP vs. protocol is provided in each SAP under category "Summary of Statistical Analysis Changes to the Protocol". </p>
              <p>For the described VBP15-LTE open-label study, the study team discussed the option of an interim analysis, and agreed that it was important to address long-term safety data and efficacy data relative to external comparators. It was then discussed whether this deviation from Protocol warranted an Amendment to the VBP15-LTE protocol, or rather a listing in the "Summary of Statistical Analysis Changes to the Protocol" in the interim SAP. The study team agreed that given that this was an open-label study utilizing external comparators, and that interim analyses would not influence the integrity of the full 2-year study, that a note in the SAP "Summary of Statistical Analysis Changes to the Protocol" was the best approach. Attached is the fully executed interim SAP for VBP15-LTE, and the "Summary of Statistical Analysis Changes to the Protocol" is seen at 3.3 on Page 8 noting the deviation from the protocol.]]</p>
              <p>Thank you for your response and for explaining this point. Please include this information in the text of the manuscript, or in the supporting information (called out in the main text of the manuscript) to clarify this.</p>
              <p>2.Inclusion of pre-specified protocol: Thank you for clarifying the rationale behind the 12 month data analysis, and for sending us your interim SAP for reference. We note that it is marked âconfidentialâ and request that you include a version (that still describes the planned and changed aspects of your analyses) as a supporting information file (e.g. S1 Interim SAP).</p>
              <p>3.Data availability: We appreciate your willingness to make your data available. Please provide a link, or other access details, for data access, as part of the data availability statement. (Any means to provide data access is acceptable- The existing DYAD site you mentioned in your email message is fine provided it is updated with the data from this manuscript).</p>
              <p>4. Abstract: Methods and Findings: Please present the TTSTAND results first in the order, as this is one of the primary study outcomes highlighted in the registered trial.</p>
              <p>5.Abstract: Methods and Findings: Please include the population and setting of participants, and years during which the study took place.</p>
              <p>6.Abstract: Methods and Findings: Please quantify the main results (with both 95% CIs and p values).</p>
              <p>7.In the last sentence of the Abstract Methods and Findings section, please describe the main limitation(s) of the study's methodology.</p>
              <p>8. Abstract: Conclusions: Please revise the sentence "Vamorolone ... improves gross motor outcomes...", to "We observed that vamorolone treatment was associated with improvements in some motor outcomes as compared with corticosteroid-naÃ¯ve individuals". To clarify that not all motor outcomes measured were found to be significantly improved.</p>
              <p>9. Abstract: Conclusions: Please clarify the statements in the conclusion regarding adverse effects- something similar to the following may be helpful: âWe found that fewer physician-reported adverse events occurred with vamorolone than have been reported for treatment with prednisones and deflazacort.â </p>
              <p>10.Author Summary: Please structure the Author Summary using bullet points rather than paragraph format. Please see our author guidelines for more information: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/revising-your-manuscript#loc-author-summary">https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/revising-your-manuscript#loc-author-summary</ext-link></p>
              <p>In the author summary, the section âWhy Was This Study Done?â should provide the rationale for investigating both the motor function outcomes and safety concerns (as you report results relevant to each).</p>
              <p>In the author summary section âWhat did the authors do and find?â please make it clear that not all measured components of motor function (e.g. TTSTAND) demonstrated improvement (as in when compared with the external comparison group)</p>
              <p>In the author summary, please clarify what is meant by âdecreased safety concernsâ (do you mean fewer reported AEs, for example?)</p>
              <p>11. Results: When presenting the results, please explicitly present the TTSTAND findings first, as this is one of the primary outcomes proposed in the trial registry. The other motor outcomes are registered as secondary outcomes, and the results should be presented and discussed in that order for clarity.</p>
              <p>12.Discussion: Please present and organize the Discussion as follows: a short, clear summary of the article's findings; what the study adds to existing research and where and why the results may differ from previous research; strengths and limitations of the study; implications and next steps for research, clinical practice, and/or public policy; one-paragraph conclusion.</p>
              <p>13. Discussion: Please revise the sentence in the Discussion stating âThese comparisons showed that DMD participants treated with vamorolone for 18 months (2.0 or 6.0 mg/kg/day) showed improvements in all motor outcomes studied, in comparison to corticosteroid-naÃ¯ve participants for TTRW (p=0.003) and TTCLIMB velocity (p=0.027) (Table 2).â Although you mention the TTSTAND findings in the following sentence, this sentence is misleading as you mention improvements in all motor outcomes studied. As TTSTAND is your primary registered motor outcome, please present your discussion of that outcome first.</p>
              <p>14.Checklist: Thank you for including the TREND checklist. When completing the checklist, please use section and paragraph numbers to refer to locations in the text, rather than page numbers, as page numbers are subject to change. Please add the following statement, or similar, to the Methods: "This study is reported as per the Transparent Reporting of Evaluations with Nonrandomized Designs (TREND) guideline (S1 Checklist)."</p>
              <p>15. Figure 1: Please present TTSTAND results first (top) and please provide the abbreviations for TTSTAND, TTCLIMB and TTRW in the figure legend.</p>
              <p>16. Table 1: In the legend, please define abbreviations for CINRG, DNHS.</p>
              <p>17. Table 2: Please include units for velocity measures. Please report the TTSTAND results first in the table, as this was your primary outcome. Please define abbreviations for DNHS, LS, NSAA, 6MWT, TTSTAND, TTCLIMB, TTRW, BMI, SD, SE, CI, and any other abbreviations used.</p>
              <p>18. Table 3: Please define the abbreviation âNrâ</p>
              <p>19. Supporting information Figure 1: Please provide a descriptive legend for the figure, including the meaning behind the green stars, the red squares, and the axis labels.</p>
              <p>20. S2 Table: Please provide (in a descriptive legend for the table) a brief description of the units of the measures for each test (seconds to what endpoint? Seconds to complete task/achieve criteria, etc). Please also define abbreviations for TTSTAND, TTCLIMB, TTRW, and present the TTSTAND outcomes first.</p>
              <p>Comments from Reviewers:</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: The authors have addressed most of my points but there still remain a couple of issues.</p>
              <p>I suggested a sensitivity analysis of the time data alongside the use of velocities. I am afraid I do not completely understand the authors response in the rebuttal letter. However this was only a suggested sensitivity analysis so it is perhaps not necessary to push the issue.</p>
              <p>More seriously the authors do not seem to have understood my point about the premature end of the study. My apologies if I was not sufficiently clear here but if a study planned to last for 24 months is stopped and reported prematurely then this raises the issue of how that decision was made. Was this made independently of the investigators by the oversight committee? Was an interim analysis planned and how was that carried out? The desire for transparency about this is driven by the fact that in the Bad Old Days people had preliminary peeks at the data and so used up all their alpha. I am not suggesting the authors did this but for full transparency we need to know what happened.</p>
              <p>Michael Dewey</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: Thank you for your thorough response to all comments and included edits. No additional concerns with this revision.</p>

              </p>
              <p>Dear Dr. Smith, </p>
              <p>On behalf of my colleagues and the academic editor, Dr. Lindsay Alfano, I am delighted to inform you that your manuscript entitled "Efficacy and safety of vamorolone in Duchenne muscular dystrophy:Â An 18-month interim analysis of a non-randomized open-label extension study." (PMEDICINE-D-20-00478R3) has been accepted for publication in PLOS Medicine. </p>
              <p>PRODUCTION PROCESS</p>
              <p>Before publication you will see the copyedited word document (in around 1-2 weeks from now) and a PDF galley proof shortly after that. The copyeditor will be in touch shortly before sending you the copyedited Word document. We will make some revisions at the copyediting stage to conform to our general style, and for clarification. When you receive this version you should check and revise it very carefully, including figures, tables, references, and supporting information, because corrections at the next stage (proofs) will be strictly limited to (1) errors in author names or affiliations, (2) errors of scientific fact that would cause misunderstandings to readers, and (3) printer's (introduced) errors.</p>
              <p>If you are likely to be away when either this document or the proof is sent, please ensure we have contact information of a second person, as we will need you to respond quickly at each point.</p>
              <p>PRESS</p>
              <p>A selection of our articles each week are press released by the journal. You will be contacted nearer the time if we are press releasing your article in order to approve the content and check the contact information for journalists is correct. If your institution or institutions have a press office, please notify them about your upcoming paper at this point, to enable them to help maximize its impact. </p>
              <p>PROFILE INFORMATION</p>
              <p>Now that your manuscript has been accepted, please log into EM and update your profile.
