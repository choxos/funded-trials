                <p>We assessed whether oral insulin slowed metabolic decline after 1 year of treatment in individuals at high risk for type 1 diabetes. Two oral insulin trials that did not show efficacy overall and had type 1 diabetes as the primary end point were analyzed: the Diabetes Prevention Trial–Type 1 (DPT-1) and the TrialNet oral insulin trials. Oral glucose tolerance tests at baseline and after 1 year of treatment were analyzed. Among those at high risk (with a Diabetes Prevention Trial–Type 1 Risk Score [DPTRS] ≥6.75), the area under the curve (AUC) C-peptide increased significantly from baseline to 1 year in each oral insulin group, whereas the AUC glucose increased significantly in each placebo group. At 1 year, the AUC C-peptide/AUC glucose (AUC Ratio) was significantly higher in the oral insulin group than in the placebo group in each trial (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05; <italic>P</italic> = 0.057 when adjusted for age in the TrialNet trial) and in both trials combined (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01 with or without adjustment for age). For a DPTRS &lt;6.75, oral insulin groups did not differ from placebo groups in the AUC Ratio. The findings suggest that 1 year of treatment with oral insulin slows metabolic deterioration in individuals at high risk for type 1 diabetes. Moreover, the findings further suggest that metabolic end points can be useful adjuncts to the diagnostic end point in assessments of preventive treatments for the disorder.</p>

              <p content-type="flushleft">Two randomized placebo-controlled trials have been performed to assess whether oral insulin can delay progression to type 1 diabetes in autoantibody-positive relatives of patients with type 1 diabetes (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). In the Diabetes Prevention Trial–Type 1 (DPT-1), there was no overall effect of oral insulin. However, in a subgroup of participants with insulin autoantibody (IAA) titers ≥80, there was a lower occurrence of type 1 diabetes among those receiving oral insulin. The subsequent TrialNet trial included individuals who had autoantibody patterns with a risk equivalent to those with the higher IAA titers in the DPT-1 oral insulin trial. Despite the lack of an overall effect, oral insulin decreased progression to diabetes in a prespecified secondary stratum with lower first-phase insulin responses (FPIRs).</p>
              <p>The seemingly greater responses to oral insulin among groups with high IAA titers and low FPIR suggested that treatment responsiveness could be related to a higher risk for type 1 diabetes. Moreover, in a recent trial of high-risk individuals, the time to diagnosis was delayed in those receiving teplizumab (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Thus, we analyzed the DPT-1 and the TrialNet oral insulin trials to assess whether oral insulin slowed metabolic decline in high-risk individuals.</p>

                <p content-type="flushleft">The DPT-1 oral insulin trial has been described previously (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). All participants were islet cell autoantibody– and IAA-positive relatives of individuals with type 1 diabetes. Those with dysglycemia or a low FPIR were excluded. These criteria were chosen so that the oral insulin trial cohort would have a 5-year risk of developing type 1 diabetes of 25–50%. In the TrialNet oral insulin trial (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), eligible individuals were required to fulfill the following autoantibody criteria: positivity for microinsulin autoantibodies in two samples; and either islet cell autoantibodies confirmed in two samples or, if not confirmed, GAD and insulinoma-associated antigen-2 autoantibody positivity in the same sample with at least one of those autoantibodies also positive in a different sample. These criteria were based on a post hoc analysis of the DPT-1 oral insulin trial, suggesting that among participants with IAA titers ≥80, those receiving oral insulin seemed to have a delayed time to diagnosis. The metabolic entry criteria were the same as those for the oral insulin trial. Data from participants in the DPT-1 and the TrialNet oral insulin trials who had undergone oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs) after a specified treatment duration approximating 1.00 year (0.75–1.25 years) were included in the analyses (described below): 76% (282 of 372) in the DPT-1 oral insulin trial and 89% (340 of 382) in the TrialNet oral insulin trial. There were no significant differences in any of the baseline characteristics between those included in and those excluded from the analyses for either trial (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.2337/figshare.12327881">Supplementary Tables 1</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.2337/figshare.12327881">2</ext-link>).</p>

                <p content-type="flushleft">In both the DPT-1 and the TrialNet oral insulin trials, participants were randomized to receive orally each day 7.5 mg of recombinant human insulin crystals (Eli Lilly) or placebo. Participants underwent 2-h OGTTs at 6-month intervals for the diagnostic surveillance of type 1 diabetes. Glucose and C-peptide were measured while participants were in a fasted state and at 30, 60, 90, and 120 min during the OGTT. Glucose was administered according to weight (1.75 g/kg) with a 75-g maximum. A type 1 diabetes diagnosis was based on American Diabetes Association criteria (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Plasma glucose levels were measured by the glucose oxidase method. C-peptide was measured with the Tosoh assay. Autoantibody measurements were performed as previously described (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>).</p>

                <title>Statistical Analysis</title>
                <p content-type="flushleft">The rationale for the timing of the end point was to maximize treatment duration without the potential bias of a high frequency of diagnoses prior to the visit. Given this rationale, the 1-year end point was specifically selected due to the sizable increase in the frequency of diagnoses from the 1-year visit to the 1.5-year visit. For example, in the DPT-1 oral insulin trial, among those with a Diabetes Prevention Trial–Type 1 Risk Score (DPTRS) ≥6.75, 6 (5 in the placebo group) were diagnosed before the 1-year visit, whereas 14 (11 in the placebo group) were diagnosed before the 1.5-year visit. The DPTRS was calculated as previously described (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.2337/figshare.12327881">Supplementary Material</ext-link>). For metabolic end point comparisons, covariance analyses were used with adjustments for baseline values, and with adjustments for age and the DPTRS.</p>
                <p>Combined glucose and C-peptide (Glu-Cpep) response curves were derived from mean 30- to 120-min OGTT values for glucose and C-peptide plotted on a two-dimensional grid (glucose on the <italic>y</italic>-axis, C-peptide on the <italic>x</italic>-axis). Glu-Cpep response curve locations on the grid and shapes were compared. These locations and shapes change characteristically during the progression to type 1 diabetes. Centroids (central points) of the shapes of the Glu-Cpep response curves were calculated according to the formula for centroids of triangles (the curve shapes tended to be triangular). Glucose and C-peptide centroid coordinates indicate OGTT locations during progression. The ratio of these coordinates correlates very highly with the area under the curve (AUC) C-peptide/AUC glucose (AUC Ratio). Student <italic>t</italic> tests and χ<sup>2</sup> tests were used to assess differences. Cox regression was used for generating hazard ratios (HRs) and for making adjustments when type 1 diabetes was an end point. Because the overall follow-up was longer in the TrialNet oral insulin trial, its maximum was limited to 7.0 years for this analysis. Two-sided <italic>P</italic> values were used to assess statistical significance. The analyses were performed with SAS, version 9.4. A DPTRS threshold ≥6.75 was chosen to define high risk, since the 3-year risk increases markedly as DPTRS values increase above 6.75 (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p>

              <p content-type="flushleft">Of the 282 participants from the DPT-1 oral insulin trial analyzed here, 90 (32%) had a DPTRS ≥6.75, whereas of the 340 from TrialNet, 118 (35%) had a DPTRS above that threshold (for a total of 208 participants with a DPTRS ≥6.75).

Vectors representing changes on the grid differed in directionality between oral insulin and placebo groups in both trials. This was reflected by significant AUC C-peptide increases in oral insulin treatment groups of each trial (DPT-1: 3.28 ± 0.17 to 3.86 ± 0.21 ng/mL, <italic>P</italic> = 0.002 [<italic>n</italic> = 37]; TrialNet: 3.84 ± 1.51 to 4.20 ± 1.65 ng/mL, <italic>P</italic> = 0.018 [<italic>n</italic> = 60]), and significant increases of AUC glucose in placebo groups of each trial (DPT-1: 132.7 ± 13.8 to 148.7 ± 43.2 mg/dL, <italic>P</italic> = 0.006 [<italic>n</italic> = 53]; TrialNet: 132.9 ± 13.5 to 146.4 ± 28.9 mg/dL, <italic>P</italic> = 0.001 [<italic>n</italic> = 58]).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p content-type="flushleft">The findings suggest that oral insulin slows metabolic progression in high-risk individuals. This suggestion is based on analyses showing a higher 1-year AUC Ratio in oral insulin groups than in placebo groups of both oral insulin trials, with corroborating evidence from OGTT vectors for the degree of progression and OGTT phenotypes.</p>
              <p>The diagnosis of type 1 diabetes was delayed in the high-risk participants receiving oral insulin in DPT-1, but only a trend was apparent for those in TrialNet. Although a diagnosis has been the gold standard for prevention trial end points, there are downsides to its use. Participants’ adherence to taking study medication could decline as lengthy trials progress, resulting in diminished responsiveness to an experimental treatment (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Also, a diagnostic end point can be insufficient for assessing timing and sustainability of treatment efficacy and for understanding mechanisms of treatment effects. Intermediate metabolic end points could be helpful for such assessments and also for reducing trial length, burden, and costs. However, although the findings from this study should encourage the development of metabolic end points, they would be adjuncts to the diagnosis end point.</p>
              <p>A DPTRS ≥6.75 defines an advanced metabolic stage at which oral insulin seems to be effective. Since evidence suggests that the loss of β-cell function begins to accelerate ∼1–2 years prior to diagnosis (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), oral insulin could possibly interfere with factors(s) contributing to that acceleration in high-risk individuals.</p>
              <p>There is little prior information regarding metabolic measures as type 1 diabetes prevention trial end points. One study examined changes in HbA<sub>1c</sub>, glucose, and C-peptide measures over 2 years and concluded that such measures have potential as intermediate end points (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p>
              <p>This study’s main limitation was the post hoc analysis. Since such analyses have potential for bias, they should be interpreted cautiously<sub>.</sub> In particular, exclusions due to absent 1-year OGTTs could have introduced a bias. However, there were no significant differences between those included in and those excluded from the analyses. The study’s main strength was the ability to assess the consistency of findings between two independent oral insulin trials.</p>
              <p>The findings raise the question of whether higher doses of oral insulin would have yielded a larger and more general benefit for the full cohort. Evidence suggests that oral insulin at doses higher than the 7.5 mg used in the trials has a more favorable effect on the immune system (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p>
              <p>In conclusion, although the findings cannot be considered definitive, they seem sufficiently promising to warrant continuing assessments of oral insulin as a potential preventive treatment for type 1 diabetes. In addition, it seems that intermediate metabolic end points could help to substantially shorten prevention trials and facilitate the evaluation of preventive treatments for type 1 diabetes.</p>
