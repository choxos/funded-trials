                  <title>Background:</title>
                  <p>Head and neck cancer (HNC) patients undergoing radiation therapy (RT)
experience significant side effects, presenting challenging care tasks for
their informal (unpaid) caregivers. HNC caregivers report low caregiving
self-efficacy, high distress, and interest in supportive care
interventions.</p>

                <sec id="section2-15347354221098984">
                  <title>Objective:</title>
                  <p>This randomized pilot trial assessed the feasibility and acceptability of a 6
to 7âweek supported self-management intervention (Prepare to Care) offering
psychoeducation and stress management skills building for caregivers of
patients receiving RT for HNC.</p>

                <sec id="section3-15347354221098984">
                  <title>Methods:</title>
                  <p>Caregivers were randomized to Prepare to Care or standard of care. Primary
feasibility measures included participation and retention percentages.
Assessments were completed before the intervention, at intervention
completion, and 6-weeks later after intervention completion.</p>

                  <title>Results:</title>
                  <p>Caregivers (Nâ=â38) were predominantly female (88.6%), an average age of
56âyears old, and a spouse/partner to the patient (71.4%). Participation
percent was 42.2%; retention at intervention conclusion was 80% and 77% at
the 6-week follow-up. Quantitative and qualitative results support
acceptability, with 64% to 88% reporting each intervention module was
helpful (quite a bit or very). Intervention caregivers reported a
significantly greater improvement in self-efficacy for progressive muscle
relaxation (PMR).</p>

                  <title>Conclusions:</title>
                  <p>Prepare to Care and the randomized pilot trial methods are feasible and
acceptable for HNC caregivers of patients receiving RT. A significant
treatment effect was observed for self-efficacy for PMR, and findings were
in the expected direction regarding improved caregiving self-efficacy.
Further research is necessary to determine the efficacy of this intervention
with a focus on increased engagement strategies and longer-term
outcomes.</p>

              <p>Treatment for the 66â000 people diagnosed with HNC each year in the United States is
complex and often includes daily radiotherapy (RT) for 6 to 7âweeks, sometimes in
combination with chemotherapy and/or surgery.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bibr2-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Patients experience significant
side effects that impede core aspects of daily life and report higher care needs
relative to other cancer patients, presenting challenging care tasks for informal
caregivers.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="bibr4-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr5-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Caring for a
patient with HNC may include special food preparation (eg, pureeing food) and
feeding tube management, as well as more traditional informal caregiving tasks such
as providing emotional support, administering medications, managing medical
appointments and insurance claims, communicating with health care providers, and
providing hands-on medical care with little to no training.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bibr6-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="bibr7-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr8-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Cancer caregivers, including
HNC caregivers, commonly report low self-efficacy for specific caregiving tasks.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Low self-efficacy (ie, oneâs confidence in capacity to engage in a particular
behavior) among cancer caregivers has been shown to be associated with worse
caregiver distress, strain, coping, quality of life, adaptation, caregiver
functioning, and physical health, as well as patient physical and emotional symptom
burden.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="bibr10-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr11-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p>
              <p>HNC caregivers also report high rates of and clinically significant emotional
distress, caregiver burden, fear of patient cancer recurrence, and poorer physical
and mental health compared to patients and the general population.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="bibr13-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr14-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr15-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr16-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> One study demonstrated that
during and shortly following the patientâs course of RT, HNC caregivers reported
increased schedule burden, decreased self-esteem, poorer self-reported health, and
dysregulation of the psychoneuroendocrine system.<sup><xref rid="bibr17-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Similarly, another study showed that HNC caregivers experienced a steady
increase in distress, peaking 5âweeks into the patientâs radiotherapy treatment.<sup><xref rid="bibr18-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Collectively, these findings suggest a critical need to support HNC
caregivers during patient radiotherapy, a time of substantial patient care
needs.<sup><xref rid="bibr19-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="bibr20-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr21-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup></p>
              <p>HNC caregivers have a need for, and are interested in, supportive care
interventions.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bibr22-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="bibr23-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr24-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr25-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr26-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> The few existing
interventions for HNC caregivers have demonstrated promise, but have focused solely
on optimizing delivery of patient care or have intervened on both members of the
patient-caregiver dyad.<sup><xref rid="bibr27-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="bibr28-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr29-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr30-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> The majority were time and
resource-intensive, requiring several in-person or lengthy telephone sessions.
Resource-intensive interventions requiring significant provider or support staff
engagement can be costly to deliver and result in limited translation to clinical practice.<sup><xref rid="bibr31-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> In supported self-management interventions, the recipient uses self-directed
educational materials to learn information and strategies to manage emotions and
promote healthy behaviors with the support of a health care provider.<sup><xref rid="bibr32-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="bibr33-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> Such
interventions are often used for individuals affected by chronic diseases, such as cancer.<sup><xref rid="bibr34-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> Supported self-management interventions can be low cost, reduce health care
utilization, and have greater dissemination potential.<sup><xref rid="bibr32-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="bibr35-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> Further, supported
self-management interventions can be used according to the participantâs preferences
for place and time and lessen logistical barriers to in-person delivered
interventions. As such, they may be especially attractive to HNC caregivers
navigating the hectic radiotherapy treatment period. Supported self-management
interventions have shown improvements in fatigue, depression, anxiety, and overall
quality of life; however, to date, these interventions have largely been applied in
cancer patients, particularly among cancer populations not including HNC (eg,
breast, lung, prostate), and have been under-utilized in the cancer caregiving
field.<sup><xref rid="bibr32-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><xref rid="bibr33-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr34-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup></p>
              <p>In this study, we conducted a randomized pilot trial to evaluate Prepare to Care, a
supported self-management intervention that teaches psycho-education and
stress-management skills for caregivers of patients receiving radiation therapy. Our
primary aim was to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention and
the randomized pilot trial methods. We also assessed potential improvements in
self-efficacy for caregiving and other caregiver outcomes including distress
(anxiety and depression), quality of life, and self-efficacy for abbreviated
progressive muscle relaxation.</p>

                <p>We assessed the feasibility and acceptability of a 6 to 7-week self-management
intervention and the randomized pilot trial methods for caregivers of HNC
patients undergoing radiation therapy using a parallel group design. Caregivers
were randomized 1:1 to the intervention or standard of care control group using
a computer-generated randomization scheme with mixed block sizes developed by
the biostatistician. Caregivers completed assessments before the intervention
(T1), at intervention completion (T2), and 6-week after intervention completion
(T3). Intervention caregivers completed a semi-structured qualitative interview
at T2. Sociodemographics and caregiving characteristics were collected at
recruitment. We also collected clinical characteristics for the patient at study
recruitment from the electronic health record. This study was approved by the
local Institutional Review Board (IRB00038084) and registered with
clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03032250) and adheres to CONSORT recommendations for
reporting a pilot feasibility trial.<sup><xref rid="bibr36-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup></p>

                <p>We approached patient-caregiver dyads at 2 outpatient radiation clinics at the
Comprehensive Cancer Center of Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center. If a primary,
informal (unpaid) caregiver was not present, with permission of the patient we
contacted the caregiver by telephone to gage interest in the study. Though
Prepare to Care is a caregiver-directed intervention, at study initiation, both
members of the dyad provided written informed consent. In order to increase
accrual, we later revised the eligibility criteria so that patient consent was
not required for caregiver participation. Patient eligibility included: (1) new
or recurrent AJCC stage I to IV squamous cell carcinoma of the upper
aerodigestive tract (including lip/oral cavity, nasopharynx, salivary gland,
oropharynx, hypopharynx, paranasal sinus, and larynx cancers), (2) planned
external beam radiotherapy (Â± chemotherapy) for 6 to 7âweeks (with curative
intent), (3) â¥18âyears of age, and (4) having an informal (unpaid) caregiver
during RT who is also willing to participate in the study. Patients were
excluded if they could not read/communicate in English. Caregivers were eligible
if they were: (1) providing the majority of the informal (unpaid) care for an
adult meeting the above criteria, and (2) â¥18âyears of age. Caregivers were
excluded if they (1) had a current cancer diagnosis or (2) could not
read/communicate in English. Caregivers received $20 gift cards at the
completion of T1, T2, and T3 assessments ($60 in gift cards total).</p>

                <p>Intervention content, timing, and delivery format were developed prior to the
current study using a 3-step process including: (1) assessing preferences for
wellness programs, including delivery and timing preferences, among a different
sample of HNC caregivers<sup><xref rid="bibr12-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>; (2) obtaining input regarding intervention content and delivery from an
advisory panel including HNC caregivers and clinicians; and (3) reviewing
empirical literature to identify HNC challenges, especially during the
radiotherapy period. The Prepare to Care intervention is guided by the
self-efficacy construct from Social Cognitive Theory.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Self-efficacy refers to oneâs confidence in his or her capacity to engage

                <p>The multi-component intervention, Prepare to Care, includes: (1) a brief
introduction video on a DVD and study website; (2) 8 modules (<xref rid="table1-15347354221098984" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) available as
a hard copy workbook and on the study website; and (3) CD with audio
instructions to facilitate Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR) Training (to
accompany a module on PMR). PMR training teaches caregivers to identify muscle
tension signals and to use the signals as cues to trigger a relaxation response.<sup><xref rid="bibr37-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> Prepare to Care is a 6 to 7âweek intervention aligned with a patientâs RT
(ie, intervention began at the start of radiotherapy and was completed at the
end of radiotherapy), in recognition that the severity of multiple RT-related
acute toxicities and associated care burdens increase during the treatment regimen.<sup><xref rid="bibr21-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> To maximize intervention engagement, modules were designed to be
succinct, and study iPads linking directly to the website were available for use
at the radiotherapy clinic. Each module includes an introduction and rationale
for the topic, strategies to overcome relevant challenges, and an activity to
facilitate skills building. Caregiver vignettes are interspersed throughout the
modules.</p>

                <p>After recruitment and randomization, caregivers in the intervention group met
with the study interventionist at the radiation clinic or by telephone to review
the intervention. All participants were provided access to the online website
and hard-copy materials (provided in person or by mail). Interventionist
involvement was minimal; sessions were brief (approximately 10âminutes) and
supported caregiversâ independent engagement with the materials by checking in
on caregiversâ module completion and answering potential questions. Each week,
caregivers completed a brief assessment to help guide them to relevant modules,
though caregivers were encouraged to complete the modules they felt would be
most helpful. The assessment included a 24-item checklist with items that
corresponded to topics covered in the 8 modules. Modules with the most items
selected were recommended. Participants had the option to complete this with the
interventionist or on their own. This preference-based approach empowers
caregivers to build skills to address their evolving challenges. Caregivers were
asked to complete at least 1 module per week and re-visit modules as needed and
did not need to complete all modules as part of their participation. Caregivers
were encouraged to utilize intervention materials at a time that best fit their
schedule. Modules included time logs to track use. The interventionist also sent
weekly text or email reminders to complete modules, based on participantsâ
communication preferences.</p>

                <title>Feasibility and Acceptability</title>
                <p>Our primary feasibility measures were participation and retention proportions.
Prepare to Care acceptability was assessed with a quantitative survey developed
for the study and a semi-structured qualitative interview at T2. The
quantitative survey asked caregivers to rate how helpful each component of the
intervention was from 0 (âNot at all helpfulâ) to 4 (âVery much helpfulâ).
Qualitative interviews (lasting approximately 30âminutes to 1âhour) explored
factors influencing overall acceptability. Specifically, caregivers were asked
about their overall experience with the intervention and what they liked or
wished was different about each of the intervention components or features.
Interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim.</p>

                <p>Measures were completed online using REDCap, by telephone, or with paper versions
completed in person at the clinic or at home and returned by mail. The Caregiver
Inventory (CI)<sup><xref rid="bibr38-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> is a 21-item instrument that assesses caregiving self-efficacy including
self-efficacy for managing medical information, caring for the patient, caring
for oneself, and managing difficult interactions/emotions. The CI uses a 9-point
Likert scale (ânot at all confidentâ to âtotally confidentâ). Total scores range
from 21 to 189, with higher scores indicating greater caregiving self-efficacy.
The CI has demonstrated adequate validity and reliability and has been
previously used with HNC caregivers.<sup><xref rid="bibr38-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="bibr39-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> Depressive symptoms were
assessed with the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D),<sup><xref rid="bibr40-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> a 20-item instrument assessing frequency of symptoms associated with
depression (ie, restless sleep, poor appetite, and feeling lonely). Scores range
from 0 to 60, with higher scores indicating more depressive symptoms. The CES-D
has been widely used in caregiver populations.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="bibr41-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="bibr42-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> Anxiety was assessed with
the PROMIS Emotional Distress Anxiety Short Form- 8a,<sup><xref rid="bibr43-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> a brief 8-item assessment of anxiety. T-scores range from 37.1 to 83.1,
with higher scores reflecting greater anxiety. We assessed quality of life using
the total score of the Caregiver Quality of Life Index-Cancer (CqoL-Canc). The
CqoL-Canc is a 35-item instrument that assesses burden, disruptiveness, positive
adaptation, and financial concerns and provides a total quality of life score.
The CqoL-Canc uses a 5-point Likert scale (ânot at allâ to âvery muchâ), with
scores ranging from 0 to 100 and higher scores indicating better quality of
life. The instrument has demonstrated reliability and validity and is strongly
recommended as quality of life assessment for cancer caregivers.<sup><xref rid="bibr44-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="bibr45-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup>
Self-efficacy for engaging in progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) was assessed
with 3-items developed for the purpose of this study (Cronbachâs alpha .89). The
instrument uses a 9-point Likert scale (ânot at all confidentâ to âtotally
confidentâ), with scores ranging from 3 to 27. Higher scores reflect greater
self-efficacy for PMR. These items assess self-efficacy for: (1) distinguishing
between tense and relaxed muscles, (2) relaxing each muscle one by one, and (3)
relaxing quickly when in stressful situations.</p>

                <title>Data Analysis</title>
                <p>The sample size was based upon the primary outcome of feasibility. For the
targeted sample size of 40, two-sided 95% confidence interval around the
expected recruitment (70%) and retention (80%) percentages were within Â±12%,
yielding 95% confidence that the true recruitment percentage would exceed 59%
and the true retention percentage would exceed 67%, both of which would indicate
a feasible study. Descriptive statistics (means and standard deviations for
continuous variable and frequencies/percentages for categorical variables) were
used to summarize sociodemographic characteristics and caregiving
characteristics at T1. Participation and retention proportions and their
associated 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated. Participation
proportion was estimated as proportion of all eligible screened caregivers who
agreed to participate; retention proportions were estimated as proportion of all
enrolled participants completing T1 surveys who completed all subsequent (T2 and
T3) surveys.</p>
                <p>Acceptability of the intervention was summarized quantitatively and qualitatively
by caregivers in the intervention arm following the conclusion of the
intervention. Percentages of caregivers reporting that an intervention component
was quite a bit or very much helpful were calculated to demonstrate
acceptability of each intervention component. Qualitative interviews were coded
by 2 raters using a thematic analysis procedure.<sup><xref rid="bibr46-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="bibr47-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup> Specifically, coders read
and re-read interview transcripts and identified themes related to acceptability
and suggestions for improvement. Discrepancies were resolved with team
discussion to achieve consensus.</p>
                <p>Finally, though our study was not powered to detect intervention effects, as a
secondary goal we examined differences in key outcomes. In an intent-to-treat
analysis, we used mixed models with a random subject effect and fixed effects of
time (T1, T2, T3, treated as 3 categories), intervention (yes/no), and included
the first-order interaction between intervention assignment and time. We used
linear contrasts to estimate average within-person changes by time by
intervention group. A 2-sided alpha level of .05 was used to indicate
statistical significance. Outcomes examined included self-efficacy for
caregiving (CI total score as well as the 4 subscales), self-efficacy for
progressive muscle relaxation, depression, anxiety, and overall CqoL-Canc total
index score). All analyses were conducted in SAS (version 9.4, Cary, NC).</p>

                <p>Caregivers were approached for recruitment between May 2017 and December 2019,
with brief disruptions due to staffing issues. Of the 90 eligible caregivers, 38
(42.2%, 95% CI 32.0%-52.4%) agreed to participate and were randomized to the
Prepare to Care intervention (nâ=â19) or control group (nâ=â19). See <xref rid="table2-15347354221098984" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> for

randomized, 35 completed T1 assessments (92%; 95% CI 79%-98%; nâ=â17
intervention; nâ=â18 control). The 3 caregivers who did not return T1 surveys or
initiate intervention activity are not included in our primary analyses. Of the
35 caregivers who completed T1 (38.9% of the 90 eligible; 95% CI 28.8%-49.0%,
nâ=â17 intervention; nâ=â18 control), 28 (80%; 95% CI 63.1%-91.6%) were retained
at T2 (12 [70.6%; 95% CI 44%-89.7%] intervention; 16 [88.9%; 95% CI 65.3%-98.6%]

                <p>Eleven of the intervention caregivers (65%) provided quantitative ratings of
helpfulness of each intervention component. Given the preference-based nature of
the intervention, caregivers only rated helpfulness for modules used. The
majority of caregivers rated each of the used modules as quite a bit/ very much
helpful, ranging from 64.0% of caregivers (eg, Managing Time Module) to 88.0% of
caregivers (Utilizing Resources Module). All modules were completed by all
participants who completed the survey, with the exception of the Utilizing
Resources Module (completed by 80% of participants) and the Seeking and

                <p>Qualitative findings (nâ=â12 intervention caregivers, 71%) provided additional
support for caregiversâ acceptance of the Prepare to Care Intervention. All
caregivers reported a positive experience using the Prepare to Care
Intervention, citing several ways that the intervention was helpful. Caregivers
noted that the intervention normalized what they were feeling, prompted them to
ask for help, and linked them to additional helpful resources (See <xref rid="table4-15347354221098984" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Caregivers
reported the modules increased their understanding of module content and what to
expect, which better equipped the caregiver to care for the patient. Similarly,
it was noted that the intervention allowed caregivers to focus their energy on
their role as a caregiver. Importantly, caregivers also indicated that they
developed new skills as a result of Prepare to Care such as relaxing and coping,
learning to ask for help, and communicating with their loved one and others. One
caregiver expressed that the intervention was a catalyst for a newfound desire
to help others in similar situations.</p>

                <p>Caregivers also made suggestions for improving the intervention. Though 2
caregivers noted that they would have liked more information, 1 caregiver
reported that it was too much information and another caregiver thought the
activities were too time consuming. While several caregivers commented on ease
of intervention participation, 1 caregiver indicated that they were unable to
utilize the information learned at the time, though they were still planning to
do so now that their situation was calmer. Some caregivers also commented on how
challenging it was to remember to participate and suggested sending additional
text reminders or sending the text reminders at a different time of the day. The
website was not an appealing option to caregivers, in part because it was
duplicative of the hard-copy workbooks; suggestions included developing a
website accessible on a cell phone, such as a web-app, and including an option
to complete activities on a more interactive website.</p>

              <p>Results from this randomized pilot trial study support the feasibility and
acceptability of Prepare to Care for caregivers of patients receiving RT for HNC.
The retention percentage (80% at intervention completion and 77% at follow-up) was
consistent with the expected percentage and supported the feasibility of the
intervention. The participation percentage of 42% was lower than anticipated but
consistent with previous studies evaluating psycho-educational interventions
including cancer caregivers, although there is wide variability across studies, many
of which recruited breast and prostate cancer caregivers.<sup><xref rid="bibr27-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="bibr48-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="bibr49-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup> The hypothesized percentage
of 70% was based on a prior study that was observational, which may have been an
unrealistic estimate for a randomized pilot trial.<sup><xref rid="bibr50-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup> In this study, many caregivers who declined participation reported feeling
overwhelmed. HNC caregivers are an especially vulnerable population tasked with
providing complex care and are underrepresented with behavioral intervention
approaches. Consequently, when intervening with this population, expectations
regarding feasibility metrics such as participation should be considered carefully
and in the context of this highly burdensome disease. Further, our recruitment
challenges underscore the need for creative strategies to market programs for busy
HNC caregivers during patient RT. For example, some cancer centers have caregiver
advocates or peer support programs that include volunteers or paid staff that have
experience as an individual affected by cancer. These individuals may be
particularly well suited to share details about the study to boost recruitment
efforts. Another option is partnering with supportive care programs or patient
advocacy non-profit groups to advertise psychosocial caregiver interventions.</p>
              <p>Our findings demonstrated acceptability of the intervention. Caregivers reported that
the intervention modules were helpful and these findings were also supported by
qualitative feedback. The highest levels of acceptability were reported for the
âUtilizing Resourcesâ and âCancer Educationâ modules relative to the other modules.
This aligns with reports of high unmet educational/information needs as they pertain
to cancer and available resources from prior studies of HNC caregivers.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bibr12-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="bibr22-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="bibr24-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="bibr25-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr26-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Importantly, qualitative data
highlighted the variability in caregiversâ preferences regarding the amount of
information provided, the timing of the intervention and their engagement in
intervention activities, highlighting that the preference-based approach of the
intervention was appropriate and could be enhanced to potentially improve the
intervention. Caregivers also recommended a more interactive website for completing
the intervention activities to improve accessibility.</p>
              <p>Our findings showed an improvement in caregiving self-efficacy for intervention
caregivers relative to control group caregivers, though these findings were not
statistically significant. Similarly, other psychosocial interventions for cancer
patients and caregivers have successfully improved self-efficacy
constructs.<sup><xref rid="bibr38-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="bibr51-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="bibr52-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup> Our focus on caregiving self-efficacy for HNC caregivers is
especially important, given the challenges associated with caring for this
high-needs patient population while simultaneously taking care of oneself.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="bibr4-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr5-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr6-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Our results also suggest that
HNC caregivers can engage in PMR skills training during patient RT and improve their
PMR-specific self-efficacy. PMR and other integrative medicine modalities have been
primarily tested in cancer patient populations rather than HNC caregivers or cancer
caregivers more broadly.<sup><xref rid="bibr53-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="bibr54-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr">54</xref></sup> Of note, our qualitative data revealed that the Prepare to Care
intervention may have influenced some unmeasured outcomes in this study. For
example, intervention participants highlighted that the intervention helped
caregivers know what to expect, improved their communication with patients, and
improved their ability to ask for help. A larger, fully-powered study with a more
distal assessment and consideration of additional outcome measures is needed to
determine both proximal and distal intervention effects for caregivers.</p>
              <p>This study builds upon the sparse literature for behavioral interventions targeted at
HNC caregivers.<sup><xref rid="bibr28-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><xref rid="bibr29-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr30-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,49</sup> While most
HNC caregiver behavioral interventions have focused solely on optimizing patient
care or have been dyadic in nature, Prepare to Care focuses on providing
psycho-education and stress-management skills training for caregivers. Another
promising self-management pilot intervention targeted both HNC patients and spouse
caregivers and demonstrated intervention effects for patient and caregiver
depressive symptoms and patient cancer-specific distress.<sup><xref rid="bibr27-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> An important question for future caregiver-directed interventions, such as
Prepare to Care, is whether or not patient outcomes can be improved by caregiver
participation alone, thereby preventing additional burden for HNC patients who are
already managing multi-modality treatment and side effects.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bibr19-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="bibr20-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr21-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup></p>
              <p>There are several strengths to this study. Prepare to Care was developed with input
from stakeholders including HNC caregivers, providers, and psychosocial oncology
professionals, an important consideration for supporting translation into practice.<sup><xref rid="bibr55-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr">55</xref></sup> In addition, this study is an important contribution that builds upon the
limited psychosocial interventions that have been developed for and tested in HNC
caregivers.<sup><xref rid="bibr27-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="bibr28-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr29-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr30-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> Our focus on a vulnerable
population of caregivers (ie, HNC caregivers) who care for patients receiving
complex treatment, has been highlighted by the National Cancer Institute and
National Institute for Nursing Research as an important gap to move the cancer
caregiving field forward.<sup><xref rid="bibr56-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr">56</xref></sup> Further, the self-management format of Prepare to Care allows the
intervention to be easily delivered to those providing care for HNC patients treated
at diverse oncology clinics, with potential for adaption to other cancer caregiving
populations as well. Caregiving self-efficacy has also not traditionally been a
focus of behavioral interventions for HNC caregivers, despite caregivers reporting
poor self-efficacy and feeling underprepared for their caregiving roles.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bibr7-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Finally, we supplemented
quantitative outcome assessments using validated instruments with qualitative
interviews to allow a more in-depth exploration of caregiver experiences.</p>
              <p>This feasibility study was limited by a small sample; however, our primary interest
was ability to recruit and retain HNC caregivers during patient RT. We were not
powered to determine efficacy of our preliminary outcomes and our findings should be
interpreted with caution. Since participants could access materials in hard-copy,
online, or a mixture of both, we cannot confirm level of intervention engagement
among caregivers who were lost to follow-up. For example, it is possible that a
caregiver continued to utilize intervention materials despite not completing the T2
assessment. Though our participation percentage is similar or better than other
caregiver intervention studies, we did not meet our participation goal of
70%.<sup><xref rid="bibr48-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="bibr49-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup> In addition, participants were randomized prior to baseline and
due to the purpose of the RCT (to compare Prepare to Care with a standard care
control group), we were unable to blind participants to their assignment group,
introducing the potential for performance bias.<sup><xref rid="bibr57-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr">57</xref></sup> Given the scope of this feasibility study, we did not include a long-term
follow-up assessment to assess potential sustained or delayed intervention effects,
which may be especially important for this population since HNC patients experience
morbidity beyond the treatment period.<sup><xref rid="bibr58-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr">58</xref></sup> The majority of participants were white females who were a spouse/partner to
the patient, limiting the generalizability of these findings to additional caregiver
types. However, spouses/partners commonly serve as a caregiver for HNC patients and
HNC most commonly afflicts white males.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bibr14-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="bibr25-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> Finally, we did not stratify
randomization based on gender in this study and all 4 male caregivers were
randomized to the control group. Female cancer caregivers experience greater stress
and mental and physical health outcomes compared to male caregivers and we cannot
rule out potential gender effects in this study.<sup><xref rid="bibr59-15347354221098984" ref-type="bibr">59</xref></sup></p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>Prepare to Care, our novel self-management intervention for HNC caregivers of
patients receiving RT, and the randomized pilot trial methodology, were feasible and
acceptable in this pilot study. This study is an important first step that should be
expanded upon in future research. A larger, fully-powered efficacy trial is
necessary to determine treatment effects on caregiving self-efficacy, as well as
secondary outcomes, including potential impacts on the patients as well.
Additionally, a longer follow-up assessment is warranted to determine distal
intervention effects and mechanisms of change. In accordance with qualitative
feedback, future work should include a more interactive, mobile-accessible website
which may also ease participation burden by allowing caregivers to access materials
and complete activities on a mobile phone. Though we previously included a DVD
introduction that provided a brief overview of the intervention, we recommend
including an improved introduction that addresses perceived barriers to engagement
to help caregivers prepare with information about what to expect with the
intervention and how to best use the intervention within the busy RT schedule.
Similarly, to improve engagement, we also suggest making the PMR audio file
available on the study website. Finally, testing in diverse community oncology
clinics as a multi-site trial would provide valuable information, given the careful
consideration to scalability in the intervention development phase of Prepare to
Care.</p>
