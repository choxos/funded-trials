                <p id="Par1">Five-year survival for human papilloma virus-unrelated head and neck squamous cell carcinomas remain below 50%. We assessed the safety of administering combination hypofractionated stereotactic body radiation therapy with single-dose durvalumab (anti-PD-L1) neoadjuvantly (<italic>n</italic> = 21) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03635164">NCT03635164</ext-link>). The primary endpoint of the study was safety, which was met. Secondary endpoints included radiographic, pathologic and objective response; locoregional control; progression-free survival; and overall survival. Among evaluable patients at an early median follow-up of 16 months (448 d or 64 weeks), overall survival was 80.1% with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) (62.0%, 100.0%), locoregional control and progression-free survival were 75.8% with 95% CI (57.5%, 99.8%), and major pathological response or complete response was 75% with 95% exact CI (51.6%, 100.0%). For patients treated with 24 Gy, 89% with 95% CI (57.1%, 100.0%) had MPR or CR. Using high-dimensional multi-omics and spatial data as well as biological correlatives, we show that responders had: (1) an increase in effector T cells; (2) a decrease in immunosuppressive cells; and (3) an increase in antigen presentation post-treatment.</p>

              <p id="Par3">Patients with human papilloma virus (HPV)-unrelated head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) are at high risk for poor survival outcomes and high morbidity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Locally advanced HPV-unrelated HNSCC of the oral cavity or larynx is still primarily treated with a combination of surgery, radiation and chemotherapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Lacking effective therapeutics targeting oncogenic drivers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, the advent of immunotherapy has provided a new modality for treating these historically unresponsive tumors. Incorporating anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1, immune checkpoint inhibitors, into therapy has the potential to improve survival outcomes and decrease the treatment’s overall morbidity. Despite these advances, response rates of HPV-unrelated HNSCC to immune checkpoint blockade have been low, both pre-clinically and in recent clinical trials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par4">Preclinical and clinical trials have shown that patients with increased T cell infiltration at the time of treatment for HPV-unrelated HNSCC have improved outcomes in response to immune checkpoint therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Combining immunotherapies with radiation therapy to increase immune cell infiltration into the tumor microenvironment (TME) may improve response rates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Hypofractionated stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) may improve anti-tumor immune function instead of blunting it<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Dose-escalation studies have shown that hypofractionation is optimal for stimulating an anti-tumor immune response while minimizing an immune wound-healing phenotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Preclinical studies investigating how to overcome resistance to immunotherapy in HPV-unrelated HNSCC tumor models have shown that combining immunotherapy with SBRT can invigorate the immune system and drive tumor eradication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par5">Based on these previous findings, we hypothesized that the addition of SBRT to treatment comprising neoadjuvant checkpoint inhibition would be safe and would prime the immune system, thereby improving the chances of successful surgeries and disease outcomes for patients with HPV-unrelated HNSCC. We tested this hypothesis in a phase I/Ib clinical trial combining neoadjuvant SBRT with anti-PD-L1.</p>

                <p id="Par7">Following enrollment, patients received one dose of neoadjuvant durvalumab (1,500 mg) approximately 3–6 weeks before standard-of-care surgery, given concurrently with neoadjuvant SBRT. This SBRT dose adjustment was escalated using a 3 + 3 model. The starting SBRT dose level was given as 6 Gy for two fractions (12 Gy total) every other day over approximately 1 week to sites of gross disease only to minimize exposure to normal tissue. Representative contouring images are depicted in Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>. As no toxicity developed that delayed surgery by more than 8 weeks, the SBRT dose was increased to 6 Gy for three fractions (18 Gy total). With dosimetric dose painting, the gross tumor volume (GTV) dose for the last nine patients on trial was calculated at 24 Gy and will be reported as such. Patients underwent surgical resection approximately 3–6 weeks after radiation concluded to the initial planned resection margins, which were not adjusted in the case of a clinical response. For the first eight patients, adjuvant therapy (radiation or cisplatin–radiation therapy) was used post-surgery as per standard of care based on pathologic analysis and initial staging. All patients were required to receive adjuvant durvalumab, initiated at approximately 6–12 weeks after surgery, at 1,500 mg intravenously once every 4 weeks for a maximum of six doses, or until progression, toxicity or withdrawal from study. Durvalumab was given either as monotherapy or concurrently with adjuvant radiation with or without systemic therapy for high-risk patients. Following the eighth patient, the protocol was updated after discussion at the multi-disciplinary tumor board to allow omission of adjuvant radiation or chemoradiation for any patient who had a complete response (CR) or major pathological response (MPR) with no positive lymph nodes detected at time of surgery or on preoperative (post durvalumab–SBRT) imaging. All patients, however, were still required to receive adjuvant durvalumab. The trial design and each patient’s pathological outcome are summarized in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a,b</xref>.

A visual representation of tumor response with this treatment regimen is provided in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1g</xref>.

                <p id="Par13">To evaluate the underlying pathways that are driving this activation of T cells, we performed RNA sequencing on tumors pre- and post-treatment. Responders had an increase in expression of IFN-γ and IFN-α-associated genes pre-treatment (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>), and an increase in lymphocyte activation pathways (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). At baseline, responders had an increase in expression of genes associated with an activated immune system: immune response to antigenic stimulation, humoral immune response, leukocyte-mediated immunity, IFN-γ response and innate immune response (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>). A heatmap of genes that had significantly different expression levels between responders and nonresponders from this immune gene cluster reveals increases in genes that encode for proteins known to increase T cell trafficking to tumors (<italic>CCL21</italic>), transendothelial migration (<italic>SELE</italic>), tumor cell killing (<italic>GZMB</italic>) and antigen presentation (<italic>HLA-DRB1</italic>) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref>). Responders also differed post-treatment from nonresponders by having a decrease in expression of genes associated with Kras signaling pathway, a known oncogenic pathway (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). These findings confirm that an increase in immune infiltration and an immune activation signature pre-treatment correlated with treatment response. To validate these findings, we used a learned prediction model for cellular phenotyping based on RNA sequencing data, MultiPLIER<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. MultiPLIER confirmed our findings from CyTOF.

                <p id="Par14">With multiple methodologies confirming increased tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in the TME of responders post-treatment, we used T-cell receptor (TCR) sequencing to examine the effect of treatment on the TCR repertoire within the TME. Responders had an increase in expansion of the top five TCR sequences found in the TME compared with nonresponders (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2g</xref>). The individual expansions of the top ten TCR sequences for responder (01-009) and nonresponder (01-007) are shown in Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>. TCR expansion has been associated with better outcomes in various cancer types, including HPV-unrelated HNSCC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Given that it has been previously reported that within the TME, new T cells, not the preexisting ones, drive response to anti-PD-1 treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, we examined clones pre- and post-treatment in responders. We found that, although there are new clones that expand in responders post-treatment that were not detected at time of biopsy, preexisting T cells within the TME were also expanding post-treatment (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2h</xref> and Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">3f</xref>).</p>

VECTRA showed a significant increase in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells post-treatment in responders (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2i</xref>). Nonresponders also showed a decrease in CD4 T cells at time of surgery (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2j</xref>).

While T cells expressing PD-1 tended to decrease post-treatment in responders (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2l</xref>), cumulative PD-L1 levels on all cells appeared to decrease in both responders and nonresponders, with the levels overall being lower in responders than nonresponders (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2m</xref>).

Keratin pearls were often surrounded by TILs and MNGCs in responders (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). Although the function of MNGCs is still unknown, MNGCs may be recruited by TILs to clear keratin pearls from the TME. Nonresponders appeared not to have developed keratin pearls post-treatment, or the keratin pearls were not surrounded by MNGCs. Only one nonresponder had keratin pearls surrounded by MNGCs, but the keratin pearls were also surrounded by large numbers of regulatory T cell (T<sub>reg</sub>) cells (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). Quantification of the area of keratin pearls and MNGCs revealed a trend towards responders having an increase in keratin formation and subsequent MNGC density (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>). This suggests that MNGCs surrounding keratin pearls may be an indication that the immune system is in the process of clearing cancer cells and their presence at surgery, if cancer cells are still detectable, can potentially serve as a biologic correlative of response to neoadjuvant SBRT + anti-PD-L1.</p>

                <p id="Par17">To effectively activate T cells, tumor antigens must be presented to T cells via antigen-presenting cells (APCs) such as dendritic cells (DCs). Preclinical studies demonstrate the importance of T cell priming in the draining lymph nodes (DLNs) for response to SBRT combined with immunotherapies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Although T cell priming is primarily in the DLNs, DCs acquire antigens in the TME and T cells require additional TCR stimulation within the TME to maintain activation and decrease efflux. Although we did not observe a difference in the amount of APCs in the TME (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>), responders had increased expression of the costimulatory molecule CD86 in the APC cluster, indicating increased potential to activate T cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>).

There was also an increase in the density of IFN-γ<sup>+</sup> CD8 T cells and replicating CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (Ki-67+) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3g</xref>), as well as IFN-γ<sup>+</sup> CD4 T cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3h</xref>). To highlight that these dense structures within DLNs were primarily composed of lymphocytes, plotted as a percentage of CD3<sup>+</sup> cells, we observe enrichment of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, activated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and activated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in responders (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3i</xref>). As T cell activation by APCs is mediated by cell-to-cell contact via MHC molecules and TCRs, we also evaluated the distance between APCs and T cells. We found that there were more CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells near APCs in responders (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3j</xref>). DC–T cell interactions are highlighted by white arrows in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>. As DC–T cell interactions in the DLNs classically result in an expansion of T cell clones that will leave the DLNs and enter circulation, we also sequenced T cells in the blood pre- and post-treatment to evaluate changes in the TCR repertoire. We found that responders already had a high percentage of clonal expansion before treatment and continued to maintain a high percentage of clonally expanded T cells post-treatment, while nonresponders did not (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3k</xref>). The clones in the blood had overlap with the clones present in the TME post-treatment (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3l</xref> and Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">5c,d</xref>). To determine if patients with this HPV-unrelated HNSCC recognize similar tumor antigens, we explored the TCR sequencing for shared expansion of T cell clones, with the same amino acid sequences that define the antigen-binding pocket. We observed that the top five TCR clones shared by the most samples sequenced expanded in all patients sequenced either in the blood and/or tumor and that these clones were not specific to a virus (cytomegalovirus) (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">5e</xref>), suggesting that this patient population may have shared tumor antigens.</p>

                <title>Responders decrease immunosuppressive cells in the TME</title>
                <p id="Par19">A long-term, robust T cell-mediated response to tumor-specific antigens requires not only activation, but also maintenance of this activation within the TME. Suppression post-activation can be mediated by cells such as T<sub>reg</sub> cells. Our VECTRA spatial imaging analysis revealed that while responders had an increase in T cells and a decrease in T<sub>reg</sub> cells, the nonresponders had two main patterns of failure. Except for one nonresponder (patient 01-002), both responders and nonresponders consistently had decreased T<sub>reg</sub> cells within the TME (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). However, in nonresponders, this was accompanied by a large decrease in T cells. Plotted as a ratio of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells:T<sub>reg</sub> cells, a clear and significant difference can be observed between nonresponders and responders (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). Representative images highlighting the differences in T<sub>reg</sub> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell abundances between responders and the two types of nonresponders pre- and post-treatment are depicted in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>. T<sub>reg</sub> cells can act on effector T cells in three main ways: (1) by decreasing antigen presentation of DCs by cell-to-cell contact; (2) by releasing immunosuppressive signals into the TME such as IL-10; and (3) by sequestering the pro-survival factor IL-2 (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>). We observed that the amount of T<sub>reg</sub> cells near DCs decreased in responders while remaining unchanged in nonresponders (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>). To examine indirect means by which T<sub>reg</sub> cells are suppressing effector T cells within the TME, we used MultiPLIER to evaluate gene expression associated with T<sub>reg</sub> activity. We observed a large increase in LV57, which represents an increase in expression of genes known to encode proteins associated with T<sub>reg</sub> cell-mediated immunosuppression (CTLA-4, IL-10, IL2RA and ICOS), in nonresponders (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref> and Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">5f</xref>). Next, we asked if these differences were based on the dose of RT given to each patient, independent of response, as we observed that a combined dosimetric dose of 24 Gy was associated with improved outcomes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>). We found that after treatment, patients that received 24 Gy had lower levels of LV57 (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">5g</xref>). Similarly, the ratio of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells to T<sub>reg</sub> cells increased in patients that received 24 Gy (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">5g</xref>).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><title>Responders decrease immunosuppressive cells in the TME.</title><p><bold>a</bold>, VECTRA image quantification of T<sub>reg</sub> cells (CD3<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>−</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup>) in patient tumors pre- and post-treatment (nonresponders <italic>n</italic> = 5, responders <italic>n</italic> = 7).

                <title>Circulating lymphocytes and metabolites correlate with response</title>
                <p id="Par20">Undoubtedly, changes in the circulatory lymphocytes represent a prime opportunity for biomarker development, given that a blood draw is minimally invasive and relatively easy to process. Given that we observed similar TCR expansion in the blood to the TME, we sought to determine how changes in other circulatory lymphocytes compare with the TME. Similar to our findings within the tumor compartment, CyTOF analysis of the blood showed that responders had increases in activated T cells, decreases in suppressive immune cells and increases in naïve T cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). Within the activated T cells cluster, responders had increases in density of both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>). We then used a clustering analysis to better understand the populations changing between responders and nonresponders. Cell populations were identified using differentiating markers (CD3, CD4, CD8, CD14, CD56) (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>) and the gating strategy for CD45<sup>+</sup> cells input into the clustering analysis are provided in Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">6c</xref>. Both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells expressed high levels of proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IFN-γ in responders (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b,c</xref>). We also observed an increase in Th1-related proteins (Tbet and IL-2) in responders (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d,e</xref>). A noticeable population that was elevated in nonresponders compared with responders pre-treatment was a myeloid population that expressed TGFβ, IL-17A and DNAM-1 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5f–h</xref>). Importantly, we also observed an increase in memory T cells circulating in responders. Effector memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were significantly increased in responders at the time of surgery (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5i</xref> and Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">6d</xref>). Post-surgery, effector memory cells re-expressing CD45RA (EMRA), CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and effector CD8<sup>+</sup> memory T cells were increased in responders at the 6-month follow-up time point (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5j</xref> and Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">6d</xref>). We also sought to determine if the circulatory effector memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were increased in patients given 24 Gy. Compared with 18 Gy, patients treated with 24 Gy tended to have an increase in this cell population (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">6e</xref>). These memory T cell populations may prove to be a correlate of long-term response in these patients upon further follow-up.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><title>Circulating lymphocytes and metabolites correlate with response.</title><p><bold>a</bold>, viSNE depicting cell populations identified in the blood (nonresponders <italic>n</italic> = 3 patients, responders <italic>n</italic> = 9 patients). <bold>b</bold>, Expression of IFN-γ, <bold>c</bold>, TNF-α, <bold>d</bold>, IL-2, <bold>e</bold>, Tbet, <bold>f</bold>, TGF-β, <bold>g</bold>, IL-17A and <bold>h</bold>, DNAM in different populations in the blood.

Consistent with our pathway analysis of RNA sequencing data (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>), plasma metabolomics analyses showed a differential treatment response in responders versus nonresponders with respect to the circulating levels of several free fatty acids (including saturated, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids), all increasing in nonresponders following the treatment (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">7a</xref>).

                <title>Noninvasive markers that predict response to treatment</title>
                <p id="Par22">Predicting response to therapy pre-treatment and at time of surgery could significantly improve patient outcomes and QOL and minimize morbid procedures and associated toxicities. Our goal was to determine whether response could be predicted exclusively from noninvasive means (blood) or biopsy samples taken at time of diagnosis. With a small sample size of 16 evaluable patients, we chose to narrow down our possible predictive variables to those that had already shown correlations with outcome in previous literature. This included clinical information such as age, sex, radiation dose, time to surgery, smoking history and previous radiation. We then added correlates in the blood that we identified throughout this manuscript, such as TCR expansion, activated T cells, memory T cells and immunosuppressive cells. From the tumor, we included variables such as CD8<sup>+</sup> cells:T<sub>reg</sub> ratio, PD-L1<sup>+</sup> expression on all cells and MHC II expression on cancer cells. We then used a random forest machine learning algorithm to determine whether these variables could accurately predict response (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig14" ref-type="fig">8a,b</xref>). Importance weighting for each variable is represented in Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig14" ref-type="fig">8c</xref> for this cohort. The variables that appeared to be most important for predicting response were from the blood taken pre-surgery (naïve T cells, activated T cells and CD4<sup>+</sup> effector memory T cells). We also ran the model again, incorporating, directly, pre- and post-treatment differences (pre–post) into the model. This did not increase the accuracy of the model. Although preliminary, this predictive model was more accurate (82.5% accuracy) than the CPS, which showed no correlation with outcome or with randomly assuming that each patient would be a responder (75%). We plan to evaluate this prediction model in the ongoing phase II trial.</p>

              <p id="Par23">We report that the administration of neoadjuvant radiation in combination with durvalumab is safe for treating locally advanced HPV-unrelated HNSCCs. The safety was established not only in the context of lack of adverse events with surgical resection, but also in terms of long-term side effects. We report high rates of pathological MPR and CR for evaluable patients treated with MTD (75%) and a pathologic tumor response (pTR) pTR2 or greater of 83% among all evaluable study participants. In the expansion cohort, none of the patients who achieved pathological MPR or CR received adjuvant RT or CRT and none have recurred at the time of reporting of this publication. We observed an increase in survival when comparing our survival outcomes (80.1%) with historical outcomes (40–65%) at 16 months for standard of care described in American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 8th Edition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par24">Although we are not able directly to compare our results with other recently published clinical trials in this space due to differences in patient population and dosing regimens, our trial design in HPV-unrelated HNSCC achieved the highest reported rates of pathological MPR and CR of 75% (89% for those treated with 24 Gy), despite having patients with more advanced disease. There were no pathological MPRs or CRs in either the neoadjuvant pembrolizumab trial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> or the neoadjuvant anti-OX40 trial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. In the neoadjuvant nivolumab or nivolumab plus ipilimumab trials, the pathological reported outcomes ranged from 8% (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>) to 17% (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>) in the nivolumab alone arm compared with 20% (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>) or 35% (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>) in the combination nivolumab plus ipilimumab arm. A landmark trial that has defined response rates to adding immunotherapy in the definitive setting is the JAVELIN trial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Although it was not a neoadjuvant trial, JAVELIN’s disappointing results dampened the enthusiasm for integrating immunotherapy in patients with HNSCC. While it is conceivable that patient selection could have accounted for the lack of difference between the groups, one must wonder if the radiation fractionation and/or radiation treatment volumes could have negated any benefit immunotherapy would have offered<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Altogether, these results are consistent with those that we and others have reported in preclinical experiments: that concurrent administration of anti-PD-L1 with RT can significantly reduce tumor growth compared with either modality alone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par25">Optimal RT dose and fractionation and optimal time to surgery remain unknown. Initially we administered 12 Gy in two fractions and escalated to 18 Gy in three fractions, but it was only when the GTV was heated to 24 Gy in three fractions that MPR or CR was consistently observed. Similarly, in a separate trial that included mostly HPV-positive patients with HNSCC, using a similar hypofractionated regimen, observed pathological response rates ranged between 67% and 86% (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>). Leidner and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup> reported that 40 Gy in five fractions did yield increased toxicity, but 24 Gy in three fractions was established to be a safe dose regimen. Additionally, maximal pathological response was observed after a minimum of 5 weeks from the end of radioimmunotherapy, consistent with data reported previously for p16<sup>+</sup> locally advanced HNSCC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. This likely reflects the time required not only to clear the disease but also to develop systemic immune memory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. The latter is especially true in the context of anticipated surgical neck dissection and the need for immune priming to first develop in the DLNs before immune effector memory development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par26">Four key steps for activating and maintaining a robust T cell-mediated anti-tumor response were consistently observed in the responders tested in this clinical trial. These steps, similar to those previously identified by others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>, include: (1) initial TIL infiltration, antigen presentation and clonal expansion; (2) antigen presentation in the lymph nodes and activation/replication of T cells; (3) clonal expansion and T cell activation in the blood post-treatment; and (4) immune suppression in the TME post-treatment (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>).<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><title>Summary of mechanisms underlying treatment failure.</title><p><bold>a</bold>, Diagram of the steps involved in a successful T cell-mediated anti-tumor response: (1) Initial TIL infiltration, antigen presentation and clonal expansion.

              <p id="Par27">Similar to what has been previously reported, PD-L1 expression on cancer cells did not correlate with response to SBRT and anti-PD-L1 in our cohort<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. CPS also did not correlate with treatment response in the context of radiation and anti-PD-L1 therapy. Instead, (step1) responders’ pre-treatment TMEs were characterized by increases in expression of inflammatory gene pathways and in total number of CD103<sup>+</sup>CD39<sup>+</sup> CD8 T cells. CD103<sup>+</sup>CD39<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells may serve as tumor antigen-specific T cells and have been associated with improved response to immunotherapy in HPV-unrelated HNSCC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. The influx of TILs and increased inflammation seen in responder TMEs pre-treatment may be the result of baseline increases in antigen presentation. This is corroborated by observed increases in responders’ MHC II cancer cell expression pre-treatment. Although CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are primed through interaction with MHC I, the importance of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell priming for an enhanced and sustained CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response is well-documented<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par28">The importance of antigen presentation was further substantiated by examining changes in the DLNs (step 2). As determined spatially by the distance from DCs to T cells and quantitatively by the number of replicating T cells, responders exhibited changes consistent with increased antigen presentation in the DLNs. Further evidence supporting enhanced antigen presentation and T cell priming in the DLNs was the observed increase in circulating clonal expansion, a direct consequence of priming in the DLNs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. Clonal expansion of TCRs in the blood of responders correlated with response, a finding that may serve as a minimally invasive surrogate of response, and a reflection of antigen presentation within the DLNs.</p>
              <p id="Par29">In the circulation, not only did TCR expansion serve as a correlate of response, but so did TIL activation post-treatment (step 3). In a manner that mirrored that of the TME, the increase in T cell activation was accompanied by increases in CD103<sup>+</sup>CD39<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Also, the TCR clonal expansion observed in the blood of the responder population post-treatment was noted in the TME, with a high degree of overlap in TCR clonality. This suggests that in responders post-treatment, tumor-specific cytotoxic T cells are infiltrating the TME, and, as shown by our spatial analysis, are ultimately localized near the cancer cells. Past studies have shown that the numbers of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells close to cancer cells are more predictive of outcome than the overall numbers of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, including CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells within the stroma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par30">Finally, maintaining a sustained immune response relies on minimizing immunosuppressive immune populations within the TME (step 4). Especially for poorly immunogenic tumors, once a T cell response develops, immunosuppression ensues as a result of a negative feedback control aimed at reducing effector T cell function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. In particular, the presence of T<sub>reg</sub> cells has been shown, both in preclinical and clinical settings, to negatively influence response to immunotherapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. The TME of responders in our study had low T<sub>reg</sub> to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell ratios post-treatment. Although individual steps in activating and maintaining an effective anti-tumor response were observed, it is critical to emphasize that these interactions are interdependent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. The intimate interplay between these variables, rather than any individual component, will likely determine patient outcome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par31">Although we observed excellent response rates to this treatment regimen, not all patients exhibited a CR. Based on extensive phenotyping of each patient profile at various time points using multiple analyses described in Figs. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>–<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, four distinct patterns emerged that suggest why some patients failed to respond (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). For example, patient 01-002 exhibited a large increase in T<sub>reg</sub> cells in their TME although they had high levels of effector T cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a,c</xref>). This patient may have benefited from combining this treatment with an immunotherapy targeting T<sub>reg</sub> cells such as anti-CD25 (refs. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>). Patients 01-004 and 01-007 had low levels of antigen presentation and T cell replication in their DLNs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), possibly indicative of a lack of antigen for presentation, or a deficiency in the TCR repertoire capable of recognizing antigens being presented. As our data suggest that this patient population has shared tumor antigens, it holds promise for the development of a tumor vaccine, or a treatment to stimulate antigen presentation by DCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. Finally, patient 01-016 did not respond despite mirroring many of the responder baseline traits. Patient 01-016 had notable edema pre-surgery. High interstitial pressure in the DLNs has been previously associated with decreased T cell activity and previous studies suggest that this patient may benefit from a therapy to relieve the interstitial pressure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par32">The results of this phase I/Ib clinical trial highlight the importance of identifying the point at which a patient’s immune system is hindered in its recognition and elimination of cancer cells. To guide treatment selection, the peripheral/circulatory compartment was identified as a surrogate for the TME, and one containing putative biomarkers that may be predictive of early response to treatment. The patterns of failure in the nonresponders were uniformly determined using these circulatory markers, that is, indicators of circulating T cell activation, pre- and post-treatment, and the expansion of the circulatory TCR repertoire. It is important to note that lymphopenia, which has been commonly reported to be a consequence of conventionally fractionated radiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, was not observed in the context of the hypofractionated SBRT used in this clinical trial. Finally, our metabolomic analysis revealed that circulating plasma fatty acids in circulatory plasma can act as a potential correlate of response. Exactly how these fatty acids affect T cell differentiation, functions and survival and are governed by lipid metabolism, however, requires further study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. Previous studies have shown a role for fatty acid metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup> in dictating effector and memory T cell responses. Our data suggest that similar mechanisms could underlie responses to SBRT and warrant further investigation on the role of cell-intrinsic immunometabolic reprogramming in this context.</p>
              <p id="Par33">The positive response rate to the combination of radiation and immunotherapy observed in this trial suggests that this intervention represents a promising therapeutic strategy for treating locally advanced HPV-unrelated HNSCC, in marked contrast to the high morbidity and dismal outcomes of traditional treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Nowadays, with clinical trials becoming increasingly complex, and with repeated biopsies simply not feasible, it is imperative to develop minimally invasive, high-throughput assays that can be used to predict response to treatment in the setting of radiation–immunotherapy. This is particularly relevant since in the context of radiation, standard imaging with CT, positron emission tomography (PET) or MRI fails to predict treatment response. In summary, we identified several potential circulatory correlates of response to the administered treatment, which can be assessed easily, and, if validated in larger trials, can serve to guide therapeutic management.</p>

Twenty-one patients were enrolled. Seven patients were female, and 14 patients were male. The average age of a participant was 61 yr with a range from 43 yr to 84 yr. Patients were enrolled from November 2018 to May 2021. Diagnosis had to be confirmed either histologically or cytologically as stage III or IV HNSCC of oral cavity, hypopharynx, oropharynx or larynx. Stage II (T2 N0 M0) oral cavity cancer was also allowed. Patients also needed to have measurable disease defined as lesions that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as &gt;10 mm with CT scan or &gt;10 mm with calipers by clinical exam. Other required factors for inclusion in the trial included: Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤1, body weight &gt;30 kg, and adequate normal organ and marrow function.

                <p id="Par36">This was a multi-center, prospective, single-arm phase I/Ib safety trial. Patients eligible for treatment had to be diagnosed with nonmetastatic, biopsy-proven p16-negative histology squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity, oropharynx, larynx or hypopharynx, and had to be eligible and amenable to surgical resection. This study enrolled using a 3 + 3 model. Patients received one dose of neoadjuvant durvalumab (1,500 mg) approximately 3–6 weeks before standard-of-care surgery given concurrently with the first dose of radiation (RT). The starting RT dose level was 6 Gy for two fractions (12 Gy total) every other day over approximately 1 week to sites of gross disease to minimize exposure to normal tissue. If toxicity developed and surgery was delayed by more than 6 weeks due to treatment toxicity (qualifying as a dose-limiting toxicity), the radiation dose was set to be dropped per protocol for the next set of patients. If this dose was tolerated, the dose was increased to 6 Gy for three fractions (18 Gy total) for the next three patients. Patients proceeded to surgical resection approximately 3–6 weeks after radiation as recommended by the Otolaryngology surgeon.</p>
                <p id="Par37">Post-operatively, pathology was reviewed at the multi-disciplinary head and neck conference, and the need for adjuvant therapy was discussed. For the first eight patients, all patients were given adjuvant therapy based on presenting features. However, after patient 8, adjuvant therapy was dictated based on high-risk pathologic features as per the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines and treating physician recommendations. Adjuvant radiation included intensity-modulated radiation therapy of 60 Gy in 2 Gy once-daily fraction size (total of 30 fractions). If indicated, adjuvant systemic therapy included cisplatin or other cytotoxic chemotherapy or targeted biologics (cetuximab) per physician discretion.</p>
                <p id="Par38">All patients received adjuvant durvalumab to be initiated approximately 6–12 weeks post-surgery. It was given as 1,500 mg intravenously once every 4 weeks for a maximum of six doses, or until progression, toxicity or withdrawal from study. This was delivered either as monotherapy or concurrently with adjuvant radiation ± systemic therapy for high-risk patients. Safety and toxicity evaluations were done throughout the study process. DLTs and adjustment of radiation doses were done during the neoadjuvant period.</p>

                <p id="Par39">Tumor response to neoadjuvant therapy (durvalumab + SBRT) was assessed by pathology review of the surgical specimen. Response was labeled as complete pathologic remission, microscopic residual tumor (only scattered foci of residual tumor cells) or macroscopic residual tumor by two independent board-certified pathologists blinded to treatment outcome. The method of assessment of disease status at baseline was MRI of neck with and without contrast and PET/CT of skull base to mid-thigh. The baseline assessment was performed no more than 28 d before SBRT. Efficacy for all patients was assessed by objective tumor assessment by repeat MRI of neck with and without contrast after the completion of radiation therapy pre-surgery. A PET/CT of skull base to mid-thigh and an MRI of the neck with and without contrast was done again after the last infusion of adjuvant durvalumab, and response assessment was categorized as having a response or progressive disease. Long-term follow-up was done with either PET/CT and/or MRI at the discretion of the treating physician. Following confirmed progression, patients continued to be followed up for survival every 12 weeks for 18 months. Patients who achieved and maintained disease control (that is, CR) through to the end of the treatment period continued with follow-up every 12 weeks for 18 months.</p>

Due to the limited amount of data, we repeated our entire experimental pipeline, which used nested cross-validation, 20 times with different random initial seedings to ensure that our results were repeatable. We implemented the following steps in our experimental pipeline. First, we split the data into training and validation sets, 75% and 25%, respectively, using stratified sampling of responders and nonresponders in equal proportion to their makeup in the overall dataset. k-nearest neighbor (KNN) imputation, which was selected for its effectiveness in similar datasets, was used to account for the missing data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref></sup>. Second, we upsampled the nonresponders to balance their count relative to the responders.

The parameter space we searched across included the number of estimators, maximum features per tree, depth of the trees and the requirements for splitting nodes of the individual decision trees. Finally, we evaluated the best model found via cross-validation on our validation set, which gave us our expected accuracy. We averaged performance over the 20 pipeline trials to arrive at our final accuracy and bounds. All experiments were performed with Python 3.6.3 and scikit-learn v.0.24.2 (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref></sup>). The code for running and evaluating the model and data is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/adumit/phase-1-hnscc-trial-prediction">https://github.com/adumit/phase-1-hnscc-trial-prediction</ext-link>.</p>

                <p id="Par52">Statistical analysis, unless otherwise stated, was done in GraphPad (v.9.1.0). For paired analysis, a two-tailed paired <italic>t</italic>-test assuming Gaussian distribution was used. For nonpaired analysis, a two-tailed Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test was used. For the multi-variate analysis, a multiple linear regression analysis was performed. For the metabolomics analysis, graphs and statistical analyses (unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test) were prepared with GraphPad Prism 8.0 (GraphPad Software). Heat maps, hierarchical clustering analyses, partial least squares discriminant analyses and two-way analysis of variance were calculated and plotted with MetaboAnalyst 5.0 (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref></sup>). All data points represent distinct samples, not repeated sampling. For continuous variables, data distribution was assumed to be normal but this was not formally tested.</p>
