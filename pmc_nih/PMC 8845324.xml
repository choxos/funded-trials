                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Asthma is an incurable, lifelong condition that places children at increased risk for exacerbation, hospitalisation and school absences. Most paediatric asthma interventions target parents alone and are overly prescriptive. Improving Asthma Care Together (IMPACT) is a novel shared management system comprised of a mobile health (mHealth) application, symptom watch and tailored health intervention that pairs parent and child together as an asthma management team. IMPACT helps families monitor asthma status, tailor asthma management strategies and facilitate intentional transition of asthma management to the child. The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy of the IMPACT intervention.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>This pilot randomised controlled trial will recruit 60 children with asthma (7–11 years) and one parent. All parent–child dyads will complete data collection sessions at baseline, postintervention and follow-up. Dyads randomised to the intervention group (IMPACT) will complete the 8-week intervention comprised of weekly activities including symptom monitoring, goal setting and progress monitoring. Dyads randomised to the control group will receive usual care but then be provided access to IMPACT at the end of the study. Feasibility will be measured by the proportion of eligible dyads enrolled and retained. Acceptability of IMPACT will be assessed using the Acceptability of Intervention Measure, the System Usability Scale and a semistructured interview. Preliminary efficacy is determined based on change in primary outcomes, parent-reported and child-reported asthma responsibility and asthma self-efficacy scores, from baseline.</p>

              <p>Asthma is most common chronic condition of childhood, affecting over six million US children.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Asthma is an incurable, lifelong condition that places children at increased risk for functional impairments, decreased quality of life, school absences, increased healthcare utilisation and irreversible structural airway remodelling.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2–5</xref> Asthma management requires symptom monitoring and response, trigger avoidance and timely and appropriate medication use.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 5 6</xref> Unfortunately, fewer than 50% of children with asthma are adherent to management regimens, leading to increased disease morbidity and mortality and potentially irreversible airway damage.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 7</xref> Improving paediatric asthma management represents a critical health need.</p>
              <p>The school-age years (7–11) represent a natural transition in asthma management, as children assume increasing responsibility for asthma-related care while they progressively spend more time away from parents at school and other extracurricular activities.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Developmentally, school-age children are rule-driven, understand right and wrong and are able to problem solve, which supports their capability to be active participants in their own asthma management.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9–15</xref> Yet, the majority of existing interventions focus on parents alone and use prescriptive approaches, telling the parent what to ‘do’ to the child to manage their asthma.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16–21</xref> As a result, our current strategies are failing to provide children with asthma and their families the tools they need to manage asthma together within the realities of their daily lives.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12 13</xref> The answer to this problem lies in shared asthma management by the parent–child dyad,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12 13</xref> with the school-age years the ideal developmental period for children to begin sharing responsibility with their parents and establishing lifelong health behaviours.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22–25</xref></p>
              <p>Using a Human-Centred Design framework, we collaborated with parent–child dyads to codesign Improving Asthma Care Together (IMPACT), a tailored shared management mobile health (mHealth) application that pairs the parent and child together as a shared management team.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26 27</xref> IMPACT aims to help families tailor asthma management strategies to fit the realities of their social environments while facilitating intentional transition of asthma management to the child. We hypothesise that by giving children a voice in their own care, we will not only improve asthma management in the present but also support the successful future transition of asthma management to those individuals who will ultimately assume sole responsibility in managing their lifelong condition. The purpose of this pilot-randomised controlled trial is to determine the feasibility, acceptability and initial efficacy of IMPACT.</p>

                <p>Sixty children and one parent (or caregiver) dyad will be recruited for this study. Child eligibility criteria include: (1) age 7–11 years, (2) diagnosed with persistent asthma (defined as a prescription for daily asthma medication) and (3) speak English. Parent eligibility criteria include: (1) child’s primary caregiver residing with the child 50% or more, (2) 18 years or older, (3) speak and read English, (4) have a smartphone with data plan and (5) have a parent-reported asthma responsibility mean score of ≤2.5 (indicating parent assumes majority of asthma management responsibility). The study catchment area is the USA. Participants who reside in the greater Seattle area in Washington State will have the option for in person visits, whereas those who reside outside of the greater Seattle area will be eligible for remote visits only. Children will be excluded if they have parent-reported conditions that may impair the child’s ability to learn shared management, including developmental delay (language &lt;5 year level), comorbid condition (cancer, diabetes, autism spectrum disorder) or current asthma exacerbation at the time of recruitment (defined as a prescription for oral corticosteroids), as this is a serious health threat and not an opportune time for learning shared management. There are no parental exclusion criteria.</p>

                    <p>The study team will perform direct child measures (height and weight). Next, the study team will assist the parent with pairing the spirometer with their mobile device. Note, spirometers use a reference database to evaluate lung functioning. As such, the spirometer requires patient details including age, gender, height and weight. The study team will instruct the parent to input the study identification number (ID) instead of the child's name and year of birth (not date) to avoid unnecessary personal health information disclosure. The study team will coach the child through spirometry and upload a screenshot of the results to the REDCap database. Note, every effort will be made to perform spirometry outside (weather permitting) and remain socially distanced while wearing masks, given that spirometry is considered an aerosolising procedure.</p>
                    <p>Next, individual data collection will commence. The parent participants will be provided an iPad with the electronic REDCap instruments preloaded. Parents will be instructed to complete the instruments to the best of their ability and to ask questions as needed. At the same time, the study team will work 1:1 with the child to assist with instrument completion using a separate iPad (reading items if requested). Should the parent finish their instruments prior to the child, the parent will be asked to refrain from providing input on the child’s answers. The estimated time burden for data collection is less than 1 hour. Following data collection, the study team will randomise parent–child dyads into intervention or control groups (described below). For those assigned to the intervention group, the study personnel will assist intervention dyads with downloading the IMPACT app, pairing the symptom watch and reader with app and reviewing written instructions for use. Dyads assigned to the control arm will receive an information sheet about upcoming data collection sessions and be advised keep the spirometer for future study sessions. Participant dyads will be emailed a US$50 digital gift card following the T0 visit.</p>

We expect an increase in asthma management responsibility scores and increased dyadic interdependence (ie, non-independence of scores between dyads)<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> between parent and child-reported outcomes over time in the intervention group, suggesting true shared management.</p>

                  <title>Secondary outcomes</title>
                  <p>Secondary outcome analyses will use mixed model ANCOVAs to assess whether the primary outcome variable means, adjusted for baseline scores, differ between intervention and control groups. We predict a Group × Time interaction such that shared management and health outcome variables (asthma responsibility score, self-efficacy, medication adherence, asthma control, quality of life (QOL)) will increase to a greater extent in the intervention group. The dyadic effect of the intervention will be tested with the Actor-Partner Interdependence Model<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30 51</xref> using structural equation modelling with full information maximum likelihood (FIML) estimation. First, the pattern of missing data will be tested to determine whether it is missing at random. The FIML method is superior to listwise deletion of missing data points in terms of producing less biased estimates. Next, intraclass correlations will be examined for parent and child asthma responsibility, self-efficacy, and general health scores. The APIM produces estimates of actor effects (Person A’s pretest → Person A’s post-test) and partner effects (Person A’s pretest→Person B’s post-test). Actor effects are estimated while controlling for partner effects, and vice versa. In these analyses, dyadic interdependence is indicated by statistically significant partner effects (eg, parent pretest → child post-test, controlling for child pretest). Intervention condition will be entered into the model as a dummy-coded variable. For each measure taken from both parent and child (ie, self-efficacy, asthma responsibility), two APIMs will be compared; one in which all of the paths from child variables are constrained equal to their respective paths from the parent variables, and one in which all paths are unconstrained and, thus, free to vary. Comparison of the fit of these two models indicates whether the effects emanating from the parent are significantly different from those emanating from the child. Parent–child dyads in IMPACT are expected to show stronger partner effects than those in the comparison group.</p>

Electronic study records will be stored within the REDCap database, a secure cloud-based data management system that is compliant with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. IMPACT intervention use data will be stored in an encrypted cloud database. Only the study team members will have access to the final study data set.

                <p>Given that this study was deemed ‘minimal risk’, we do not anticipate any serious adverse events. However, to ensure participant safety, we will send a monthly report of all unanticipated problems, adverse events and protocol deviations to a Scientific Monitoring Committee (SMC), comprised of a paediatric pulmonologist and senior nurse scientist. Potential adverse events will be graded by the PI and SMC following standard procedures for the University of Washington Adverse Event Reporting Policy. Any potential serious adverse events, such as those resulting in medical problems or breach of confidentiality, will be reviewed by PI and SMC, graded and reported to the Institutional Review Board.</p>
