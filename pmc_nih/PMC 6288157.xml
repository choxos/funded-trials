                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">146 patients were treated, including 63 in dose escalation and 83 in expansion. The MTD was pimasertib 90 mg and voxtalisib 70 mg daily. Based on the safety profile, the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) was pimasertib 60 mg and voxtalisib 70 mg. The most frequent treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were diarrhoea (75%), fatigue (57%), and nausea (50%). Responses included a complete response in one patient (1%), partial response in five (5%), and stable disease in 51 (46%). At the RP2D, 74 patients required dose interruption (73%), 20 required dose reduction (20%), and 26 discontinued treatment due to TEAEs (26%).</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="Par5">The MAPK (RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK) and PI3K/mTOR signalling pathways are among the most frequently altered in cancer, where they are important contributors to tumour growth and survival.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> Activating <italic>RAS</italic> and <italic>BRAF</italic> mutations are seen in approximately 15 and 8% of all cancers, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>
<italic>KRAS</italic> mutations are common in several solid tumours including pancreatic cancer, colorectal cancer (CRC), and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> while <italic>BRAF</italic> mutations are prevalent in melanoma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> Aberrant activation of the PI3K pathway typically occurs through activating mutations in <italic>PIK3CA</italic> or by loss-of-function or epigenetic silencing of <italic>PTEN</italic>.</p>
              <p id="Par6">The PI3K and MAPK pathways are closely linked by feedback loops leading to compensatory activation of one in response to inhibition of the other.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> In patients, concurrent genomic alterations and/or upregulation in components of both pathways are frequently observed. In vitro and in vivo preclinical models have demonstrated enhanced anti-tumour effects when both pathways are targeted simultaneously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> Therefore, combination therapy with drugs targeting the MAPK and PI3K signalling pathways is predicted to improve efficacy compared with inhibition of either cascade alone and may be an effective therapeutic strategy in the treatment of a variety of cancers.</p>
              <p id="Par7">Pimasertib (MSC1936369B, formerly known as AS703026) is a potent and selective, ATP non-competitive small molecule inhibitor of MEK1 and MEK2 that has shown efficacy in preclinical models.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> In a phase I, first-in-human study of this compound, the adverse event profile of pimasertib was consistent with other agents in this class and include skin rash, diarrhoea, asthenia, anorexia, nausea/ vomiting, peripheral oedema, anaemia and visual disorders, including serous retinal detachment and retinal vein occlusion. Two dosing schedules were explored, including Schedule 1 consisting of dosing on days 1–5, 8–12, and 15–19, and Schedule 2 consisting of dosing on days 1-15 of a 21-day cycle. The maximum tolerated doses (MTDs) were 120 mg per day and 195 mg per day, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup></p>
              <p id="Par8">Voxtalisib (SAR245409, formerly known as XL765) is a highly selective and potent, ATP-competitive, reversible dual pan-Class I PI3K and mTORC1/mTORC2 inhibitor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> The phase I, first-in-human study of this compound demonstrated a manageable safety profile, reduced PI3K and mTORC1/mTORC2 pathway signalling, and was associated with clinically relevant stable disease. The most frequent treatment-related adverse events were nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting, and decreased appetite. Both once and twice daily schedules were explored. The MTDs were 90 mg once daily and 50 mg twice daily.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup></p>
              <p id="Par9">The aim of this phase Ib study was to determine MTD and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for pimasertib combined with voxtalisib when administered orally to patients with selected advanced solid tumours. Additional objectives included evaluating safety and preliminary antitumour activity (clinicaltrials.gov registry identifier NCT01390818).</p>

                <title>Patient population</title>
                <p id="Par11">Eligible patients were ≥ 18 years old with a histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of an advanced solid tumour (pancreatic, thyroid, colorectal, non-small cell lung, endometrial, renal, breast, ovarian carcinoma, or melanoma) and/or any advanced solid tumour with an alteration in one or more of the following genes: <italic>PTEN</italic>, <italic>BRAF</italic>, <italic>KRAS</italic>, <italic>NRAS</italic>, <italic>PI3KCA</italic>, <italic>EGFR</italic>, <italic>ERBB2</italic>, <italic>MET</italic>, <italic>RET</italic>, <italic>c-KIT</italic>, <italic>GNAQ</italic>, <italic>GNA11</italic>. Subjects were also required to have archived tumour tissue available for central analysis, measurable disease by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) v1.1, Eastern Cooperative Group Oncology (ECOG) performance score of 0 to 1, and adequate organ and bone marrow function.

                <p id="Par12">This was a phase Ib, open-label, nonrandomised, dose-escalation and dose-expansion study. The primary endpoint was the incidence of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) and determination of the MTD and RP2D. Secondary endpoints included tumour response as assessed by RECIST v1.1, characterisation of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), pharmacokinetics (PK), treatment-mediated changes in the MAPK and PI3K pathways (pERK and pS6 levels in blood and tumour biopsies), and correlation of MAPK and PI3K pathway alterations with response to therapy.</p>
                <p id="Par13">A modified “3 + 3” dose escalation design was followed with once daily dosing (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The MTD was defined as the highest dose with 0 out of 3 patients or ≤1 out of 6 patients with a DLT. Once an MTD was reached, additional subjects were enroled in an MTD dose expansion to confirm the tolerability of this dose level. Additional subjects could also be enroled at lower dose levels (LDLs) at the discretion of the safety monitoring committee consisting of members from the sponsor and investigator. After completion of the once daily dosing dose escalation, twice daily dosing was explored whereby the monotherapy RP2D of each drug was combined with a lower dose of the combination partner in 2 parallel cohorts. The final RP2D of the combination was defined by the safety monitoring committee based on the totality of safety and tolerability data generated during the dose escalation phase of the study. After selection of the RP2D of the combination, four tumour-specific expansion cohorts were opened for patients with advanced NSCLC, TNBC, CRC, and melanoma as explained above.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Dose-escalation schedule</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41416_2018_322_Fig1_HTML" id="d32e537"/></fig></p>

The sample size of the expansion cohorts was based on the hypothesis that a sample size of 18 evaluable patients was sufficient to reject the null hypothesis (RR ≤ 10%) when the true response rate is ≥30%, with a power of 80%. Safety and efficacy data were reported using descriptive statistics and were based on the database lock date of July 1st, 2015. For categorical variables, frequencies and percentages were employed. Continuous variables were described using the mean, standard deviation, median, range, and number of missing values.

Geometric least squares means with corresponding 95% CIs per treatment, and ratios of geometric least squares means with corresponding 90% CIs for test/reference were estimated by exponentiation of estimates from the mixed model.</p>

The CR occurred in a patient with melanoma treated in the disease specific expansion cohort. The five subjects with PRs included three in the dose escalation cohorts dosed once daily, and two subjects in the disease specific expansion cohorts (one with NSCLC and one with melanoma). Therefore, the response rate was 14% in the melanoma cohort (2/14 evaluable patients), 5% in the NSCLC cohort (1/20), and 0% in the TNBC and CRC cohorts (0/16 and 0/11, respectively). Notably, two responders in the dose escalation cohort had mutations in the MAPK or PI3K pathways, including one with KRAS-mutant CRC with neuroendocrine features and another with dual KRAS/PIK3CA-mutant low grade serous ovarian cancer. Best tumour responses in patients treated at the RP2D are shown (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The median time on treatment was 2 cycles (6 weeks).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par29">This phase 1b study demonstrates that the MTD of the oral MEK1/2 inhibitor, pimasertib, and oral PI3K and mTORC1/2 inhibitor, voxtalisib, is pimasertib 90 mg and voxtalisib 70 mg once daily. Based on the overall safety profile, the RP2D was chosen as one dose level below the MTD, or pimasertib 60 mg and voxtalisib 70 mg. Despite choosing this lower dose for evaluation in the expansion cohorts, the majority of patients treated at this dose required treatment interruptions, dose reductions, or drug discontinuation due to chronic toxicity, suggesting that the overall tolerability of the combination may be challenging. The twice daily dosing schedule was abandoned due to poor tolerability.</p>
              <p id="Par30">The safety profile of this combination was consistent with that of other regimens that have attempted to target both the MAPK and PI3K/mTOR pathways simultaneously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> For example, in a phase Ib study of the oral pan-PI3K inhibitor, buparlisib, in combination with the oral MEK1/2 inhibitor, trametinib, the most common adverse events included elevated creatinine kinase, diarrhoea, nausea, stomatitis, and rash.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> Long-term tolerability was challenging and both dose interruptions and reductions were common. The significant long-term toxicity observed with strategies that combine MAPK and PI3K/mTOR pathway inhibition is likely due to several factors. These classes of agents have some overlapping toxicity that includes fatigue, anorexia, nausea/vomiting, diarrhoea, and rash. It is noteworthy that many of the preclinical studies evaluating the efficacy of this combination have been done in model systems such as mice that historically have tolerated inhibitors of the MAPK pathway better than humans. In addition, therapeutic agents targeting these pathways have historically not had selectively for mutant over wild-type kinases. Given that both pathways play important biological roles in many host tissues, it is perhaps expected that the combination presents long-term tolerability concerns. This trial exemplifies how defining DLTs only in cycle 1 may be insufficient to accurately characterise the tolerability of therapy, especially when studying continually-dosed targeted drugs. Cumulative toxicity and intolerability of chronic low-grade symptoms such as fatigue and nausea are not effectively captured using the standard trial design that only considers cycle 1 when defining the MTD. The frequency of dose reductions, dose holds, and general toxicity in later cycles must be considered when ultimately deciding the RP2D.</p>
              <p id="Par31">Despite preclinical data suggesting that the combination of pimasertib and voxtalisib would be synergistic, the clinical efficacy was limited and does not support this as a promising treatment option. Although it is possible that the limited dataset and patient heterogeneity contributed to the lack of observed efficacy, it is likely that the absence of cancer cell selectivity and narrow, or in some cases absent, therapeutic index associated with inhibiting these critical cellular pathways underlies the lack of clinical activity when this combination is administered at tolerable doses. Intermittent dosing may have achieved a more favourable therapeutic index, however, this theory has not borne out in similar trials testing PI3K/mTOR and MEK inhibitor combinations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> The phase Ib study of buparlisib and trametinib demonstrated minimal activity in NSCLC and pancreatic cancer. Intriguingly, the response rate was 29% in patients with ovarian cancer with a signal of increased efficacy in patients with KRAS-mutant tumours.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> Similarly, a phase 1b study of binimetinib (MEK inhibitor) with apelisib (alpha-specific PI3K inhibitor), and another phase I study of gedatolisib (PI3K/mTOR inhibitor) in combination with PD-0325901 (MEK inhibitor) also showed tumour responses in KRAS-mutant ovarian cancers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> The combination of pimasertib and voxtalisib was explored in a randomised phase II trial of women with low grade ovarian cancer (NCT01936363) but the study was terminated approximately halfway through accrual and the combination is not undergoing active development for this indication.</p>
              <p id="Par32">This study establishes that poor long-term tolerability prevents the combination of pimasertib and voxtalisib from being a meaningful therapeutic option at the tested dosing schedule. Future studies of agents targeting the MAPK and PI3K/mTOR pathway should include alternative dosing schedules and further explore the relationship between tumour type, genomic alterations, and efficacy.</p>
