                <p>Although the vast majority of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections are uncomplicated, our understanding of predictors of symptom resolution and viral shedding cessation remains limited. We characterized symptom trajectories and oropharyngeal viral shedding among 120 outpatients with uncomplicated Coronavirus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19) enrolled in a clinical trial of Peginterferon Lambda, which demonstrated no clinical or virologic benefit compared with placebo. In the combined trial cohort, objective fever was uncommon, inflammatory symptoms (myalgias, fatigue) peaked at 4 to 5 days postsymptom onset, and cough peaked at 9 days. The median time to symptom resolution from earliest symptom onset was 17 days (95% confidence interval 14–18). SARS-CoV-2 IgG seropositivity at enrollment was associated with hastened resolution of viral shedding (hazard ratio 1.80, 95% confidence interval 1.05–3.1, <italic>P</italic> = 0.03), but not with symptom resolution. Inflammatory symptoms were associated with a significantly greater odds of oropharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection; respiratory symptoms were not. These findings have important implications for COVID-19 screening approaches and trial design.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="para0003">As of October 2021, 241 million individuals have been confirmed infected with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and over 4.9 million have died (<xref rid="bib0003" ref-type="bibr">COVID-19, 2021</xref>). Despite high mortality in the elderly and among those with medical comorbidities, the vast majority of individuals have uncomplicated disease, with only mild to moderate symptoms, and do not require hospitalization. However, these individuals contribute to ongoing transmission, and some develop prolonged symptoms and sustained disability (<xref rid="bib0016" ref-type="bibr">Petersen et al., 2021</xref>). A better understanding of the natural history of uncomplicated Coronavirus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19) would help guide the development of therapeutics needed to shorten the duration of viral shedding, relieve symptoms, and prevent hospitalizations.</p>
              <p id="para0004">Most published reports of COVID-19 symptomatology are derived from hospitalized patients, in whom fever and shortness of breath are common (<xref rid="bib0007" ref-type="bibr">Ferguson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bib0022" ref-type="bibr">To et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bib0024" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). In contrast, outpatients with more mild disease report less fever, but hyposmia is more common (<xref rid="bib0011" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bib0019" ref-type="bibr">Skipper et al., 2020</xref>). Data on symptom trajectories and clusters are limited, as studies in outpatients have largely been limited to cross-sectional surveys. Furthermore, the relationship of these syndromes to viral shedding and SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses has not been described in detail.</p>
              <p id="para0005">In this study, we leveraged a cohort of participants with uncomplicated COVID-19 enrolled in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of Peginterferon Lambda to perform a detailed examination of the symptomatology and natural history of uncomplicated SARS-CoV-2 infection. We aimed to (1) characterize symptom trajectories and clusters; (2) assess predictors of symptom resolution and cessation of oropharyngeal viral shedding; and (3) evaluate associations between symptoms and viral shedding.</p>

                <p id="para0006">SARS-CoV-2-infected outpatients were enrolled in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial of Peginterferon Lambda-1a (Lambda, NCT04331899). Inclusion/exclusion criteria and the study protocol for the trial have been published (<xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">Jagannathan et al., 2021</xref>). Briefly, adults aged 18 to 75 years with any FDA emergency use authorized reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) positive for SARS-CoV-2 within 72 hours prior to enrollment were eligible for study participation. Exclusion criteria included hospitalization, respiratory rate &gt;20 breaths per minute, room air oxygen saturation &lt;94%, pregnancy or breastfeeding, decompensated liver disease, recent use of investigational and/or immunomodulatory agents for treatment of COVID-19, and prespecified lab abnormalities (Supplementary Methods). All participants gave written informed consent and all study procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Board of Stanford University (IRB-55619).</p>

                <title>Study procedures</title>
                <p id="para0007">On the day of enrollment, participants completed a standardized history, including the duration of symptoms prior to enrollment, physical exam and bloodwork. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive a single subcutaneous injection of Lambda or saline placebo and followed for 28 days. Participants completed a daily symptom questionnaire and recorded daily in-home measurements of temperature and oxygen saturation using study-provided devices (REDCap Cloud). In-person visits were conducted on Days 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 14, 21, and 28 post-enrollment with assessment of symptoms and vitals, and collection of oropharyngeal swabs (FLOQ Swabs; Copan Diagnostics). Peripheral blood was collected for assessment of complete blood count, metabolic panel, and SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain (RBD, Supplementary Methods).</p>

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p id="para0008">Analyses were conducted in R version 4.0.2 (<xref rid="bib0018" ref-type="bibr">R Development Core Team, 2020</xref>) or Stata SE (version 14). Cohort demographics, baseline characteristics and distribution of symptom prevalence were summarized descriptively. Symptom duration prior to enrollment determined symptom start day. Symptoms reported pre-enrollment were assumed to have been continuously experienced from the first reported day until enrollment. Symptoms occurring more than 21 days prior to enrollment were deemed non-COVID related and excluded. Outcomes measured included symptom prevalence and duration, time to resolution of symptoms and cessation of viral shedding.</p>

Given the duration of symptoms and duration of viral shedding were similar overall between treatment arms, (<xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">Jagannathan et al., 2021</xref>) we included participants from both the Lambda and placebo arms in this analysis. Repeated measures of at-home temperature and oxygen saturation were modeled using linear regression models with robust standard errors and generalized estimating equations to account for repeated measures within participants.</p>

                  <p id="para0010">Spearman's correlation coefficient and exploratory factor analysis were used to assess pairwise correlations between symptom severity and whether symptoms clustered at various days from symptom onset, respectively. Exploratory factor analysis was carried out on symptoms reported at symptom onset and on days 4, 7, 10, 14, and 21 after symptom onset. Only symptoms with more than 5% overall study prevalence were chosen for examination (Supplementary Methods). Changes in factors derived and symptoms contributing to each factor were compared descriptively across time points of interest. The joint trajectory of symptoms was assessed to determine whether participant clusters persist over time (Supplementary Methods). Fisher's exact test and the Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test were used to test for differences in baseline characteristics and demographics by cluster assignment.</p>

Both models included age at randomization, sex, body mass index (BMI), race/ethnicity, and treatment arm. The time from enrollment model additionally included pre-enrollment symptom duration, oxygen saturation, heart rate, alanine transaminase, white blood count, lymphocyte count, oropharyngeal PCR result, and seropositivity at enrollment.

The inflammatory symptom cluster persisted and increased in reliability from day 4 to day 10 before decreasing (<xref rid="fig0002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>A,B). After day 0, 2 distinct respiratory clusters were identified, including upper (sore throat, runny nose, nausea) and lower (shortness of breath, cough, chest pain/pressure) respiratory tract symptoms.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="para0027">In this study, we leveraged a comprehensive and detailed dataset among outpatients with uncomplicated COVID-19 enrolled in a Phase 2 clinical trial to carefully define symptom prevalence, longitudinal emergence and resolution of individual symptoms and symptom clusters, and associations between symptoms, viral shedding, and SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity. Although objective fever was uncommon, inflammatory symptoms (myalgias, chills, fatigue) were common and peaked early; these symptoms were also associated with ongoing viral shedding. In contrast, respiratory symptoms were not associated with viral shedding. Though SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity at enrollment was associated with more rapid viral shedding cessation, it was not associated with more rapid time to symptom resolution. Participants were enrolled early in the course of disease, with excellent participant retention and little missing data. Only 4 participants were hospitalized, and no deaths observed.</p>
              <p id="para0028">Importantly, though the most prevalent symptoms observed were consistent with previous reports, (<xref rid="bib0007" ref-type="bibr">Ferguson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bib0009" ref-type="bibr">Guan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bib0011" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">Struyf et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bib0024" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2020</xref>) we observed different prevalence peaks per symptom. The most common initial symptoms were headache, myalgias and chills; these symptoms peaked at 4 days postsymptom onset. Shortness of breath and cough peaked at 6 and 9 days, respectively. These data differ from a prediction model which suggested that cough would precede headache and myalgias (<xref rid="bib0012" ref-type="bibr">Larsen et al., 2020</xref>). Anosmia was common and is likely specific for COVID-19 (<xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">Dixon et al., 2020</xref>), but was most prominent one week post symptom onset. Thus, patients may be shedding infectious virus for up to one week prior to the onset of “typical” COVID-19 symptoms such as cough, shortness of breath, and anosmia.</p>
              <p id="para0029">Only 3 participants had fever &gt;100.4° F at enrollment, and 6 had fever at any timepoint during follow-up, consistent with other studies which show relative lack of fever in mild/moderate cases compared with severe/critical cases (<xref rid="bib0007" ref-type="bibr">Ferguson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bib0011" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bib0019" ref-type="bibr">Skipper et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bib0022" ref-type="bibr">To et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bib0024" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). However, overall temperature did decrease in the first week after enrollment, after which temperatures remained stable at a mean temperature of 97.6°F. These observations are consistent with recent reports suggesting that “normal” body temperatures are well below the established “normal” of 98.6°F, (<xref rid="bib0014" ref-type="bibr">Obermeyer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bib0017" ref-type="bibr">Protsiv et al., 2020</xref>) and suggest that temperatures above 97.6°F may represent clinically significant physiologic changes within the context of uncomplicated COVID-19.</p>
              <p id="para0030">LatinX participants were significantly more likely to have symptoms resolve at any point during the study compared to non-LatinX, white participants. This was after controlling for key demographic/clinical characteristics, including age, gender, and BMI. Although it is possible that biologic differences may underlie these differences in symptom resolution, prior reports have suggested that race or ethnic-based differences are not significant predictors of clinically relevant hospitalization outcomes such as mortality, ICU admission, or mechanical ventilation (<xref rid="bib0013" ref-type="bibr">McCarty et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">Ogedegbe et al., 2020</xref>). These differences may be driven by residual confounding, including the possibility of differential symptom recall bias and/or delays in testing/diagnosis prior to enrollment.</p>
              <p id="para0031">The median time to viral shedding cessation from enrollment was 10 days, consistent with other reports (<xref rid="bib0006" ref-type="bibr">Fang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bib0021" ref-type="bibr">Tirupathi et al., 2020</xref>). Though other studies have identified disease severity as a risk factor for longer duration of shedding (<xref rid="bib0006" ref-type="bibr">Fang et al., 2020</xref>), in this cohort, only SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity and oropharyngeal PCR cycle thresholds at enrollment were associated with more rapid viral shedding cessation. The majority of participants reporting symptoms on each day had detectable oropharyngeal virus by PCR, suggesting that ongoing presence of symptoms is an indicator of ongoing viral shedding. This supports CDC guidelines (<xref rid="bib0002" ref-type="bibr">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020</xref>) to continue isolating until symptoms are improved, though PCR positivity does not infer infectivity (<xref rid="bib0023" ref-type="bibr">Vetter et al., 2020</xref>). Myalgia and joint pain were the only symptoms significantly associated with oropharyngeal PCR positivity. These are also some of the earliest symptoms to appear, when viral loads are higher early in disease course and patients are most likely to be infectious. Therefore, screening for respiratory symptoms may miss the most infectious patients, who may attribute their symptoms to other causes.</p>
              <p id="para0032">There were limitations to this study. This cohort was part of a randomized, placebo-controlled trial, where half the cohort received Lambda and the other half received placebo. The duration of symptoms and viral shedding was similar between the 2 arms in the primary analysis (<xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">Jagannathan et al., 2021</xref>), so we included the entire cohort in order to improve statistical power to perform our analyses. In this analysis of individual symptoms, there were some symptoms that lasted longer in the Lambda vs. placebo arm, although adjustment for treatment arm did not significantly alter our time to event models. Only 4 (3%) participants in this cohort needed hospitalization and 10 (8.3%) went to the ED for evaluation, compared with an incidence of hospitalization of 2.9% to 11% in other outpatient trials (<xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr">Davoodi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bib0019" ref-type="bibr">Skipper et al., 2020</xref>). This is likely related to study selection criteria, and that recruitment occurred during non-surge conditions when even moderately ill patients were being hospitalized. Median participant age was 36 years, and the cohort was predominantly LatinX, reflecting our local population of COVID-19 cases (<xref rid="bib0001" ref-type="bibr">Center CoSCEO</xref>); however, our findings may not be generalizable to other settings, including those with other circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants and/or post-vaccination infections. Though there was high retention in the study, 34 participants missed 2 consecutive daily symptom surveys and were excluded from the symptom cluster analysis. Though we collected symptom data daily for 28 days after enrollment, time of symptom onset was reported retrospectively by participants at enrollment and thus subject to recall bias. Finally, this is a secondary analysis of data from a clinical trial that was not designed for these analyses, so this study should be considered hypothesis-generating.</p>
              <p id="para0033">In this cohort of participants with uncomplicated COVID-19, distinct symptom clusters and trajectories were identified and inflammatory symptoms were associated with ongoing viral replication. In contrast, cough, loss of taste/smell, and elevated temperature, which are often used for screening programs, are not always earliest to present and not associated with viral replication, and may therefore not be ideal for screening approaches. Data from this and other longitudinal studies will be critical in shaping our understanding of disease pathogenesis in patients, and for planning large, Phase 3 outpatient studies based on clinical and virologic endpoints.</p>
