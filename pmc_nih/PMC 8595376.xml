                <p id="Par1"><italic>Campylobacter</italic> commonly causes foodborne infections and antibiotic resistance is an imminent concern. It is not clear, however, if the human gut ‘resistome’ is affected by <italic>Campylobacter</italic> during infection. Application of shotgun metagenomics on stools from 26 cases with <italic>Campylobacter</italic> infections and 44 healthy family members (controls) identified 406 unique antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) representing 153 genes/operons, 40 mechanisms, and 18 classes. Cases had greater ARG richness (p &lt; 0.0001) and Shannon diversity (p &lt; 0.0001) than controls with distinct compositions (p = 0.000999; PERMANOVA). Cases were defined by multidrug resistance genes and were dominated by Proteobacteria (40.8%), specifically those representing <italic>Escherichia</italic> (20.9%). Tetracycline resistance genes were most abundant in controls, which were dominated by Bacteroidetes (45.3%) and Firmicutes (44.4%). Hierarchical clustering of cases identified three clusters with distinct resistomes. Case clusters 1 and 3 differed from controls containing more urban and hospitalized patients. Relative to family members of the same household, ARG composition among matched cases was mostly distinct, though some familial controls had similar profiles that could be explained by a shorter time since exposure to the case. Together, these data indicate that <italic>Campylobacter</italic> infection is associated with an altered resistome composition and increased ARG diversity, raising concerns about the role of infection in the spread of resistance determinants.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="Par2">Enteric pathogens are common causes of foodborne illness affecting 9.4 million individuals each year in the United States; 3.6 million of these enteric infections are caused by bacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. In 2018, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that the incidence of foodborne infection was highest for <italic>Campylobacter</italic> and <italic>Salmonella</italic>, with the incidence of both pathogens increasing relative to the frequencies reported in 2015–2017<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. The pathogenesis and virulence of these enteric pathogens have been well characterized and, more recently, several studies have examined how enteric pathogens influence the gut microbiota. For example, our prior 16S rRNA sequencing study showed that infection by one of four enteric pathogens resulted in decreased diversity of the gut microbiota, specifically resulting in an increase in the relative abundance of <italic>Proteobacteria</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Thus, further consideration and characterization of the ecological consequences of enteric infection in the human gut microbiome is needed.</p>
              <p id="Par3">In addition to their role in causing foodborne illness, <italic>Campylobacter</italic> spp., are progressively found to be drug-resistant, which has led to their classification as a serious public health threat by the CDC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. The increasing prevalence of <italic>Campylobacter</italic> spp. linked to human infections plus their enhanced ability to evade modern antibiotics substantiate the need to further understand their total impact on health. Generally, antibiotic resistance increasingly results in adverse health and economic outcomes due to the growing prevalence and emergence of drug-resistant infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Growing awareness of these burdens has led to a rise in the number of studies investigating the resistome, or the compilation of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs), within microbial communities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Several studies have investigated resistomes across different environments including the guts of humans, cattle, poultry, and swine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. These environments do not exist in isolation; one study found similar genetic regions containing ARGs among environmental soil isolates and five relevant human pathogens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, while another identified ARGs that could cross habitat boundaries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Many of these genes are co-localized with mobile genetic elements and other ARGs, suggesting significant potential for transmission of multiple resistance genes via horizontal gene transfer. This spread of antimicrobial resistance across environments illuminates our need to further clarify the ecological mechanisms facilitating such exchange.</p>
              <p id="Par4">As in other ecosystems, the human gut microbial community exhibits microbe-microbe and microbe-host interactions, temporal and spatial dynamics, and has varied community responses to disturbance or species invasion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Multiple studies have explored the ability of the human gut microbiota to recover after a disturbance like antibiotic treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. One longitudinal study, for instance, investigated the effects of repeated antibiotic exposure in infants and found that antibiotic use contributed to a loss of species- and strain-level diversity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Just as disturbance has the capacity to uproot stable communities, so, too, does microbial invasion. Microbial invasion ecology involves the introduction of a foreign microbe to a stable environment and follows a trajectory from establishment to growth and spread, leading to downstream ecological consequences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Previous studies have examined the importance of microbial invasion in various environmental contexts such as soil, plant, and agricultural settings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. However, investigation of microbial invasion as it pertains to the human gut microbiome and resistome via infection has yet to be fully explored. Elucidating the impacts of ecological invasion on the composition and mobility of ARGs in the human gut is crucial to advancing our fight against the spread of drug resistance.</p>
              <p id="Par5">Given the health and economic burden of foodborne pathogens and the ubiquity of antimicrobial resistance across environments, further understanding the impacts of infection on ARGs and their dissemination is needed. This study therefore aims to understand enteric infection by a bacterial pathogen, <italic>Campylobacter</italic>, on the human gut resistome using shotgun metagenome analyses.</p>

                <p id="Par6">Stools from 26 patients with acute campylobacteriosis (cases) were compared to stools from 44 related healthy family members (controls). Controls belonged to 16 different families with two to eight participating members. Although 10 cases and seven controls were not matched to a family, they were included in the comparative case versus control analyses. Among cases, 17 (65.4%) were female with 13 (50%) between 19 and 64 years of age, 8 (30.7%) between 0 and 9 years old, and 5 (19.2%) greater than 65 years (Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). Controls had a slightly different demographic distribution in which 18 (40.9%) were female; 17 (38.7%) were between 0 and 9 years old, 4 (9.1%) were 10–18 years of age, 21 (47.7%) were 19–64 years, and 2 (4.5%) were greater than 65 years old. No significant differences were observed in the age or sex distribution between groups. Although more controls resided in urban areas, the difference was not significant and is likely due to the recruitment of more than one control per case in most households. The majority of cases self-identified as Caucasian (n = 22; 88.0%) and reported abdominal pain (n = 21; 80.1%) and diarrhea (n = 24; 92.3%). Nausea (n = 9; 34.6%), vomiting (n = 6; 23.1%), and bloody stool (n = 10; 38.5%) were also reported, while 20 cases (76.0%) received outpatient care and six (23%) required hospitalization. Among the latter, four (66.7%) were hospitalized for two days, one for three days, and another for six. Three of the 26 cases (11.5%) and three of the 44 controls (6.8%) received antibiotics two weeks prior to sample collection.</p>

Interestingly, however, many of the MDR ARGs detected among cases were correlated with other taxa such as <italic>Shigella;</italic> for example, <italic>Shigella</italic> was highly correlated with the MDR gene <italic>mdtC</italic>. Multidrug efflux is a common resistance mechanism and therefore carriage of <italic>mdtC</italic> by <italic>Shigella</italic> spp<italic>.</italic> is consistent with previous findings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Nonetheless, detection of <italic>Shigella</italic> raises questions regarding co-infections, which require confirmation via culture or other diagnostic tests. It is also important to note that we did not directly explore genetic architecture, a technique which would more clearly elucidate which microbes harbor specific ARGs of interest. Despite providing preliminary information regarding ARG-harboring taxa, this method assumes that ARGs and taxa co-occurring in similar abundances indicate a correlation, potentially leading to inaccurate associations. Indeed, an association between ARGs and their microbial hosts was observed in a prior study using methods that measured both ARGs and taxa abundance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. While fluctuations in the abundance of specific taxa during infection likely change the abundance of ARGs harbored by these taxa, future work employing a more rigorous test assessing key taxa-associated ARGs is needed. It will also be important to examine these communities in a phylogenetic context using tools like UniFrac<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> when they become more readily available for use with metagenomics data.</p>
              <p id="Par25">It is notable that cases with <italic>Campylobacter</italic> infections had three distinct clusters with differentially abundant ARG profiles. Resistomes belonging to Cluster 2 were more similar to control resistomes, a finding that could point to less perturbed gut communities with a greater initial resilience or to partially recovered communities at the time of sampling. Cluster 1 and Cluster 3 resistomes, however, were either more perturbed by infection or were distinct at the start of the infection. Indeed, it is possible that the trajectory of an individual’s resistome during infection is contingent upon the microbiome composition before infection. Support for this possibility comes from a prior study of <italic>Campylobacter</italic> patients, who had significantly lower taxonomic diversity in their gut communities before infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, an outcome that could be related to varying levels of microbiome resilience<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Indeed, studies in mice with varying degrees of microbial imbalance prior to infection demonstrated that disturbed gut communities were more susceptible to infection by <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Typhimurium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Another study in chickens observed <italic>Campylobacter</italic> invasion of the cecal microbiome only after substantial changes to the metabolic profile were detected<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Direct interactions between the normal gut microbiota and invading pathogens via resource competition, metabolite production, and direct antagonism, coupled with the complexity of pathogen-induced inflammation, have also been shown to influence enteric infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Variable perturbations among individuals is consistent with prior studies showing distinct shifts in the gut microbiota and resistome following antibiotic treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par26">Because we could not evaluate patient communities prior to infection onset, an approach that would require a costly and lengthy longitudinal study of healthy individuals, we cannot rule out the possibility that the sampled communities were already distinct. We have utilized a single sample taken during infection (cases) and during a self-described “healthy” period (controls) and therefore, an assessment of microbiome changes over time could not be performed. Longitudinal studies are needed to define the trajectory of microbiome fluctuations in the gut and determine how <italic>Campylobacter</italic> impacts these alterations. Another limitation is the assumption that stool is representative of the human gut microbiome. Previous work has shown that microbial signatures in the stool differ from other gut-related samples from the same individual<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Since the abundance of different bacterial populations differs in stool, our findings likely represent an underestimate of the actual abundance of taxa and ARGs within the gut. Future studies should therefore examine additional sample types, such as mucosal tissues, to better define how the gut microbiome is impacted by <italic>Campylobacter</italic>.</p>
              <p id="Par27">Specific factors responsible for observed differences between resistome profiles of cases remain elusive. It is possible, however, that geographic location as well as variable exposures and host responses play a role. For example, a prior study reported differences in ARG composition and abundance across land-use sites (rural, urban, and industrial), with ARGs fluctuating seasonally and in accordance with a relevant mobile genetic element (MGE), <italic>int</italic>1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Another study suggested that local anthropic activities, regardless of rural or urban identity, play a role in determining ARG profiles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. These findings are consistent with our observation that urban residents were significantly more likely to have a resistome profile belonging to Clusters 1 or 3 than Cluster 2, indicating that unique factors may be important for the expansion of specific ARGs during acute infection. Variation in host immune responses could offer another potential explanation for the observed differences among cases. <italic>Campylobacter</italic> infection elicits activation of NFΚ-B and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-8<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>, though cytokine responses can vary among strains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. This variation may contribute to dissimilar levels of inflammation that differentially influence the resident gut microbiota and, at times, benefit the invading pathogen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Of importance, too, is that specific pathogen features such as the lipooligosaccharide and polysaccharide capsule can impact virulence and host responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>, while repeated exposure to <italic>Campylobacter</italic> has been linked to local and systemic inflammation in children<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Host responses and <italic>Campylobacter</italic> strain characteristics were not evaluated in our study and, hence, we cannot rule out the possibility that some of these factors impacted the resistome profiles observed. Future studies should therefore utilize a larger sample size to further clarify factors that contribute to more perturbed or variable resistomes.</p>
              <p id="Par28">Resistome profiles detected in control samples also provide important information about background levels of resistance due to the presence of specific ARGs and ARG classes. The finding that tetracycline, MLS, and beta-lactam ARGs were more abundant in controls is consistent with two global studies, though gene prevalence was somewhat impacted by geography<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. In the United States, healthy individuals harbored MLS and beta-lactam resistance genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. While the reasons behind the increased abundance of these ARGs in healthy individuals is not clear, it is possible that historic circulation of these drugs in agriculture as well as veterinary and human health has had a long-term impact on the gut microbiome. Comparatively, historical use of tetracyclines in the medical field could also have long-term effects on gut microbes, which has been shown for group B <italic>Streptococcus</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>, an opportunistic pathogen that commonly resides in the gut. Because ARGs can be horizontally transferred to commensal gut bacteria and are stably maintained in this environment regardless of recent exposure or antibiotic use<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>, detection in healthy control stools could be attributed to prior exposure to antibiotics or acquisition of antibiotic resistant bacteria. This suggestion is consistent with ARGs identified in other cohorts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup> and strengthens our assumption that uninfected control samples can be used as a baseline for comparison when analyzing resistomes following pathogen infection.</p>
              <p id="Par29">It is important to note that directly comparing case and control samples presented some challenges. First, control samples were obtained weeks after the related patients had recovered, which prevented an assessment of other factors that may be linked to resistome differences. Indeed, some of the observed variation between cases and controls could be due to factors such as diet and exercise level, which were not measured in this study but have been shown to influence gut communities. Secondly, the sample size of our cases and controls differed. Multiple controls were associated with a single case in some circumstances, while other cases lacked corresponding controls. Regardless of these limitations, however, we were provided with a novel opportunity to conduct a family-based analysis to explore how familial relations may influence the resistome.</p>
              <p id="Par30">Among all 16 families examined, family relation did not appear to outweigh the effect of disease state on the resistome as most cases had different profiles than the controls within each family. Variation in ARG distribution and abundance, however, was observed across families with four families having specific ARGs that were more likely to be shared among their family members. The mismatched number of controls per case, however, makes interpreting these data difficult, as more controls per case may have overestimated the importance of some ARGs. Nonetheless, the analysis exploring environmental associations was notable. Specifically, time since exposure to the infected family member significantly influenced control resistomes; the longer the time period between a case being infected and a control submitting a stool sample, the less similar the resistomes are. Intuitively, this is expected since the longer the period following exposure to a case, the less likely a healthy family member will show signatures of potential infection/crossover.</p>
              <p id="Par31">The level of social closeness among family members may have also played a role in the similarity of their resistomes. A prior study, for instance, noted that the closer the social interaction between two family members (such as between married partners), the more similar their gut microbiome compositions were<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. Unfortunately, we did not consistently receive information about the relational status of each control, and hence, conclusions about these relationships could not be made. In addition, due to the differing number of household members available per family as well as our hesitancy to exclude samples on a nonrandom basis, the uneven distribution of controls:cases limits our interpretation of these data. Regardless, the provision of multiple control samples enabled us to observe similarities/differences between healthy members of a family in relation to each other and their infected relative, a tenet of this study that may prove useful in future analyses when considering how pathogens impact the gut microbiome.</p>
              <p id="Par32">Collectively, these data demonstrate that patients with <italic>Campylobacter</italic> infections have key differences in the human gut resistome relative to healthy, uninfected individuals. Of great interest, we observed an increase in specific taxa, the diversity of ARGs, and ARGs related to MDR in the patients. These findings substantiate the need for further characterizing the microbiome and resistome in response to perturbations such as those caused by enteric pathogens. Future work should also involve examining bacterial genes found to be differentially abundant between groups or that possessed SNPs within genes linked to antibiotic resistance previously. Indeed, it is likely that periods of flux not only influence the composition of the microbiome, but also its capacity for horizontal gene transfer, which can play a role in the persistence and transmissibility of ARGs and emergence of resistant pathogens.</p>

Most infections were caused by <italic>C. jejuni</italic>, although one patient had <italic>C. coli</italic> and three isolates could not be classified. Samples were collected via the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) as described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Briefly, stools were added to Cary-Blair transport media, cultured for <italic>Campylobacter</italic> spp., and transported to Michigan State University (MSU). Upon receipt at MSU, stool samples were homogenized, centrifuged and aliquoted for analysis and/or storage at − 80 °C. Metagenomic stool DNA was extracted using the QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit (QIAGEN; Valencia, CA) as described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. Epidemiological data about demographics, exposures, hospitalization, and symptoms were extracted from the Michigan Disease Surveillance System (MDSS) and household members were contacted for inclusion as study controls. Forty-four healthy household family members submitted a stool 5–21 weeks after the cases’ infection and completed a questionnaire about exposures and symptoms. Sixteen families were included. While 10 cases and 7 controls were not matched to a shared household, they were included in the overall comparative case versus control analyses. County of residence was classified as ‘rural’ or ‘urban’ based on the classification scheme developed by the National Center for Health Statistics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup> (NCHS). These classifications utilized census data from 2010 while considering the 2013 county designation assigned by the Office of Management and Budget as metropolitan, micropolitan, or noncore, as well as the specific population sizes and city location for metropolitan areas.</p>

Library construction was completed using a TruSeq Nano library kit (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) and shotgun sequencing was performed in a series of four sequencing runs on an Illumina HiSeq 2500.

Following trimming, quality filtering, and host genome removal, 176,686,501 of the 217,104,781 raw paired-end reads were used for downstream analyses. The number of paired-end reads used in the analysis did not significantly differ between cases and controls (p = 0.051).

Average Genome Size (AGS) and the number of genome equivalents (GE) within each sample were quantified using MicrobeCensus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>. Because AGS analyses have been considered a potential source of bias in gene-based metagenomic comparisons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>, comparing communities across different sample types may be confounded by varying AGS.
