              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Older adults who experience a disabling medical event, such as hip fracture, require physical and occupational therapy (PT/OT) in postacute care settings, such as skilled nursing facilities (SNFs). The use of postacute care has grown as frail and medically complex older adults survive medical events but with such functional incapacity that they are unable to return home and function independently.<sup><xref rid="zoi190327r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190327r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> In 2016, Medicare paid approximately $60 billion for postacute care, including 2.4 million SNF stays.<sup><xref rid="zoi190327r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> For such patients, postacute rehabilitation is a window of opportunity to regain functional ability. The alternative is persistent disability, which comes with considerable human costs, as well as high health care costs,<sup><xref rid="zoi190327r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> much of it resulting from rehospitalizations.<sup><xref rid="zoi190327r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190327r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190327r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190327r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup></p>
              <p>To date, efforts to improve rehabilitation outcomes of older adults have met with limited success in randomized clinical trials.<sup><xref rid="zoi190327r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190327r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Increasing intensity by providing more PT/OT time in SNF therapy has modestly improved functional gains<sup><xref rid="zoi190327r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190327r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190327r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190327r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> and increased the rate of discharge to community settings.<sup><xref rid="zoi190327r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Yet, a further increase in the use of therapy is likely not an option owing to cost-containment considerations.<sup><xref rid="zoi190327r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190327r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Instead, postacute rehabilitation could be optimized by improving therapists’ engagement with patients and the intensity of the therapy sessions, resulting in greater patient active time or patient activity per minute of PT/OT.<sup><xref rid="zoi190327r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190327r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190327r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190327r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190327r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190327r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190327r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190327r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Such engagement efforts must account for patient factors, such as depression, cognitive impairment, and multiple medical comorbidities, that can undermine motivation.<sup><xref rid="zoi190327r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190327r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190327r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190327r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Therefore, enhanced medical rehabilitation (EMR), a set of techniques and tools for therapists to engage patients in therapy, was developed.<sup><xref rid="zoi190327r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190327r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> Enhanced medical rehabilitation is a systematic and standardized approach based on behavior change principles<sup><xref rid="zoi190327r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190327r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190327r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190327r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> to enhance patient engagement and intensity to promote optimal functional outcomes. Enhanced medical rehabilitation was designed for real-world therapists and uses short, intuitive motivational messages and simple tools to help the therapist link PT/OT activities, effort, and progress to attainment of the patient’s selected and personally meaningful goals (<xref rid="zoi190327t1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).<sup><xref rid="zoi190327r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup></p>

                <title>EMR Therapist Selection</title>
                <p>Therapists were selected for EMR by measuring their pretraining patient active time and number of motivational messages and creating EMR and standard-of-care therapist groups who were equated in these variables (<xref rid="zoi190327t3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) as well as years and level of experience. Eleven therapists (occupational therapists, physical therapists, and certified therapy assistants) were trained in EMR, including 7 at the larger facility and 4 at the smaller one. Eighteen therapists were not trained and performed standard-of-care therapy. Therapist selection was conducted in collaboration with therapy managers to ensure adequate staffing coverage in each group (EMR and standard of care). Therapists had the opportunity to decline participation in the training and thus be in the standard-of-care group. To prevent bias or contamination between groups, the research team did not provide the standard-of-care therapists with information about EMR and discouraged the EMR-trained therapists from sharing it with them.</p>

Patients in the EMR arm received their weekday PT/OT only from EMR-trained therapists, while patients in the standard-of-care arm received PT/OT only from licensed therapists not trained in EMR. Otherwise, the 2 conditions did not differ (eg, EMR therapists were not instructed to spend more time with patients). To further equate the 2 conditions, the standard-of-care therapists also received 5 hours of training on various rehabilitation topics (eg, standardized assessments), and the therapists’ training was described neutrally to patients at the time of consent to avoid causing an expectancy bias.</p>

                <p>All outcomes were measured by blinded assessors. The primary outcome was change in Barthel Index score from admission to discharge. The Barthel Index is an instrument that measures a person’s ability to perform 10 basic activities of daily living or mobility items, with a scale range between 0 and 100 (higher scores indicate better function).<sup><xref rid="zoi190327r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> It has proven external validity in estimating care needs and independent living in patients who have experienced stroke or hip fracture.<sup><xref rid="zoi190327r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190327r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> The admission and discharge Barthel Index items were measured by 2 of us (M.B. and P.B.) from nursing and therapy notes that were redacted to hide participant identity or treatment assignment.</p>
                <p>Secondary outcomes were self-reported function, performance-based gait measures, discharge to community settings, and rehospitalization. Self-reported function after discharge was assessed using a patient self-report version of the Barthel Index at days 30, 60, and 90 after randomization administered by telephone; we also ascertained whether rehospitalization occurred after completion of SNF rehabilitation up to day 90 after randomization. Performance-based measures obtained at admission and discharge from the facility were gait speed using 1 trial of the 10-m walk test<sup><xref rid="zoi190327r44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190327r45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> and a 6-minute walk test (number of feet walked in 6 minutes).<sup><xref rid="zoi190327r46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> Gait assessments were videotaped and scored by a blinded assessor. Disposition from the SNF was dichotomized as return to the community setting (ie, to a private residence, group home, or assisted living) vs not returned (ie, to further skilled nursing rehabilitation, long-term care, or a hospital).</p>
                <p>We collected 3 baseline variables for prespecified moderator analyses: the Montgomery-Äsberg Depression Rating Scale for evaluating the severity of depressive symptoms (range, 0-60; higher scores indicate more depressive symptoms; no cutoff was used in this study)<sup><xref rid="zoi190327r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>; the Short Blessed Test, a brief assessment of orientation, registration, and attention<sup><xref rid="zoi190327r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> (higher scores indicate worse impairment, with scores of 5-9 consistent with mild cognitive impairment and ≥10 consistent with dementia); and the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale for Geriatrics score to quantify chronic illness burden from the medical records (higher scores indicate greater burden).<sup><xref rid="zoi190327r47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup></p>

Study data were managed using REDCap, version 7.<sup><xref rid="zoi190327r48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup> Analyses were performed using R, version 3.5.0 (R Foundation) or SPSS, version 24 (SPSS Inc). The primary outcome was change in Barthel Index score; the secondary outcomes were the 6-minute walk test and gait speed values at SNF discharge, as well as discharge disposition, rehospitalizations, and self-reported function at days 30, 60, and 90. The discharge point was the sole focus for the 6-minute walk test and gait speed test, as most participants were unable to complete these tasks at baseline and, therefore, there was no variability in these data at baseline. To test the primary hypothesis that EMR participants showed greater change in the Barthel Index score than standard-of-care participants, we used a marginal model with time (baseline and discharge), condition (EMR vs standard of care) and time × condition as fixed effects and with an unstructured covariance structure specified based on bayesian information criterion.</p>
                <p>The secondary analyses for 6-minute walk test distance and gait speed used a Mann-Whitney test to examine differences in means between groups. For the secondary outcome of rehospitalization, χ<sup>2</sup> analysis was used to determine whether rehospitalizations were dependent on condition. The outcome of self-reported function applied a marginal model using time (30, 60, and 90 days), condition, and time × condition as fixed effects, with the unstructured covariance structure specified based on the Bayesian information criterion. In addition, a marginal model tested for potential moderator effects: the model was constructed for each potential moderator and consisted of time and condition as factors, all 2-way interactions (eg, condition × time), and the 3-way interaction between time, condition, and the potential moderator, the latter of which is the term of interest. Exploratory analyses tested whether the effects of age, sex, race, and site altered the conclusions of the primary results as well as the conclusions of the moderator results. Both condition and site were constructed as 2-level fixed factors (EMR vs standard of care and facility 1 vs facility 2, respectively).</p>
                <p>The trial was stopped at the end of the grant funding period (July 13, 2018). The study was originally powered to detect a moderate effect size of 0.4 based on a sample size of 252 with 80% power for 2 coprimary outcomes: functional change in the entire sample and change in depressive symptoms among participants who were clinically depressed as defined by a current depression diagnosis (major or minor depression, according to the Structural Clinical Interview for <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Medical Disorders-IV</italic> Axis I Disorders<sup><xref rid="zoi190327r49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup>) at the time of SNF admission; however, of the 229 participants randomized, only 14 met a depression diagnosis, so this outcome analysis was not done and the level of significance, determined with 2-tailed testing, was set to 5% for functional change.</p>

              <p>Of 3265 patients screened for study eligibility, 2909 were ineligible (eg, age &lt;65 years, severe cognitive impairment, or not scheduled to receive ≥2 weeks of therapy), 127 refused to participate, and 229 were randomized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="zoi190327f1">Figure</xref>). <xref rid="zoi190327t2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> reports the sample’s baseline characteristics; mean (SD) age was 79.3 (8.0) years and 149 were women (65.1%). The participants were ethnically diverse (177 [77.3%] white, 51 [22.3%] black, 1 [0.4%] &gt;1 race); had a range of primary impairments along with multiple medical comorbidities, as measured by the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale for Geriatrics (mean [SD] score, 16.9 [5.2]); were highly disabled, as measured by the Barthel Index on admission (mean [SD] score, 33.5 [13.0]); and had a range of cognitive impairment symptoms, as shown on the Short Blessed Test (mean [SD] score, 4.1 [3.4]), and depressive symptoms, as shown on the Montgomery-Äsberg Depression Rating Scale (mean [SD] score, 8.6 [7.8]).</p>

                <title>Process Data in Therapists Before and After Training</title>
                <p>Before any training was conducted, the EMR therapists were similar to the standard-of-care therapists in terms of fidelity to the EMR intervention (quantified as number of engagement/motivational techniques consistent with EMR per therapy session), mean patient active time per therapy session, and patient engagement as measured by the Pittsburgh Rehabilitation Participation Scale (<xref rid="zoi190327t3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). After training (ie, during the randomized clinical trial), EMR therapists used a median (interquartile range) of 24.4 (21.0-37.3) motivational messages per therapy session compared with 2.3 (1.1-2.9) for nontrained therapists (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). EMR patients were active during a mean (SD) of 52.5% (6.6%) of the therapy session time vs 41.3% (6.8%) for nontrained therapists (P = .001).(<xref rid="zoi190327t3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Thus, therapists trained and coached in EMR were conducting this intervention with good fidelity that was clearly differentiated from standard of care, and these differences were attributable to the EMR training and coaching and not preexisting therapist differences. <xref rid="zoi190327t3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> also presents the mean (SD) durations of therapy sessions, showing that EMR sessions were not longer than standard-of-care sessions.</p>

Adding age, sex, race, and site as main effects did not alter the conclusions. Discharge disposition data (discharge to home vs institution) were available on 220 participants. Whether a participant was discharged to home or was institutionalized was independent of condition. Rehospitalization data during the 90-day follow-up were available on 221 participants. Whether a participant was rehospitalized was independent of condition. In terms of adverse events, there were none that were related to the study procedures or interventions.</p>

                <title>Moderator Results</title>
                <p>We considered 3 variables measured on admission as potential moderators: depressive symptoms (Montgomery-Äsberg Depression Rating Scale score), level of cognitive impairment (Short Blessed Test score) and total amount of medical morbidity (Cumulative Illness Rating Scale for Geriatrics score). Results are presented in <xref rid="zoi190327t4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. Contrary to our hypothesis, none of these variables was a significant moderator of the effectiveness of EMR, as evident by a lack of a significant time × condition × moderator interaction. These results were not affected when including age, sex, race, and site as main effects in the models. For example, among those with low Montgomery-Äsberg Depression Rating Scale scores, participants randomized to EMR improved by a mean (SD) of 36.2 (17.4) points in the Barthel Index vs 28.3 (18.1) in the standard-of-care group; among those with high Montgomery-Äsberg Depression Rating Scale scores, the improvements were 32.7 (19.0) with EMR vs 28.7 (15.2) with standard-of-care. Similarly, improvements were 34.4 (18.4) with EMR vs 27.5 (17.1) vs standard-of-care with low (nonimpaired) Short Blessed Test scores, compared with 35.7 (17.4) with EMR vs 30.0 (17.5) with standard-of-care with high (impaired) Short Blessed Test scores.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>This randomized clinical trial evaluated the effects of EMR, an approach to engage and motivate patients in PT/OT. Our main finding is that patients treated by EMR therapists had an estimated 25% greater functional recovery on average during postacute SNF rehabilitation, compared with those who received standard-of-care therapy. With respect to secondary outcomes, however, there were no group differences in gait measures, discharge disposition, or longer-term self-reported function. These findings are important because they indicate that older patients can achieve better short-term functional outcomes when treated by therapists who are trained and coached to systematically motivate patients and strive for higher-intensity therapy. Additional strategies are needed to maintain these functional gains after discharge from the rehabilitation facility and affect outcomes such as rehospitalization.</p>
              <p>To our knowledge, this is the first full-scale test demonstrating benefits of a standardized method to improve rehabilitation outcomes by increasing engagement and intensity of therapy sessions. Functional recovery of older adults is an important outcome<sup><xref rid="zoi190327r50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup> and one that is not always achieved despite postacute rehabilitation services.<sup><xref rid="zoi190327r51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup> This finding fits well with the 2008 Institute of Medicine report <italic>Retooling for an Aging America</italic>, which recommended models of treatment that make older persons more active partners in their own care.<sup><xref rid="zoi190327r52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup> This finding is also supported by smaller studies demonstrating the benefits of systematic interventions to increase engagement and intensity in rehabilitation settings.<sup><xref rid="zoi190327r53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190327r54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref></sup></p>
              <p>The EMR model does not ask therapists to do anything technically different in their practice, such as specific exercises or therapy protocols. Instead, it integrates communication techniques into therapy, increasing the focus on treatment engagement and intensity, thus providing more potent therapy without more treatment time. As such, EMR could be applied to any rehabilitation setting. This finding is important, because we found no differences in key secondary discharge outcomes, including disposition (frequency of returning home) or gait measures (gait speed and 6-minute walk test). Therefore, to fully optimize outcomes, it may be necessary to combine EMR with additional components, such as techniques to increase muscle strength and stamina to improve gait performance,<sup><xref rid="zoi190327r55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref></sup> and a postdischarge care component to reduce rehospitalization.<sup><xref rid="zoi190327r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190327r56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref></sup></p>
              <p>In addition, there were no differences in longer-term self-reported function. Self-reported function may be a different construct than therapist-measured function; furthermore, self-reported function appeared to show a ceiling effect by 60 to 90 days after SNF admission, suggesting that self-report scores were inflated or that participants who were able to be assessed after discharge were also those who regained most or all of their function. Studies should measure both self-reported and observed function to better understand the long-term functional trajectory after rehabilitation.</p>
              <p>The effectiveness of EMR was not moderated by baseline levels of depression, cognitive impairment, or medical complexity, which we had estimated would be potential barriers to motivation and recovery. This finding argues against providing EMR only to certain patient groups, such as individuals with depression, in favor of a more universal application of this approach in rehabilitation.</p>

                <title>Strengths and Limitations</title>
                <p>Strengths of this study included demonstrating that EMR and standard-of-care therapists were equated at baseline prior to training and blinding of outcomes. The study has several limitations. The trial was conducted in 2 facilities in 1 geographic area. Because of logistical challenges, we were unable to control therapy done on weekends and we were only able to assign and randomize participants after 1 to 2 days in the SNF. However, this limitation would not invalidate positive study findings; possibly, EMR would have greater effects if implemented for all therapy sessions. Further studies of EMR are needed to replicate and extend these findings. Another limitation is that, for feasibility reasons, we were unable to directly observe all therapy sessions and we did not have a method of assessing treatment fidelity by therapists other than by direct observation; this lack of continuous assessment could have influenced EMR-trained therapists to carry out more motivational messaging when observed. Other limitations include low statistical power for examining binary secondary outcomes, such as rehospitalization, and a high rate of SNF admissions excluded for reasons such as patients being severely cognitively impaired or not requiring intensive rehabilitation.</p>
