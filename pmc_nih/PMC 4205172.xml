                <p id="P1">Prevention of sexual acquisition of HIV in women requires a substantial increase in our knowledge about HIV-target cell availability and regulation in the female reproductive tract (FRT). In this study, we analyzed the phenotype and susceptibility to HIV-infection of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell in the endometrium (EM), endocervix (END) and ectocervix (ECT) of the FRT. We found that Th17 cells represent a major subset in FRT tissues analyzed, and that Th17 cells were the main CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell population expressing CCR5 and CD90. In pre-menopausal women, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and Th17 cells in particular, were significantly lower in EM relative to END and ECT. Th17 cells were elevated in EM from post-menopausal women relative to pre-menopausal tissues, but not changed in END and ECT. Susceptibility of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to HIV infection measured as intracellular p24 was lowest in the EM and highest in ECT. Additionally, we found that Th17 cells co-expressing CCR5 and CD90 were the most susceptible to HIV-infection. Our results provide valuable information for designing preventive strategies directed at targeting highly susceptible target cells in the FRT.</p>

              <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
              <p id="P2">Currently 34 million people are known to be infected with HIV and the pandemic continues to spread despite intensive preventive efforts<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. Worldwide, approximately half of these infections are women; however an imbalance between genders is found in areas like sub-Saharan Africa, where young women ages 15–24 are up to 8 times more likely to be infected than young men<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="P3">A combination of behavioral and biological factors may be involved in the differential incidence of infection between men and women. Intensive effort is being invested to try to prevent HIV-infection in women, with mixed and disappointing results<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. To develop successful approaches to prevent sexual acquisition of HIV in women, a considerable improvement in our knowledge is necessary regarding HIV-target cell distribution and regulation in the female reproductive tract (FRT). While the pathogenesis of HIV infection is being widely studied in immune cells from blood, we are only starting to understand and unravel the complex interactions between HIV and the immune system in the FRT.</p>
              <p id="P4">A unique characteristic of the FRT immune system is the dual task of protection against infection while allowing reproduction. Immune cells in the FRT are directly regulated by sex hormones throughout the menstrual cycle and indirectly by the mucosal microenvironment, which is also responsive to hormonal fluctuations<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. The direct effects of hormones on immune cells include changes in phenotype and activation status<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>, as well as the direct modification of susceptibility to HIV infection as we recently demonstrated<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. In that study, we found that estradiol treatment of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells isolated from blood and monocyte-derived macrophages before HIV challenge reduced infection levels in a dose dependent manner. Therefore, hormonal influence should be taken into account when analyzing HIV-target cells in the FRT.</p>
              <p id="P5">CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are one of the main targets for HIV infection; however, not all CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are equally susceptible to infection<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. Studies in non-human primates indicate that memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells expressing CCR5 preferentially support HIV replication<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. Work with human cervico-vaginal tissue explants also demonstrated that HIV-infection occurs preferentially with R5 viruses and that the majority of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells present in these explants display an effector memory phenotype<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="P6">Experiments in macaques demonstrated that MIP3α (CCL20) was rapidly produced in response to SIV vaginal challenge and that blockade of this molecule resulted in the prevention of systemic dissemination of infection<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. MIP3α is a high affinity ligand for CCR6 and will attract CCR6+ cells to the infectious focus. Cells expressing CCR6 include immature dendritic cells, B cells and a subset of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells identified as Th17 cells. In addition to CCR6 expression, Th17 cells are characterized by their production of IL-17 and expression of the transcription factor retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor C2 (RORC2), the human ortholog of RORγt expressed in the mouse<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. Th17 cells are mainly found in tissues, especially those in contact with the microbial environment, where they mediate immune responses to fungi and are important in maintaining the integrity of epithelial surfaces<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. Although Th17 cells have been broadly characterized in mucosal tissues such as gut, lungs or skin, with the exception of the endocervix<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>, relatively little is known about their presence and distribution in other FRT tissues.</p>
              <p id="P7">Several reports indicate that Th17 cells display high susceptibility to HIV-infection and disappear early from the gut and cervix of HIV-infected patients<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>–<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. Th17 cells express higher levels of CCR5 and possess a memory phenotype, which may account for their increased HIV-susceptibility<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. Furthermore a recent study demonstrated expression of CD90 (Thy-1) in a subset of Th17 cells isolated from blood which was depleted in non-treated HIV infected patients<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="P8">In the present study we characterized the distribution and phenotype of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells at different sites in the FRT from pre- and post-menopausal women and compared their susceptibility to HIV-infection. Understanding which cells are readily available to be infected, where they are located in the FRT, and the extent to which these cells are regulated by sex hormones and the mucosal tissue environment, are essential to achieving successful prevention of sexual acquisition of HIV in women.</p>

                <p id="P9">Hysterectomy tissues were digested as described in Methods to obtain mixed cell suspensions. Differences in the distribution of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells between endometrium (EM), endocervix (END) and ectocervix (ECT) were investigated analyzing CD3, CD4 and CD8 expression by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>). In EM, within the total T cell population (CD3<sup>+</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>), CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells accounted for approximately 35% of the CD3<sup>+</sup> cells present and were significantly lower than the CD3<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>−</sup> population (P&lt;0.0001), which corresponds to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>). In contrast, END and ECT CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells accounted for approximately 50% of the total CD3<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>). Comparison of CD3<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells amongst the three FRT tissues showed significantly lower numbers of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in EM relative to those present in END and ECT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>).</p>
                <p id="P10">To investigate if the menstrual status of the patients would affect T cell distribution in FRT tissues, we stratified samples according to pre- or post-menopausal status, as established by tissue histology. Menstrual status significantly influenced T cell distribution in EM, but not in END or ECT, with pre-menopausal women containing a higher percentage of CD3+ CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c</xref>) as compared to post-menopausal women. Additionally, in post-menopausal women, the percentage of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells was lower in EM with respect to END or ECT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c</xref>).</p>

                <title>Th17 cells constitute a major T cell subset in the FRT</title>
                <p id="P11">A previous report indicated that Th17 cells constitute an important T cell subset in cervical cytobrush samples<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. Therefore, we further characterized the immunophenotype of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in our hysterectomy samples by investigating the presence of Th17 subsets in the different FRT compartments. CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were purified by negative selection to obtain an untouched pure population. After selection, EM, END and ECT CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell purity was higher than 90% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>). RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that purified CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from EM, END and ECT express both RORC2 and IL-17, which identify Th17 cells<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref>). Additionally, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells express CCL20, also described to be produced by Th17 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref>). Gene expression of RORC2, IL-17 and CCL20 was highest in END, followed by ECT and lowest in EM.</p>
                <p id="P12">We next explored how END gene expression without <italic>in vitro</italic> stimulation compared to gene expression in PHA-activated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from blood, which is known to upregulate Th17 markers<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c</xref>, gene expression of RORC2, IL-17 and CCL20 was significantly higher in cervical samples relative to that seen in blood CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Additionally, gene expression of CCR7, which is known to be down-regulated in tissue resident T cells<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>, was significantly lower in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from END compared to blood. Similar patterns were seen when blood CD4<sup>+</sup> cells were compared to EM and ECT cells (not shown).</p>

                <title>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from FRT express high levels of CCR6</title>
                <p id="P13">Since CCR6 is a defined surface marker for Th17 subsets<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>, we analyzed expression of CCR6 in mixed cell suspensions from the different FRT sites. Expression of CCR6 in CD3<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells was detected in all FRT tissues, but expression varied among anatomical sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3a-b</xref>). Median values for percentage of CCR6<sup>+</sup> cells were 11.3% in EM, 23.7% in END and 15.2% in ECT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b</xref>). Since Th17 cells express the transcription factor RORC2 and produce IL-17, we performed intracellular staining to confirm that these cells were Th17 cells. The CCR6<sup>+</sup> population expressed RORC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3c-d</xref>) and produced IL-17 in response to stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3e</xref>), corresponding to the Th17 subset.</p>
                <p id="P14">We then analyzed the influence of menopausal status by stratifying the participants shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b</xref> into those corresponding to pre- (black dots) or post-menopausal (white dots) women (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3f</xref>). The number of CCR6<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in EM from pre-menopausal women was significantly lower than that seen in post-menopausal women. Additionally, when EM, END and ECT pre-menopausal cells were compared, the number of CCR6<sup>+</sup> cells in END from pre-menopausal women was significantly greater than those found in EM. No differences were found amongst post-menopausal tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3f</xref>).</p>

                <p id="P15">Th17 cells are more susceptible to HIV infection and it has been hypothesized that this is due to expression of higher levels of CCR5<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>–<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. Therefore we measured expression of CCR5 in CCR6<sup>+</sup> and CCR6<sup>−</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets from the FRT. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a</xref>, an overlay of CCR6<sup>+</sup> and CCR6<sup>−</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells demonstrated that CCR6<sup>+</sup> T cells (solid line) co-express higher levels of CCR5 than CCR6<sup>−</sup> T cells (dashed line), while no differences in CD4 expression were found between both populations. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4b</xref>, analysis of different donors confirmed that CCR5 expression was significantly higher in CCR6<sup>+</sup> than in CCR6<sup>−</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the three FRT compartments analyzed. Subsequent stratification of the individuals shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4b</xref> into pre- and post-menopausal women revealed significantly increased levels of CCR5<sup>+</sup> CCR6<sup>+</sup> T cells in post-menopausal women with respect to pre-menopausal women in EM. The same trend was observed in END and ECT although these differences did not reach statistical significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4c</xref>, left graph). No differences between CCR5<sup>+</sup> CCR6<sup>−</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were evident for either group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4c</xref>, right graph).</p>

Therefore we investigated CD90 expression in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from the FRT.

Analysis of co-expression of CD90 and CCR6 in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from the same donor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5b</xref>) showed that the majority of CD90<sup>+</sup> cells were found within the CCR6<sup>+</sup> population in the three FRT compartments analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5b</xref>). This pattern was maintained when CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from 6 different patients were analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5c</xref>), with significantly higher expression of CD90 in CCR6<sup>+</sup> cells than in CCR6<sup>−</sup> cells.</p>

                <title>Differential susceptibility of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to HIV-infection within FRT tissues</title>
                <p id="P17">We hypothesized that differences in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell populations would result in differential susceptibility to HIV-infection among FRT tissues and that CCR6<sup>+</sup> cells would be more susceptible to infection. To test this hypothesis, mixed cell suspensions from EM, END and ECT were prepared and infected in vitro with HIV (BaL) as detailed in Methods. A low viral dose (MOI=0.1) that gave detectable p24 and would help identify the most susceptible cells was chosen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary Figure 1c</xref>). Secreted p24 was detected in the supernatants at low levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6a</xref>), as expected with the low viral input used, and infections were not productive, consistent with previous publications<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>.</p>
                <p id="P18">To identify the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells producing p24, intracellular p24 was measured by flow cytometry 6 days after infection. The highest proportion of p24+ T cells was found in ECT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6b</xref>). In contrast, p24 was detected only in two of the six EM samples analyzed. Next we asked if CCR6<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were more susceptible to HIV infection. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6c</xref>, irrespective of the site analyzed, more CCR6<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were p24+ than their corresponding CCR6<sup>−</sup> population.</p>
                <p id="P19">We then explored the possibility that CD90+ cells were more susceptible to infection. Following 6 days in culture, CD90 expression was decreased in uninfected controls relative to the initial values on day 0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6d</xref>). In infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6d</xref>, bottom row), CD90 expression was also reduced relative day 0, however expression was approximately 60% higher than the values measured in uninfected controls for END and ECT, with no changes in EM. Compared to uninfected controls on day 6, the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell population co-expressing CCR5 and CD90 doubled in HIV-infected samples from END (7.38 vs 3.21%) and tripled in ECT (6.39 vs 1.95%) with no changes in EM. We then analyzed p24 expression in each of the 4 quadrants of ECT infected cells to see if infection was preferential to a given cell phenotype. As expected, all p24+ cells were found in cells expressing CCR5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6e</xref>; upper and lower right panels); however, the highest percentage of p24+ cells was found within the population co-expressing CCR5 and CD90 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6e</xref>; upper right panel and graph).</p>

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p id="P20">The characterization of the target cells in the FRT involved in sexual acquisition of HIV remains a major gap in our knowledge. In the present study we compared phenotype, distribution and susceptibility to HIV-infection of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from EM, END and ECT in pre- and post-menopausal women. Regarding differences in cell distribution between anatomical sites, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in general and Th17 cells in particular were lowest in EM compared to END and ECT. With respect to comparisons between pre- and post-menopausal tissues, post-menopausal women had reduced CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, increased CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and increased Th17 cells in EM, and increased CCR5 expression in Th17 cells from EM, END and ECT. Additionally we found decreased susceptibility to infection in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell from EM compared to END and ECT.</p>
              <p id="P21">Gene expression analysis of purified CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from FRT tissues revealed expression of IL-17 and CCL20, cytokines produced by Th17 cells, and RORC2, the human ortholog of mouse RORγt, which is the master transcription factor involved in Th17 cell development<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. Consistent with gene expression profiles, a high proportion of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the FRT had surface expression of CCR6, a marker for Th17 cells, intracellular RORC2 and produced IL-17 in response to stimulation. While Th17 cells have been broadly studied in other mucosal surfaces<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>, to the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to compare Th17 subsets among FRT tissues. It is worth noting that CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from the FRT showed a unique phenotype and gene expression profile compared to their blood counterparts. The proportion of T cells that we found in EM, and to a lesser extent in END and ECT, was markedly different than the levels found in peripheral blood, where CD3<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells account for approximately 60–70% of the total T cells. Additionally, expression of IL-17, CCL20 and RORC2 was increased in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from END compared to blood, suggesting that CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from each compartment may have unique innate and adaptive immune functions. As expected, CCR7 gene expression was reduced in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from the tissue compared to blood, consistent with the known down-regulation of the chemokine receptor CCR7 during the development of tissue resident memory T cells<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="P22">McKinnon <italic>et al</italic><sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> recently characterized CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells collected by cytobrush, which recovers cells located on the surface of the cervical mucosa. In their study, Th17 cell frequency in cervix was enhanced compared to blood and Th17 cells co-expressed CCR5. Our study complements these findings by analyzing the cells present within FRT tissues. We also found that Th17 cells were abundant in the FRT and constituted the main T cell subset co-expressing CCR5. Additionally, our study indicates that within each tissue, Th17 cells are more susceptible to <italic>in vitro</italic> HIV-infection than the rest of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. This finding is in agreement with preferential gp120 binding by Th17 cells described by McKinnon <italic>et al</italic>, and with other studies previously indicating that Th17 cells from blood have increased susceptibility to HIV-infection<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="P23">Our studies demonstrate that CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from END and ECT are more readily infected by HIV than cells from EM. Others have shown in non-human primates that the cervix is the first site of detectable SIV-infection<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. Our results extend these findings, suggesting that in the human, the cervix is the initial site of detectable HIV-infection and demonstrating that not all CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are equally susceptible to HIV infection. In contrast to END and ECT, HIV-infection was detected in two out of 6 patients in EM. Reduced numbers of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, and in particular of Th17 cells, in EM with respect to END and ECT could partially explain the reduced susceptibility of this tissue to HIV-infection. Further studies are needed to carefully identify the mechanisms in EM that restrict infection in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells; this information could lead to the development of new preventive approaches.</p>
              <p id="P24">Interestingly, our studies indicated that Th17 cells were more frequent in END than in ECT, but highest number of infected cells was found in ECT. Just why such differences were seen at adjacent sites remains to be determined. Plasticity and flexibility and the existence of intermediate subsets of Th17 cells have been reported, with alterations in lineage commitment that is regulated by the mucosal environment<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>. In our studies we measured expression of CCR6, but did not analyze additional chemokine receptors such as CCR4 and CXCR3, which allow sub-classification into Th17 and Th1/Th17 subsets, respectively. Both subsets express RORC2, but their cytokine profiles are different and may display differential susceptibility to HIV infection. Another possible explanation is that upon entry into a given FRT tissue, the local environment influences phenotype and function of immune cells. Previously, we found that basolateral secretions from EM epithelial cells suppress DC-SIGN and HIV trans-infection by blood derived dendritic cells<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. We found that CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell function, measured as CTL activity, was suppressed during the secretory phase of the menstrual cycle in EM, but not END or ECT<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. Our findings in the present study demonstrate site phenotype specificity for CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells as well as selective susceptibility to HIV infection. Further studies are needed to understand the impact of the tissue environment on T cell function in the FRT.</p>
              <p id="P25">Here we describe for the first time that CD90 was highly expressed on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from the FRT, in particular in Th17 cells. Although CD90 is expressed in the majority of T cells in mice, CD90 expression in T cells from humans has only been reported in a small population of cortical thymocytes and less than 1% of T cells in peripheral blood<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>. CD90 (Thy-1) is a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored glycoprotein preferentially localized in lipid rafts<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>. CD90 appears to mediate cell to cell interactions, participate in transferring of other GPI-anchored proteins, (such as CD55 and CD59), from one cell membrane to another<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> and was preferentially localized at the contact areas between infected and target cells<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>. We found a higher percentage of p24+ cells in the population co-expressing CCR5 and CD90 than in cells expressing solely CCR5, which may suggest increased susceptibility to infection. Our data are in agreement with CD90 detection in a subset of Th17 cells from peripheral blood that was depleted during HIV infection, suggesting that might represent a highly susceptible T cell subset<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. The role that CD90 may play in HIV-acquisition remains unexplored and future studies with purified cell populations need to determine their involvement in HIV-acquisition. Although the physiological functions of this cell subset remain to be elucidated, selective targeting of CCR5<sup>+</sup>CD90<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells may be an attractive strategy for preventing sexual acquisition of HIV in women.</p>
              <p id="P26">Our studies also demonstrate that T cell subsets in FRT tissues vary with menopausal status. Differences in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell distribution between pre and post-menopausal women were found in EM but not in the other two compartments, suggesting regulation of T cell subsets in the uterus. The CD4:CD8 T cell ratio was decreased in EM from post-menopausal women, similar to previous findings in peripheral blood from post-menopausal women <sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>–<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>. Additionally, we found that menopausal status affected Th17 frequency in FRT tissues. In pre-menopausal women, the proportion of Th17 cells was lower in EM than in END, likely contributing to the reduced HIV-susceptibility of T cells from EM. In post-menopausal women, Th17 cells were significantly increased in EM with respect to pre-menopausal women, suggesting selective regulation of different T cell subsets. Although in the present study we cannot demonstrate that the observed differences between pre- and post-menopausal women are due to hormonal changes, recent studies in mice demonstrated that estrogen deficiency promotes the differentiation of Th17 cells<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>. Ovariectomized mice had increased numbers of Th17 cells and this effect could be reversed by estradiol supplementation. Down-regulation of Th17 cells in EM of pre-menopausal women may be physiologically necessary for successful fertilization, implantation and pregnancy, considering the reportedTh17 cell increase in peripheral blood and decidual tissues from women with recurrent pregnancy loss<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup></p>
              <p id="P27">Two main findings in our study support the reported increase in HIV-susceptibility in post-menopausal women<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>. First, we observed increased CCR5 expression in Th17 cells from post-menopausal women in all tissues analyzed, suggesting that these cells would be more susceptible to infection than those from pre-menopausal women. Although we could not compare HIV-susceptibility between pre- and post-menopausal women in our cohort, we observed a trend for higher infection levels in cells from post-menopausal women. Second, we demonstrate that menopausal status correlates with the presence of HIV-susceptible CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell populations in EM. The increase in Th17 cells in EM from post-menopausal women found in our study suggests that the EM is also a portal of entry for HIV in these women. Further research is needed to determine whether hormonal fluctuations throughout the menstrual cycle and hormonal shifts that occur with menopause directly modify the susceptibility of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to HIV-infection in the FRT.</p>
              <p id="P28">In conclusion we demonstrate that Th17 cells are abundant in the FRT, that they display increased susceptibility to HIV infection and that differential distribution and regulation of these cells may be responsible for the differential predisposition to infection of different FRT tissues. Our studies contribute important information for the development of preventive strategies oriented to target highly susceptible cells in the FRT.</p>
