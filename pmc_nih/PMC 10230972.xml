                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>In preclinical studies, combining M9241 (a novel immunocytokine containing interleukin (IL)-12 heterodimers) with avelumab (anti-programmed death ligand 1 antibody) resulted in additive or synergistic antitumor effects. We report dose-escalation and dose-expansion results from the phase Ib JAVELIN IL-12 trial investigating M9241 plus avelumab.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>In the dose-escalation part of JAVELIN IL-12 (NCT02994953), eligible patients had locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors; in the dose-expansion part, eligible patients had locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC) that had progressed with first-line therapy. Patients received M9241 at 4, 8, 12, or 16.8 µg/kg every 4 weeks (Q4W) plus avelumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks (Q2W, dose levels (DLs) 1–4) or M9241 16.8 µg/kg Q4W plus avelumab 800 mg once a week for 12 weeks followed by Q2W (DL5/dose expansion). Primary endpoints for the dose-escalation part were adverse events (AEs) and dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), and those for the dose-expansion part were confirmed best overall response (BOR) per investigator (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors V.1.1) and safety. The dose-expansion part followed a two-stage design; 16 patients were enrolled and treated in stage 1 (single-arm part). A futility analysis based on BOR was planned to determine whether stage 2 (randomized controlled part) would be initiated.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>At data cut-off, 36 patients had received M9241 plus avelumab in the dose-escalation part. All DLs were well tolerated; one DLT occurred at DL3 (grade 3 autoimmune hepatitis). The maximum-tolerated dose was not reached, and DL5 was declared the recommended phase II dose, considering an observed drug–drug interaction at DL4. Two patients with advanced bladder cancer (DL2 and DL4) had prolonged complete responses. In the dose-expansion part, no objective responses were recorded in the 16 patients with advanced UC; the study failed to meet the criterion (≥3 confirmed objective responses) to initiate stage 2. Any-grade treatment-related AEs occurred in 15 patients (93.8%), including grade ≥3 in 8 (50.0%); no treatment-related deaths occurred. Exposures for avelumab and M9241 concentrations were within expected ranges.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>M9241 plus avelumab was well tolerated at all DLs, including the dose-expansion part, with no new safety signals. However, the dose-expansion part did not meet the predefined efficacy criterion to proceed to stage 2.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Immune checkpoint inhibitors have shown antitumor activity across a range of tumor types. Avelumab is an anti-programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) monoclonal antibody that is approved in various countries worldwide, including the USA, European Union countries, and Japan, as first-line maintenance treatment for patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC) that has not progressed with first-line platinum-based chemotherapy, and in the USA, Canada, and Israel for patients with disease progression after platinum-based chemotherapy.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1–5</xref> Avelumab is also approved as monotherapy for patients with metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma and in combination with axitinib for first-line treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref>
</p>
              <p>Interleukin (IL)-12 is a potent proinflammatory cytokine that promotes effective antitumor immune responses via several mechanisms, including upregulating interferon (IFN)-γ production, promoting differentiation of T-helper 1 cells, and enhancing antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. However, non-targeted IL-12 treatment is associated with toxicity and low levels of IL-12 in the tumor microenvironment.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 7</xref> M9241 is a novel immunocytokine composed of two heterodimers of IL-12 fused to the heavy chains of the human antibody NHS76.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 8</xref> NHS76 recognizes DNA–histone epitopes, which can be exposed in necrotic regions of solid tumors when rapid tumor growth outpaces the development of blood vessels.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 9</xref> M9241 aims to achieve a high concentration of IL-12 within the tumor but a relatively low systemic dose of IL-12, thereby reducing potential toxicity.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 7</xref> Preclinical studies of M9241 demonstrated that NHS76 targets IL-12 to areas of tumor necrosis, enhancing antitumor activity and decreasing systemic toxicity.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
</p>
              <p>In preclinical models, treatment with a murine version of M9241 (NHS-muIL12) led to changes in the bladder tumor microenvironment, reverting to an immunopermissive environment.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Additionally, concurrent therapy with M9241 and avelumab resulted in additive or synergistic antitumor effects.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 12</xref> In preclinical studies, increased antitumor efficacy also correlated with a higher frequency of tumor antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and enhanced T-cell activation.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 11</xref> These findings suggest that combining M9241 and avelumab may improve antitumor activity. In a first-in-human, phase I, multiple dose-escalation trial, M9241 monotherapy was well tolerated up to a dose of 16.8 µg/kg and elicited preliminary evidence of clinical benefit in patients with advanced solid tumors.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Here, we report the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and clinical activity of M9241 plus avelumab in patients with advanced solid tumors, including dose expansion in patients with advanced UC from the phase Ib JAVELIN IL-12 trial.</p>

                <title>Study design</title>
                <p>JAVELIN IL-12 (NCT02994953) was an open-label, multicenter, dose-finding, phase Ib trial with a consecutive parallel-group expansion conducted at 33 sites in North America and Europe. In the dose-escalation part, sequential cohorts of patients received combination therapy with M9241 plus avelumab in a modified 3+3 design to determine the maximum tolerated dose, defined as the maximal dose at which no more than one of six evaluable patients experienced a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). Patients in the dose-escalation cohorts received one of four ascending dose levels (DLs) of M9241 subcutaneously every 4 weeks (Q4W) plus avelumab 10 mg/kg intravenously every 2 weeks (Q2W). For DL1–DL4, patients received M9241 at 4, 8, 12, and 16.8 µg/kg, respectively. For DL5, patients received M9241 at 16.8 µg/kg Q4W plus avelumab 800 mg once a week (QW) for a 12-week induction followed by Q2W. To limit infusion-related reactions, patients received pretreatment with diphenhydramine and acetaminophen prior to the first four infusions of avelumab. All patients continued treatment until confirmed disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal, or loss to follow-up. The dose-expansion part followed a two-stage design; in stage 1 (single-arm part), 16 patients were enrolled and treated with the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of the combination (DL5) to determine the clinical activity and safety of combination treatment at the RP2D. A futility analysis based on the occurrence of &lt;3 confirmed objective responses by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) V.1.1 was planned to determine the futility of the study prior to initiation of stage 2 (randomized part).</p>

                <title>Patient eligibility</title>
                <p>In the dose-escalation part, eligible patients were aged ≥18 years and had histologically or cytologically proven metastatic or locally advanced solid tumors for which no standard therapy existed; standard therapy had failed; the patient was intolerant of established therapy known to provide clinical benefit for their condition; or standard therapy was not acceptable to the patient. Prior treatment with an immune checkpoint inhibitor was allowed. The dose-expansion part enrolled patients with locally advanced or metastatic UC that had progressed on ≥1 prior line of platinum-based chemotherapy and were anti-programmed death 1/PD-L1 treatment-naive. Additional inclusion criteria for both parts included an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) of 0 or 1 and measurable disease per RECIST V.1.1 (except for patients with prostate or breast cancer in the dose-escalation part); tumor tissue for biomarker assessments was required for the dose-expansion part only. Patients were excluded if they had been previously treated with IL-12 or were intolerant to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, which was defined as the occurrence of an adverse event (AE) requiring drug discontinuation.</p>

                <title>Endpoints and assessments</title>
                <p>In the dose-escalation part, primary endpoints were AEs according to the National Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for AEs V.4.03 and DLTs during the DLT observation period. Patients were observed for DLTs for the first 3 weeks after undergoing study treatment (one or more injections of M9241 and two infusions of avelumab). A DLT was defined as any grade ≥3 non-hematological AE or grade ≥4 hematological AE that occurred during the DLT observation period and was determined by the investigator or sponsor to be related to either or both study drugs. Any grade 3 autoimmune thyroid-related toxicity that did not clinically resolve to grade ≤2 within 7 days of initiating therapy and any grade ≥3 thrombocytopenia with medically concerning bleeding were also defined as a DLT. The following treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were excluded from the DLT definition: grade 4 neutropenia of &lt;5 days’ duration; grade 3 infusion-related reaction that resolved within 6 hours of the end of infusion and was controlled with medical management; grade 3 diarrhea or skin toxicity that resolved to grade ≤1 in less than 7 days after medical management (eg, immunosuppressant treatment) was initiated; transient (≤48 hours) grade 3 fatigue, local reactions, influenza-like symptoms, fever, headache, nausea, emesis, and diarrhea; other single laboratory values out of normal range that had no clinical correlate and resolved to grade ≤1 or baseline within 7 days with adequate medical management; and tumor flare phenomenon defined as local pain, irritation, or rash localized at known or suspected tumor sites. Secondary endpoints for the dose-escalation part included pharmacokinetics and confirmed best overall response (BOR) by investigator per RECIST V.1.1.</p>
                <p>In the dose-expansion part, the primary endpoints were confirmed BOR by investigator per RECIST V.1.1 and safety. Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS) by investigator per RECIST V.1.1, overall survival (OS), and pharmacokinetics analyses.</p>

                <title>Pharmacokinetics</title>
                <p>Concentrations of M9241 and avelumab were measured by a validated immunoassay, with lower limits of quantitation of 1 µg/L and 0.2 mg/L, respectively. Non-compartmental pharmacokinetic analyses were performed using actual doses per patient’s weight, actual time points, and actual duration of infusions. Pharmacokinetic parameters of interest were area under the concentration–time curve over the dosing interval (AUC<sub>tau</sub>), maximum concentration (C<sub>max</sub>), concentration at the end of dosing interval (C<sub>trough</sub>), time to maximum concentration (t<sub>max</sub>), and half-life. In the dose-escalation part, potential pharmacokinetic interaction with avelumab as a ‘victim’ when coadministered with M9241 was assessed by comparing observed avelumab pharmacokinetic parameters (eg, AUC<sub>tau</sub> and C<sub>trough</sub>) with the corresponding median values predicted using an avelumab population pharmacokinetic model.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> To compare pharmacokinetic parameters for M9241 when combined with avelumab with parameters for M9241 monotherapy, observed M9241 pharmacokinetic data from a phase I trial were used,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> since no M9241 population pharmacokinetic model is currently available.</p>

                <p>In both the dose-escalation and dose-expansion parts of the study, changes in serum levels of cytokines at baseline and during treatment were determined using a validated 10-plex immunoassay (Meso Scale Discovery) following the manufacturer’s instructions.</p>
                <p>In the dose-escalation part, cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were examined by multicolor flow cytometry to identify 135 peripheral immune cell subsets<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> using the methodology described previously.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16 17</xref> Additionally, in the dose-escalation part, gene expression analyses were performed on total RNA extracted from cryopreserved PBMCs that had been collected from patients before and after 15 days of treatment using the Qiagen RNeasy Plus Minikit (Valencia, California, USA) per the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA was analyzed using the nCounter PanCancer Immune Profiling panel (NanoString Technologies, Seattle, Washington, USA), per the manufacturer’s protocol. Genes with p&lt;0.05 and &gt;1.5-fold change after treatment were analyzed for enrichment of pathways using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software (Redwood City, California, USA). Changes in immune parameters between two time points were assessed for statistical significance using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Blood-based PD-L1 gene expression was assessed in the dose-escalation part using samples from baseline and during treatment; total RNA was extracted using the PAXgene Blood miRNA Kit, and PD-L1 gene expression was detected by using a validated digital droplet PCR method. TaqMan assays containing primer and probe sets were selected based on coverage of the PD-L1 gene and were tested for linearity and efficiency using real-time quantitative PCR. Four reference genes were analyzed in genomic DNA derived from a positive control cell line (A549 treated with IFN-γ).</p>
                <p>In the dose-expansion part, immune cell subsets, including T-cell, B-cell, and natural killer (NK)-cell subsets; myeloid-derived suppressor cells; and monocytes from whole-blood samples collected at baseline and during treatment (days 15 and 29) were assessed by flow cytometry using four validated panels of antibodies. Baseline PD-L1 tumor expression in patients with UC was assessed in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue by immunohistochemistry using the VENTANA PD-L1 (SP263) assay. PD-L1+ status was defined by the following cut-offs: ≥1%, ≥5%, or ≥50% expression in tumor cells or expression in ≥25% of tumor cells; expression in ≥25% of tumor-associated immune cells if the percentage of immune cells present was &gt;1%; or expression in 100% of tumor-associated immune cells if the percentage of immune cells present was 1%.</p>

                  <p>Of a total of 41 screened patients, 36 were enrolled across the five dose groups. At final analysis (data cut-off: November 20, 2020), 36 patients with various solid tumors had received ≥1 dose of M9241 plus avelumab.

The most common reasons for treatment discontinuation were disease progression (M9241, 52.8%; avelumab, 50.0%) and AEs (M9241, 30.6%; avelumab, 33.3%) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>). One patient (2.8%) who had a complete response with M9241 8 µg/kg plus avelumab discontinued both study drugs per protocol; on disease reoccurrence, this patient subsequently reinitiated both study drugs. Median treatment duration for both drugs across all dose cohorts was 8.0 weeks (range, 4.0–173.1), with a median of two M9241 administrations and four avelumab infusions.</p>

                  <p>All 36 patients had ≥1 treatment-emergent AE of any grade; 25 (69.4%) had a grade ≥3 AE (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>). The most common AEs of any grade (≥25% of all patients) were fever (61.1%), fatigue (58.3%), anemia (52.8%), decrease in lymphocyte count (50.0%), nausea (38.9%), influenza-like illness (36.1%), decreased appetite (30.6%), dizziness (27.8%), chills (25.0%), diarrhea (25.0%), hypoalbuminemia (25.0%), and vomiting (25.0%). TRAEs of any grade occurred in 30 patients (83.3%). Grade ≥3 TRAEs occurred in three patients (8.3%): increased amylase and increased lipase (both grade 3 and considered related to combination treatment), immune-mediated hepatitis (grade 3 and considered related to combination treatment), and decreased lymphocyte count (grade 3 and considered related to M9241).</p>

The maximum administered dose (M9241 16.8 µg/kg Q4W plus avelumab 800 mg QW for 12 weeks followed by Q2W) was declared as the RP2D. In total, 32 patients were evaluable for DLTs. One patient had a DLT of grade 3 immune-mediated hepatitis in the M9241 12 µg/kg plus avelumab cohort, which resolved following steroid therapy. A cytokine release syndrome AE was reported in four patients (11.1%); all were of grade 1 or 2 severity; none led to treatment discontinuation. However, one patient (2.8%) with prostate cancer who received M9241 16.8 µg/kg Q4W plus avelumab 10 mg/kg Q2W had a serious cytokine release syndrome AE of grade 2 severity that was reported on day 2 and had resolved with supportive treatment on day 6; this AE was related to both study drugs but did not lead to drug interruption. Cytokine release syndrome was diagnosed based on clinical symptoms rather than on cytokine measurements; therefore, it is unclear whether these diagnoses were cytokine release syndrome or infusion-related reactions because of overlapping symptomatology and/or timing of treatment.</p>

                  <p>After the RP2D was determined, enrollment began of patients with advanced or metastatic UC in a dose-expansion cohort. Of a total of 26 screened patients, 16 were enrolled. At final analysis (data cut-off: November 6, 2020), 16 patients with advanced UC had received ≥1 dose of M9241 plus avelumab at the RP2D. Of these, six patients (37.5%) had upper-tract tumors and 10 (62.5%) had lower-tract tumors. The median time since first diagnosis was 1.6 years (range, 0.3–12.3); the median time since metastatic diagnosis was 0.7 years (range, 0.1–6.1); and the median time since last disease progression was 1.5 years (range, 0.9–2.8). Most patients were male and White, and all had an ECOG PS of 0 or 1 (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>In this first-in-human study, we report the safety, clinical activity, and pharmacokinetics of an anti-PD-L1 antibody plus an IL-12 immunocytokine in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors, with a dose expansion in patients with advanced UC. The safety profile of M9241 plus avelumab was similar to that observed with individual agents; grade ≥3 TRAEs were reported in 21% of patients across both cohorts with combination therapy vs 20% of patients with M9241 alone<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> and 12% with avelumab monotherapy at 10 mg/kg Q2W.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> However, the number of patients in the current study was small, and caution should be used in the interpretation of the results.</p>
              <p>Analysis of safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics data from the dose-escalation part led to the selection of M9241 16.8 µg/kg Q4W plus avelumab 800 mg QW for 12 weeks followed by Q2W as the RP2D. Based on non-clinical data and the mechanism of action of M9241, a potential pharmacokinetic interaction between M9241 and avelumab was expected.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> The observed drug–drug interaction (reduced avelumab exposure with M9241 16.8 µg/kg Q4W plus avelumab 10 mg/kg Q2W vs monotherapy) was likely driven by M9241-mediated IFN-γ induction, causing PD-L1 upregulation in the periphery and tumor, leading to an increased target-mediated clearance of avelumab (sink effect). Consequently, the more frequent avelumab dosing of 800 mg QW for 12 weeks followed by Q2W was introduced to mitigate the sink effect.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> At the RP2D, pharmacokinetic exposure metrics for M9241 16.8 µg/kg Q4W plus avelumab 800 mg QW were non-inferior to avelumab 10 mg/kg monotherapy Q2W, and concentrations of M9241 were within expected ranges for M9241 monotherapy.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
</p>
              <p>Across the dose-escalation cohorts, two patients had prolonged objective responses (both complete responses) for &gt;24 months, both of which were ongoing at data cut-off. Both patients had advanced bladder cancer, and one patient had received previous immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment. Despite the promising antitumor activity seen in the dose-escalation part with M9241 plus avelumab, no objective responses occurred among 16 patients with platinum-treated advanced UC who received the RP2D of M9241 16.8 µg/kg Q4W plus avelumab 800 mg QW in the dose-expansion part. The study therefore failed to meet the predefined go criterion to proceed to stage 2 (≥3 objective responses), and the study was stopped due to futility at the end of stage 1. These results were unexpected and inconsistent with previous studies of avelumab monotherapy in advanced UC (objective response rate, 16.5%).<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> In addition, median OS in the dose-expansion part was shorter than with avelumab monotherapy (4.9 vs 7.0 months),<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> indicating that patients in this study may have had more aggressive or resistant disease. However, definitive reasons for the negative outcome of the dose-expansion part of this trial are unclear.</p>
              <p>Biomarker analyses showed immunological activity of M9241 consistent with that of previous studies<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> and the known function of IL-12<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>; therefore, these analyses did not provide a clear explanation for the limited efficacy that was observed. There was a time-dependent induction of serum levels of cytokines (including IFN-γ, IL-10, and IL-12p70) in the dose-expansion part of the study, consistent with the dose-escalation part. In the dose-expansion part, a time-dependent increase in CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell and NK-cell proliferation in peripheral blood was also observed.</p>
              <p>IL-12 may have had an antagonistic effect via its impact on PD-L1 expression and alteration of the overall immunosuppressive state of the tumor microenvironment. IFN-γ induced by IL-12 may have triggered a negative feedback loop to increase expression of PD-L1 and potentially activate additional regulatory mechanisms, for example, by the observed increased expression of immune checkpoint proteins such as LAG-3 (<xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental figure S4</xref>), and other immunoregulatory mechanisms conferring adaptive immune resistance of tumor cells.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20 21</xref> Additional RNA-based studies could help to understand the increase in markers associated with T-cell exhaustion and/or activation; however, we were unable to perform functional experiments due to limited amounts of PBMCs. M9241 was administered subcutaneously and, therefore, first needed to transition from the site of injection to the tumor microenvironment, passing through other tissues and the blood stream, where PD-L1 was then induced. There is a potential that any peripheral sink effect or other regulatory mechanisms may have been avoided with intralesional M9241 administration, which could have also allowed for the use of a lower dose. However, M9241 was not designed as an intralesional drug and instead targets the tumor microenvironment via NHS76 after systemic injection. The avelumab QW treatment schedule may not be able to compensate for higher PD-L1 levels in the tumor or for other regulatory mechanisms not conferred by PD-L1. Therefore, M9241 treatment may have led to peripheral immune exhaustion and an overall immunosuppressive state, potentially due to IFN-γ, that may hinder the antitumor activity of this combination.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22 23</xref> Additionally, in the dose-escalation part, two patients had a complete response with avelumab Q2W dosing, compared with none of the 16 patients in the dose-expansion part with avelumab QW dosing; this suggests that treatment with M9241 in combination with more frequent avelumab QW dosing may lead to T-cell exhaustion.</p>
              <p>Additionally, in the dose-expansion part, the proportion of patients with PD-L1− tumors based on a ≥5% tumor cell cut-off was higher than in the JAVELIN Solid Tumor UC cohorts (75.0% vs 54.2%, respectively), although different PD-L1 immunohistochemistry assays were used (VENTANA PD-L1 (SP263) vs Dako PD-L1 73–10 PharmDx, respectively).<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> However, avelumab monotherapy has also shown antitumor activity in patients with PD-L1− urothelial tumors (objective response rate of 12.3% vs 23.8% in patients with PD-L1+ tumors).<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> The proportion of patients with upper tract disease, which is associated with poor prognosis,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> was also higher in this study than in the JAVELIN Solid Tumor UC cohorts (37.5% vs 23.3%, respectively).<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
</p>
              <p>In conclusion, data from this trial show that the combination of M9241 plus avelumab was generally well tolerated with a manageable safety profile. Furthermore, preliminary data, although from a small number of patients, suggest that combining M9241 with avelumab QW might have reduced antitumor activity compared with avelumab Q2W monotherapy and potentially M9241 in combination with avelumab Q2W in patients with advanced UC.</p>
