                <p id="Par1">In a trial of patients with high grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC), addition of the ATR inhibitor berzosertib to gemcitabine improved progression free survival (PFS) compared to gemcitabine alone but biomarkers predictive of treatment are lacking. Here we report a candidate biomarker of response to gemcitabine versus combined gemcitabine and ATR inhibitor therapy in HGSOC ovarian cancer. Patients with replication stress (RS)-high tumors (n = 27), defined as harboring at least one genomic RS alteration related to loss of RB pathway regulation and/or oncogene-induced replication stress achieve significantly prolonged PFS (HR = 0.38, 90% CI, 0.17–0.86) on gemcitabine monotherapy compared to those with tumors without such alterations (defined as RS-low, n = 30). However, addition of berzosertib to gemcitabine benefits only patients with RS-low tumors (gemcitabine/berzosertib HR 0.34, 90% CI, 0.13–0.86) and not patients with RS-high tumors (HR 1.11, 90% CI, 0.47–2.62). Our findings support the notion that the exacerbation of RS by gemcitabine monotherapy is adequate for lethality in RS-high tumors. Conversely, for RS-low tumors addition of berzosertib-mediated ATR inhibition to gemcitabine is necessary for lethality to occur. Independent prospective validation of this biomarker is required.</p>

              <p id="Par3">Effective treatment of patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer (PROC) remains a significant unmet medical need<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Nonplatinum cytotoxic chemotherapy (with or without bevacizumab) is the standard of care for these patients, who typically have poor prognosis and no targeted treatment options except for PARP inhibitors (PARPi) if their tumors are <italic>BRCA1/2</italic> mutated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Weekly gemcitabine has demonstrated similar activity as pegylated liposomal doxorubicin in two randomized phase 3 studies in PROC and is a commonly used chemotherapy regimen in this setting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par4">Preclinical studies have demonstrated synergistic antitumor activity for the combination of gemcitabine and the ATR inhibitor berzosertib<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Gemcitabine induces replication stress (RS) and dependence on the ATR-mediated replication stress response (RSR) via two mechanisms: (i) inhibition of DNA repair by incorporation of gemcitabine nucleotides into the DNA; and (ii) inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase leading to depletion of the deoxyribonucleotide pool required for replication and repair<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Targeting the ATR-mediated RSR is particularly relevant to high-grade serous ovarian cancers (HGSOCs), which commonly exhibit molecular alterations associated with increased RS. Specifically, large-scale genomic studies have demonstrated that HGSOCs exhibit: (i) near universal loss of the G1/S checkpoint (via deleterious <italic>TP53</italic> mutations); (ii) loss of RB pathway regulation leading to premature G1- &gt; S phase entry due to <italic>CCNE1</italic> amplification and <italic>RB1</italic> loss in ~20% and 10% of tumors, respectively; and (iii) oncogene-induced replication stress via amplification of the <italic>MYC</italic> oncogene in up to ~30% of tumors, <italic>KRAS</italic> amplification (or more rarely mutations) in ~11% of tumors and <italic>NF1</italic> loss or mutations in ~12% of tumors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. In addition, ~50% of HGSOCs exhibit defective homologous recombination repair (HRR) due to genetic and epigenetic alterations involving HRR genes, and are therefore good candidates for ATR inhibition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par5">Based on these considerations, we conducted a randomized phase 2 (RP2) study (NCI-CTEP #9944, NCT02595892) to evaluate whether addition of the ATR inhibitor berzosertib to gemcitabine would show acceptable toxicity and superior activity compared with gemcitabine alone in patients with recurrent, platinum-resistant HGSOC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. This was a multicenter, open-label, RP2 study, involving 11 different centers within the US NCI Experimental Therapeutics Clinical Trials Network (ETCTN), which randomly assigned 70 patients (1:1) to treatment with gemcitabine alone (36 patients) or gemcitabine plus berzosertib (34 patients), stratified by platinum-free interval into two strata (PFI ≤ 3 months vs 3–6 months)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. The study met its primary endpoint demonstrating that addition of berzosertib to gemcitabine increased progression-free survival (PFS, the primary endpoint of the study) compared to gemcitabine alone (HR = 0.57, one-sided log-rank <italic>p</italic> = 0.044), which met the one-sided significance level of 0.1 used for the sample size calculation. Exploratory post-hoc subgroup analyses of PFS showed that the benefit of berzosertib was consistent across various clinical subgroups (including <italic>BRCA</italic>-mutation status and prior PARPi therapy). However, analysis within the two PFI strata (PFI ≤ 3 months vs 3–6 months) demonstrated that the benefit of addition of berzosertib was only present in the PFI ≤ 3 months subgroup. Here, we report the results of preplanned exploratory correlative studies on tumor specimens from study subjects and demonstrate that a genomic biomarker of RS is associated with outcome to gemcitabine alone and may predict which patients benefit from addition of the ATR inhibitor berzosertib.</p>

In this regard, we evaluated patient tumor specimens for the presence of <italic>ATM</italic> mutations via targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) and for loss or reduction of ATM protein expression via immunohistochemistry (IHC). Archival formalin-fixed tumor specimens were available for targeted NGS from 57 of 70 patients (for the remaining 13 patients there was either inadequate tissue or test failure) and for ATM IHC testing from 60 patients (for the remaining 10 patients there was inadequate tissue).</p>
                <p id="Par7">Targeted NGS using our institutional CLIA-certified OncoPanel assay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> showed that only one patient (1.8%) had a tumor with an <italic>ATM</italic> mutation (ATM c.3078-5_3078-4insC), which also exhibited negative ATM protein expression by IHC. This patient was randomized to gemcitabine alone and developed clinical progression after three cycles of therapy. The low frequency of <italic>ATM</italic> mutations in our dataset is consistent with data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) showing that <italic>ATM</italic> mutations are rare in HGSOC (only 1.3% of patients)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.</p>
                <p id="Par8">In the 60 patients with ATM IHC data, ATM IHC demonstrated that 15 (25%) patients had tumors negative for ATM protein expression, 9 (15%) had tumors with low ATM protein expression, and 36 (60%) had tumors considered to have positive/retained ATM expression (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a–d</xref>). There was no difference in ATM protein expression between tumors from patients in the PFI ≤ 3 months versus the PFI 3–6 months strata (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). Overall, the benefit of the addition of berzosertib to gemcitabine was observed across all ATM expression groups (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e, f</xref>) suggesting that ATM expression by IHC was not associated with patients who benefited from addition of berzosertib to gemcitabine.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Correlation of ATM expression via immunohistochemistry (IHC) with benefit of addition of berzosertib to gemcitabine.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Results of ATM IHC presented by PFI strata (PFI ≤ 3 vs 3–6 months). <bold>b</bold> Figure of ATM IHC highlighting a tumor with negative ATM expression. <bold>c</bold> Figure of ATM IHC results highlighting tumor with low ATM expression. <bold>d</bold> Figure of ATM IHC results highlighting tumor with positive ATM expression. <bold>e</bold> Progression-free survival among patients with tumors with negative/low ATM expression. <bold>f</bold> Progression-free survival among patients with tumors with positive (retained) ATM expression.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41467_2021_25904_Fig1_HTML" id="d32e665"/></fig></p>

                <p id="Par10">Here, we assessed three different biomarkers of HRR deficiency: (i) tumor <italic>BRCA1/2</italic> mutation status; (ii) presence of HRR gene mutations by targeted NGS (using our CLIA-certified institutional OncoPanel assay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>); and (iii) presence of mutational signature 3 (Sig3), a specific mutational signature characterized by a high number of larger deletions (up to 50 bp) with overlapping microhomology at breakpoint junctions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Sig3 has been proposed as a biomarker of HRR deficiency reflecting the fact that deficient HRR leads to dependence on alternative error-prone repair mechanisms such as alternative nonhomologous end joining or microhomology-mediated end joining, which utilize microhomology at rearrangement junctions to rejoin and repair DNA double strand breaks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>.</p>
                <p id="Par11">OncoPanel targeted NGS was performed in 57 patient tumor specimens and identified 14 (25%) patients with HRR mutated/altered tumors (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>).

                <p id="Par12">Overall, the benefit of the addition of berzosertib to gemcitabine was observed both among patients with tumors with HRR alterations/mutations and among those with tumors without HRR alterations (Supplement Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Similarly, the benefit of the addition of berzosertib to gemcitabine was observed independently of Sig3 status (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c, d</xref>). Taken together, these data indicate that these biomarkers of HRR deficiency were not associated with benefit of addition of berzosertib to gemcitabine. It is also important to note that although there was a trend that patients in the Sig3-negative subgroup responded better to gemcitabine compared to patients in the Sig3-positive subgroup, this was not significant [HR 1.51 (90% CI 0.72–3.18)], Supplement Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>.

                <p id="Par15">As evident in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>, the RS alterations were spread across tumors without a dominant element, precluding selective statistical analysis of the association of individual RS alterations with berzosertib benefit. Therefore, RS alterations were grouped together, and tumors were assigned into two different groups based on the presence or not of at least one of these genomic RS alterations. Specifically, the first group included patients with tumors with at least one of these RS alterations (defined as RS-high tumors): <italic>CCNE1</italic> amplification, <italic>RB1</italic> two-copy loss, <italic>CDKN2A</italic> two-copy loss, <italic>KRAS</italic> amplification, <italic>NF1</italic> mutations, <italic>ERBB2</italic> amplification, <italic>MYC</italic> amplification, and <italic>MYCL1</italic> amplification (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). The second group included patients with tumors without any of these RS alterations (defined as RS-low tumors). Overall, 30 (53%) tumors were RS-low and 27 tumors (47%) were RS-high; five (19%) of 27 RS-high tumors had more than one RS-associated events. Supplement Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> presents the genomic alterations within the context of patients with RS-high and RS-low tumors. There was no significant difference in the prevalence of RS-low and RS-high tumors between patients in the PFI ≤ 3 months versus the PFI 3–6 months strata (54% of PFI ≤ 3 months and 51% of PFI 3–6 months were RS-low).</p>
                <p id="Par16">A PFS benefit of addition of berzosertib to gemcitabine was observed only in the RS-low tumors (HR = 0.34,90% CI, 0.13–0.86, median PFS 27.7 weeks versus 9.9 weeks; Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b, c</xref>). Furthermore, among RS-low tumors, there was no difference in the benefit of addition of berzosertib between PFI ≤ 3 months and PFI 3–6 months (the PFS benefit of addition of berzosertib was 0.47 (0.13–1.68) in the PFI ≤ 3 months stratum and 0.25 (0.04–1.43) in the PFI 3–6 months). Interestingly, no benefit of addition of berzosertib to gemcitabine was observed in the RS-high tumors (PFS HR = 1.11, 90% CI, 0.47–2.62) suggesting that this genomic biomarker may be an important biological discriminant for benefit of ATR inhibition to gemcitabine, and worthy of future, statistically powered evaluation. Correlation of this biomarker with objective response rate, clinical benefit response rate and PFS at 6 months is presented in Supplement Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>.</p>
                <p id="Par17">Although limited by small numbers, we also performed two separate analyses for the alterations associated with each of the two mechanisms of increased RS, i.e., separately for the alterations associated with loss of RB pathway regulation and separately for the alterations associated with oncogene-induced replication stress. Specifically, when focused only on RS alterations associated with oncogene-induced replication stress, the benefit of addition of berzosertib was again observed only in tumors without any oncogene alterations with a HR 0.49 (90% CI 0.23–1.02), similar with the finding in RS-low tumors, Supplement Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>.

                <p id="Par20">Taken together, these results indicate that patients with RS-high tumors did better with gemcitabine alone (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>) and that for these patients, addition of berzosertib did not appear to provide benefit (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). Conversely, patients with RS-low tumors did worse with gemcitabine alone (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>) and for these patients, addition of berzosertib provided PFS benefit (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). All four PFS curves are also presented in the same Figure as reference (Supplement Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>). Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref> shows a working model highlighting: (i) the better outcome with gemcitabine alone among patients with RS-high tumors (compared to RS-low tumors), and (ii) the benefit of addition of berzosertib to gemcitabine among patients with RS-low tumors. According to this model, gemcitabine, a drug that increases replication stress, has better monotherapy activity against RS-high tumors (left panel) than RS-low tumors (right panel). In RS-high tumors, the exacerbation of replication stress by gemcitabine monotherapy is adequate for lethality. However, in RS-low tumors, the addition of berzosertib-mediated ATR inhibition to gemcitabine is necessary for lethality to occur, explaining why the benefit of addition of berzosertib to gemcitabine is only observed among RS-low tumors.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par21">We report a candidate, previously unrecognized, potentially predictive biomarker of response to gemcitabine monotherapy in HGSOC. Patients with RS-high tumors, defined as harboring at least one genomic RS alteration related to (i) loss of RB pathway regulation (<italic>CCNE1</italic> amplification, <italic>RB1</italic> two-copy loss, <italic>CDKN2A</italic> two-copy loss), and/or (ii) oncogene-induced replication stress (<italic>KRAS</italic> amplification, <italic>NF1</italic> mutations, <italic>ERBB2</italic> amplification, <italic>MYC</italic> amplification and <italic>MYCL1</italic> amplification) achieved significantly prolonged PFS (HR = 0.38) on gemcitabine monotherapy compared to those with tumors without such alterations. Although sensitivity to gemcitabine has been previously associated with specific genomic alterations (such as ARID1A deficiency) in preclinical models, a genomic biomarker has not been previously associated with clinical response to gemcitabine in ovarian cancer or any other malignancy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. The improved response of RS-high tumors is consistent with the mechanism of action of gemcitabine, which induces RS via: incorporation of gemcitabine nucleotides into the DNA and by inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Conceptually, RS-high tumors are less likely to tolerate the increased RS induced by gemcitabine compared to RS-low tumors and are therefore more likely to respond (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>).</p>
              <p id="Par22">Evaluation of the association of response to gemcitabine with markers of HRR deficiency revealed a nonsignificant trend that patients in the Sig3-negative subgroup (reflective of HRR proficient tumors) responded better to gemcitabine compared to patients in the Sig3-positive subgroup (reflective of HRR-deficient tumors), Supplement Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>. This observation is consistent with available literature in ovarian cancer suggesting that response to gemcitabine is at least equal (or even better) in patients with platinum-resistant disease (a setting enriched for HRR proficient tumors) compared to platinum sensitive disease (a setting enriched for HRR-deficient tumors)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par23">While patients with RS-high tumors fared better with gemcitabine alone (compared to RS-low), only patients with RS-low tumors benefited from addition of the ATR inhibitor berzosertib to gemcitabine (gemcitabine/berzosertib HR compared to gemcitabine was 0.34 in RS-low vs 1.11 in RS-high tumors). This finding appears counterintuitive as patients with RS-high tumors would have been expected to derive more benefit from ATR inhibitor therapy (given the implication of ATR kinase in regulation of the RS response). However, our study did not explore which patients benefit the most from berzosertib monotherapy (there was no berzosertib monotherapy arm in the clinical trial); rather, our study explored which patients benefited the most from the addition of berzosertib to gemcitabine. Given that gemcitabine monotherapy exhibited poor activity against RS-low tumors and given the known synergism between gemcitabine and ATR inhibitor therapy, it is not surprising that it was patients with RS-low tumors that benefited the most from addition of berzosertib. Conversely, for patients with RS-high tumors who fared significantly better with gemcitabine alone, addition of berzosertib did not appear to provide benefit. Importantly, the benefit of addition of berzosertib in patients with RS-low tumors was seen in both PFI (PFI ≤ 3 months and 3–6 months) strata, including the PFI 3–6 months stratum, where in the overall analysis of all patients, the benefit of addition of berzosertib was not present<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par24">It is important to note that alternative biomarkers of RS have also been reported in the literature for other tumor types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a unique signature of Cyclin A2 or E1 activating alterations associated with an aggressive HCC subtype and characterized by structural rearrangements with hundreds of tandem duplications and templated insertions frequently activating the TERT promoter has been reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. A similar signature is present in ovarian cancer but solely in <italic>BRCA1</italic>-mutated tumors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. In pancreatic cancer, a transcriptomic signature of replication stress that predicts response to ATR and WEE1 inhibitors has been reported, which, similar to our findings, was not associated with homologous recombination deficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. However, development of this transcriptomic signature was based solely on preclinical models of patient derived cell lines and organoid models without any human response data.</p>
              <p id="Par25">No other biomarker including ATM aberrations (ATM protein expression loss and/or <italic>ATM</italic> deleterious mutations) and HRR deficiency (<italic>BRCA1/2</italic> mutations, HRR alterations and presence of Sig3) could predict benefit from addition of berzosertib to gemcitabine. These biomarkers have been associated with response to ATRi monotherapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> but our study could not evaluate this association as there was no berzosertib monotherapy arm. Furthermore, these biomarkers could not predict response to gemcitabine monotherapy. Our study confirmed that <italic>ATM</italic> mutations are rare in HGSOC (&lt;2%); however, loss of ATM expression was not uncommon, with 25% and 15% of tumors being negative and low for ATM protein expression by IHC, respectively. Consistent with previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, Sig3 positivity was identified in a larger proportion of tumors (40% of samples) than positivity for <italic>BRCA</italic>1/2 mutations and HRR alterations, suggesting that Sig3 may identify HRR-deficient (HRD) tumors beyond BRCA/HRR alterations. However, it is important to underscore that the ability of HRD assays to predict deficient homologous recombination in the setting of platinum- and PARPi-resistant ovarian cancer is limited by the fact that tumors predicted to be HRD may have restored HRR as a mechanism of resistance driven by selection pressure from prior platinum and/or PARPi therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par26">We acknowledge certain limitations of this study. The sample size was small, as this trial was a hypothesis-generating study powered to detect an improvement in median progression-free survival at a one-sided significance level of 0.1. The candidate predictive biomarker we identified is exploratory and hypothesis-generating on which to base future studies and will require independent validation in subsequent studies of gemcitabine with and without ATRi therapy. In this regard, a randomized phase 2/3 study of gemcitabine with or without berzosertib with prospective validation of this biomarker is being planned. Samples were collected from patients enrolled in 11 different study sites in the United States, and, despite our best efforts, insufficient tumor material was available for all patients for completion of all correlative studies. These limitations notwithstanding, our hypothesis-generating findings are interesting because they challenge the notion that ATR inhibitor therapy should only be considered for tumors with high replication stress. In fact, for tumors with low replication stress, a strategy of combining ATR inhibitors with agents that induce replication stress (such as gemcitabine) and therefore sensitize to ATR inhibition may be particularly appealing and, when compared to gemcitabine alone, may provide greater benefit among RS-low tumors (where single agent gemcitabine has low activity). Furthermore, the proposed genomic biomarker is mechanistically relevant, developed using our CLIA-certified targeted NGS assay and, assuming it is independently validated, may be readily applicable to clinical practice. Our study highlights that careful analysis of genomic information from clinical samples can provide valuable information on the determinants of response to therapy and may accelerate the development of predictive biomarkers to aid in patient stratification.</p>

Targeted panel NGS was performed on FFPE tissue samples using OncoPanel, a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certified assay performed at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI). The Oncopanel test consists of NGS of formalin-fixed tumor samples covering exons of 447 cancer-associated genes plus intronic regions of genes involved in somatic rearrangements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>.
