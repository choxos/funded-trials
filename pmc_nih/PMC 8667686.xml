                  <title>Purpose:</title>
                  <p>CD40 activation is a novel clinical opportunity for cancer immunotherapy. Despite numerous active clinical trials with agonistic CD40 monoclonal antibodies (mAb), biological effects and treatment-related modulation of the tumor microenvironment (TME) remain poorly understood.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Patients and Methods:</title>
                  <p>Here, we performed a neoadjuvant clinical trial of agonistic CD40 mAb (selicrelumab) administered intravenously with or without chemotherapy to 16 patients with resectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) before surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy and CD40 mAb.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results:</title>
                  <p>The toxicity profile was acceptable, and overall survival was 23.4 months (95% confidence interval, 18.0–28.8 months). Based on a novel multiplexed immunohistochemistry platform, we report evidence that neoadjuvant selicrelumab leads to major differences in the TME compared with resection specimens from treatment-naïve PDAC patients or patients given neoadjuvant chemotherapy/chemoradiotherapy only. For selicrelumab-treated tumors, 82% were T-cell enriched, compared with 37% of untreated tumors (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.004) and 23% of chemotherapy/chemoradiation-treated tumors (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.012). T cells in both the TME and circulation were more active and proliferative after selicrelumab. Tumor fibrosis was reduced, M2-like tumor-associated macrophages were fewer, and intratumoral dendritic cells were more mature. Inflammatory cytokines/sec CXCL10 and CCL22 increased systemically after selicrelumab.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions:</title>
                  <p>This unparalleled examination of CD40 mAb therapeutic mechanisms in patients provides insights for design of subsequent clinical trials targeting CD40 in cancer.</p>

              <p>Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly treatment-refractory disease, with fewer than 1% of patients responding to current immunotherapeutic interventions, highlighting the need for novel approaches for improved clinical outcomes. Here we report for the first time in humans an in-depth analysis of the tumor site after neoadjuvant agonistic CD40 monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapy. The PDAC tumor site after CD40 mAb displayed a T-cell–enriched phenotype with concomitant increases in dendritic cells and reeducated macrophages, and a depletion of tumor stroma. These alterations in the tumor site were associated with systemic T-cell activation and clonal expansion in the periphery. Together, these data provide novel, proof-of-concept evidence regarding the mechanisms of agonistic CD40 mAb use in the clinical setting and inform next-generation agonistic CD40 clinical trials, especially for patients with PDAC.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>CD40 is a cell-surface member of the tumor necrosis factor superfamily of receptors that functions as a proximal regulator of myeloid cell function and adaptive immunity. Agonistic CD40 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) are under active clinical investigation as novel agents for immune activation and cancer immunotherapy, distinct from immune-checkpoint blockade (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Mechanistically, and largely based on preclinical cancer models, agonistic CD40 mAb activates various effector functions in CD40<sup>+</sup> macrophages, B cells, and dendritic cells (DC)—mimicking CD40 cross-linking and activation by CD40 ligand (CD154) on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and driving antitumor CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell immunity (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). In preclinical models, delivering agonist CD40 mAb activates DCs, induces Th1 cytokines such as IL12, and reeducates tumor-associated macrophages toward an M1-like phenotype with capacity to degrade tumor stroma (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3, 4</xref>). As such, CD40 activation represents a unique pathway for bridging DC activation and adaptive immunity in cancer independently of innate immune receptors (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). CD40 mAbs synergize with chemotherapy and radiotherapy and sensitize tumors otherwise refractory to treatment with anti–CTLA-4 or anti–PD-1/PD-L1 mAb (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6, 7</xref>). In particular, extensive studies in genetically engineered pancreatic cancer mouse models with low tumor mutational burden demonstrate that CD40 mAb in combination with chemotherapy renders tumors susceptible to T-cell–dependent destruction and potentiates durable remissions (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p>
              <p>Multiple single-agent and combination studies of CD40 mAb in cancer have been developed around an emerging array of agonistic antibody formulations (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Promising rates of objective clinical responses have been reported, and manageable and feasible outpatient dosing schedules have been established for use in phase II studies. Toxicities have been mild to moderate, including transient cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and transient alterations in hematologic and liver function tests. Clinical data demonstrate potential efficacy of CD40 mAb and chemotherapy in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC; refs. <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3, 8</xref>). In a phase Ib study of the CD40 mAb APX005M with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel with or without anti–PD-1 nivolumab, objective responses were observed in 58% of patients with newly diagnosed metastatic PDAC (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p>
              <p>Biological effects of CD40 activation in patients—especially with respect to modulation of the tumor microenvironment (TME) and T-cell infiltration, as predicted in preclinical models—remain poorly understood because, to date, clinical trials with CD40 mAb have minimally studied patient tumor samples, hampered by poor yield and low cellularity common with such biopsy fragments. Here, we performed a clinical trial of the CD40 mAb selicrelumab (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10, 11</xref>) with or without chemotherapy given in both the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings for patients with resectable PDAC. Application of a curated antibody panel by multiplexed IHC (mIHC) on resection samples revealed major alterations in the TME of patients receiving selicrelumab compared with samples from therapy-naïve control PDAC patients (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Marked T-cell infiltration in the TME after selicrelumab was associated with loss of stroma, systemic inflammation, and T-cell activation. This study provides proof-of-concept regarding the mechanisms of agonistic CD40 mAb in cancer and informs the design of next-generation CD40 mAb clinical trials.</p>

                <p>An open-label, phase I clinical trial (Cancer Immunotherapy Trials Network CITN11-01; NCT02588443) at four sites in the United States was conducted to determine if adding the agonist anti-CD40 fully human IgG2 mAb selicrelumab (RG7876, previously known as CP-870,893; ref. <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) to a standard chemotherapy regimen of gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel both before and after surgery was feasible, safe and beneficial to patients with resectable PDAC. Primary objectives were to determine the feasibility and safety, and secondary objectives were to estimate disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS), and to assess immune biomarkers in blood and surgical specimens.

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p>For the clinical trial, baseline demographics and the clinical outcomes were summarized with descriptive statistics. To assess the hypothesis that the feasibility rate was 50%, the binomial probability of the observed feasibility rate was computed by combining the two arms, as described in Supplementary Data and Methods. For DFS and OS, median and 95% confidence intervals plus 1-year rates ± SE were estimated by the Kaplan–Meier method. The degree of intratumoral fibrosis was compared between experimental and untreated samples by the Mann–Whitney rank test. Statistical considerations for mIHC analysis have been recently reported (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). For global TME analyses, a linear mixed-effect model was used, with treatment group as between-group factor and ROI location as within-group factor. Prior to applying the mixed-effect model, the data were transformed using logarithmic function with base 10. The Bayesian Information Criteria was used to assess within subject covariance structure. The Tukey multiple comparison correction was used to control overall type I error. Differences in TME cluster types between experimental and untreated samples were tested with Fisher exact test (2 × 3 contingency table). For intratumoral analyses, Kruskal–Wallis nonparametric one-way ANOVA was used with Dunn multiple comparisons correction. The Wilcoxon matched-pair signed-rank test was used to assess paired differences (i.e., change from baseline, protocol day 0; to day 5 after selicrelumab, protocol day 8) measured by mass cytometry or cytokine quantification. Statistical analyses were performed using STATA v.16 (StataCorp), IBM SPSS v.26, or GraphPad Prism v7 (GraphPad Prism Software, Inc.). <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p>

                <p>Sixteen patients with resectable PDAC initiated neoadjuvant therapy with either (i) selicrelumab (0.2 mg/kg i.v.) two weeks prior to surgery (arm I, <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 11) or (ii) gemcitabine (1,000 mg/m<sup>2</sup> i.v.) and nab-paclitaxel (125 mg/m<sup>2</sup> i.v.) followed 2 days later by selicrelumab prior to surgery (arm II, <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 5; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The CONSORT diagram for screening and enrollment is provided (Supplementary Fig. S1). Enrollment to arm II was allowed when safety was established for arm I, as detailed in Supplementary Data and Methods. Thirteen patients (9 on arm I and 4 on arm II) were able to initiate adjuvant therapy with gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel followed by selicrelumab with up to four 28-day cycles (gemcitabine 1,000 mg/m<sup>2</sup> i.v. on days 1, 8, 15; nab-paclitaxel 125 mg/m<sup>2</sup> i.v. on days 1, 8, 15; selicrelumab 0.2 mg/kg i.v. on day 3). The sequence of chemotherapy and selicrelumab was based on preclinical (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4, 18</xref>) and clinical studies (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Arm II was closed to enrollment short of goal when no new patient was enrolled for a year. Based on DNA sequencing, the mutational profile of the resected tumors represented a typical picture of PDAC with frequent KRAS mutations and common mutations in TP53 and CDKN2A; one tumor had a pathologic mutation in BRCA2; no patient's tumor met the definition of MSI-high.</p>

There was a single occurrence each of grade 3 hyperglycemia and elevated liver function tests (AST and ALT). Grade 2 AE included diarrhea, fatigue, headache, hypertension rash, and rigors. There were no serious adverse events (SAE) with neoadjuvant therapy. AEs attributed to selicrelumab adjuvant therapy were grade 3 fatigue (2 patients), hypertension, elevated AST/ALT, and thrombocytopenia (1 patient each); and grade 4 pancreatitis (1 patient; Supplementary Table S1). Six patients experienced grade 2 CRS. There were three SAEs in two patients: elevated AST/ALT and pancreatitis in a single patient attributed to selicrelumab, and fever in a second patient attributed to both selicrelumab and chemotherapy.

At either last contact or the time of database lock (i.e., May 10, 2019), 8 patients were alive at a median of 20.0 months after surgery (follow-up range, 12.2–34.8 months). Survival estimates were imprecise due to small sample sizes, but these survival rates are on par with a cohort of patients receiving no neoadjuvant intervention or a cohort of patients receiving a neoadjuvant chemo- or chemoradiation therapy, as shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref> (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p>

This mIHC platform is a chromogen-based iterative staining method utilizing a curated panel of antibodies followed by a computational pipeline culminating in single-cell hierarchical gating to identify lymphoid and myeloid immune lineages, as described previously (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15, 17</xref>) and summarized in Supplementary Fig. S2. Importantly, ROIs were selected following pathologic annotation and categorized as tumor (T), tumor adjacent stroma (TAS), adjacent normal pancreas tissue (AN), or tertiary lymphoid structure (TLS) ROIs. Further, the location of each ROI was recorded as related to the pathologists' tumor annotation (intratumoral, border, spanning, and distal) to allow for spatial characterization of immune infiltrates (defined in Supplementary Fig. S2, with ROI features summarized in Supplementary Table S3). A recent study by Liudahl and colleagues utilized mIHC to characterize PDAC immune ecosystems, a phenotypic and spatial immune atlas was constructed following assessment of 104 treatment-naïve and 13 neoadjuvant chemo/chemoradiation-treated PDAC resection samples (DFCI/BWH and OHSU, mean time to surgery after start of neoadjuvant therapy of 188 days), providing comparative analyses for our neoadjuvant study (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p>
                <p>We then applied the immune atlas from Liudahl study to our patient samples. We first analyzed “globally” across the samples, and multiple ROI types (T, TAS, AN, and TLS) were quantitatively evaluated.

                <p>We next assessed how immune infiltrates were affected by either treatment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>) and/or spatial localization (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>) and generated a statistical mixed-effects model to understand the two variables in combination (Supplementary Table S4). In terms of spatial localization in the TME, there were significant differences in total CD45<sup>+</sup> cell density regardless of the treatment group—greater in distal locations as compared with intratumoral (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.0001), and greater in border locations compared with either intratumoral (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.0001) or spanning regions (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.016). This effect was linked to B cells, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells as these cell populations were largely excluded from intratumoral and spanning locations, whereas myeloid cells (including monocytes/macrophages or neutrophils/eosinophils) were not differentially distributed by spatial location (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">C</xref>; Supplementary Table S4). Statistically significant treatment effects were observed overall for densities of mature DC, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>; Supplementary Table S3). Mature DC density was greater in selicrelumab-treated tumors compared with either untreated tumors (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.001) or chemo/chemoradiation-treated tumors (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.001). CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell density was similarly greater in both selicrelumab or selicrelumab/chemotherapy tumors compared with either untreated tumors or chemo/chemoradiation-treated tumors (adjusted <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> values shown in Supplementary Table S4, ranging from 0.003 to 0.015)—an effect appreciated in every spatial location (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). Treatment effects on CD8<sup>+</sup> cell density were most notable in comparing chemo/chemoradiation to selicrelumab/chemotherapy-treated tumors that approached statistical significance, and was best appreciated in distal and border areas rather than spanning or intratumoral areas (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). Of all ROI locations and treatments examined, the highest density of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells was observed in the distal region of selicrelumab and border region of selicrelumab/chemotherapy-treated tumors.</p>
                <p>To understand leukocyte identity in closest proximity to neoplastic cells, we then applied unsupervised hierarchical clustering on histopathologically defined tumor regions studied from all patients and treatment groups (<italic toggle="yes">N</italic> = 128 total samples). Three unique clusters based on the dominant immune infiltrates emerged: granulocyte-enriched (22% of samples, 28/128), T-cell–enriched (39%, 50/128) and myeloid-enriched (39%, 50/128; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>; Supplementary Fig. S3). Analysis of the cluster groups revealed that the T-cell–enriched cluster contained significantly reduced granulocytes and significantly greater abundance of total CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells than the other clusters (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). For 11 tumors resected after selicrelumab, 82% (9/11) were T-cell–enriched, compared with 37% (38/104) of untreated tumors (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.004) and 23% (3/13) of chemotherapy/chemoradiation-treated tumors (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.012). One selicrelumab-treated tumor from arm I was granulocytic-enriched and one was myeloid-enriched. Thus, tumors from patients treated with selicrelumab prior to surgery, with or without chemotherapy, were more likely to be classified as T-cell–enriched PDAC than untreated tumors or those treated with chemotherapy/chemoradiotherapy.</p>
                <p>We then further focused on immune infiltrates within pathologically defined tumor ROIs and compared directly across treatment groups (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">G</xref>; Supplementary Fig. S3). CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were increased in abundance in both selicrelumab groups when compared with untreated or chemo/chemoradiation groups, and nearly reached statistical significance, as did the ratios of mature/immature DCs and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells/CD68<sup>+</sup> monocytes/macrophages (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>; Supplementary Fig. S3B). To measure monocyte/macrophage effector phenotype reflecting alternatively activated M2-like status, we examined CD163 expression (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) and found the ratio of CD163<sup>−</sup> to CD163<sup>+</sup> monocytes/macrophages to be significantly less in chemo/chemoradiation and greater with selicrelumab treatment, thus indicating “skewing” toward more M2-like with chemo/chemoradiation and reduction in M2-like skewing with selicrelumab therapy (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>; Supplementary Fig. S3B).</p>
                <p>Finally, we sought evidence for T-cell functionality by mIHC, as measured by expression of effector molecules (PD-1, granzyme B) or the proliferation marker Ki67. We observed statistically significant greater positivity of PD-1<sup>+</sup> cells among both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell subsets in selicrelumab-treated tumors, indicative of recent activation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref>). In CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, this was concordant with greater granzyme B positivity, which approached statistical significance, and a statistically significant increase in Ki67<sup>+</sup> cells among CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, indicative of cytotoxic activity and population expansion, central to effective antitumor T-cell responses.</p>

                <title>Systemic inflammation and immune cell activation</title>
                <p>To understand immune activation following treatment, we measured 42 cytokines in the serum at baseline and compared levels with those measured on protocol day 8, corresponding to 5 days after neoadjuvant selicrelumab. Pooling patients from arm I and II together, 15 cytokines exhibited a mean fold change greater than 1.0, with two—CCL22 and CXCL10—significantly upregulated (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>; Supplementary Fig. S4A). CCL22 is upregulated during inflammation, secreted by DCs, and mediates crucial DC:Treg interactions. CXCL10 is secreted by several cell types in response to IFNγ and is a chemoattractant for myeloid cells, T cells, and dendritic cells. For 13 cytokines with a fold change below 1.0, CCL11 was significantly less than baseline and IL4 was less, approaching statistical significance (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>; Supplementary Fig. S4B). CCL11 and IL4 are both soluble factors linked to myeloid accumulation and Th2 immunity. The remaining 14 analytes, including IFNγ and IL12p70, were unchanged with treatment at this time point.</p>

                <title>Assessing T-cell clonality across treatment course with selicrelumab</title>
                <p>TCR deep sequencing was performed on 15 surgical samples from the clinical trial as well as on peripheral blood T cells from those patients obtained at baseline and serially after surgery through the end of study. Using TCRβ sequencing of tumor samples, we observed an average of 17,803 unique TCR clones in the TME (“tumor clones”; median 7,652; range, 1,528–69,237; <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>). For each patient, we then gated on the set of tumor clones and quantified this population in peripheral blood at baseline (prior to neoadjuvant selicrelumab) and/or at multiple time points after surgery and during the adjuvant selicrelumab/chemotherapy phase of the study (starting at cycle 1 day 1 or “C1D1”). These selection criteria thus narrow in on tumor-associated T-cell clones that may have been enriched as a result of selicrelumab treatment during either the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting. The mean number of post-surgical time points was 5.3 ± 2.7 (mean ± SD, median 4, range, 1–12; 3 patients did not have post-surgical blood samples; <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>). To assess the overlap of clones detected in the tumor site across the blood samples within each patient sample set, including baseline and post-surgery, we calculated the Jaccard coefficient for all tumor-associated clones at all time points (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>). The Jaccard coefficient measures similarity between finite sample sets, defined as the size of the intersection divided by the size of the union of the sample sets such that a value of 1 means identical and 0 means no similarity.

                <p>Pooling across the 15 patients examined, we found that 54.4% of all tumor clones were only ever identified in the tumor, not in blood (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>). Of the 15 patients examined, 3 patients had no post-surgical blood samples for follow-up, and for the remaining 12 patients, we found that only 9.9% of tumor clones were identified in baseline blood and never again in blood after surgery. In contrast, 24.3% of tumor clones were found in at least one blood sample after surgery, and 20.3% of tumor-associated clones were only found in post-surgery blood. Tumor clones undetected in blood at baseline but evident after surgery may include new tumor-specific clones induced following therapy with selicrelumab. Notably, for total tumor clones found only after surgery, 10.1% were found in two or more blood samples from the same patient and 0.73% of such tumor clones were found in every post-surgery time point—up to 12 post-surgery samples in some patients. For patients with two or more post-surgical blood samples (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 11), a mean of 159 tumor clones were found consistently in every post-surgery blood sample (±SD 399 clones, range, 6–1,350 clones). For each of these tumor clones that were detected in every post-surgical sample, we determined the maximum frequency and the time point at which the maximum was achieved. For all patients and all tumor clones detected in every post-surgical sample, the average maximum frequency in the blood was 62.5 templates (SEM ± 53.3, median 42, range, 9–147). The most common time points of maximal frequency were cycle 2 day 1 and cycle 3 day 1, with a range from cycle 1 day 15 to end of study.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Agonist CD40 mAbs are being pursued as a novel strategy for cancer immunotherapy based on the hypothesis from preclinical models that systemic CD40 activation activates cross-presenting DCs, reeducates tumor macrophages, and triggers antitumor T-cell immune responses (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Corroborating data in patients treated with agonist CD40 mAb have been lacking. Here, we conducted a phase I clinical trial involving neoadjuvant and adjuvant CD40 mAb selicrelumab in patients with resectable PDAC and analyzed biosamples for evidence of treatment-induced modulation of the TME and systemic T-cell activation. Compared with untreated controls, surgical samples from patients receiving selicrelumab preoperatively exhibited less tumor fibrosis and greater likelihood of T-cell enrichment. Greater maturation of intratumoral DCs and fewer M2-like tumor-associated macrophages were also observed in selicrelumab-treated tumors than controls. In the periphery, increased activation and proliferation of CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and elevations of serum inflammatory cytokines were observed after selicrelumab treatment. Thus, consistent with mechanisms surmised from mouse models of pancreatic cancer but not previously demonstrated in humans, agonistic CD40 mAb alters the PDAC TME in patients, enhances T-cell infiltration and activation, and modulates inflammatory cytokines. These results suggest a novel mechanistic approach for immunotherapy of this and other tumors—potentially additive, not redundant, with checkpoint blockade.</p>
              <p>A key to these findings was the application of a quantitative chromogen-based multiplexed IHC platform with computational image processing allowing simultaneous evaluation of 21 biomarkers in one FFPE tissue section (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15, 16</xref>). In the recently published study by Liudahl and colleagues, in which the mIHC platform was applied to 104 resection samples from treatment-naïve PDAC patients, a reference atlas of subtypes of tumor immune microenvironments was constructed for this disease (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). With the ability to look across many ROIs in large surgical resections, the mIHC platform revealed intratumoral and intertumoral heterogeneity across a far wider area of the TME than is typically represented in small pieces of biopsy tissue. Importantly, this mIHC platform critically provides fine spatial information and addresses a limitation of single-cell analyses (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21, 22</xref>).</p>
              <p>By applying hierarchical clustering, we observed that 82% of PDAC tumors resected after selicrelumab were classified as T-cell–enriched, as compared with 36% T-cell–enriched tumors from treatment-naïve patients (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.004) and 23% of such tumors in patients given only chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.012). Thus, it was 2–3 times more likely for a selicrelumab-treated tumor to be T-cell–enriched than other tumors. Our findings indicate that a single dose of selicrelumab with or without chemotherapy converts T-cell–low PDAC tumors to T-cell–high (i.e., “cold” to “hot”). The conversion may be important because in mice, T-cell–high PDAC tumors are sensitive to CD40/checkpoint-based immunotherapy, whereas T-cell–low tumors are not (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). The greater PD-1-positivity observed on CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the TME after selicrelumab implies potential further clinical synergy via PD-1-blockade.</p>
              <p>Our data also provide evidence for systemic T-cell activation. In the 5 days after selicrelumab (protocol day 8), we observed increased markers of activation/exhaustion and proliferation of circulating CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Although our analyses indicated robust pharmacodynamic effects on immune cells after selicrelumab treatment, it is possible that additional interventions may further potentiate the impact of agonistic CD40 therapy. Without a common or well-defined tumor antigen in PDAC to study, we utilized TCR deep sequencing to track T-cell clonal expansion and persistence. We focused on TCR clones identified in the resection sample (we called these “tumor clones”) hypothesizing based on prior studies (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24, 25</xref>) that this subpopulation might be enriched for tumor-specific T cells, at least as compared with whole peripheral blood. We were able to identify a small population of TCR clones, not detectable in the blood at baseline, but evident and persistent in the blood at multiple time points during adjuvant therapy. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that selicrelumab (with or without chemotherapy) can drive expansion of new, clonal T-cell responses. These data are also consistent with TCR deep sequencing studies in transgenic mouse models of PDAC for which CD40 mAb, with or without gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel (but not with chemotherapy alone) led to expansion of certain T-cell clones and recruitment of new populations of rare clones to the TME (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p>
              <p>A key hypothesis underlying the mechanism of action of CD40 agonists is the activation and licensing of DCs, a cell increasingly appreciated to be dysfunctional in cancer. In pancreatic cancer, in both mice and patients, DC dysfunction presents as an early, systemic, and progressive vulnerability—although this is clearly reversible <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> in mouse models using CD40 mAb or CD40 mAb with Flt3 ligand (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26, 27</xref>). DC dysfunction is not repaired with checkpoint therapy (targeting PD-1, PD-L1, or CTLA-4) alone. Here, we examined the rare DC population in the PDAC TME and found that density of mature DC was greater in the selicrelumab-treated tumors compared with either untreated tumors or chemo/chemoradiation-treated tumors. In intratumoral spatial locations, the ratio of mature/immature DCs was increased in both selicrelumab groups as compared with untreated or chemo/chemoradiation groups. In peripheral blood after selicrelumab, there was a greater percentage of CD141-expressing DCs that are critical in priming antitumor immunity (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). These DC exhibited a trend toward increased expression of HLA-DR. It is important to note that this study did not include procurement of any biosamples sooner than 5 days after selicrelumab, which is likely beyond the window of maximal pharmacodynamic response to CD40 mAb. Prior human and mice studies indicate the peak effect of CD40 mAb on APC is 24–72 hours after i.v. administration (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4, 11, 19, 29</xref>). This likely also explains why certain cytokines such as IL12 were not found to be increased in the serum of patients 5 days after treatment with selicrelumab (protocol day 8), suggesting that earlier time points may better capture systemic cytokine release.</p>
              <p>Monocyte/macrophages were also altered in patients treated with selicrelumab. Based on hierarchical clustering, 50 of all 128 tumor samples here were classified as myeloid-enriched based on the mIHC platform results; however, none of the selicrelumab tumors and only one of the selicrelumab/chemotherapy tumors fell within the category. Intratumorally, the ratio of CD163<sup>−</sup> to CD163<sup>+</sup> monocytes/macrophages was significantly greater in selicrelumab-treated tumors. In the periphery, CD163<sup>−</sup> (M1-like) CD11b<sup>+</sup> CD68<sup>+</sup> myeloid cells were increased after selicrelumab treatment, and CD163<sup>+</sup> (M2-like) cells CD11b<sup>+</sup> CD68<sup>+</sup> myeloid cells were significantly reduced after treatment, with lower expression of HLA-DR. These findings are consistent with reeducation away from an M2-like phenotype—and consistent with predictions from PDAC genetically engineered mice treated with CD40 mAb (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3, 4</xref>).</p>
              <p>We also observed less fibrosis and desmoplastic stroma in tumors treated with selicrelumab compared with untreated tumors, reproducing the phenotype observed in spontaneous KPC tumors after a single dose of agonist anti-mouse CD40 mAb (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3, 4</xref>). This alteration in tumor stroma leads to transient tumor regressions in KPC mice, even in the absence of T cells, with a mechanism of action dependent on macrophage reeducation by CD40 activation and upregulation of metalloproteinases. Delivering chemotherapy 5 days after CD40 mAb in KPC mice—at a time of tumor stroma disruption—permits better chemotherapy delivery and subsequent tumor killing (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) and represents an important nonimmune mechanism of action of agonist CD40 mAb. In the adjuvant setting in the clinical trial here, chemotherapy was given 5 days after each dose of selicrelumab in part for this purpose. Whether fibrosis in PDAC patients after neoadjuvant therapy correlates with clinical outcome—and whether all “fibrosis” seen on resection samples reflects the same underlying biology—remains to be determined. A recent paper, for example, shows that higher fibrosis after neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy is associated with higher overall and DFS (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). The Erstad and colleagues study, however, focused exclusively on patients receiving FOLFIRINOX (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), whereas our study involved gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel, limiting comparisons to this study.</p>
              <p>Our results support strategies to incorporate CD40 activation into the armamentarium of cancer immunotherapy. Multiple agonist CD40 mAbs in addition to selicrelumab are under active clinical investigation, many of which differ in structure and function (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Here, we report an acceptable safety profile, as expected from previous studies with this dose of selicrelumab given i.v. With the small sample size, it is difficult to compare DFS and OS to prior studies, although each is at least as good as historically documented for patients with R0 or R1 resections and adjuvant chemotherapy (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). It is encouraging that all patients on arm II remain alive between 12 and 18 months, although the sample size is small. We have used caution and avoided stating any correlations between clinical outcomes and biomarker data given the small number of patients. Pharmacodynamic assessments of treatment effects independent of clinical outcome, however, were robust, statistically significant and provide insights into mechanisms of action.</p>
              <p>In comparison with other CD40 clinical trials, most notable are results from a phase Ib study (NCT03214250) with the agonist CD40 mAb sotigalimab—with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel, with or without nivolumab—that demonstrate clinical promise and an acceptable safety profile in patients with newly diagnosed metastatic PDAC. In this study (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), objective responses were documented in 14 of 24 DLT-evaluable patients [58%; 95% confidence interval (CI), 37–78). Median progression-free survival was 11.7 months (95% CI, 7.1–17.8) and median OS was 20.1 months (95% CI, 10.5–not estimable)—highly encouraging results compared with prior studies of gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel alone. This approach is now being tested further in a national, randomized phase II clinical trial (NCT03214250).</p>
              <p>In summary, using a neoadjuvant trial design and novel multiplexed tissue biomarker assays, we present the first evidence in humans that agonist CD40 mAb modulates the PDAC TME, decreases density of tumor stroma, activates DC, reeducates macrophages, and increases infiltration T cells with heighted activation and proliferation status. These changes in the TME are concomitant with observations of T-cell activation and clonal expansion in the periphery. As an immunotherapeutic approach distinct biologically and mechanistically from checkpoint blockade, CD40 activation addresses unmet challenges in cancer immunobiology and may provide novel, effective strategies for tumors relapsed or refractory to currently available immunotherapy.</p>
