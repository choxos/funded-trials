                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Participants were a national probability sample of 623 US adolescents aged 13–17 years, recruited in the summer of 2020. Adolescents were randomized to one of the five warning message themes about the potential health effects of vaping: 1. chemical harms, 2. lung harms, 3. Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) harms, 4. nicotine addiction, or 5. control (messages about vape litter). The primary outcome was perceived message effectiveness (PME; 3-item scale). Secondary outcomes were negative affect (fear), attention, anticipated social interactions, and message novelty.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Adolescents rated the chemical, lung, and COVID-19 harms warning messages higher on PME than nicotine addiction and control (all <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; .05), while nicotine addiction was rated higher than control (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; .05). The chemical, lung, and COVID-19 harms warning themes also elicited greater negative affect than nicotine addiction and control (all <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; .05). For all other secondary outcomes, the COVID-19 harms warning message theme was rated higher than nicotine addiction and control (all <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; .05).</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Although vaping among youth in the United States has declined in recent years, national estimates suggest one in ten high schoolers currently vape,<sup><xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> and vaping frequency among current youth vapers remains high.<sup><xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Vaping can pose a threat to adolescent health because the e-liquids from many vaping devices contain nicotine,<sup><xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> which increases the risk of nicotine addiction.<sup><xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Another concern is that vaping devices may expose users to toxic chemicals (eg, formaldehyde, acrolein) that have the potential for respiratory harm.<sup><xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Lastly, some studies have suggested that vaping may lead to other harmful substance use behaviors, including combustible cigarette smoking and alcohol use;<sup><xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7–9</xref></sup> though, the evidence from these investigations is limited by potential confounders.</p>
              <p>Communicating about the harms of vaping—through product warnings and communication campaigns—should be a key part of a comprehensive strategy to prevent vaping among adolescents, particularly those who may be susceptible to or current e-cigarette users.<sup><xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10–12</xref></sup> Recent data from the US National Youth Tobacco Survey found that adolescents who had ever used e-cigarettes and who self-reported high exposure to vaping warnings were more likely to perceive even occasional use of e-cigarettes as harmful.<sup><xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> In addition, among those who had never vaped, exposure to vaping warning messages reduced adolescents’ likelihood of choosing e-cigarette products in a discrete choice experiment.<sup><xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Currently, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires only a single warning on commercial vaping products sold in the United States, which focuses on how e-cigarette products contain nicotine, an addictive chemical.<sup><xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> While these warnings may benefit adult smokers seeking alternatives to traditional cigarettes, warnings about addiction may have a limited impact on youth, as vaping-related harms and hazards (eg, chemical exposure, respiratory damage) may be more effective themes to discourage vaping compared to warning themes about nicotine.<sup><xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16–18</xref></sup></p>
              <p>In addition, studies have shown that exposure to the FDA’s <italic toggle="yes">The Real Cost</italic> vaping prevention advertisements increases negative attitudes and risk beliefs about vaping among youth.<sup><xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> While <italic toggle="yes">The Real Cost</italic> vaping prevention campaign has focused on both addiction and the health harms of vaping, little is known about the relative efficacy of these and other themes in the context of adolescent vaping prevention campaigns.</p>
              <p>Finally, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may present an opportunity to develop impactful and timely adolescent vaping warning messages. For example, it is possible that some of the respiratory effects associated with vaping<sup><xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> could result in more severe cases of COVID-19 among adolescents who vape. For instance, a recent study found that ever use of e-cigarettes and dual use of cigarettes and e-cigarettes may increase adolescents’ likelihood of contracting COVID-19 and developing symptoms,<sup><xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> respectively, although the findings from this study have since been questioned.<sup><xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23–26</xref></sup> While the relationship between vaping and COVID-19 currently remains unclear, it is useful to test messages about vaping and COVID-19 while the science on this issue develops.<sup><xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup></p>
              <p>To date, most of the literature about the effects of vaping warning messages and themes has come from adult samples; however, evidence suggests that adolescents may process tobacco-related warning messages differently than adults.<sup><xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> In addition, adolescence is characterized by significant cognitive and social developments, which can increase youth susceptibility to risky behaviors such as tobacco product use.<sup><xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> The current study aimed to experimentally test warning themes about vaping among a national probability sample of US adolescents (aged 13–17 years). We sought to examine receptivity to different warning themes to inform the development of effective vaping prevention messages.</p>

                <title>Participants and Procedure</title>
                <p>Participants were a national probability sample of US adolescents (ages 13–17 years) recruited in September and October of 2020 from the AmeriSpeak panel, a probability-based panel maintained by the National Opinion Research Center (NORC) at the University of Chicago in the United States. NORC randomly selected US households using area probability and address-based sampling, with a known, non-zero probability of selection from the NORC National Sample Frame. For the current study, adolescents were drawn from AmeriSpeak panel households. To address panel attrition due to the COVID-19 pandemic, NORC also invited adolescents ages 13–17 years living in AmeriSpeak panel households who had not yet joined the teen panel to take part in the study. In total, 1 351 households had age-eligible children and received information about the study. Parents from 1 002 households (74% of those eligible) provided informed consent, and 624 adolescents assented and completed the survey (62% of households whose parents consented; 46% of all eligible households). One participant had extensive missing data and was excluded from analyses, resulting in <italic toggle="yes">N</italic> = 623.</p>
                <p>The survey assessed vaping, combustible cigarettes, and other tobacco product use (eg, little cigars, hookah). For vaping and other tobacco product use questions, adolescents were shown images of products for reference. For this experiment, we randomly assigned adolescents to one of the five warning message themes: 1. control, 2. nicotine addiction, 3. chemical harms, 4. lung harms, or 5. COVID-19 harms. Each theme condition contained three text-based warning messages about vaping in white text on a black background (see <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> for the verbatim text used in the warning message stimuli and the supplemental document for images of the stimuli that were shown to participants).</p>

                <p>We opted to use causal language in the framing of the text of the warning messages (e.g., “vaping causes coughing and wheezing”) to increase comparability across message themes and to enhance understanding of the warning text.<sup><xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">38–40</xref></sup> While some of the statements go beyond the evidence from the 2018 NASEM report, we justify this decision based on the fact that this experiment is a test of the relative efficacy of warning themes rather than specific product warnings being proposed for implementation on packaging and advertising. After exposure to all three warnings, participants filled out assessments of perceived message effectiveness (PME) (primary outcome), negative affect, attention, social interactions, and message novelty (secondary outcomes).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>This experiment sought to examine responses to and identify compelling warning message themes about vaping among a national sample of US adolescents (aged 13–17 years). Messages about the chemical, lung and COVID-19 health effects of vaping were rated higher on PME than those about nicotine addiction. In addition, messages about nicotine addiction were rated higher on PME than control messages about vaping litter, suggesting that addiction warnings hold some value in communicating vaping harms to youth. While prior studies have examined responses to warnings and warning themes among adults,<sup><xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> our experiment extends this work to adolescents, a priority population for vaping prevention.</p>
              <p>A key finding from this experiment was the superiority of health harm warnings over addiction warnings for adolescents, a finding previously shown only among adults.<sup><xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Currently, nicotine addiction is the most common theme used in vaping prevention messages for youth,<sup><xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup> yet our data suggest it is not the most effective. Our findings are in line with work showing that adolescents sometimes discount the seriousness of addiction and often fail to understand the consequences of nicotine addiction.<sup><xref rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref></sup> While the health harms evidence continues to develop, further efforts are needed to develop effective health harms messages based on the latest scientific evidence. Such messages should then be placed in channels that target youth, or in cases where adult smokers will be exposed (eg, warnings on packaging or advertising), should be pre-tested to avoid any unintended consequences.<sup><xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Among adolescent participants, COVID-19 warning messages were rated higher than nicotine addiction and control messages on PME as well as on attention, negative affect, and social interactions—all key constructs of the Tobacco Warnings Model.<sup><xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup> Because a relationship between vaping and COVID-19 is not yet settled science, and studies have shown conflicting findings,<sup><xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref></sup> additional work is needed before consideration of disseminating warnings on this topic. Nonetheless, our findings emphasize the importance of communicating with youth about novel health harms of vaping as soon as the research evidence is conclusive.</p>
              <p>Notably, PME ratings for the five warning message themes did not substantially differ across several participant characteristics such as sexual attraction, household income, and vaping status—which is important given that a goal of vaping warning messages for adolescents should be to both prevent initiation and encourage cessation among current users. The subgroups analyzed in this experiment largely mirrored results from the overall study sample, with PME ratings from the chemical, lung, and COVID-19 harms warning message themes scoring the highest, followed by warnings message themes about nicotine addiction, and lastly control. The only variable that exhibited an interaction on PME was parent education; though, the significance of this interaction was modest and could reflect multiple testing errors. Overall, these findings suggest that warning messages about the various health effects of vaping may have an impact on adolescents regardless of vaping status and other socioeconomic and demographic factors. This finding builds upon prior studies showing that warning messages tend to work well across diverse populations.<sup><xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Findings from our research also have important policy implications. As previously discussed, the FDA currently requires a single warning about nicotine addiction on e-cigarette packaging and advertisements in the United States.<sup><xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> This warning strategy could be strengthened by messaging about additional health harms, such as the chemical exposures and respiratory effects of using e-cigarettes.<sup><xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> It is important, however, that studies with adult smokers evaluate such warnings to ensure that messages do not create inaccurate risk perceptions, and also that they do not discourage adult smokers from completely switching to vaping. Such unintended consequences should be examined given the fact that adult smokers would likely experience high exposure to vaping warnings on e-cigarette products and advertisements. While current evidence does <italic toggle="yes">not</italic> support the notion that exposure to vaping warnings encourages adult tobacco users to smoke cigarettes,<sup><xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> further work on any new warnings being considered for packaging and advertising is warranted.</p>
              <p>The warning message themes examined in the current study could also inform vaping prevention campaigns targeted to adolescents. For example, FDA’s <italic toggle="yes">The Real Cost</italic> vaping prevention campaign has used both addiction and health harm messages, and our findings suggest that a greater emphasis on the health harms of vaping in the campaign would be beneficial. Analyses of federal, state, and local vaping prevention campaigns have shown a variety of themes being used in such campaigns,<sup><xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup> and our results bolster the focus of such campaigns on the health effects of vaping.</p>
              <p>Strengths of this experiment include a national probability sample of adolescents in the United States, an experimental design that compared several vaping warning themes, the use of a validated multi-item scale to measure the primary outcome, and the inclusion of adolescent current vapers and those at-risk of vaping. Limitations of this experiment include that participants were exposed to the warning messages only a single time and our assessments were only of self-reported message reactions. Future work should test the impact of multiple exposures to messages overtime on outcomes such as susceptibility to vaping and e-cigarette use. In addition, research in this area may wish to use other methods of evaluating adolescent reactions to vaping warning message themes, such as experiments using eye-tracking software. Another limitation is that we assessed outcomes only after exposure to all three warning messages, and thus we can only speak to the impact of the theme but not the individual warnings in each condition. A final limitation was that all adolescents saw two vaping prevention videos ads as part of a separate study prior to being exposed to the warning message stimuli, which may have sensitized participants ahead of this warnings experiment.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>Adolescents in the current experiment rated warning messages about the chemical, lung, and COVID-19 health effects of vaping highest on PME, followed by addiction and then control messages. These results can inform both further research and policy—for instance, by systematically developing, implementing, and evaluating messages for e-cigarette prevention beyond nicotine addiction to maximize the ability of such prevention messages to discourage youth vaping. As new warnings are developed, it is important that they reflect the current science on the harms of vaping, which continues to evolve as new evidence emerges.</p>
