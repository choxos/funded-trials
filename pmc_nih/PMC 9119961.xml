                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Three clusters were identified: mental health and sleep impact (cluster 1, n = 37), economic impact (cluster 2, n = 18), and less overall impact (cluster 3, n = 20). Clusters differed in age, income, diet, and baseline coping skills. The intervention led to improvements across several health outcomes compared with usual care, with medium to large effects on functional impairments (standardized mean difference, −0.7 [95% CI: −1.3, −0.1]) in cluster 1, depressive symptoms (−1.1 [95% CI: −2.0, −0.1]) and obesity-related problems (−1.6 [95% CI: −2.8, −0.4]) in cluster 2, and anxiety (−1.1 [95% CI: −1.9, −0.3]) in cluster 3.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="p0005">During the COVID-19 pandemic, stay-at-home orders and social distancing impacted health behaviors, including physical activity and eating habits, and exacerbated the widespread obesity pandemic. Global estimates suggest that 12.8–48.6% of community-dwelling adults reported weight gain associated with lifestyle changes during the COVID-19 pandemic, with higher odds of weight gain among those with elevated baseline BMI <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Furthermore, the global prevalence of depression, which commonly co-occurs with obesity <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, grew from 4% in 2017 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> to 28% in 2021 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Simultaneous growth of the prevalence of obesity and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic heightened the risk for future health consequences and highlighted the urgent need for effective interventions that support people with this comorbid pattern.</p>
              <p id="p0010">The effectiveness of interventions that leverage lifestyle modification to treat people with obesity and comorbid depression during the post-COVID-19 era may be impacted by societal shifts that occurred during the pandemic. Disparate influences of the COVID-19 pandemic on daily and instrumental activities (e.g., childcare, healthcare access) <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, stress <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, and health behaviors (i.e., physical activity, diet, sleep) <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> may impede lifestyle modification efforts, especially among individuals with comorbid depression. Investigating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the effectiveness of behavioral interventions for people with obesity and comorbid depression is important as this may inform tailoring of interventions that address the different needs of people among this high-risk population during the ongoing pandemic.</p>
              <p id="p0015">We leveraged data from a pilot randomized clinical trial (RCT) that took place during the COVID-19 stay-at-home order in Illinois <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. The objectives of this posthoc analysis were to: identify clusters of pilot RCT participants who reported common patterns of COVID-19 pandemic impact, examine associations between cluster membership and baseline characteristics, and examine intervention effects on 6-month clinical outcomes stratified by cluster. Our hypothesis was that the intervention effects would be smaller among clusters of participants that experienced more negative impacts of COVID-19 relative to those who experienced fewer negative impacts.</p>

                <p id="p0020">Data were collected between March 7, 2019 and August 19, 2020. The trial aimed to elucidate neurobiological mechanisms of behavior change associated with an integrated collaborative care intervention for comorbid obesity and depression (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03841682). Participants (N = 106) were randomized (2:1 ratio) to receive an integrated collaborative care intervention (I-CARE2) or usual care over 6 months.</p>

                <p id="p0055">We conducted 3 analyses to (1) identify clusters of participants by COVID-19 Impact; (2) examine the association between baseline characteristics and COVID-19 Impact clusters; and (3) explore the intervention effects stratified by COVID-19 Impact clusters.</p>
                <p id="p0060">Clusters of participants who reported common patterns of impact on the COVID-19 Impact Scale were identified using Latent Class Analysis (LCA). This model-based approach uses participant responses on a set of indicators to identify profiles based on an underlying categorical latent variable. Similar COVID-19 Impact Survey items were combined resulting in 28 items (<xref rid="sec0120" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). The final model was selected based on the model fit (e.g., Log Likelihood, AIC, BIC, CAIC, Adjusted BIC, entropy), relative cluster size, and utility of the clusters <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.</p>
                <p id="p0065">Percentages and means (standard deviations [SD]) were used to describe baseline characteristics among participants who did and did not complete the COVID-19 Impact Survey, and by cluster. We examined the bivariate associations between identified clusters and baseline characteristics using the 2-step Fisher’s least significant difference method. After comparing baseline characteristics across clusters (analysis of variance, Chi-square), we examined pairwise comparisons (Student’s t, Chi-square) for variables significant at α &lt; 0.05. We then used canonical discriminant analysis to identify dimensions representing linear combinations of baseline characteristics that significantly differentiate the COVID-19 impact clusters by including baseline characteristics with P values ≤ 0.10 from the bivariate analyses <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Canonical discriminant analysis is a multivariate dimension-reduction technique that derives linear combinations of explanatory variables that have the highest possible multiple correlation, the <italic>canonical correlation</italic>, with the groups of a classification variable. Dimensions defined by each linear combination are considered canonical dimensions. Standardized canonical coefficients measured the strength and direction of correlation of each dimension with the characteristics. Participant scores on each canonical dimension were calculated as a sum of the products of canonical coefficients and the participant’s individual values for the characteristics. These scores were compared among the 3 COVID-19 impact clusters using analysis of variance.</p>
                <p id="p0070">Repeated-measures mixed-effects linear modeling was used to explore the intervention versus usual care effects on health outcomes over the 6-month trial stratified by COVID-19 impact clusters. The fixed effects of each model included baseline value of the outcome, randomization covariates (age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, BMI, SCL-20 score, current use of antidepressant medication), a dichotomous COVID lockdown indicator (dummy variable indicating whether the outcome was collected before or after 3/16/2020), group, time-point (2 or 6 months), group-by-time interaction, the main effect of the COVID-19 impact cluster, and its interaction with group. The random effects accounted for repeated measures with an unstructured covariance matrix. Model-based point estimates of adjusted between-group differences in means are reported with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Standardized mean differences on outcomes were computed using the baseline standard deviations and interpreted using Cohen’s d conventions for small (d=0.2), medium (d=0.5), and large (d=0.8) effect sizes. Given the exploratory nature of this study, we focused on the magnitude and precision (95% CIs) of intervention versus control effects within each COVID-19 impact cluster instead of the statistical significance of the interaction term of the COVID-19 impact cluster with group, and no multiple comparison corrections were made. Analyses used all available data for each outcome, and missing data were handled directly through maximum-likelihood estimation via mixed modeling. In the case of missing study-measured weight, the closest electronic health record (EHR) weight within 3 months of the due date of a missed study visit or self-reported weight (if no EHR weight) was used. All analyses were conducted in SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="p0100">Adults with obesity and comorbid depression who completed the COVID-19 Impact Survey during the first part of the COVID-19 pandemic were characterized by 3 clusters, highlighting mental health and sleep impact, economic impact, and less overall impact. differed in age, income, diet, and baseline coping skills. The intervention led to improvements across several health outcomes compared with usual care, specifically with medium to large effects on functional impairments in cluster 1, on depressive symptoms and obesity-related problems in cluster 2, and on anxiety in cluster 3. These exploratory findings may have important implications for the tailoring and implementation of behavioral interventions designed to restore health among adults with comorbid depression and obesity as society navigates the ongoing pandemic.</p>
              <p id="p0105">Participants in cluster 1 were likely to report detrimental impacts on mental health and sleep. These participants were the youngest among all 3 clusters. This aligns with evidence that younger people reported worse mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Participants in cluster 1 also had medium effect sizes on functional impairments in the intervention versus the control group. This effect size is similar to that reported in prior PST studies <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, suggesting that PST may be a viable treatment for adults who experienced pandemic-related mental health and sleep impacts. It is also worth noting that although intervention effects (95% CI) on depression, anxiety, sleep-related impairments, obesity-related psychosocial problems, and mental health quality of life overlapped the null in cluster 1, the effect was in the expected direction. This may be, in part, related to challenges adhering to behavioral health recommendations reported by adults who experienced mental health impacts during the COVID-19 pandemic <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Augmenting PST with additional support or increasing the intensity of intervention may be required to bolster effects on important health outcomes. Further research specifying treatment needs of adults who report mental health and sleep impacts during the pandemic will inform tailoring of behavioral interventions that support this vulnerable group.</p>
              <p id="p0110">Participants in cluster 2 were likely to report difficulty meeting basic needs such as accessing food, medication, transportation, and inability to pay bills. These participants had low income relative to those in the less overall impact cluster. The economic toll of the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with elevated depressive symptoms among people with low income <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Participants in cluster 2 also had large effects on obesity-related problems and depression in the intervention versus the control group. PST, which was a key part of the integrated intervention, previously demonstrated efficacy for reducing depressive symptoms and improving mental health among low income populations <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. The problem solving skills and coping strategies developed during the intervention may have supported participants as they navigated economic problems associated with the pandemic. Enhancing coping strategies may be particularly important for people with obesity and comorbid depression who experienced high economic impact associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Further research that elucidates the impact of increasing positive coping strategies and reducing negative coping strategies on health outcomes should guide the tailoring of interventions for members of this cluster.</p>
              <p id="p0115">Participants in cluster 3 were least likely to report negative or positive impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic. These participants were the oldest and had the highest income among all 3 clusters. Interestingly, among all clusters, these participants also had the highest scores on self-blame coping and avoidance problem solving style, which are maladaptive strategies that were associated with worse anxiety, depression, and stress outcomes during the pandemic <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. However, the demographic characteristics of this cluster are consistent with prior findings that age and income were protective of mental health <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. This aligns with evidence suggesting that social determinants of health (i.e., access to resources such as income) may play a greater role in health outcomes than individual psychological factors <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Members of the less overall impact cluster demonstrated improvements on anxiety, but no other health outcomes. Future studies may investigate whether improving maladaptive coping strategies in this less overall impact cluster may lead to improvements in weight, sleep, and depression outcomes.</p>

                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p id="p0120">This clinical trial was ongoing at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Consequently, it was not prospectively designed or adequately powered to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on intervention outcomes. Although the small sample size used to conduct LCA was compensated for by the large number of indicators (COVID-19 Impact Survey questions), the clusters should be viewed as exploratory and replicated in larger samples <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Additionally, 29% of trial participants did not respond to the COVID-19 Impact survey. Although responders and nonresponders did not differ in baseline characteristics, generalizability of the findings may be limited. Finally, the EPII is a new tool which was designed in tandem with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and is currently undergoing validation to establish psychometric properties <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. The present analysis supports and advances that work.</p>

                <title>Conclusions</title>
                <p id="p0125">Despite these limitations, this posthoc study takes an important step toward characterizing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the effectiveness of interventions within a uniquely high-risk and underserved population with obesity and comorbid depression. Participants in 3 distinct COVID-19 impact clusters differed in baseline characteristics (e.g., age, income, diet, and baseline coping skills) and may vary in their response to behavioral interventions. Future research that clarifies the unique needs of patients who experienced substantial mental health, sleep, and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic is required to advance intervention tailoring and implementation to restore health and well-being among at-risk populations as society continues to navigate the pandemic.</p>
