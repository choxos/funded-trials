                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>The United States has among the highest per capita red meat consumption in the world. Reducing red meat consumption is crucial for minimizing the environmental impact of diets and improving health outcomes. Warning messages are effective for reducing purchases of products like sugary beverages but have not been developed for red meat. This study developed health and environmental warning messages about red meat and explored participants’ reactions to these messages.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>A national convenience sample of US red meat consumers (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 1,199; mean age 45 years) completed an online survey in 2020 for this exploratory study. Participants were randomized to view a series of either health or environmental warning messages (between-subjects factor) about the risks associated with eating red meat. Messages were presented in random order (within-subjects factor; 8 health messages or 10 environmental messages). Participants rated each warning message on a validated 3-item scale measuring perceived message effectiveness (PME), ranging from 1 (low) to 5 (high). Participants then rated their intentions to reduce their red meat consumption in the next 7 days.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Health warning messages elicited higher PME ratings than environmental messages (mean 2.66 vs. 2.26, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&lt;0.001). Health warning messages also led to stronger intentions to reduce red meat consumption compared to environmental messages (mean 2.45 vs. 2.19, <italic toggle="yes">p&lt;</italic>0.001). Within category (health and environmental), most pairwise comparisons of harms were not statistically significant.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Per capita red meat consumption in the United States is among the highest in the world. On average, adults in the US consume 284 grams of unprocessed red meat per week [<xref rid="pone.0268121.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] (approximately 2.5-quarter pound hamburger patties), nearly three times the recommended level identified in the landmark 2019 EAT-<italic toggle="yes">Lancet</italic> report <italic toggle="yes">Healthy Diets from Sustainable Food Systems</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0268121.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Unprocessed red meat (defined as meat from mammals, e.g., beef, pork, lamb, goat) contains some beneficial nutrients, including protein and micronutrients such as iron and vitamin B<sub>12</sub> [<xref rid="pone.0268121.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, in the US, the vast majority of the population consumes adequate protein [<xref rid="pone.0268121.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and vitamin B<sub>12</sub> [<xref rid="pone.0268121.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Additionally, while iron deficiency anemia is the most common nutrient deficiency in the US, prevalence is relatively low at 10.4% for females and 5.2% for males [<xref rid="pone.0268121.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. At the same time, high intake of red meat consumption is associated with a number of poor health outcomes, including increased risk of several types of cancer, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and premature death [<xref rid="pone.0268121.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0268121.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. These relationships are particularly strong for processed red meats that are salted, cured, fermented, smoked or otherwise processed for flavor or preservation [<xref rid="pone.0268121.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. According to the American Cancer Society, it is unknown if there is a safe level of red meat consumption [<xref rid="pone.0268121.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In lieu of knowledge of safe consumption levels, organizations like the American Cancer Society and the American Diabetes Association recommend limiting red meat consumption in favor of poultry, fish, or plant-based proteins [<xref rid="pone.0268121.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0268121.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p>
              <p>Red meat production is also damaging to the environment. Livestock production is responsible for 14.5% of anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions globally [<xref rid="pone.0268121.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Among animal products, red meat is particularly damaging; for example, beef contributes approximately five times as much GHG emissions compared to chicken [<xref rid="pone.0268121.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Red meat production also damages the environment through deforestation and excess water use [<xref rid="pone.0268121.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. International reports by experts on food systems and climate change, including the EAT-<italic toggle="yes">Lancet</italic> report and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, indicate a drastic reduction in red meat consumption in high-income countries is needed to prevent further damage to the climate [<xref rid="pone.0268121.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p>
              <p>Given this evidence, public health practitioners and policymakers have sought strategies for reducing red meat consumption in the US. One potential population-level strategy is to use front-of-package labels to inform consumers about health and environmental effects of red meat. For example, several countries have mandatory or voluntary carbon labelling on food products, and given the large carbon footprint of red meat in particular, these labels may specifically discourage red meat consumption [<xref rid="pone.0268121.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Additionally, several private companies across the globe have also implemented similar optional “green label” certification for products [<xref rid="pone.0268121.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. One online experiment found that providing consumers with information about GHG emissions of vegetarian and meat-containing soups reduced intentions to purchase the meat-containing soups [<xref rid="pone.0268121.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Studies of similar carbon footprint labels and behavioral nudges on meat products in cafeteria settings in Europe have also found reductions of meat-purchasing behaviors [<xref rid="pone.0268121.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0268121.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p>
              <p>However, these studies focused on numerical labels about carbon emissions, rather than warning messages that make a direct statement about the health or environmental harms of a product. Previous research has highlighted the promise of warning labels to reduce purchases and consumption of tobacco products [<xref rid="pone.0268121.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0268121.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], sugary beverages [<xref rid="pone.0268121.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0268121.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], and junk food and alcohol [<xref rid="pone.0268121.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Yet, currently there is very little knowledge about warning labels on red meat. Specifically, limited research has compared health and environmental warning messages side by side or identified the most promising health and environmental harms to include in warning messages. We recently published a study comparing two specific health warnings (about cancer and early death) and two specific environmental warnings (about environmental damage and carbon emissions) [<xref rid="pone.0268121.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]; here, we describe the exploratory research that led to the development of the specific warnings used in that study.</p>
              <p>Research is also needed to assess potential differences in responses to the warning messages based on demographic characteristics, in order to inform policies to promote equity. A systematic review on consumer perspectives towards environmental concerns of red meat consumption found that females are more likely than males to be willing to reduce meat consumption after being exposed to environmental harm messages [<xref rid="pone.0268121.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Individuals with higher education levels tend to comprehend high-literacy sustainability and carbon labels compared to those with less education [<xref rid="pone.0268121.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Other demographic characteristics might also affect responses to red meat warnings, but limited research has explored this question.</p>
              <p>The objective of this study was to develop health and environmental warning messages about red meat consumption and examine US consumers’ reactions to these messages, with the overarching goal of identifying which messages hold the most promise for use in future studies to test behavioral impact. We further aimed to assess potential differences in message reactions across demographic groups. Our primary outcome was perceived message effectiveness (PME), a measure that has been used extensively in similar experiments to identify the potential impact of food and beverage warning labels on consumers [<xref rid="pone.0268121.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0268121.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0268121.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. PME is a measure that is sensitive enough to detect small differences between warnings yet is also predictive as to messages’ ability to change actual behaviors [<xref rid="pone.0268121.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p>

                <p>We designed messages using a multistage process similar to studies to evaluate health warnings for other products [<xref rid="pone.0268121.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0268121.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. First, we conducted a review of the literature on the health and environmental outcomes associated with red meat to select outcomes. Outcomes were included if recent meta-analyses, systematic reviews, or expert consensus statements indicated an association between red meat consumption and the outcome (<bold><xref rid="pone.0268121.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>).

                <p>Based on this literature review, we created 14 health messages and 16 environmental messages. We then convened an Expert Advisory Committee comprised of experts in nutrition, environment, food policy, agriculture policy, and law to review and provide feedback on both the warning message wording and scientific evidence supporting each of the harms. From this meeting, we created a final list of eight health messages and ten environmental messages to be used in this experiment. The number of messages selected for health and environment reflected the number of distinct topics for which we found scientific support (<bold><xref rid="pone.0268121.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>), as well as discussions with the expert advisory committee. The health harms were: diabetes; several types of cancer; colon cancer; colon and rectal cancer; cardiovascular disease; heart damage; stroke; and early death (e.g., “Eating red meat increases your risk of early death”). Environmental harms were: climate change; climate change, which leads to extreme weather events; global warming; carbon footprint; greenhouse gas emissions; water pollution; water shortages; deforestation; environment; and planet. We chose to include two messages about climate change (one general and one that linked climate change to extreme weather events) to assess whether consumers have stronger reactions to a climate-related message when a concrete environmental outcome (like extreme weather) is used, as the general population often has difficulty with understanding terminology related to climate change [<xref rid="pone.0268121.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>].

                <p>From March 22-March 25, 2020, we recruited a sample of 1,199 U.S. adults aged 18 years and older using Cloud Research’s Prime Panels, an online participant recruitment company commonly used by social and behavioral science researchers [<xref rid="pone.0268121.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Eligibility criteria were being aged 18 years or older and consumption of any red meat in the past 30 days. We used an item adapted from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) to measure consumption of red meat in the past 30 days (“In the past 30 days, how often did you eat red meat? Red meat includes beef, lamb, pork, sausage, and ham. It also includes processed red meats such as bacon, hot dogs, and lunch meats. It does not include chicken, turkey, or seafood products.” Response options: Never, Less than once a week, Once a week, 2–3 times a week, 4–6 times per week, 1 time per day, 2 times per day, 3 or more times per day) [<xref rid="pone.0268121.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>].

Eligible participants were randomized to view a series of either health or environmental warning messages (between-subjects factor). The within-subjects factor was the specific health or environmental harm included in the warning message. Participants randomized to the health arm viewed a series of eight health warning messages, and those randomized to the environmental arm viewed a series of ten environmental warning messages (<bold><xref rid="pone.0268121.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref></bold>). Similar to previous message development studies [<xref rid="pone.0268121.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], this study omitted a control group, because the main purpose was to understand whether health or environmental messages were perceived as more effective relative to each other.</p>

                <p>Then, participants completed two additional experimental tasks to examine other important but often overlooked design choices for warning messages. First, we examined consumer reactions to differences in the framing of how the target behavior was described (behavioral framing task). All participants were randomized to view one of the following six messages: 1) <underline>Eating</underline> red meat contributes to species loss; 2) <underline>Eating too much</underline> red meat contributes to species loss; 3) <underline>Eating a lot of</underline> red meat contributes to species loss; 4) <underline>Consumption of</underline> red meat contributes to species loss; 5) <underline>Overconsumption of</underline> red meat contributes to species loss; 6) <underline>Excess consumption of</underline> red meat contributes to species loss. (Underlining is presented here to highlight differences between conditions but was not used in the survey).</p>
                <p>Second, we examined reactions to messages with varying strength in causal language (causal variant task). Prior research on causal variants has shown that ‘causes’ is more discouraging than weaker variants such as ‘contributes to,’ ‘can contribute to,’ and ‘may contribute to’ [<xref rid="pone.0268121.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. This study aimed to test additional variations of causal language that could be applied to red meat. All participants were randomized to view one of five messages: 1) Eating red meat <underline>contributes to</underline> obesity; 2) Eating red meat <underline>may contribute to</underline> obesity; 3) Eating red meat <underline>is associated with</underline> obesity; 4) Eating red meat <underline>increases your risk</underline> of obesity; 5) Eating red meat <underline>increases your chances</underline> of obesity. (As above, underlining is presented here to highlight differences between conditions but was not used in the survey).</p>

                <title>Measures</title>
                <p>The primary outcome for the main experiment was PME of the health and environmental warning messages. After viewing each message, participants rated the message on a three-item PME scale. We adapted items from the UNC PME scale, which has previously been validated for use developing tobacco warnings [<xref rid="pone.0268121.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. The three PME items used in this study were: “How much does this message… 1) discourage you from wanting to eat red meat?; 2) make eating red meat seem unpleasant to you?; 3) make you concerned about the health/environmental effects of eating red meat?” The final item regarding concern about health/environmental effects was tailored to participants’ assigned condition (i.e., participants in the health warning message condition were asked about health effects and those in the environmental warning message condition were asked about environmental effects). The three PME items used five-point Likert-type response options ranging from “Not at all (coded as 1) to “A great deal” (coded as 5). Average PME (the primary outcome) was calculated by averaging responses across all three items.</p>
                <p>Secondary outcomes for the main experiment were intentions to limit red meat consumption over the next seven days and selection of the most discouraging message in each message category (health and environmental). Intention to reduce red meat consumption in the next seven days [<xref rid="pone.0268121.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] was measured using the same five-point Likert response options as PME. To measure the most discouraging message, participants were asked “Which of these messages <underline>most</underline> discourages you from wanting to eat red meat?” (underline shown in survey). The answer choices were the eight health or ten environmental warning messages (dependent upon condition).</p>
                <p>The outcome for the behavioral framing and causal variant tasks was perceived discouragement, measured using the discouragement item of the UNC PME scale.</p>
                <p>After completing the experiment, participants answered a series of questions on demographic characteristics as well as political affiliation and change in red meat consumption over the past 12 months.</p>

                <p>To assess whether PME varied by message type (health vs. environmental) in the main experiment, we used a t-test to compare PME ratings (averaged across all warning messages) between the two conditions. Results did not differ in direction or statistical significance when we used linear regression controlling for the unbalanced covariate (change in red meat consumption) (<bold><xref rid="pone.0268121.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref></bold>), so we retained the unadjusted analysis. We also used t-tests to evaluate differences in intention to reduce meat consumption over the next seven days.</p>
                <p>To compare the different messages within topic in the main experiment, we used mixed-effects linear regression, with separate models for health and for environmental messages. For both models, indicator variables were used for each warning message (excluding one), treating the intercept as random to account for repeated measures. We used postestimation commands to conduct pairwise comparisons of the predicted means, correcting for multiple comparisons. The reported p-values for these comparisons were produced using Bonferroni’s method.</p>
                <p>To evaluate the results of the most discouraging message, we used the descriptive results of the frequency of selection of warning messages. Additionally, we conducted z-tests to assess statistical significance in the frequency of selection of the different messages.</p>
                <p>In exploratory analyses, we used multivariate linear regression with OLS estimation to examine predictors of average PME for health and environmental messages (averaged across all warning messages shown in <bold><xref rid="pone.0268121.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref></bold>). Predictors were chosen based on characteristics previously found to be associated with food purchases and dietary intake overall and red meat intake in particular [<xref rid="pone.0268121.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0268121.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Separate regressions were conducted for health and environmental messages. The following predictors were included in the models: demographic characteristics (age, gender, race, Latinx ethnicity, income, education level, household income), political affiliation, usual red meat consumption, and change in red meat consumption in the past 12 months. For the environment model, belief in climate change was also included.</p>
                <p>There were four participants that selected “nonbinary” or “self-describe” for their gender; these respondents were not included in the OLS regressions involving gender due to small cell size. Racial categories other than Black and white were collapsed into an “other race” category and analyzed as such in the OLS due to small sample size in other racial categories. Likewise, those who had no change in red meat consumption over the past 12 months were combined with those who had increased their red meat consumption over the past 12 months due to the fact that only 6.3% of the sample increased their red meat consumption over the past 12 months, and a dichotomous variable of “reducers” and “non-reducers” was used for analysis. In post estimation tests, no variable had a Variance Inflation Factor of 5 or greater, indicating that multicollinearity was not problematic and thus all variables were retained in the model.</p>
                <p>For the behavioral framing and causal variant tasks, we assessed whether PME varied by message by conducting a one-way ANOVA to examine statistical differences between groups.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>To our knowledge, this is one of the first studies to develop and compare health and environmental warning messages about red meat. In our sample of US adults, we found that red meat consumers perceived health warning messages to be more effective than environmental warning messages. Moreover, across specific health warning messages, those for colon and rectal cancer and early death were perceived to be most effective. Red meat warnings for both health and the environment elicited higher perceived message effectiveness ratings among younger adults and those reporting that they had reduced their red meat consumption over the past year. The relationship between other personal characteristics and PME varied depending on warning topic (health vs. environmental). PME from health warnings was higher among Black participants compared to white participants. For environmental warnings, PME was higher among Hispanic/Latinx participants, participants with an annual household income of $100,000 or more, and liberal participants.</p>
              <p>Warnings about red meat could help inform consumers about the health and environmental impacts of these products [<xref rid="pone.0268121.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Current awareness of the adverse health impacts likely is low given the lack of public health campaigns focused on red meat’s health harms. Further, red meat is highly marketed. For example, the Beef Industry Council-funded ad campaign that promotes the consumption of red meat (“Beef. It’s what’s for dinner.”), administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, is recognized by 88% of American adults [<xref rid="pone.0268121.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Public confusion over the health effects of red meat has been exacerbated by inconsistent scientific messaging. Most recently, for example, the <italic toggle="yes">Annals of Internal Medicine</italic>, a journal published by the American College of Physicians, published a review article that concluded that there was insufficient evidence to support that red or processed meat consumption was associated with poor health outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0268121.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. This article received a widespread critique by nutrition scientists due to flaws in study design and interpretation bias [<xref rid="pone.0268121.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Despite this critique, the article garnered widespread media coverage in outlets such as the <italic toggle="yes">New York Times</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0268121.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. In the same year, the New York Times also covered the EAT-<italic toggle="yes">Lancet</italic> report, which includes recommendations to limit red meat intake, in multiple articles [<xref rid="pone.0268121.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0268121.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. The rapid and contradictory nature of reporting around red meat may contribute to consumer confusion.</p>
              <p>In this study, health warnings elicited higher ratings of PME than did environmental warnings. The reasons for these differences are unclear. One possible explanation is that environmental warnings elicit stronger feelings of defensiveness among consumers [<xref rid="pone.0268121.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>] than health warnings. For example, abstinence from meat can be viewed as threatening [<xref rid="pone.0268121.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. If consumers felt more judged by the environmental messages, perhaps this led to lower ratings of PME. Similarly, research on graphic tobacco warnings has found that some messages elicit reactance, or cognitive or emotional resistance to a message, which suppresses warnings’ effects on intentions to quit smoking [<xref rid="pone.0268121.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. More research will be needed to understand the degree to which environmental warning messages elicit reactance and potentially blunt the impact of the warnings.</p>
              <p>Another possibility is that baseline awareness about the environmental damage caused by red meat is low, leading to lower PME. According to a recent report by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication, only 27% of Americans think that beef contributes to global warming “a lot” and 30% think it contributes “a little” or “some” [<xref rid="pone.0268121.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Further, the same survey found that 91% of consumers cited health as at least moderately important as a reason why they consumed plant-based foods, compared to 64% that cited reducing global warming as at least moderately important [<xref rid="pone.0268121.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. This is consistent with a previous nationally representative survey that found people who are reducing meat consumption more commonly cite health than environmental reasons, and the relationship we observed in this study is consistent with those findings [<xref rid="pone.0268121.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Warnings on red meat may help increase public awareness and perceptions of risk of these environmental harms. In turn, higher public awareness about the environmental damages caused by red meat may increase the effectiveness of the messages. More research will be needed to understand consumers’ reactions to environmental messages about red meat, particularly as public attitudes and knowledge shift over time.</p>
              <p>Additionally, the difference in PME ratings between the health and environmental messages could be due to differences in the types of causal variants used. All of the health warning messages included the phrase “increases your risk of,” while the environmental warnings used “contributes to,” “increases,” and “harms.” On the other hand, the results from our causal variant task suggested that the type of causal language used does not meaningfully influence PME for messages about red meat. We tested three causal variants linking red meat with one health harm, obesity (“Eating red meat is associated with, increases your risk, or increases your chances of obesity”) and found that there were no differences in PME by causal variant. However, we did not test different causal variants for other health harms, nor for any environmental harms, and thus, it would be useful for future research on messages about red meat to explore whether different causal variants are perceived as more or less effective.</p>
              <p>Within the messages focused on health harms, there were few differences in PME between different health topics. The exception to this pattern was type 2 diabetes, elicited lower PME ratings than all other health harms tested in this study. These differences may be because other outcomes, such as cancer and mortality, may be perceived as more damaging to health than type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, these differences could be due to the fact that the general public has overall low awareness about the association between red meat intake and type 2 diabetes [<xref rid="pone.0268121.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>].</p>
              <p>Similar to the results for health harms, there were few differences in PME across specific environmental harms, with little variability between the top rated and lowest rated messages. The exception to this pattern is that the environment message elicited higher PME than the carbon footprint, water shortage, and climate change messages. These results are consistent with a recently published study by Wistar et al. which also found that a general environment message was perceived as more effective at discouraging red meat consumption than other environmental topics [<xref rid="pone.0268121.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. In contrast, it was surprising that the carbon footprint message elicited lower perceived message effectiveness as many existing environmental warning labels focus on carbon footprints. Lower PME for the carbon footprint message could reflect that many consumers do not understand the meaning of carbon footprints [<xref rid="pone.0268121.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0268121.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Our findings that many health and environmental harms elicited similar PME highlights that practitioners and policymakers have a wide variety of options for which harms to include in warnings.</p>
              <p>We assessed the concept of PME two different ways in this study. Although PME rating of individual warnings was the primary outcome [<xref rid="pone.0268121.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], we also asked participants to select which message of all the messages would most discourage them from consuming red meat because forcing participants to select one message might amplify subtle differences in reactions to each warning. For health messages, PME ratings were highest for messages about colon and rectal cancer, followed by early death, and several types of cancer, which all had very similar PME ratings. The overall pattern of top messages was the same when participants were forced to select the most discouraging message compared to when they rated each message individually, though the differences between messages appeared to be amplified in the former. For example, a substantial margin separated the proportion of participants who selected early death as the most discouraging harm (31% of participants) compared to several types of cancer or colon and rectal cancer (selected by 17% and 13% of participants, respectively), despite these harms performing similarly in PME ratings. These differences could reflect differences in measurement approaches (rating vs. forced choice), or that the 3-item PME scale measures two constructs in addition to discouragement (concern and unpleasantness). Overall, results from both sets of questions suggest that messages focused on cancer and especially early death may be particularly promising for eliciting behavior change.</p>
              <p>For the environmental messages, results were largely consistent regardless of whether participants were rating messages on PME or selecting the most discouraging message. Specifically, there was little variability in both PME ratings (range of mean PME scores, 2.20 to 2.32) and in the proportion of participants who selected each message as the most discouraging (range of %s, 6% to 15%). This pattern of results suggests that a variety of environment-related messages would perform similarly.</p>
              <p>With regards to demographic and personal predictors of PME, health warning messages elicited a higher PME among Black compared to white participants. It is possible this pattern was seen because racial inequities persist in chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, wherein the prevalence is higher among Black as compared to white adults [<xref rid="pone.0268121.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. This higher message effectiveness may also be because at the population level Black individuals are already reducing their meat consumption more than white individuals [<xref rid="pone.0268121.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>], and so may be more receptive to these types of warning messages. If this pattern of results holds in real-world settings, health warning messages on red meat could serve as a tool for reducing racial inequity in chronic diseases.</p>
              <p>Political affiliation and belief in human-caused climate change were the strongest predictors of PME in the environmental message model. As we hypothesized, stronger beliefs in human-caused climate change were associated with higher perceived effectiveness of the environmental messages. This finding is consistent with the findings from “Climate Change and the American Diet” [<xref rid="pone.0268121.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. While these findings indicate that those who do not believe that human-caused climate change may be harder to reach with environmental messaging, only 18% of our sample strongly or somewhat <italic toggle="yes">disagreed</italic> with the statement that human-caused climate change is occurring. This finding is consistent with other national polls of belief in climate change that show that the majority of US residents believe in human-caused climate change [<xref rid="pone.0268121.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>].</p>
              <p>Environmental messages elicited higher PME from liberals than from moderates and conservatives. This finding is consistent with climate change literature that has examined concern for climate change based on political belief [<xref rid="pone.0268121.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0268121.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. This relationship was not significant in the analysis of health messages. Thus, health messages may be perceived as less politically controversial in the US.</p>
              <p>In both our health and environmental analyses, messages were less effective among older adults compared to 18-25-year-olds (45 and older for environment warning messages; 55 and older for health warning messages). Young adults are the fastest growing age group for vegetarians and vegans; 12% of U.S. adults aged 18–29 report eating mostly vegetarian or vegan, compared to 5% of U.S. adults aged 50 and older [<xref rid="pone.0268121.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. Though our survey contained only red meat consumers, younger people may be more willing to reduce their meat consumption, perhaps contributing to their stronger perceptions that warning messages would be effective at reducing red meat consumption.</p>
              <p>For both health and environmental messages, participants who had not reduced their red meat consumption over the past year rated messages as less effective than participants who had reduced their red meat consumption. Higher self-reported consumption of red meat was significantly associated with lower PME ratings for environmental messages. Again, this relationship between lower red meat consumption and higher PME for environmental messages was consistent with the recent study published by Wistar et al. [<xref rid="pone.0268121.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. No such relationship between red meat intake and PME emerged for health messages.</p>
              <p>All causal variants and behavioral frames performed similarly. These findings suggest messages can take a variety of forms and perform well. These findings are important because subtle differences in warning language could affect warnings’ legal viability in the US; if a variety of warnings are similarly effective, policymakers can pursue those most likely to clear potential legal challenges.</p>
              <p>This research was conducted with the goal of informing future policies to inform consumers about the harms of red meat and discourage consumption. Although warning labels on other food products, such as sugary beverages, have been successful in several countries, policies focused on red meat have not been implemented, so legal and political feasibility in the US must be considered. In the US, warning may face First Amendment challenges [<xref rid="pone.0268121.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. Furthermore, the strong political power of the meat industry [<xref rid="pone.0268121.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0268121.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>], as well as deep-rooted ideologies of carnism and neoliberalism [<xref rid="pone.0268121.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>], could make implementing meat warnings politically challenging.</p>
              <p>Although perceived effectiveness is a marker for messages’ potential to change behavior, more research is needed to assess whether red meat warnings influence red meat purchasing and consumption behaviors. To our knowledge, only one study has investigated the impact of health and environmental warnings on outcomes related to red meat purchases [<xref rid="pone.0268121.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. That study found that participants perceived health warnings and combined environmental and health warnings as more effective than environmental warnings. However, the warnings did not affect participants’ selections in a product choice task. Given that previous research has shown that perceived message effectiveness is predictive of behavioral change [<xref rid="pone.0268121.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], it is unclear why even the health warnings did not reduce selection of red meat in that study. One possibility is that the behavioral task may not have been properly powered to detect differences [<xref rid="pone.0268121.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], or that the simplistic nature of an online choice experiment does not reflect how warnings would influence purchasing decisions in the real world. Future research would be useful to understand whether such warnings would discourage meat purchases in a more realistic food retail environment.</p>
              <p>Strengths of this study include the large sample of US residents and use of a randomized experiment. Limitations includes the use of a convenience sample, though the Cloud Research sample has been shown to more closely reflect the US population on sociodemographic characteristics than other online samples [<xref rid="pone.0268121.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Furthermore, this was an exploratory study without an <italic toggle="yes">a priori</italic> power calculation, and it is possible that there were differences in consumer responses to messages that we were not powered to detect. Additional limitations include that this study did not assess behavioral outcomes, such as purchases of red meat, although previous research on communication campaigns has found that PME, our primary outcome, is predictive of behavioral change [<xref rid="pone.0268121.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. Further research will clarify how consumers alter food purchases in response to red meat warnings. Another limitation is that data were collected in late March 2020, while coronavirus was spreading across the US. The spread of coronavirus may have elicited higher PME in health warning messages, particularly early death, given heightened concern about health harms during this time period. Public health agencies widely communicated the elevated risk of severe COVID-19 infection and death for individuals with pre-existing conditions [<xref rid="pone.0268121.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. Many of these pre-existing conditions are associated with diet, such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease [<xref rid="pone.0268121.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. Additionally, research has found that the COVID-19 pandemic increased mortality salience, leading to increased health behavior intentions [<xref rid="pone.0268121.ref088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0268121.ref089" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. Future research should examine how the salience of health and mortality risks caused by the coronavirus pandemic may impact reactions to health warning messages.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>Reducing red meat consumption in the US is critical for human and planetary health. This study developed several evidence-based health and environmental warning messages for red meat. Results of this exploratory study suggest that health warning messages are perceived to be more effective than environmental messages. Nonetheless, the inclusion of environmental waring messages is an opportunity to educate consumers about the environmental harms of consuming red meat. Future work will clarify the impact of these messages on meat purchases and consumption.</p>

              <p>Reviewer #1: Comments to authors</p>
              <p>This study investigates the effectiveness of health and environmental warning messages on consumers’ intention to reduce red meat consumption via an online experiment. The authors claim that health warning is more effective than environmental messages. The topic is timely and relevant. However, the measurement of the effectiveness is poorly designed. Based on the results resented by far, I am far from convinced that the health warning messages are more effective.</p>
              <p>The most important concern that I have for this study is the choice of the effectiveness measurement. In the current version, the authors use perceived message effectiveness (PME) as the key measurement. PME is a self-report Likert scale about the message, e.g., I think this message discourage me from wanting to eat red meat a great deal or not at all.</p>
              <p>If we assume that the message works via the following mechanism: (a)messages --&gt; (b) change thoughts --&gt; (c) change behavior (e.g., consumption frequency). What the authors measured is only the first step (from a to b) - the impacts of message on thoughts not behavior. Given that there are field studies already successfully measured the impacts of nutrition education on direct consumption outcomes, I find that a study only investigating the partial impacts of the message on people mind could provide limited solid and novel insights to the existing literature.</p>
              <p>Further, a large amount literature has demonstrated that the hypothetical bias associated with self-report behavior intention, and such bias can be particularly large when social desirability bias exists. I believe both health and environmental message could induce social desirability bias which could exacerbate hypothetical bias.</p>
              <p>In term of statistical analysis, I strongly disagree that authors directly calculated means of Liker scale, e.g., 5= a great deal and 1= not at all, and the average is 2.6. By taking average of those scales, the authors are assuming the distance between 1=not at all and 2 = somewhat not important are equal to the distance between 4=somewhat important and 5=a great deal, which is a very poor assumption and is also not the common practice. Corresponding to that, instead of using linear regression model (table 5), the author should use ordered logit model.</p>
              <p>Also, I strongly disagree with the author that, because messages are randomly assigned, the balance tests are therefore not required. Balance tests are essential to demonstrate that your randomization was successful. Unsuccessful randomization is fairly common even when researchers thought they randomly assigned subjects to treatment groups.</p>
              <p>For the experiment design, shouldn’t there be a baseline group where they received a placebo information so that their attitude can be used as the gold standard benchmark?</p>
              <p>Minor comments</p>
              <p>The presentation of the table requires a lot of work. The presentation of Table 1 is horrible. This single table takes 8 pages with a lot of blank areas on many pages. For table 3, the author can easily add one more column to compare the differences between Health Warning and Environmental Warnings groups as the balance test. As for table 5, there are more professional presentation to report regression results.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: This study explored participants’ reactions to health and environmental warnings messages about red meat. The manuscript is well written and easy to follow. I have included general and specific notes below on areas of the paper that I believe could be strengthened:</p>
              <p>GENERAL</p>
              <p>You mention at the very end of your limitations section that COVID may have elicited higher PME in health warning messages, especially for early death, which seems likely given its salience during the study period. This seems to be a very large limitation of this work, and should be discussed in more detail. Did you collect any data before the nationwide quarantine (i.e., early March)? Is there any way you can do a sensitivity analysis looking at responses from earlier in the pandemic (March) compared to later (April) to see if the effectiveness of the warnings changed over time? In the discussion, I think it would be valid to spend more time reflecting on COVID’s influence on this study. Do you think health warnings will continue to be salient, given the ongoing pandemic? Is there any scientific evidence that you can cite that supports or negates the idea that the salience of health risks created by COVID may have influenced your findings?</p>
              <p>I think this manuscript could benefit from a more in-depth discussion of the application of red meat warnings. How policy-relevant is this work? Is there any way such warnings could be legally required, either in the US or internationally? Do you foresee these warnings being used in educational materials or PSAs?</p>
              <p>INTRODUCTION</p>
              <p>p. 3, line 51: Can you give the reader context for what 284 grams of red meat looks like in a person’s diet, perhaps in servings of steak or burgers?</p>
              <p>p. 3, line 60: typo: “knowledge of a safe consumption levels”</p>
              <p>METHODS</p>
              <p>General: Could you standardize your language throughout the methods section to have consistent terminology for your main experiment, the behavioral framing task, and the causal variant task? I found it a little confusing when you referred to your main experiment as the “between subjects” experiment, because it appears that all three of the tasks in your study were between subjects (in the second and third tasks, participants were randomized to see only one message, correct?).</p>
              <p>p. 14, line 122: Can you explain why you tested 8 health messages and 10 environmental messages, instead of 8 and 8? Even just a few additional words at the end of the sentence in lines 122-123 would be helpful. Something like, “we created a final list of eight health messages…to be used in this experiment CHOSEN BASED ON X CRITERIA”</p>
              <p>p. 14, lines 123-124: You list 9 health harms here (not 8), and mention colon and rectal cancer twice—could you clarify?</p>
              <p>p. 14, line 126: Can you separate your list with semicolons to make it clear that you didn’t accidentally list climate change twice? I had to reread that sentence to understand what you were trying to say.</p>
              <p>p. 17, line 188: Can you be more specific about your primary outcome, given that you’re assessing PME in three separate tasks? ie, add a note that it’s PME for the health/environment warning messages in the main experiment</p>
              <p>p. 19, lines 218-222: While balance tests may be unnecessary for randomized experiments, I still think it’s useful to check for differences in demographics and if one is found, conduct a sensitivity analysis on your primary outcome to ensure it isn’t affecting your results.</p>
              <p>p. 19, line 223: “between-subjects’ arms”: see general comment under methods section heading. Could you refer to this as your main experiment (or something like that)?</p>
              <p>p. 19, line 228: “most discouraging message”: You had previously mentioned asking participants which message was most discouraging under Procedures lines 162-163, but I didn’t see that as an outcome of interest in the measures section.</p>
              <p>p. 19, lines 230-236: How did you determine which predictors to include in your models?</p>
              <p>RESULTS</p>
              <p>Table 3: When you refer to “meat” in this table, is that red meat? If so, can you modify to “frequency of red meat consumption” and “red meat consumption as compared to a year ago”?</p>
              <p>pp. 24-25, lines 261-269: Can you list the p-values for the significant findings you’re reporting, beyond just saying they’re &lt;0.05? It’s hard to understand what a significant difference of 0.1 on the PME scale means without added context.</p>
              <p>Table 4: Why was the SD for global warming so small (0.05) compared to the others (~1.2-1.3)?</p>
              <p>Figure 3: How was the order of messages on the X axis determined? Could you order them from highest to lowest PME score (and add a note at the bottom of the figure that they’re arranged that way) so that readers can see the relationship between the discouragement outcome vs. PME outcome, given that they’re both trying to predict behavior?</p>
              <p>p. 29, lines 290-293: There appear to be other significant differences in predictors for PME for the health and environmental message models individually that weren’t commented on in the text (e.g., income, political affiliation, ethnicity)—could you either add those results to the text or provide justification for excluding them?</p>
              <p>DISCUSSION</p>
              <p>General: Your main takeaway for differences between warning messages was that colon and rectal cancer and early death were most effective (based on PME), but based on your discouragement outcome, only early death was “effective”. I’m curious as to why you chose to highlight both outcomes (PME and discouragement) in the results—which do you think is most predictive of actual behavior change? What do we gain by using the other outcome?</p>
              <p>General: I think it’s worth commenting on the varied phrasing of the messages you tested, given that your health warnings all used “increases your risk of” but the environmental warnings never used the word “risk” and instead used words like “contributes to”, “increases”, and “harms.” Is there reason to believe that the word “risk” contributed to the health warning messages’ success? Could you craft an environmental message that frames the warning as health risks to the environment? This seems worthy of mention and future research, given your findings.</p>
              <p>p. 30, lines 307-308: I think it’s worth spending a little more time talking about significant predictors of PME for health and environment warnings, especially given ethnic and income differences that could be of use for future messaging research.</p>
              <p>p. 30, lines 309-310: Does your study provide evidence that warnings about red meat could help inform consumers about the health and environmental impacts of products? If so, can you explicitly say that, and if not, can you temper this statement?</p>
              <p>p. 30, lines 349-355: Couldn’t it also be possible that type 2 diabetes had the lowest PME because most people associate it with sugar and carbs, not red meat? You also found differences in the environment messages that seem worth commenting on—why do you think the environment message performed so much better than carbon footprint? This seems useful to mention given that many labels focus on carbon footprints.</p>
              <p>p. 32, lines 356-374: Can you also speak to the other significant differences in predictors that you observed in Table 3? You didn’t mention some of these results until now, so I recommend adding them to the results section before they’re mentioned in the discussion.</p>
              <p>p. 34, lines 394-398: You didn’t see statistically significant differences in the causal language or eating behavior language experiments, but could that be because you weren’t powered to see significant effects, given that your sample sizes were much smaller per group for those analyses? Can you provide an explanation of what your study was powered to find? If you were underpowered to detect differences in effects for these two experiments, I would recommend tempering your language here and including this as a limitation.</p>
              <p>CONCLUSIONS</p>
              <p>I don’t think your study found that health and environmental harms could be used in warning messages about red meat—your study created warning messages about red meat that included health and environmental harms, and you found that health warnings appeared to be more effective.</p>

              <p>Dear Editor,</p>
              <p>We thank you and the reviewers for your comments on our recently submitted manuscript titled “Developing health and environmental warning messages about red meat: An online experiment” (ID PONE-D-21-09001). We appreciate the thoughtful comments from the reviewers and believe the revised manuscript is significantly stronger for having incorporated their suggestions. </p>
              <p>We are attaching a revised version of the manuscript with track changes. We are also attaching a table to this submission that contains point-by-point responses to the reviewers’ comments.</p>
              <p>Another change is that co-author Christina Chauvenet has requested to be moved from the author list to the acknowledgements section as due to a job change, she can no longer to contribute to reviewing or contributing to the manuscript. We have also added Carmen Prestemon as a co-author. Carmen is a research assistant who contributed to the project during the initial phases and also contributed writing, editing, and analysis during the revision; we believe that her contributions warrant authorship. </p>
              <p>We look forward to hearing from you regarding our submission. We would be happy to respond to any further questions and comments that you might have.</p>
              <p>Kind regards,</p>

              <p>Reviewer #2: Thank you for your thoughtful edits and responses. A few more thoughts:</p>
              <p>Lines 82-83, 96-97: You say that studies have not yet examined health warnings on red meat or developed warning messages about the environmental impact of red meat, but didn’t the study below do that? I understand that this study under review informed the behavioral study cited below and that study was conducted after this one, but it still was published first so I think you need to acknowledge it. You could change this language to something like, “before conducting this study, no research had examined health warnings…” etc.</p>
              <p>Taillie, L.S., Chauvenet, C., Grummon, A.H. et al. Testing front-of-package warnings to discourage red meat consumption: a randomized experiment with US meat consumers. Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act 18, 114 (2021).</p>
              <p>Lines 197, 405: you used “casual” instead of “causal”, just double check if that happened anywhere else in the paper.</p>
              <p>Lines 255-256: You say that you corrected for multiple comparisons using Bonferroni’s method—can you specify whether the p-values presented in the paper are corrected, and if so, which ones?</p>
              <p>Figure 3: I previously commented about changing this figure and although you said that you made the change, it does not appear to have changed in the revision you submitted. My original comment stands: I think it would be more useful to reorder the x axes in Panels A and B so that messages are ordered from highest to lowest PME score from left to right. You added a footnote saying that message topics are arranged from highest to lowest PME score, but they don’t appear to be.</p>
              <p>Discussion: I know your discussion is already quite long, but I think the Taillie et al. 2021 paper cited above deserves some acknowledgement in the discussion, given that you are calling for that work to be done at the end of your paper but it already has been done and published. In that published paper you did not comment on how your findings compared to this paper (because it wasn’t published yet), so it seems important to note in this paper that although you found significant differences in this paper, you did not see those differences play out in an actual behavioral task. I know it was one single task and may not have been properly powered, but I think it is still worth discussing.</p>
