              <abstract>
                <p>To augment HIV-1 pox-protein vaccine immunogenicity using a next generation adjuvant, a prime-boost strategy of recombinant modified vaccinia virus Ankara and multimeric Env gp145 was evaluated in macaques with either aluminum (alum) or a novel liposomal monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) formulation adsorbed to alum, ALFA. Binding antibody responses were robust and comparable between arms, while antibody-dependent neutrophil and monocyte phagocytotic responses were greatly enhanced by ALFA. Per-exposure vaccine efficacy against heterologous tier 2 SHIV mucosal challenge was 90% in ALFA-adjuvanted males (<italic>P</italic> = 0.002), while alum conferred no protection. Half of the ALFA-adjuvanted males remained uninfected after the full challenge series, which spanned seven months after the last vaccination. Antibody-dependent monocyte and neutrophil phagocytic responses both strongly correlated with protection. Significant sex differences in infection risk were observed, with much lower infection rates in females than males. In humans, MPLA-liposome-alum adjuvanted gp120 also increased HIV-1-specific phagocytic responses relative to alum. Thus, next-generation liposome-based adjuvants can drive vaccine elicited antibody effector activity towards potent phagocytic responses in both macaques and humans and these responses correlate with protection. Future protein vaccination strategies aiming to improve functional humoral responses may benefit from such adjuvants.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Of the seven preventive HIV-1 vaccine trials conducted to date, only RV144 showed evidence of efficacy [<xref rid="ppat.1008764.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The rapid waning of protective immune responses and the reduction in vaccine efficacy from 60% to 31% at one and three years after initial vaccination, respectively, highlight opportunities to improve upon the RV144 pox-protein regimen [<xref rid="ppat.1008764.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1008764.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Increasing vaccine-elicited immune response magnitude, persistence, and functionality are active areas of investigation toward this end.</p>
              <p>Numerous preclinical and clinical studies are exploring next generation adjuvants as a means to augment immunity. Historically, most licensed subunit vaccines have been adjuvanted with aluminum salts (alum). In recent years, promising alternatives to alum have emerged due largely to improved understanding of innate immunologic processes involved in pathogen recognition. As a result, multiple licensed vaccines now employ novel adjuvants for which robust safety profiles have been established, including the highly successful Shingrix shingles vaccine [<xref rid="ppat.1008764.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Promising results in many pre-clinical and clinical studies for other pathogens support their evaluation as a means to improve HIV-1 vaccine efficacy [<xref rid="ppat.1008764.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1008764.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. As such, MF59, rather than alum, was used in the HVTN 702 phase 2b ALVAC-gp120 prime-boost clinical trial in the Republic of South Africa. This trial aimed to follow up on the RV144 trial but immunizations in the trial were recently halted. While the HVTN 702 futility finding limits the future prospects of this regimen due to manufacturing constraints, it raises key questions regarding whether parameters that differed between RV144 and HVTN 702 contributed to the disparate outcomes [<xref rid="ppat.1008764.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], such as the use of different adjuvants. Identification of adjuvants able to improve HIV-1 protein vaccine efficacy, even within the context of a pox-protein regimen, may aid in optimizing protein-based regimens.</p>
              <p>Immune correlates analyses of RV144 and pre-clinical SHIV/SIV vaccine efficacy studies using unrelated vaccine regimens indicate potential mechanisms that mediate protection against mucosal HIV-1 transmission. Binding antibodies to the V1/V2 region of the envelope protein, IgG3 subclass V1/V2-specific antibodies, polyfunctional Env-specific CD4 T cells, low mucosal Env-specific IgA, and antibody-effector activities all show evidence of being associated with reduced risk of infection [<xref rid="ppat.1008764.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1008764.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1008764.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Vaccine elicitation of HIV-1 broadly neutralizing responses capable of protecting against clinically relevant heterologous viral strains has proven elusive. As a result, there is growing interest in optimizing vaccine-induced humoral responses that exhibit non-neutralizing antibody-dependent effector activity. Development of robust assays that quantify non-neutralizing functional antibodies has further spurred investigations in this area [<xref rid="ppat.1008764.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1008764.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Moreover, Fc-mediated phagocytic functions are highly active in mucosal tissues [<xref rid="ppat.1008764.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], suggesting they may play an underappreciated role in protecting against HIV-1 and other mucosally transmitted pathogens. Vaccine strategies able to augment these responses have not been well described and could substantially improve efficacy [<xref rid="ppat.1008764.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1008764.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p>
              <p>To evaluate a next generation adjuvant in combination with pox-protein HIV-1 vaccination against the most prevalent HIV-1 subtype, we immunized rhesus macaques with attenuated modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) encoding HIV-1 <italic>gag-pol</italic> and <italic>env</italic> and a multimeric subtype C HIV-1 envelope protein, gp145 [<xref rid="ppat.1008764.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], adjuvanted with either alum or the Army Liposomal Formulation adsorbed to alum (ALFA) [<xref rid="ppat.1008764.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. ALFA is believed to be an improvement to the highly successful but proprietary AS04 adjuvant, which contains free MPLA adsorbed to alum, and neither of these have been assessed for vaccination against HIV-1. Protection was determined by limiting-dose serial intrarectal challenge with the heterologous, tier 2, CCR5-tropic subtype C SHIV-1157ipd3N4 virus strain, considered to be a stringent model with limited vaccine efficacy achieved to date [<xref rid="ppat.1008764.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1008764.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Adjuvanting with ALFA, but not alum, dramatically reduced the per-exposure infection risk, however, protection was limited to male animals. While most HIV-specific immune responses were similar between the adjuvant arms, antibody-dependent cellular (ADCP) and neutrophil phagocytic (ADNP) responses were augmented by ALFA. Evaluating for immunologic correlates of protection revealed ADCP, ADNP, and linear V2 peptide-specific rectal binding antibody responses as associated with protection. Further, a separate phase 1 study in humans demonstrated greater ADCP and ADNP responses upon gp120 vaccination adjuvanted with a related liposomal-MPLA-alum formulation relative to alum.</p>

                <p>Forty-eight Indian-origin male and female rhesus macaques were enrolled in an HIV-1 vaccine efficacy study with SHIV challenge. Animals were manually assigned to three study groups minimized for differences in age, weight, sex, and <italic>TRIM5</italic> and <italic>TRIMcyp</italic> alleles. All animals lacked protective MHC class I alleles.

Gp145 was adjuvanted with either aluminum hydroxide (AH, or “alum”) or Army Liposomal Formulation (ALF), which contains synthetic MPLA, adsorbed to AH (ALFA). Control animals received MVA lacking HIV-1 inserts and ALFA adjuvant alone.</p>

                <p>Three months following the last immunization, serial limiting-dose intrarectal SHIV-1157ipd3N4 challenges were administered for up to ten exposures per animal (AID40). Animals were challenged simultaneously over two consecutive days or on a single day when fewer than 24 animals remained uninfected. The subtype C SHIV-1157ipd3N4 virus was selected as a stringent challenge strain for its tier 2 neutralization profile, heterologous sequence to the vaccine immunogens, and resistance to vaccine-mediated immunity [<xref rid="ppat.1008764.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1008764.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The sequence distance between gp145 and the challenge strain is comparable to that between two randomly selected sequences within an HIV-1 subtype. Time to infection was assessed by weekly plasma viremia measurements. Per-exposure infection rates were similar between the alum and control arms (19% and 22%, respectively), while ALFA reduced the per-exposure infection risk by 59% compared to controls (<italic>P =</italic> 0.09, 12% infection rate, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008764.g001">Fig 1B and 1C</xref>). Nine animals from all three groups resisted all ten prespecified challenges. Subsequent challenge with a five-fold higher dose resulted in infection of all but one animal (alum group) after three challenges, indicating susceptibility to infection across the cohort.</p>
                <p>While the study was not designed to detect differences between sexes, sex can influence both vaccine-elicited immune responses as well as vaccine efficacy [<xref rid="ppat.1008764.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1008764.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], and the majority of macaque HIV-1 vaccine trials have historically been performed in male animals. In order to account for potential differences in the risk of infection, the analysis of vaccine efficacy was stratified by sex. Remarkably, ALFA-adjuvanted vaccine efficacy was highly sex-specific, with protection exclusively in male animals (90% efficacy, <italic>P =</italic> 0.002, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008764.g001">Fig 1D–1F</xref>). Males in the control (n = 8) and alum (n = 6) groups were all infected by the fourth challenge, while all ALFA males (n = 6) resisted the first three challenges and 50% remained uninfected following all ten challenges, which extended to seven months after the last vaccination. Thus, among males, the control and alum arms were highly susceptible to infection while ALFA afforded substantial protection both short- and long-term. In contrast, no efficacy was observed with ALFA or alum among females.</p>
                <p>Of note, SHIV acquisition was delayed in control females compared to control males (infection rates per-exposure of 13% and 44%, respectively, <italic>P =</italic> 0.006, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008764.g001">Fig 1F and 1G</xref>). Infection rates were also significantly higher in males than females in the alum arm (<italic>P =</italic> 0.005). The increased resistance to infection among females may reflect sex-specific innate barriers to infection, as has been observed in other settings [<xref rid="ppat.1008764.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1008764.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Markers of inflammation and gastrointestinal tract integrity, such as type I interferon response (Mx1) and gastrointestinal neutrophil infiltration (MPO), in rectal lamina propria prior to challenge did not differ between sexes across or within study arms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008764.s001">S1A Fig</xref>). To determine whether the rectal mucosa microbiome influenced infection rate, beta diversity statistical metrics were used to compare overall microbial compositions. Microbial composition differed between males and females using both Bray Curtis and weighted Unifrac analyses (<italic>P =</italic> 0.005 and <italic>P =</italic> 0.007, respectively), with significant differences observed at the Family level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008764.s001">S1B Fig</xref>), consistent with previously described sex-based differences [<xref rid="ppat.1008764.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. However, no significant associations with time to infection were observed in either sex, among all animals or vaccinated only.</p>
                <p>Viral replication post-infection did not differ between vaccinated and control animals: peak and set point viremia were comparable across groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008764.s002">S2A and S2B Fig</xref>). These and similar findings in other pox-protein clinical and pre-clinical vaccine studies are consistent with limited magnitude and potency of cytotoxic T cell responses elicited by these regimens [<xref rid="ppat.1008764.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1008764.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1008764.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. A sex-based difference in viremia was observed, however, within the ALFA group, as set point viremia was higher among ALFA-vaccinated females than males (<italic>P =</italic> 0.04 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008764.s002">S2C Fig</xref>)). Females are known to produce more IFN-α in response to Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) stimulation (e.g. challenge virus genome) than males [<xref rid="ppat.1008764.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1008764.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. However, viral sequencing of two control female animals (with relatively high viral load) during acute infection did not reveal any selection barrier for type I interferon-resistant virus among females (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008764.s002">S2D Fig</xref>).</p>

                <p>Binding, neutralization, and non-neutralizing functional antibody responses to multiple antigens were assessed in serum and rectal secretions. Remarkable serum IgG responses to HIV-1 Env gp140, gp120, gp70-scaffolded and cyclic V1V2 and V3 antigens, gp41, and the gp145 immunogen were observed by ELISA, multiplex Luminex-based assays (BAMA), and Fc array analysis in both active arms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008764.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008764.s003">S3</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008764.s005">S5</xref> Figs). These included antigens derived from the vaccine, challenge, and unrelated strains across multiples subtypes. However, response rates and magnitude were similar between the alum and ALFA arms at all time points assessed, including following each vaccination as well as the time of challenge. Hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis of the binding responses assessed by Fc array did not discriminate between active arms and no individual component responses were significant after FDR-adjustment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008764.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). Env-specific rectal mucosa IgG responses were also similar in magnitude between arms, including to linear peptides from multiple HIV-1 strains, while minimal IgA responses were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008764.g002">Fig 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008764.s005">S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008764.s006">S6</xref> Figs). Specific activity to both the vaccine and challenge Envs ranged from 10<sup>3</sup>−10<sup>4</sup>, with 100% response rates. Binding antibody responses to infected cells were also robust but again did not differ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008764.s003">S3F Fig</xref>). Sex-specific analyses revealed greater binding responses to some antigens among females that received ALFA adjuvant compared to alum, but these differences were inconsistent across time points and did not withstand adjustment for multiple comparisons.</p>

                <p>Neutralizing antibody responses to multiple tier 1 pseudoviruses were achieved and boosted with each immunization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008764.s007">S7 Fig</xref>). No tier 2 neutralizing responses were observed, including to the matched vaccine and SHIV-1157ipd3N4 challenge pseudoviruses. Response rate and magnitude were generally similar between the alum and ALFA arms, as were neutralization breadth and potency scores. Taken together, while strong binding and tier 1 neutralizing antibody responses were elicited by the MVA-gp145 regimen, adjuvanting with ALFA did not substantially increase these responses relative to alum.</p>
                <p>The importance of antibody effector activities in controlling pathogen replication is increasingly appreciated in large part due to their identification as immune correlates of vaccine-reduced infection risk [<xref rid="ppat.1008764.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1008764.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1008764.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. To determine the extent of cell-mediated antibody effector responses, we assessed antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), ADCP, ADNP, and antibody-dependent natural killer (NK) intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) responses at peak immunogenicity and at the time of challenge. ADCC, ADCP, ADNP and NK ICS responses were elicited in both active arms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008764.g002">Fig 2C–2E</xref>). ADCC and NK ICS responses were similar between the alum and ALFA groups at peak (<italic>P =</italic> 0.16, <italic>P</italic> = 0.6, respectively) and waned to baseline levels by the time of challenge. ADCP and ADNP, by contrast, were robust at peak, sustained for several months, and consistently greater with ALFA than alum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008764.g002">Fig 2E</xref>). Of note, the animal that resisted all ten prespecified challenges as well as the high-dose supplemental challenges maintained exceptional ADNP responses at the time of challenge. The increased ADCP activity by ALFA relative to alum was most apparent within males, and ADNP within females, though trends were clear in both sexes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008764.s008">S8 Fig</xref>). Results obtained with human and rhesus neutrophil effectors were correlated. ADNP, but not ADCP, responses correlated with concurrent binding antibody titers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008764.g002">Fig 2F and 2G</xref>), suggesting that ALFA specifically increased monocyte phagocytic antibody effector activity independent of binding antibody levels.</p>

To assess the induction of antigen-specific T cell responses in MVA-gp145 vaccinated animals, we performed T cell ICS on peripheral blood and mucosal mononuclear cells. PBMC Env-specific CD4 T cell responses rates were uniformly high following the third and fourth vaccinations in both the alum and ALFA arms, with all animals responding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008764.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). The frequency of Env-specific CD4 T cells ranged from 0.2–1.7% of the memory compartment and did not differ between adjuvants. CD4 response quality, as assessed by either the Boolean combinations of cytokines expressed by Env-specific cells using SPICE or the COMPASS functionality and polyfunctionality scores, was similar between the adjuvant arms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008764.s009">S9 Fig</xref>). CD154 single-positive T cell responses predominated. CD8 T cell responses to Env were more variable, observed in approximately half of the animals in each arm, and restricted to just one of the three Env peptide pools assessed. Among responding animals, the magnitude was robust, at 0.2–4% of memory CD8 T cells. Again, there was no difference between the alum and ALFA vaccinated groups. The MVA HIV <italic>gag-pol</italic> insert did not show evidence of priming SIV Gag cross-reactive responses, as SIV Gag-specific CD4 and CD8 T cell responses were not apparent in the active arms post-vaccination and comparable between the control and active arms post-infection.

                <p>To assess adaptive mucosal T cell responses, ICS was performed on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), an accessible extra-lymphoid mucosal effector site with less background than rectal samples, four weeks post-infection. Responses early after infection in vaccinated animals represent an anamnestic response primed by vaccination and are thus expected to exceed the primary response seen in control animals. As mucosal samples are prone to more ICS background than PBMC and background values are often within the range of vaccine-elicited responses, probing the more vigorous anamnestic post-infection response can be a useful approach for assessing vaccine priming of cellular responses. Indeed, acute infection HIV-specific BAL CD4 and CD8 T cell responses were much greater in ALFA vaccinees than controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008764.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). Median CD4 and CD8 T cell responses with ALFA were ~6% and 4%, respectively, versus &lt;1% for both subsets in control animals. These anamnestic responses were less pronounced with alum (3% and 0.5%), which did not differ from controls, suggesting more effective mucosal T cell priming by ALFA than alum.</p>

                <p>To identify potential vaccine-mediated immune correlates of protection, the numerous humoral and cellular immunogenicity measurements were first filtered to remove highly correlated assays (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008764.s011">S1 Table</xref>). Assays were assessed for association with the risk of infection via Cox proportional hazards models, with sex and vaccine arm included as covariates. ADCP responses to gp145 were significantly protective in males at both peak (HR = 0.34, <italic>P</italic> = 0.004, q = 0.016) and time of challenge (HR = 0.44, <italic>P =</italic> 0.03, q = 0.15, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008764.g004">Fig 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008764.s012">S2 Table</xref>). Eighty percent of vaccinated animals with peak ADCP responses below the median were infected after just two challenges, while animals above the median remained uninfected during this time and either succumbed to subsequent challenges or resisted all prespecified challenges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008764.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). In the unfiltered analysis, ADNP responses assessed at the time of challenge were also protective in males (HR = 0.14, <italic>P =</italic> 0.02, q = 0.11, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008764.g004">Fig 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008764.s013">S3 Table</xref>).

                <title>Human antibody-dependent phagocytic responses to liposomal-MPLA adjuvanted HIV-1 vaccine</title>
                <p>To determine whether adjuvanting with liposomal-MPLA also increases antibody-dependent phagocytic activity in humans, we analyzed responses in 26 participants of a phase 1 clinical trial (AVEG015, NCT00001042) that compared HIV-1<sub>SF-2</sub> gp120 protein vaccination adjuvanted with either alum or a liposomal-MPLA-alum formulation (n = 13 per arm) [<xref rid="ppat.1008764.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The liposome components used in this study were identical to those of ALFA, but the protein immunogen was encapsulated within the liposomes rather than external to them [<xref rid="ppat.1008764.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Protein immunizations were administered at weeks 0, 8, 24, and 72. Prior analysis of Env-specific IgG binding antibody responses revealed 32- and 4-fold higher median titers with the liposomal adjuvant compared to alum at peak immunogenicity (week 26) and week 112, respectively [<xref rid="ppat.1008764.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Here, we found peak ADCP and ADNP responses were also greater (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008764.g005">Fig 5A</xref>, <italic>P =</italic> 0.008 and <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001, respectively). Moreover, alum only weakly elicited ADNP responses, which marginally increased from baseline to week 26 (<italic>P =</italic> 0.07). In contrast, much higher ADNP responses were generated with the liposomal adjuvant (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001). Of note, the magnitude of the increase in peak ADCP responses relative to alum was similar to that observed in the macaques: the median score increased by about ten in both liposomal groups; ADNP scores improved by a larger margin in macaques (~20 versus 40 in humans and NHP, respectively). At week 112, ADCP responses were still apparent but did not differ by adjuvant, while ADNP responses persisted in the liposome group (<italic>P =</italic> 0.01 relative to baseline) and remained greater with liposome than alum (<italic>P =</italic> 0.03). Peak ADCP and ADNP responses were both highly correlated with contemporaneous Env-specific binding antibody titers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008764.g005">Fig 5B</xref>), suggesting that the increase in peak phagocytic responses achieved by liposomal adjuvanting is most likely explained by greater titers.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>HIV-1 Env gp145 protein vaccination adjuvanted with ALFA combined with MVA priming demonstrated a remarkable 90% efficacy in male macaques against a stringent, difficult to neutralize tier 2 heterologous SHIV challenge, while adjuvanting with alum conferred no protection. Few pre-clinical HIV-1 vaccine studies have achieved this level of protection. ALFA increased HIV-specific ADCP, ADNP and mucosal T cell responses, and the antibody-dependent phagocytic responses highly correlated with reduced risk of infection. While vaccine-mediated protection was not observed in females, immune responses were largely similar in males and females and therefore the ALFA adjuvant appeared equally immunogenic in both sexes. Evaluation of liposomal-MPLA-alum adjuvanted gp120 in humans also demonstrated increased Env-specific ADCP and ADNP responses relative to alum. These data support future studies with ALFA as a promising and safe adjuvant formulation that elicits protective antibody effector responses in both NHP and humans.</p>
              <p>Our pre-clinical vaccine efficacy study was modeled after the RV144 trial, as was the HVTN 702 trial. Despite the failure of the latter to demonstrate a reduction in infection rates, there is compelling evidence that the results from RV144 remain valid. These clinical trials differed in many respects, including vaccine immunogens, adjuvant, HIV-1 circulating strains and their diversity, and infection risk within the respective populations [<xref rid="ppat.1008764.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In addition, the hypotheses generated by RV144 regarding the protective role of V1V2-specific antibody responses have been borne out repeatedly in several macaque efficacy studies [<xref rid="ppat.1008764.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], including here. The MF59 adjuvant employed in HVTN702 was previously reported to increase both binding and non-neutralizing antibody responses relative to alum in macaques [<xref rid="ppat.1008764.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], and therefore it will be important to determine whether these responses were also augmented in humans. Though the present macaque study evaluated adjuvanting of protein vaccination in the setting of pox vector priming, our findings are expected to be relevant for other regimens as well. ALFA increased antibody-dependent phagocytosis in the absence of pox vector priming in the AVEG015 clinical trial, indicating adjuvant-mediated augmentation of ADCP and ADNP responses is not limited to pox-protein vaccination.</p>
              <p>Our finding that antibody-dependent phagocytic activities correlate with vaccine efficacy lends substantial support to the emerging notion that non-neutralizing functions of antibodies can mediate protection from HIV/SIV infection with multiple vaccine regimens [<xref rid="ppat.1008764.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1008764.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Moreover, we demonstrate that liposomal adjuvants can be used to increase ADCP and ADNP responses in both NHP and humans relative to alum. ADCP might be a particularly relevant mechanism of protection for intrarectal transmission, where macrophages greatly outnumber NK cells and neutrophils [<xref rid="ppat.1008764.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Previously, the adjuvant MF59 elicited greater antibody effector functions than alum but did not result in protective immunity [<xref rid="ppat.1008764.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Interestingly, we found that in NHP, ADCP was not associated with IgG binding titers while ADNP was, suggesting that distinct pathways might be involved in the development of these effector functions. Addition of a TLR4 agonist to alum in a prior study did not significantly increase ADCP responses [<xref rid="ppat.1008764.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], possibly implicating the liposomes or liposomes in combination with MPLA for increased responses observed with ALFA. Incorporating different TLR agonists into liposomal adjuvants has also been shown to influence antibody effector functions: TLR4 plus TLR7 agonists resulted in higher ADNP and ADCC responses than TLR4 agonist plus QS21, while the latter promoted antibody-dependent complement deposition and distinct antibody glycoforms [<xref rid="ppat.1008764.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Given the importance of IgG glycosylation in mediating phagocytic effector activity [<xref rid="ppat.1008764.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], it is plausible that alum and ALFA elicit distinct glycosylation patterns that impact phagocytic responses. Alternative possibilities include antibody subclass, epitope specificity, and valency of immune complexes. Liposomal adjuvants may also increase immune responses by promoting uptake of adjuvant-antigen complexes by antigen presenting cells [<xref rid="ppat.1008764.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Future studies evaluating ADCP and ADNP responses elicited by this adjuvant family should consider additional assays that incorporate native conformations of Env, such as virion- or infected cell-based assays, as well as species-matched effector cells to account for Fc receptor differences, as they may better reflect antibody effector activity <italic>in vivo</italic>. The Env-coated bead-based assays used here generally compare favorably to virion phagocytosis assays and have revealed immune correlates identified in other vaccine studies, but they may poorly recapitulate aspects of infected cell phagocytosis.</p>
              <p>While liposomal-MPLA-alum adjuvant increased antibody-dependent phagocytic responses in both humans and NHP, correlations with binding titers differed between the studies, possibly due to differences in the adjuvant formulations. In AVEG015, protein was encapsulated within the liposomes [<xref rid="ppat.1008764.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1008764.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], while ALFA used in the NHP study consisted of immunogen adsorbed to the aluminum salt rather than inside the liposome [<xref rid="ppat.1008764.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Antigen physically associated or attached to the outer surface of liposomes can elicit superior binding and neutralizing antibodies compared to liposome-encapsulated antigen [<xref rid="ppat.1008764.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Other features of ALFA that may be relevant include the use of unilamellar rather than multilamellar liposomes, a lower phospholipid:lipid A ratio, and less MPLA.</p>
              <p>Non-neutralizing antibodies have also been associated with control of SIV replication after vaccination [<xref rid="ppat.1008764.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1008764.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], and yet we did not observe any effect of vaccination on viral load peak or set point. The challenge virus may partially explain these conflicting observations, as post-acute viremia is typically less robust with SHIV. Our findings are consistent with the RV144 trial, however, in which viral load did not differ between the vaccine and placebo groups [<xref rid="ppat.1008764.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p>
              <p>It is not clear why vaccine efficacy was observed in male but not female macaques. One possibility is that the males provided a more sensitive model for detecting adaptive immune-mediated reductions in infection risk given their increased susceptibility to infection. Of note, most pre-clinical macaque vaccine efficacy studies are conducted exclusively in males or with insufficient power to stratify outcome by sex, and thus opportunities to assess sex-based differences have been limited. One study using recombinant adenovirus priming and Env protein boosting observed a delay in SIV acquisition following intrarectal challenge in female but not male macaques [<xref rid="ppat.1008764.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. While the opposite sex was protected in that study compared to the current study, these findings speak to the existence of poorly understood sexual dimorphisms in primate immunity, which is well known in humans and an area of active investigation [<xref rid="ppat.1008764.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1008764.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Future well-powered studies including both sexes will be important to assess the influence of sex on vaccine outcomes. Our observation in humans of humoral responses in males benefiting more than females from the liposomal adjuvant relative to alum further supports sex-based differences in adaptive immune responses to adjuvanted vaccines.</p>
              <p>The sex dichotomy in SHIV acquisition rate observed in this study was also unexpected and striking. Intrarectal infection risk was considerably higher in control males than control females (<italic>P =</italic> 0.006). To our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating a significant impact of sex on mucosal infection rates in rhesus macaques. One possibility is that the adjuvants alone differentially impacted infection risk in males versus females; discerning such effects requires studies comparing adjuvants in the absence of immunogen. Innate immune responses following vaccination also warrant investigation. Few studies have directly compared mucosal infection risk between sexes in either macaques or humans. In a previous report combining control animals from multiple challenge studies, intrarectal SIVmac251 infection rates appeared similar in male and female controls [<xref rid="ppat.1008764.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], although rates were not formally compared. Possible mechanisms underlying the difference observed here include: 1) higher type I interferon response to the SHIV challenge inoculum TLR7 stimulation in females limiting early viral replication [<xref rid="ppat.1008764.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], 2) greater propensity among males to produce TNF upon TLR4 stimulation (via the MPLA in ALFA) increasing viral transcription [<xref rid="ppat.1008764.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], and 3) estradiol-mediated inhibition of viral transcription in females via the repressive estrogen receptor in the LTR [<xref rid="ppat.1008764.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. In humans, by contrast, a recent meta-analysis showed intrarectal HIV-1 acquisition risk to be higher in women than men [<xref rid="ppat.1008764.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], though only one study assessing intrarectal transmission risk in women was available. Taken together, there are limited and inconsistent findings regarding the impact of sex on mucosal transmission rates in humans and NHP and more studies involving females are needed. Establishing whether sex influences mucosal infection risk in other SHIV or SIV models will be important to ensure that future studies including both sexes are adequately powered to assess vaccine efficacy.</p>
              <p>In summary, our findings strongly support future clinical and pre-clinical studies exploring liposomal adjuvants with MPLA and other next-generation immunostimulants aimed at developing a more effective HIV-1 vaccine. Other pathogens lacking protective vaccines may also benefit from incorporation of such adjuvants.</p>

                <title>Binding antibody responses</title>
                <p>Sera were assayed in triplicate for the presence of protein- or peptide-specific IgG antibodies by ELISA as previously described [<xref rid="ppat.1008764.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] except that horseradish peroxidase-labeled affinity-purified goat anti-monkey IgG (Kirkegaard &amp; Perry Labs #5220–0333, polyclonal, Lot 10249162) was used as the secondary antibody. Briefly, 96-well Immulon 2 “U” bottom microtiter plate (Thermo Scientific) were coated with 0.1 μg/well of gp145 or gp70V1V2 protein for 2 hours at 37°C and then blocked overnight at 4°C with 0.5% casein and 0.5% BSA in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 4°C, washed, and incubated for 1 h at 25°C with serial dilutions of test serum. Plates were washed, incubated with goat anti-monkey IgG (described above) for 1 h at 25°C, and washed again. ABTS substrate (KPL) was added for 1 h at 25°C. Plates were analyzed at 405 nm on a SpectraMax 250 plate reader (Molecular Devices). Matched pre-immune sera were used as the negative control for each animal. Data are expressed as endpoint titers defined as the highest dilution that yielded an optical density reading greater than or equal to twice that of the background values. Titers were calculated after subtracting the mean absorbance of triplicate wells lacking antigen. Trimeric subtype C CN54 gp140 protein is derived from HIV-1<sub>97CN54</sub> strain (GenBank accession number <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jvi.asm.org/external-ref?link_type=GEN&amp;access_num=AF286226">AF286226</ext-link>). For the peptide ELISA, wells were coated overnight with 0.2 μg/well of Streptavidin followed by the addition of 0.1 μg/well of biotinylated cyclic-V2 or -V3 peptides (JPT Peptide Technologies) in bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6, for 1 h at 37°C. The wells were blocked overnight with 0.5% milk, 0.1% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) pH 7.4 at 4°C. The rest of the procedure was similar to the protein ELISA described above.</p>
                <p>Binding antibody multiplex assay (BAMA) was performed blinded to vaccine arm as previously described [<xref rid="ppat.1008764.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Linear epitope-specific binding rectal IgG responses were assessed blinded to vaccine arm by peptide array as previously described [<xref rid="ppat.1008764.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], with modifications for mucosal IgG analysis. Mucosal sample specific binding activity (SA) to each peptide was calculated as follows: fluorescence intensity / total IgG concentration in the mucosal sample (μg/ml) * dilution. Response magnitude to each epitope is defined as the highest binding signal to an individual peptide within the region referenced by the epitope name (e.g. “p58-60” indicates the range of peptides covered by the epitopes in the array library). Vaccine-induced binding response magnitude, or Binding Response, is calculated as the log2 fold difference between pre- and post-immunization, where fold difference = (post-immunization SA) / (the greater of the following: a. matched pre-immune SA; or b. non-specific SA); wherein non-specific SA is defined as: (median intensity of all pre-immune samples) / (IgG concentration of the post-immunization sample) * dilution. Non-specific SA represents the level of non-specific binding SA expected of a sample with the same IgG concentration as the post-immunization sample. Only 13 of 16 control animals were included in the array mapping assays for reference purposes; the three excluded animals were deemed “non-responders” by other binding antibody assays.</p>

Fresh peripheral blood leukocytes were used as effector cells and prepared from human or rhesus macaque blood by red blood cell lysis with ACK lysing buffer (ThermoFisher). Following HIV Env antigen biotinylation, 10μl of a 100-fold dilution of the bead–protein conjugate was incubated for 2h at 37°C with 100μl of 125-fold diluted serum or plasma and washed before addition of effector cells (50,000 cells/well). Fresh peripheral blood leukocytes were used as effector cells and prepared from human or rhesus macaque blood by red blood cell lysis with ACK lysing buffer (ThermoFisher). After 1h incubation at 37°C, cells were washed, surface stained, fixed with 2% formaldehyde solution, and evaluated on a LSRII (BD Biosciences).

                <p>Cryopreserved PBMC were thawed, rested overnight in R10 with 50U/ml Benzonase Nuclease (Sigma-Aldrich), and stimulated with peptide pools for 6 h; bronchoalveolar lavage mononuclear cells were stimulated directly <italic>ex vivo</italic> for 16 h. Stimulations consisted of either HIV-1 Env potential T cell epitope pools (1μg/ml, NIH AIDS Reagent Program, 11551) or SIVmac239 Gag peptide pool (2 μg/ml, NIH AIDS Reagent Program, #12364) and were performed in the presence of Brefeldin A (0.7 μl/ml, GolgiPlug<sup>™</sup>, BD Cytofix/Cytoperm Kit, Cat. 555028). Env PTE peptide pools 1–3 (amino acids 4–585) were chosen as they cover the entire extracellular portion (gp120), plus 60 amino acids of the extracellular portion of gp41 (pool 3). Following stimulation, cells were stained serially with LIVE/DEAD Fixable Aqua (ThermoFisher #L34957) and a cocktail of fluorescent-labeled antibodies (BD Biosciences unless otherwise indicated) to cell surface markers CD4-BV605 (OKT4, BioLegend #317438, Lot B216636), CD8-BV711 (RPA-T8, BioLegend #301044, Lot B208239), CD45RA-PE.Cy5.5 (MEM-56, ThermoFisher #MHCD45RA18, Lot 1741577A), CD28-PE.Cy5 (CD28.2, #555730, Lot 6224858), CCR7-PE-CF594 (150503, #562381, Lot 6077673), CD95-BV421 (DX2, BioLegend #305624, Lot B224425).

Sample staining was measured on an LSR II (Becton Dickenson) and data analyzed using FlowJo v.9.9 software (Tree Star, Inc.). CD4 and CD8 T cell subsets were pre-gated on memory markers prior to assessing cytokine expression as previously described as follows: CD95+ and CD28+/- for CD4 T cells; single positive or double negative for CD45RA and CCR7 for CD8 T cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008764.s009">S9 Fig</xref>).

                <title>Primary immune correlates analysis</title>
                <p>The goal of the primary analysis was to determine potential immune correlates of protection. First, immunogenicity data from all assays were analyzed as follows. Assay values below the lower limit of detection (LOD) were imputed as LOD/2. For Fc array data, the mean of the replicates was used for all analyses; intraclass correlation coefficients were estimated for all probes to determine whether variability between replicates was a concern and a sensitivity analysis using one randomly chosen replicate was needed. Titer data were log-2 transformed, and all variables were mean-centered and scaled by the sample standard deviation and treated as continuous for the primary analysis. Assays with little to no variability were excluded from consideration for analysis. For all analyses, <italic>P</italic>-values were adjusted to control the false discovery rate via the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure [<xref rid="ppat.1008764.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], within related subsets of assays (e.g. non-neutralizing effector antibody, Fc array, IgG titers), such that FDR is controlled within a class of assays. Tests with raw <italic>P</italic>-values less than 0.05 and adjusted p-values less than 0.2 were considered significant. Assays at 12.5 and 15 months were analyzed separately, and the <italic>P</italic>-value adjustment was done within each set of hypothesis tests (i.e. HRs in males, in females, and all animals separately).</p>
                <p>To reduce the number of assays assessed in the primary analysis, the correlation between assays was examined to determine assays that appear redundant due to similar patterns with other assays (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008764.s011">S1 Table</xref>). Spearman rank-order correlation coefficients were estimated between all pairs of assays within a class (e.g. IgG titers), and the assay highly correlated (rho&gt;0.7) with the greatest number of other assays was removed until the correlation between all remaining pairs fell below this threshold. If two or more assays were highly correlated with the same number of other assays, one was randomly chosen to remove at that step. For completeness, all assays were analyzed in an exploratory analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008764.s013">S3 Table</xref>).</p>
                <p>The assays remaining after the filtering steps were individually assessed for associations with the risk of infection via Cox proportional hazards models (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008764.s012">S2 Table</xref>). Sex and vaccine arm were included as covariates, along with a sex by assay interaction term to allow for differing patterns of protection between sexes. Similar models were fit without the interaction terms to examine combined-sex associations. Baseline values were also included where available, to adjust for the background noise and possible innate immune responses. Control animals were included in the primary analysis for assays performed for all animals, but they were dropped from sensitivity analyses to assess vaccine-induced effects.</p>

Archived sera from the aluminum hydroxide arm (HIV-1<sub>SF-2</sub> gp120 adsorbed to Alhydrogel) and the liposomal arm (L[HIV-1<sub>SF-2</sub> gp120 + MPL] adsorbed to Alhydrogel) were used (n = 9–13 participants/arm per time point for available specimens; n = 6 females per arm, n = 7 males per arm). Vaccinations occurred at weeks 0, 8, 24 and 72 with 50 μg of gp120 and 0.5 mg of aluminum (aluminum hydroxide arm) or 37.5 μg of encapsulated gp120, 2.2 mg of MPL (RIBI Immunochem Research, Inc.), and 0.5 mg of aluminum (liposomal arm). The liposomes consisted of dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine, dimyristoyl phosphatidylglycerol, cholesterol, and MPL [<xref rid="ppat.1008764.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. These liposomes contained identical lipids as ALFA, but differed in the formulation as follows: 1) gp120 was encapsulated in the liposomes with extensive washing to remove free antigen, prior to liposome adsorption to aluminum; 2) liposomes were multilamellar rather than unilamellar; 3) the phospholipid:lipid A ratio was greater; and 4) the MPLA content was greater.

Each row represents a full binding antibody profile for a single animal with each cell representing a z-score of the response. Columns represent clustered Env-specific antibody responses, generalized by the antibody detection reagent (top row) and Env protein antigen (bottom row) shown by the colored bars along the top. Composite scores were generated for each Env antigen (gp140, gp120, V1V2, and V3) for clustering analysis. <bold>(B)</bold> Principal component analysis (PCA) of binding antibody responses assessed by Fc array among vaccinated animals (no controls) at peak and first challenge. No separate or distinct profiles specific to the ALFA or alum arms were observed. The major variation captured along the first principal (46.2% at 12.5 months and 61.7% at 15 months) was due to vaccine-elicited immune responses, but not a specific adjuvant (alum or ALFA).</p>

Results are grouped by related immunologic assays and time point, represented by different tabs within the spreadsheet.
