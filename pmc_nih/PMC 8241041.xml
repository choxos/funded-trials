                  <p>HIV status awareness is critical for HIV prevention and care but HIV testing rates remain low in Uganda, especially among men. One suggested approach to increase access and utilisation of HIV testing services is HIV self-testing. We explored perceptions of pregnant and lactating women and their male partners who attended antenatal care, and health care providers in a government hospital in Kampala, Uganda, about HIV self-testing for initial or repeat testing for women and their partners during pregnancy and postpartum We draw implications for scaling-up this new testing approach in Uganda.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>This was a qualitative study conducted at Mulago National Referral Hospital, Kampala, Uganda, between April and December 2017. We conducted in-depth interviews with five pregnant or lactating women and their five male partners; five focus group discussions (two with women, two with health workers and one with male partners of women attending antenatal care) and five key informant interviews with health workers providing prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission (PMTCT) services. Data were analysed using content thematic approach.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>There was limited awareness about HIV self-testing especially among pregnant or lactating women and their male partners. Study participants mentioned that HIV self-testing would enable people to know their HIV status faster, they thought the approach would be cost- and time-saving compared to health facility-based HIV testing, improve confidentiality and reduce stigma for those who test HIV positive. They expressed however, a general fear that HIV self-testing would lead to harm to self and others in case one tested HIV positive, including suicide, violence among couples, intentional transmission of HIV, and limited linkage to care due to lack of counselling. The likely misinterpretation of HIV test results especially among those with no or limited education, and possible coercion exerted by male partners on their wives were other potential concerns raised about the use of HIV self-testing.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>There was limited knowledge about HIV self-testing among pregnant and lactating women, their partners and health workers. While the self-testing modality was perceived to be critical for helping people, especially those in casual and distant relationships, to know their HIV status and that of their partners, most study participants believed that HIV self-testing could potentially result in a multitude of negative outcomes in the absence of pre- and post-test counselling. Successful scale-up and integration of self-testing in HIV programs requires community education, provision of information materials and making self-test kits accessible and affordable, especially in rural areas.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>HIV status awareness is critical for HIV prevention and care but HIV testing rates remain low in Uganda particularly among men [<xref rid="pone.0253616.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The World Health Organisation [<xref rid="pone.0253616.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] defines HIV self-testing [<xref rid="pone.0253616.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] as an additional approach to facility-based HIV testing [<xref rid="pone.0253616.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], in which individuals collect their own specimen, perform the test and interpret the results and recommends its use in order to improve HIV testing rates. HIVST is an emerging approach with potential for high impact on HIV prevention, care and treatment [<xref rid="pone.0253616.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. HIVST has been recognized for its potential to overcome traditional barriers to testing. In particular, HIVST has been documented to be convenient and less costly [<xref rid="pone.0253616.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], feasible, accurate and acceptable among the general population [<xref rid="pone.0253616.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0253616.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] including pregnant women and their partners [<xref rid="pone.0253616.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0253616.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Nevertheless, the risks of HIVST as perceived by pregnant and lactating women and their male partners as potential recipients of HIVST as well as their health care providers could limit acceptability and scale-up of this new testing approach. A possibility for coercive testing, inability to test accurately and difficulty to cope with reactive results in the absence of HIV counselling are some of the key concerns documented about the HIV self-testing modality [<xref rid="pone.0253616.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0253616.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The cost of HIVST kits and challenges regarding linkage to care for those who test HIV-positive are other obstacles [<xref rid="pone.0253616.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0253616.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0253616.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0253616.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p>
              <p>In Uganda, HIVST is still a new strategy and has not yet been implemented to scale. The 2018 National Consolidated Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of HIV and AIDS in Uganda recommends the use of HIV self-testing as an additional approach to HIV testing services [<xref rid="pone.0253616.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. It further recommends that individuals whose HIV self-test results are positive should go for further HIV testing for diagnosis confirmation and counseling at the nearest health facility and if confirmed HIV positive, they should be linked to HIV treatment services [<xref rid="pone.0253616.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The majority of pregnant women in many African settings including Uganda, who test for HIV as part of PMTCT programs are HIV- negative, but remain at risk of HIV acquisition during pregnancy and breastfeeding [<xref rid="pone.0253616.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0253616.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Acquiring HIV during pregnancy or breastfeeding increases the risks of adverse health outcomes for mothers and exposes their unborn or breastfeeding babies to higher risks of HIV infection [<xref rid="pone.0253616.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0253616.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Male partner HIV testing as part of antenatal care remains low. Scaling-up HIVST could thus offer both pregnant and non-pregnant women and their male partners an opportunity for initial and repeat HIV testing and those with HIV-positive self-test results can proceed to health facilities for HIV diagnostic testing. However, successful implementation of HIVST will depend on its acceptability by intervention recipients and providers.</p>
              <p>This qualitative study was conducted consecutive to the ‘Primary HIV Prevention among Pregnant and Lactating Ugandan Women’ [<xref rid="pone.0253616.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], a randomised controlled trial (RCT) conducted between 2012 and 2017 that assessed the effect of repeat HIV testing and enhanced counselling for the primary prevention of HIV acquisition in pregnant and lactating women and their male partners during late pregnancy and throughout the breastfeeding period [<xref rid="pone.0253616.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. A qualitative evaluation of the PRIMAL intervention indicated that repeat HIV testing and enhanced counselling at health facilities were acceptable and could enhance risk reduction among pregnant and lactating women [<xref rid="pone.0253616.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Here, we explored perceptions of pregnant and lactating women, their male partners and health care providers regarding both initial and repeat HIV self-testing for women and their male partners during pregnancy and lactation in Kampala and generated suggestions for potential integration and scale-up of HIV self-testing in PMTCT programs.</p>

                <p>This was a cross-sectional qualitative study conducted at Mulago National Referral Hospital in Kampala, Uganda, between April and December 2017. The study was consecutive to the PRIMAL RCT, whose methodology and quantitative outcomes have been reported previously [<xref rid="pone.0253616.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0253616.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. This follow-on qualitative study was conducted among selected 12 men, 22 women and 23 health care providers who either had participated in the PRIMAL study or were seeking or providing antenatal care services at Mulago Hospital (distinct numbers in each group provided in data collection section below). All study participants were from Kampala and Wakiso Districts (both of which encompass together the city of Kampala). All health workers including those who had worked in the PRIMAL study, had been involved in the national PMTCT program for over five years.</p>

                <title>Study setting</title>
                <p>Mulago National Referral Hospital, located in Kampala, Uganda’s capital city, is the teaching hospital for Makerere University College of Health Sciences and other medical training institutions. HIV counseling and testing services are provided routinely to all women attending their first ANC visit daily Monday through Friday as well as to all women considered at risk of intermittent infection when presenting for delivery at maternity. Pregnant women are encouraged by the hospital staff to attend ANC with their male partners and test for HIV together. On average, 90 pregnant women are seen per ANC day.</p>

                <title>Data collection</title>
                <p>Data were collected from a total of 57 study participants through 10 in-depth interviews, five focus group discussions and five key informant interviews. The 10 in-depth interviews were conducted with five lactating women, four men who took part in the PRIMAL study, and one male partner of a pregnant woman enrolled in the general PMTCT program who preferred to be interviewed as an individual instead of being part of the FGD. Female study participants from the PRIMAL study were called and selected based on their availability and interest in participating in the study. The fifth male partner who took part in an in-depth interview was recruited among men who had accompanied their women to attend ANC at Mulago but had not taken part in the PRIMAL study. We explained the purpose of this study and asked the individuals mentioned above if they were willing to participate. All accepted were invited for an interview on a day and time convenient to them at Makerere University-Johns Hopkins University Research Collaboration (MUJHU Care) which is situated on Mulago Hospital complex. Separate interviews were conducted for women and their partners.</p>
                <p>Five focus group discussions (FGDs) of 7–10 participants each (total 42 participants) were conducted. Each FGD included a distinct group of participants: group 1) seven pregnant HIV-negative women attending ANC, group 2) 10 HIV positive pregnant women attending ANC, group 3) seven male partners of women attending ANC, group 4) 10 health workers involved in the provision of PMTCT services, and group 5) eight health workers who implemented the PRIMAL Study. The FGD participants in groups 1–4 were not part of the PRIMAL study while group 5 has been part of PRIMAL and this combination of participants facilitated comparison of perspectives regarding HIVST. Women and male partner FGD participants attending ANC were identified by attending health workers during ANC clinic visits and directed to members of the study team who provided information, recruited participants in the study and conducted the FGDs in a separate room at the hospital. Discussions were conducted by two qualitative researchers, one as a facilitator and the other as a note taker.</p>
                <p>In addition, four health workers (a doctor, midwife, counselor and male peer counselor) involved in the provision of PMTCT services and one counselor who took part in the PRIMAL Study participated in key informant interviews.</p>
                <p>The interview and FGD guides (included as Supporting Information) were developed by the study team informed by an extensive literature search. They explored awareness about HIV self-testing, perceived benefits and challenges of using self-testing and more specifically to reach male partners, and implications for integrating self-testing in the PMTCT program as well as the potential for scaling-up the approach. After answering the question on awareness, use of an oral HIVST kit was explained to study participants to enable them appraise its benefits and challenges. Interviews and FGDs with women and their male partners were conducted in Luganda, the main language spoken in Kampala, while those with health workers were conducted in English. All interviews and discussions were audio recorded and transcribed. On average interviews lasted 45–60 minutes and FGDs 60–90 minutes.</p>
                <p>Data collection was phased, starting with in-depth interviews, followed by FGDs and finally key informant interviews. This approach to data collection enabled researchers to probe insights from one method of data collection to inform the subsequent data collection exercise. At the end of the interviews or FGDs, no new insights were emerging and no further data collection was undertaken.</p>

                <title>Data management and analysis</title>
                <p>Data were transcribed and translated verbatim by a professional transcriber proficient in both Luganda and English. The first author (JR), who conducted all interviews and FGDs checked the transcripts for completeness. Data analysis was a continuous and iterative process guided by qualitative content thematic approach [<xref rid="pone.0253616.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. A code book was developed by the first and last author (RK) following reading of scripts several times to identify latent and manifest themes and sub-themes. Coding was done by JR who met regularly with RK to discuss emerging issues. Results were synthesised based on study themes and discussed at a study team meeting. Direct quotations were selected and used in presentation of study results. Throughout the process of data analysis, views of pregnant and lactating women, their male partners and health care providers were triangulated.</p>

                <p>The study was approved by Makerere University School of Medicine Research and Ethics Committee (SOMREC- Ref No. 2012–157), Uganda National Council for Science and Technology (UNCST- HS 1269), and the Committee on Human Research of the University of California San Francisco, USA (Study # 11–08151). On the day of the interview or FGD, each potential study participant was taken through the objectives, methods, procedures, benefits and risks of participating in the study and assured that no consequence was to result from their decision to participate or not. After verifying their understanding, those confirming their willingness to participate were asked to provide written consent before taking part in the study.</p>

                <p>Some study participants argued that HIV self-testing can be done any time thus making it a convenient approach unlike health facility-based testing which is subject to opening and closing hours. Self-testing was particularly considered more advantageous than health facility-based testing for people with limited time, mostly men who are often busy looking for money to take care of their families. Most study participants viewed HIV self-testing as a potential gateway to increase testing rates for male partners who in general are hesitant to attend antenatal care clinics and test for HIV with their female partners.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>In this qualitative study, we describe perceptions of pregnant women, their male partners and health care providers regarding HIV self-testing in Kampala, Uganda and participants’ suggestions to facilitate potential integration and scaling-up of self-testing as part of the national PMTCT program.</p>
              <p>Study findings revealed limited awareness about HIV self-testing among women, their male partners and health workers. This finding is not surprising given that this testing approach is still new and has only been part of pilot studies in Uganda [<xref rid="pone.0253616.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The limited awareness on HIVST in this study reflects a need for raising awareness as part of scaling-up the HIV self-testing strategy. Most women and their male partners as well as health workers, expressed doubts about people’s ability to use HIV self-testing kits appropriately and to interpret results correctly, especially among people with no or low education. Taken together, the limited awareness and widespread reservations about HIV self-testing imply that both health workers and community members sustained programs to educate potential users about HIV self-testing as part of scaling-up HIV testing in Uganda and similar low-income settings.</p>
              <p>Our study revealed divergent and often contested perceptions about HIV self-testing in supplementing the existing HIV testing strategies. Regarding the perceived benefits of HIV self-testing, most study participants mentioned that the testing approach can enable people to know their HIV status faster compared to health-facility based approaches and is cost-saving in terms of transport or time to go and wait at health facilities or testing centres. In this regard, HIV self-testing was considered suitable and with potential to reach men currently underserved by, or unwilling to test at, health facilities especially as part of maternal and child health programs [<xref rid="pone.0253616.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] which largely target women. Some studies have indicated that due to difficulties of men accessing HIV testing services, some of them rely on results of their female partners and assume similar HIV status [<xref rid="pone.0253616.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In this regard, HIV self-testing could be a gateway for men and other groups of people constrained by time to know their HIV status, and for those found to be HIV-positive to enroll in care.</p>
              <p>In line with our findings, an earlier study conducted in Kenya, Malawi and South Africa on attributes of an ideal HIV self-test, revealed that self-testing would save on time spent waiting in long queues at health facilities and traveling to and from health facilities [<xref rid="pone.0253616.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0253616.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0253616.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The time and cost saving benefits of HIV self-testing are of particular relevance to Uganda and other low-income settings given that COVID-19 and related restrictions have increased the cost of seeking health care. A recent qualitative study conducted in South Western Uganda revealed that COVID-19 is inhibiting access to and uptake of HIV testing services through lack of transportation, poverty and stigma related to the pandemic [<xref rid="pone.0253616.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Fear of being exposed to COVID -19 at health facilities has also been noted [<xref rid="pone.0253616.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Thus, prompt scale-up of HIV self–testing as part of existing HIV programs has potential to sustain access to HIV testing services in Uganda and other sub-Saharan African countries during the COVID pandemic.</p>
              <p>The perception that HIV self-testing was convenient and guarantees privacy was recurrent in most interviews and discussions in our study. This desire for privacy among our study participants could be in part a reflection of continued stigma and the need for people to have autonomy over HIV testing and results. Being convenient, providing for privacy and autonomy as desired attributes of HIV self-testing have also been highlighted as key benefits of the testing approach by the World Health Organisation [<xref rid="pone.0253616.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0253616.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Our findings on the benefits of HIV self-testing are also consistent with what has been documented in other African settings. In Ethiopia, HIV self-testing was preferred among health workers due to confidentiality [<xref rid="pone.0253616.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. A community study done in Rakai, Uganda, also highlighted privacy, convenience and ability to test before sex as key benefits of HIV self-testing [<xref rid="pone.0253616.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Recent reviews on HIV testing approaches [<xref rid="pone.0253616.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and HIVST [<xref rid="pone.0253616.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] in sub-Saharan Africa revealed that HIVST can leverage social and sexual networks to reach those unlikely to be reached by HIV programs, increases opportunities for people to test when they want, can increase testing for men, youth and key populations [<xref rid="pone.0253616.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and provides men with an alternative, confidential and convenient testing model [<xref rid="pone.0253616.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. These widely appreciated HIV self-testing benefits by women, men and health workers in our study should be building blocks for community education and the scale-up of HIV self-testing as an additional testing approach.</p>
              <p>A unique benefit of HIV self-testing highlighted in our study is the potential to promote faithfulness among couples especially those living apart from each other including truck drivers and those in new relationships. Many study participants noted that these could undertake HIV testing as couples before engaging in or resuming sexual activity. As such, self-testing would challenge and encourage couples to be faithful to each other to avoid HIV infection. HIV self-testing has previously been found to be acceptable and feasible among truck drivers but stressed the need to provide supervised support and an opportunity for users to ask questions [<xref rid="pone.0253616.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Our study findings also indicated that HIV self-testing can provide an opportunity for people in doubt of their HIV results to confirm their HIV status. The idea of some people doubting HIV test results given their own risk perception has also been documented in eastern Uganda [<xref rid="pone.0253616.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and can hinder HIV prevention for those who test HIV negative or enrolling in care for those who test HIV positive. It is important that, as part of activities to scale-up HIVST, community education emphasizes the need for individuals whose HIV self-test results are positive to go for further HIV testing and counseling at health facilities [<xref rid="pone.0253616.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. HIVST was also viewed to have potential to enable women and men to conduct repeat HIV-testing which is critical to enhance primary HIV prevention [<xref rid="pone.0253616.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0253616.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0253616.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p>

                <title>Potential disadvantages of HIV self-testing likely to hinder scale-up</title>
                <p>The major perceived disadvantages of HIV self-testing by our study participants were; perceived inability to conduct the test and interpret results accurately, possible difficulty in coping with positive HIV test results for self and others, a possibility of coercive HIV testing of women by their male partners, and potential failure to enroll in care following HIV positive results.</p>
                <p>Women, men and health workers in our study expressed fear that many people would be unable to conduct HIV self-testing and interpret results accurately owing to lack of knowledge and skills. Most study participants considered HIV testing highly technical and preferred that it should be left to trained health workers. Inability to conduct HIV self-testing accurately and difficulties to cope with positive test results in the absence of HIV counselling to prepare an individual for the test and managing test results have been documented by others as barriers to scaling-up HIV self-testing [<xref rid="pone.0253616.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0253616.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0253616.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Study participants noted that the difficulties to conduct HIV self-testing and interpret results appropriately may be more pronounced in rural areas where educational levels are low. This worry may have considerable relevance for Uganda given that the vast majority of Ugandans (close to 80%) live in rural areas [<xref rid="pone.0253616.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Consistent with our findings, a study done in South Africa on differentiated HIV testing approaches revealed that HIV self-testing and HIV counselling and testing can co-exist and complement each other [<xref rid="pone.0253616.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p>
                <p>Most of the concerns related to inability to cope with the positive HIV test results and negative outcomes (separation, depression, fear of being abandoned or accused of bringing HIV to the family, intentionally transmitting HIV, violence and suicidal ideation) were linked to the absence of professional counselling and support by health workers for HIVST. These findings are not surprising given that since the advent of HIV in Uganda in the 1980s, pre and post-test counseling by health workers have been the norm and a backbone of HIV testing. These findings re-echo a need to ensure that HIV counseling is available and should be an integral part of scaling-up HIVST. Similar to our findings, a study conducted in other central Ugandan districts also documented fears of marital disruption and suicidal ideation and linked these to the absence of HIV counseling [<xref rid="pone.0253616.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p>
                <p>The risk of suicide following HIVST in the absence of counseling has also been documented in a qualitative study done in Kenya, Malawi and South Africa [<xref rid="pone.0253616.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In another Kenyan study, two cases of intimate partner violence were reported by women delivering HIVST kits to their partners [<xref rid="pone.0253616.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. On the contrary, a community-based study promoting HIVST conducted in urban Malawi reported no cases of suicide or intimate partner violence attributed to HIVST [<xref rid="pone.0253616.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Similarly, no serious adverse events were reported post-HIVST in Uganda [<xref rid="pone.0253616.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], an indication that these fears may be overestimated in qualitative studies. Coercion as a social harm was reported by 3% of the respondents in the same Malawian study [<xref rid="pone.0253616.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. It is important that mechanisms for monitoring and responding to social harms following HIVST be part of plans for scale-up of the testing approach.</p>
                <p>Other disadvantages of HIV self-testing raised in our study include limited access to test kits and their cost which may make the testing approach out of reach to low-income earners and those living in rural areas. High cost as a barrier to use and scale-up of HIVST has been highlighted in other African studies [<xref rid="pone.0253616.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0253616.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0253616.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The concerns about affordability as a likely barrier to use of HIV self-testing are relevant given that 21.4% of Ugandans are estimated to be living below the poverty line [<xref rid="pone.0253616.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The implication here is that making HIVST accessible and affordable will be key to its utilization.</p>
                <p>To counter the disadvantages likely to hinder scaling-up of HIV self-testing in Uganda, study participants recommended public education about the testing approach, provision of information and education materials including those with clear instructions and visual aids, as well as training of health workers to promote HIV self-testing. The implication here is that the potential scale-up of HIV self-testing in HIV programs should go hand in hand with a strong behaviour change communication component highlighting the benefits and how to minimize the potential disadvantages of the approach.</p>
                <p>Similar to our findings, a study on men’s experiences of HIVST in Rwanda recommended health education and awareness creation about the testing approach and ensuring that test kits are available at a low cost. Also making self-test kits accessible over the counter or in the same manner as condoms including distribution through home visits, use of call centres for ordering kits and collection from local leaders, supermarkets and pharmacies [<xref rid="pone.0253616.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] are other strategies to improve access. A review of men’s perspectives on HIVST in sub-Saharan Africa recommended the use of community-level campaigns to educate men about HIVST and implementing strategies to ensure potential HIVST users are counseled and supported to test [<xref rid="pone.0253616.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Having user friendly HIVST kit instructions [<xref rid="pone.0253616.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and translating them into local languages [<xref rid="pone.0253616.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] are other key strategies to improve use of the HIVST.</p>
                <p>Our study findings should be interpreted in light of the following strengths and limitations.</p>
                <p>Use of qualitative methods of data collection facilitated an in-depth understanding of perceptions regarding HIV self-testing and what might be needed for its scale-up. The inclusion of pregnant and lactating women, their male partners and health care providers in the study enabled triangulation of data which helped to improve the trustworthiness of our findings. However, the study was conducted at a public hospital in the general antenatal care setting, thus the results apply to the population at this type of health facility but may not reflect the perceptions of women and men of higher socio-economic status. As well, the study was conducted at a tertiary hospital with experienced health workers often involved in research, and whose awareness about HIVST may be higher than what may be found at lower level and in rural health facilities with minimal exposure to research. The study was also conducted in Kampala, the capital city of Uganda, whose population tends to be more educated and informed. Thus the awareness and perceptions of this population may be different from those of rural dwellers. Nevertheless, the fact that our findings especially regarding the benefits and disadvantages of HIVST were similarly documented in other Ugandan settings [<xref rid="pone.0253616.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and other African countries is reassuring that our findings may have wider applicability beyond the study area.</p>
                <p>Data for the study was collected in 2017 before Uganda started rolling out HIVST. With ongoing rollout, awareness might have slightly improved given that the rollout process has been slow. Thus more studies are needed to assess changes in awareness and stakeholder perceptions about HIVST as the testing modality becomes more available in Uganda and other African settings. In this study, we did not demonstrate how the HIVST kit works which would have improved study participants’ familiarity with the kit. Indeed, some of the study participants kept referring to use of blood samples possibly reflecting as a common approach of collecting HIV testing samples through finger pricks which they have been able to experience or witness at most health facilities in Uganda. Future studies should include a demonstration session on the use of HIVST kits. However, given that our findings on awareness, benefits and limitations of the HIVST testing approach are consistent with what has been documented in Uganda [<xref rid="pone.0253616.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0253616.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and other African settings [<xref rid="pone.0253616.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0253616.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0253616.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] supports the validity of our findings.</p>

              <title>Conclusion and recommendations</title>
              <p>Although there was limited knowledge and experience about HIV self-testing among pregnant and lactating women, their male partners and health workers in Kampala, HIV self-testing was perceived as having the potential to help individuals and couples, especially those in casual and distant relationships to know their HIV status and that of their partners faster, more conveniently, saving cost and time, and guaranteeing privacy and confidentiality. The approach was also deemed to possibly encourage partners to be faithful to each other and could be an important tool for the integration of repeat postpartum testing into PMTCT programs. The major potential disadvantages of HIV self-testing perceived were a risk of harm to self or others including domestic violence and family breakdown in case of positive HIV self-test results as well as poor linkage to care due to the absence of pre and post-test counselling. Thus successful integration and scale-up of HIV self-testing in Uganda will require raising awareness and ensuring adequate linkages among health workers and community members about this new testing approach. Provision of information, education and communication materials including use of visual aids, making test kits available at no or low cost, and ensuring available and functional counselling support to users of HIVST especially in rural areas are key to scaling-up. Further research is needed to understand changes in awareness and perceptions about HIVST as the strategy is being scaled-up in Uganda and other African countries.</p>
