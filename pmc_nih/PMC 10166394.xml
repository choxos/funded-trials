                <title>PURPOSE</title>

                  <p>This noninferiority randomized trial is taking place in El Salvador, China, and Colombia. Patients are 1,152 eligible women with biopsy-confirmed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or higher who will receive one of three ablation treatments. Pain is measured before, during, and after treatment with a visual analog scale (1-10). Side effects and acceptability are assessed at 6 weeks.</p>

                  <title>RESULTS</title>
                  <p>To date, 1,024 of 1,152 (89%) women were randomly assigned to treatment. The median pain level was higher during TA (4, IQR = 4) than CO<sub>2</sub> (2, IQR = 4) or nongas cryotherapy (2, IQR = 4) (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; .01, range: 0-10). The most common post-treatment symptom was watery discharge, reported by 97.9% of women, and it lasted longer in the CO<sub>2</sub> group than the other two treatments (in days, median [IQR]: CO<sub>2</sub> = 20[20], nongas cryotherapy = 15[10], TA = 18[15], <italic toggle="yes">P &lt; .</italic>01). Bleeding was reported more frequently in women treated with TA (27.6%) than CO<sub>2</sub> (17.5) or nongas cryotherapy (18.7%) (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; .01). The majority of patients reported being very satisfied with the treatment they received at 6 weeks (91%) and again at 12 months post-treatment (97%).</p>

                  <p>Despite differences in pain and side effects across ablation treatments, all were safe and highly acceptable to patients. In addition to efficacy, considerations such as cost and portability may be more significant in choosing a treatment method.</p>

              <p>The WHO recommends either ablation methods or excisional surgeries to treat high-grade precancer (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or higher [CIN2+]),<sup><xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> but the latter require costly infrastructure and highly trained personnel. Ablation treatments that use extreme temperatures to destroy precancerous cells are the most feasible in low-resource settings. This ongoing randomized clinical trial (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT0308408" ext-link-type="uri">NCT0308408</ext-link>) is comparing the efficacy and safety of three ablation treatments: gas-based cryotherapy (the standard of care in many LMICs), nongas cryotherapy, and thermal ablation (TA). The primary hypothesis is that CIN2+ cure rates of nongas cryotherapy and TA will be noninferior to gas-based cryotherapy after 1 year. These final efficacy results will be available at the end of 2023 after all randomly assigned patients return for a 12-month follow-up or are considered lost to follow-up. Here, we present early findings on side effects, feasibility, and patient acceptability based on 89% of the estimated sample size.</p>
              <p>Gas-based cryotherapy uses carbon dioxide or nitrous oxide gas to cool a probe to temperatures below −50°C that is applied to the cervix. Although effective (cure rates range from 77% to 93%)<sup><xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> and simple to use by providers at all levels,<sup><xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>-<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> the requirement of a consumable good is a significant barrier. Procurement, cost, and transportation of gas cylinders prevent robust scale-up of treatment programs. In addition, poor gas quality, leakages, and blockages can lead to equipment malfunctioning.<sup><xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Our team has found evidence that, without regular maintenance, cryotherapy units may not reach therapeutic temperatures.<sup><xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup></p>
              <p>We have collaborated with two biomedical companies to adapt two technologies that do not require gas to treat CIN2+. The portable CryoPen (CryoPen, Inc, Southlake, TX) is a nongas cryotherapy device originally used in dermatology. The development of this device for cervical precancer treatment has been documented elsewhere.<sup><xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> The CryoPen uses a Stirling cooler to freeze a probe that is applied in a similar manner to gas-based cryotherapy. TA (aka cold coagulation, thermocoagulation, and thermoablation) uses heat rather than cold to destroy cervical precancer. Our team partnered with WiSAP Medical Technologies, GmbH (Brunnthal, Germany), to adapt a desktop TA instrument into a handheld, battery-operated device. The desktop unit has been used since the 1970s, and meta-analyses of its efficacy have found cure rates of 93.8%-96%.<sup><xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> The WHO endorsed TA for precancer treatment in 2019.<sup><xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> There are currently three portable TA units commercially available. This technology has emerged as an alternative to cryotherapy that can easily be used in hard-to-reach areas.<sup><xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>-<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Descriptions of the three treatment modalities compared in this trial are showed in Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.</p>

Preliminary results from a large-scale trial found that fewer than 2% of patients experienced moderate or severe pain after both treatments<sup><xref rid="b38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>; however, another recent study found that 16% of women experienced moderate or severe pain with TA.<sup><xref rid="b39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> Here, we provide a systematic evaluation of side effects, adverse events including pain, and patient acceptability of gas-based cryotherapy, nongas cryotherapy (CryoPen), and TA across three different LMICs.</p>

              <p>The trial is taking place at the Hospital 1° de Mayo of the Instituto del Seguro Social in San Salvador, El Salvador; Hospital Universitario San Ignacio in Bogotá, Colombia; and the Shanxi Bethune Hospital in Taiyuan, Shanxi Province, China. Patients were also recruited during a 3-month enrollment period at three women's health hospitals in Xinxiang, a semirural area in Henan Province, China. Patient enrollment began on June 19, 2017, with the goal of randomly assigning 1,152 patients to the three treatment arms: gas-based cryotherapy (referent), CryoPen, and TA. Data presented here range from initial enrollment to November 30, 2021, and include 1,248 women, of which 1,024 (82%) were randomly assigned to treatment.</p>
              <p>Inclusion criteria were women older than 18 years, with biopsy-confirmed CIN2, grade 2-3 (CIN2-3), grade 3 (CIN3), or high-grade CIN not otherwise specified (hereafter, all these summarized as CIN2+), who consented to participate in the study, and were willing and able to provide a reliable address. Exclusion criteria were pregnancy or plans to become pregnant during the study, previous surgery destructive to the cervix within the last 3 years, and history of total hysterectomy.</p>
              <p>Women were invited to participate after screening medical charts for eligibility (see Fig <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> for CONSORT diagram). Potential patients were taken to a private room for informed consent procedures. Consented women were administered a sociodemographic and health background questionnaire, followed by a urine pregnancy test. Those with positive pregnancy results were excluded from further participation. Others underwent a speculum examination by a trained gynecologist to visually assess contraindications to ablation treatment. Ineligibility for ablation included lesions that covered more than 75% of the cervix, extended into the endocervical canal, or extended further than the surface of the smallest probe tip of the three devices, a disfigured or hard to reach cervix, a not fully visible squamocolumnar junction, and suspicion of invasive cancer. Eligible patients were assigned to one of the three following treatments using site-stratified random assignment:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>CO<sub>2</sub> gas-based cryotherapy (CO<sub>2</sub>): double-freeze (freeze for 3 minutes, thaw for 5 minutes, and freeze for 3 minutes) using a Medgyn Cryotherapy System MGC-200 (Medgyn Products, Inc, Addison, IL),</p></list-item><list-item><p>Nongas cryotherapy: single-freeze (5-minute freeze) with CryoPen, or</p></list-item><list-item><p>TA with a portable device: 40-second application at 100°C followed by additional 20-second applications as necessary to cover the entire squamocolumnar junction using a WiSAP C3 thermocoagulator.</p></list-item></list></p>

              <p>At the treatment visit, self-reported pain levels were obtained via the Wong-Baker FACES Scale.<sup><xref rid="b42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> This tool consists of a visual representation of simplified faces expressing pain levels that correspond to numbers from 0 to 10 (0 = no hurt and 10 = hurts worst). Pain was evaluated at four points: before speculum introduction, after speculum introduction but before treatment, during treatment, and within 5 minutes after speculum removal. After treatment, a provider explained post-treatment recommendations (ie, avoidance of immersion baths, vaginal douches, inserting tampons into the vagina, and sexual relations). At the 6-week visit, patients underwent a speculum examination and were administered a questionnaire to assess duration (in days) and intensity (mild, moderate, or severe as a multiple-choice item) of side effects. Patients also evaluated their adherence to post-treatment recommendations and responded to a brief acceptability assessment which was repeated at the 12-month follow-up visit.</p>

                <title>Data Analysis</title>
                <p>A descriptive analysis of sociodemographic and health history variables, pain, side effects, and patient satisfaction was performed using central tendency measures and percentages. Differences by site and treatment arm were assessed with one-way ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis, chi-square, and Fisher's tests. All statistical analyses were carried out using R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). Responses to the open satisfaction question were analyzed via content analysis. An inductive approach was used to develop a coding scheme, and two coauthors (R.J.M. and G.C.R.) coded all answers independently. Inter-rater (ie, intercoder) reliability was calculated, and any discrepancies were adjudicated by another coauthor (M.S.) to determine overall frequency. All study procedures were reviewed and approved by the Cleveland Clinic Institutional Review Board and the ethics committees of local institutions in El Salvador, Colombia, and China.</p>

                <p>During or after treatment, 282 of 1,024 women (27.5%) experienced symptoms of vasovagal syncope, including dizziness, nausea, headache, and flushing. The majority of cases were reported in China (n = 265 [94%] <italic toggle="yes">v</italic> n = 8 [3%] in El Salvador and n = 9 [3%] in Colombia) and occurred with CO<sub>2</sub> (n = 138 [13.5%]) or CryoPen (n = 120 [11.7%]) rather than TA (n = 24, 2.3%). Symptoms resolved in a few minutes with minimal intervention. The informed consent was amended (October 18, 2018) to include vasovagal reactions as potential treatment side effects.</p>
                <p>At the 6-week follow-up visit, data were collected on intensity and duration (in days) of common side effects (Table <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). In total, 4% (n = 41) of women reported seeking medical attention for their symptoms. In two cases, this was due to difficulty urinating while the remainder cited pelvic pain, bleeding, and/or discharge. In El Salvador, one patient was admitted to the study hospital for 3 days to receive intravenous antibiotics. At least 24 of 41 (59%) patients who returned for medical treatment were prescribed analgesics, antibiotic, or antifungal treatment. The remaining cases involved providers outside of the study centers or did not require further treatment.</p>

                <title>Patient Acceptability</title>
                <p>At the 6-week and 12-month follow-up visits, 91% (n = 649/713) and 97% (648/668) of women, respectively, reported feeling very satisfied with the treatment they received (other options were somewhat satisfied, neutral, somewhat dissatisfied, and very dissatisfied). There were no differences across treatments. Women were also asked if they would recommend the treatment they received to a friend. At the 6-week visit, 94% (879/934) replied definitely yes and 4% (42/934) replied probably yes; these responses were 97% (648/668) and 1% (9/668), respectively, at the 12-month visit. A follow-up open question asked women to explain why they would or would not recommend the treatment they received. Responses from the 6-week visit (n = 921) were coded with high inter-rater agreement (Table <xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">5</xref>). The other category included infrequent responses and themes that could be attributed to the nature of the study rather than features of the treatments (eg, no cost, extensive follow-up). There were few differences in the frequency of themes associated with each treatment, but significant variation across sites (Table <xref rid="tbl6" ref-type="table">6</xref>). In addition, over 98% of women reported following recommendations to avoid baths, vaginal douches, and the use of tampons, although adherence to sexual abstinence was lower (92.9%) across sites (Colombia = 74.1%, El Salvador = 90.1%, and China = 94.1%, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; .01). No associations were found between adherence to recommendations and frequency of common side effects.</p>

                <title>Problems With Equipment or Treatment Application</title>
                <p>CO<sub>2</sub> equipment malfunctions (n = 11) included gas leaks, low gas tank pressure, probe tip not freezing, or problems with probe defrosting. With CryoPen (n = 8), the temperature indicator malfunctioned, plastic probes broke, and in one instance, the probe jammed in the cooler. Finally, with TA (n = 5), the probe tip did not heat up and electrical outlets malfunctioned. Seven patients were referred to excisional treatment due to malfunctions; in the remaining cases, the issue was resolved or a replacement unit or part was used to complete treatment. In addition, 10 women were referred to excision after incorrect placement of the treatment probe or a clinical determination that the lesion had not been properly treated (eg, the cervix did not appear frozen or the lesion was too large).</p>

                <title>Adverse Events</title>
                <p>Five unanticipated or serious adverse events were reported. This included a vaginal infection at the initial visit, an infection post-treatment that resulted in a 3-day hospitalization (described above), a diagnosis of adenomatous carcinoma 10 months after treatment, a patient with a worsening lesion at 6 months post-treatment, and a case where the treatment probe caused a minor injury to the vaginal wall. The patients with invasive cancers had returned for nonprotocol visits when they were diagnosed. The protocol () and informed consent were amended to further inform patients of the risk of infection (October 22, 2018) and incorrect probe placement (July 12, 2019).</p>

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>Gas-based cryotherapy is the most common treatment for CIN2+ in LMICs, but the challenges of gas procurement have prompted the development of alternatives.<sup><xref rid="b43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> However, there is limited evidence that directly compares side effects and acceptability of different ablation methods. Our findings indicate differences in pain during treatment and side effects, but similar levels of patient acceptability across treatments. Some symptoms and perceptions are highly context-dependent. These results can help guide clinical practice to select treatment methods that are most suitable for specific populations.</p>
              <p>Women reported a higher level of pain with TA than with either form of cryotherapy, but there were differences across sites (random assignment was stratified by site, and it is unlikely that observed differences were impacted by site sample size). Other studies in China<sup><xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="b37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> have reported higher pain levels with TA compared with cryotherapy. In contrast, a recent large-scale trial in Zambia found that only 2% of women treated with gas-based cryotherapy and TA reported pain.<sup><xref rid="b38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> Sociocultural values (eg, stoicism) or varying interpretations of the measurement tool may influence patient assessments and account for conflicting findings regarding pain. However, overall pain levels were moderate and decreased rapidly after treatment.</p>
              <p>The most common post-treatment symptom was watery discharge, which was more severe and lasted longer with gas-based cryotherapy. In previous studies, discharge has been cited as a frequent side effect of cryotherapy<sup><xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>-<xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> and sometimes of TA.<sup><xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> Bleeding, on the other hand, has been reported more often after TA. In pooled data from Bangladesh, Brazil, and India, mild bleeding was found in 1% of TA patients,<sup><xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> while in another study in Honduras, 10% of women reported the symptom.<sup><xref rid="b35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> Here, mild bleeding occurred across treatments, although more often with TA (30%) than either form of cryotherapy (approximately 20%). The proportion of women who experienced vasovagal syncope was disproportionally high among Chinese women. This occurred mainly after both cryotherapy treatments rather than with TA, a difference not widely reported in the literature.</p>
              <p>Approximately 20% of women experienced malodorous discharge, a potential sign of vaginal infection. However, severe discharge was reported only by 2.4% of women. Only 4% of women sought medical attention post-treatment, and with one exception, no serious complications were reported. Infections may be related to incomplete adherence to post-treatment recommendations, but no such associations were found. Other research from LMICs has shown that male partners can complicate adherence to sexual abstinence restrictions.<sup><xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="b44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> Although self-reported adherence to recommendations was very high, responses may be subject to acquiescence bias. An additional consideration is that infection rates may be different in populations with high HIV prevalence, although existing research is limited and suggests similar patterns to non-HIV populations.<sup><xref rid="b37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> Although we did not ascertain HIV status, prevalence is likely to be very low in our sites.<sup><xref rid="b45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Finally, patient satisfaction across treatment was high, but content analysis revealed differences across populations. For example, women in Colombia and China frequently mentioned that the procedure was simple, fast, or noninvasive, but this theme was less salient among women from El Salvador, perhaps because there is less familiarity with excisional procedures to serve as a comparison. In contrast, patients from El Salvador were more likely to mention efficacy both positively (having trust that the procedure worked) and negatively (uncertainty of the treatment's efficacy until final results were available). Counseling and education campaigns surrounding ablation procedures should be tailored to address local concerns.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, the results presented here have some limitations. Data on side effects, satisfaction, and adherence to recommendations were self-reported, which may increase response bias. Some of the patient satisfaction questions were added after study initiation, when providers had gained more experience using the devices, and this might have resulted in more positive evaluations. Finally, all patients were treated at regional urban hospitals by trained gynecologists. Feasibility, safety, and acceptability may be different in rural or low-resource areas with weaker infrastructure. We anticipate that data to compare cure rates of TA, gas-based cryotherapy, and CryoPen will be available in 2023.</p>
              <p>Our findings to date provide direct comparative data of the safety and acceptability of three ablation treatments. Despite some differences in pain and side effects, all were safe and highly satisfactory to patients. The results may also help clarify previously contradictory data regarding pain during TA. CryoPen, also shown to be a feasible option, may serve as a substitute to gas-based cryotherapy in contexts where the use of TA is not desirable. The availability of various ablation alternatives may give stakeholders more flexibility to make decisions that affect the implementation and sustainability of cervical cancer prevention programs, such as long-term costs, portability, and acceptability.</p>
