                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>HIV transmission and acquisition risk among transgender women is particularly high in the context of primary partnerships. This project extends a previous pilot couples-focused HIV intervention programme, which was shown to be feasible, acceptable and promising in reducing sexual risk behaviour among transgender women and their partners. This randomised controlled trial (RCT) tests the efficacy of this culturally sensitive HIV prevention programme for HIV-serodiscordant and HIV-negative seroconcordant transgender women and their partners.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>To finalise the protocol for trial, we used qualitative methods to hone eligibility criteria, refine the intervention and control manuals, and name and brand the intervention (‘It Takes Two’). The RCT investigates the effects of the It Takes Two intervention on Composite Risk for HIV (CR-HIV) among 100 couples. CR-HIV is a binary indicator of couple HIV risk using validated measures of sexual behaviour, pre-exposure prophylaxis use among HIV-negative participants and viral suppression among participants living with HIV. Using a two-arm RCT, we will examine intervention effects on CR-HIV at 12-month follow-up comparing transgender women and their partners randomised to the intervention versus control (HIV prevention information only).</p>

                <title>Background and rationale</title>
                <p>Transgender women (individuals with a feminine and/or female gender identity who were assigned men at birth and hereafter ‘trans women’) are disproportionately affected by HIV. Trans women represent one of the populations at highest risk for HIV infection, both in the USA and globally.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Two independent meta-analyses of HIV prevalence studies in trans women estimated that 19% of trans women are living with HIV<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 3</xref> and reports of HIV incidence<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 4</xref> and prevalence rates<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> are among the highest of all risk groups.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> One of the most consistently reported contexts for HIV transmission among trans women is within a primary partnership with a cisgender man (hereafter ‘cis man’).<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6–10</xref> HIV prevention interventions addressing relationship contexts for trans women and their primary partners are needed.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p>
                <p>Couples-based HIV prevention interventions have been shown to be feasible, acceptable and efficacious in reducing sexual risk among heterosexual couples and men who have sex with men.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12–15</xref> No efficacious couples-based HIV interventions for trans women and their partners currently exist. Previous research has identified intervention targets for reducing HIV transmission in trans women and cis men couples.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7–9 16–21</xref> Identified risk factors among these dyads include condomless sex within the partnership and with outside partners, mental health, substance use and stigma toward the relationship.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19 22</xref> Communication barriers about condom use with outside partners were also identified.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23–25</xref></p>
                <p>We previously developed a couples-based HIV prevention programme for trans women and cis men in a primary partnership (called ‘Couples HIV Intervention Programme’ or CHIP). A pilot study found that CHIP was feasible, acceptable and produced significant reductions in condomless sex acts with primary and casual partners and in number of casual partners at 3-month follow-up compared with a control group.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> The protective effects of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and an undetectable viral load on HIV transmission had not yet been established when CHIP was piloted, so the intervention lacked content on these biomedical HIV prevention strategies for trans women and their partners.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26–28</xref></p>
                <p>The current trial will test the efficacy of a couples-focused HIV prevention programme for HIV serodiscordant and HIV-negative seroconcordant couples of trans women and their primary partners, renamed by trans community members as It Takes Two. The primary outcome is a novel Composite Risk for HIV (CR-HIV) measure, which is a binary indicator of couple HIV risk incorporating validated measures of (1) sexual behaviour (defined as condomless anal or vaginal sex with a serodiscordant or unknown HIV status primary or outside partner), (2) pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) use among HIV-negative participants and (3) viral suppression among participants living with HIV.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Using a two-arm randomised controlled trial (RCT), this study will examine intervention effects on CR-HIV at quarterly time points over a year comparing 100 couples of trans women and their primary partners randomised to the It Takes Two intervention versus HIV prevention information only (50 couples per group).</p>

                <title>Objectives</title>
                <p>The primary specific aim is to:</p>
                <p>Evaluate the efficacy of It Takes Two on CR-HIV compared with an HIV prevention information control condition.</p>
                <p>We hypothesise that couples in the intervention condition will have lower CR-HIV at 12-month follow-up compared with couples in the control condition.</p>
                <p>The secondary aims are to:</p>
                <p>Assess the effects of the intervention on theory-based mediators (ie, communication and collaborative coping skills); and explore partner gender identity and couple HIV status as moderators of the effect of the intervention on CR-HIV. We hypothesise that couples in the intervention will report higher scores on the theory-based mediators, which will in turn be associated with lower CR-HIV at the 12-month follow-up compared with the couples in the control condition. The moderators analyses are exploratory; thus, there is no hypothesis of the effects of the intervention on CR-HIV.</p>

                <title>Trial design</title>
                <p>We conducted focus groups (N=2) with partnered trans women and in-depth interviews (N=4) with cis male partners to update and standardise intervention content to ensure that information and communication modules regarding biomedical prevention strategies were relevant and appropriate, and to develop training materials for peer health educators. Formative data indicated that trans women are increasingly engaging in HIV risk behaviours with partners who do not identify as cis men. Therefore, we expanded the eligibility criteria of trans women’s partners to include all genders as long as there is HIV transmission or acquisition risk, either within the dyad or with outside partners. Qualitative findings also provided details on study protocol logistics (ie, input on the name of the study, flexible appointment hours specifically in evening hours, providing transportation compensation, conducting the study in discrete location).</p>
                <p>We will recruit and randomise a total of 100 dyads (200 participants total) to test effects of the theory-based couples-focused intervention on CR-HIV. Couples in the control arm receive a single-session involving HIV prevention information, in which both partners separately view HIV prevention education videos and then receive referrals by a trained peer health educator. Couples in the intervention arm receive the 4-session It Takes Two intervention delivered by a peer health educator. All dyads are assessed quarterly over 12 months, and biological (ie, dried blood spots (DBSs) to test for PrEP adherence and viral load tests) and behavioural data are collected and analysed using state-of-the-science dyadic analyses.</p>

                  <p>For inclusion in the RCT, both individuals in the relationship must: (1) be age 18 or older; (2) be in a self-reported primary partnership with each other for at least 3 months (assessed through multiple questions validated in prior research); (3) have had penetrative anal or vaginal sex with the primary partner in the last 6 months; (4) be able to provide informed consent; and (5) be English-speaking. At least one individual in each couple must: (1) have had condomless sex with any partner in the last 6 months; and (2) be a trans woman. Couples must be HIV-negative concordant or HIV serodiscordant, in order to focus exclusively on HIV transmission risk. HIV status is verified at intake through standard individual HIV testing and counselling conducted at the study site; individuals who report being HIV-positive are asked to provide verification of their status. If one partner has a preliminary positive test result at their visit then they are referred to confirmatory testing. Staff members are trained to not reveal participants’ HIV status results to their partners. The newly diagnosed participant has the option to disclose a positive test result to their partner. If they choose not to disclose, staff members will inform both partners that they are not eligible at this time but can screen for the study at a later date. We define a primary relationship as ‘currently in a relationship with someone you feel emotionally and sexually involved with for at least 3 months’. A 3-month time frame is based on our prior relationship research, indicating that many couples at risk for HIV are in the beginning of their relationship.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Individuals are excluded if they: (1) are currently displaying symptoms of psychosis, or otherwise unable to complete informed consent procedures; (2) report that participation would be unsafe; or (3) have plans to move away from the area in the next 6 months. Excluded individuals are provided referrals to local resources (eg, mental health and couples counselling). To determine couple status, each member of the dyad is asked to answer a series of questions (eg, what pets, if any, do you have?, what pets, if any, does your partner have?) and answers are compared with verify couple status.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34 35</xref></p>

                <p>The original CHIP protocol was updated based on qualitative findings to reflect current HIV prevention best-practice evidence by incorporating biomedical HIV prevention strategies,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26–28</xref> and content was refined to enhance relevance with racially/ethnically diverse trans women and their partners of different age groups. The final intervention, It Takes Two, was expanded to four sessions due to the inclusion of content about biomedical prevention, as well as additional skills training on communication related to HIV prevention.</p>
                <p>Peer health educators deliver all of the intervention sessions. A licensed clinical social worker trained the peer health educators in delivering and maintaining fidelity to the It Takes Two manual over a 3-day training session. The training included specific strategies for working with couples (eg, managing conflict, attending to social-structural barriers such as unemployment, financial strain and stigma). Peer health educators demonstrated proficiency via audiotaped role-plays prior to being ‘certified’ to deliver sessions. All counselling sessions are audiotaped (with participant informed consent), and peer health educators receive weekly supervision with the licensed clinical social worker, and the peer health educator complete a checklist after every session to indicate which activities were completed.</p>

                <p>Given that there is no standard of care for HIV prevention with trans woman and their partners, the control condition consists of participants viewing brief HIV prevention education videos on the following four topic areas: HIV testing; PrEP and post-exposure prophylaxis; condom use; and ‘U=U’ (undetectable=untransmittable). Participants are also provided with relevant referrals to HIV and other sexually transmitted infection (STI) prevention and care, mental health and social services. The videos last approximately 20 min and participants watch them immediately after their enrolment visit.</p>

                  <title>Outcomes</title>
                  <p>The primary outcome CR-HIV is a couple-level binary indicator of any HIV risk (eg, yes=1 vs no=0), which is derived from an algorithm based on whether one or both partners report condomless anal or vaginal sex with a HIV serodiscordant or status-unknown primary or other partner in the past 30 days.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> CR-HIV is assessed at baseline and every follow-up assessment. Couples are coded as 0 if neither partner reports condomless anal or vaginal sex. If one or both partners in the dyad report condomless sex with a serodiscordant or status-unknown primary or other partner, then the couple is coded as 1 if (1) the HIV-negative participant is not adherent to PrEP and/or (2) the partner living with HIV is not virally suppressed. Sexual risk behaviour is measured by the number of occasions of different sexual acts (vaginal, anal; receptive, insertive) with three different types of partners (primary, casual, paying partner), use of condoms during the past 30 days, and knowledge of partners’ HIV status. At-risk sex is defined as any vaginal or anal intercourse without condoms that occurs with a person of known HIV-positive or unknown serostatus during the follow-up period. We assess PrEP use using DBS procedures for biological measurement of adherence from tenofovir diphosphate concentrations in blood plasma.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> At the start of the trial, we used dosing categories for quantification similar to those used in past drug-level studies of adherence to Truvada,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> allowing estimation of the number of tablets participants take per week (eg, 700–1249 fmol for 4–6×per week and &gt;1250 for daily dosing). Participants also self-report whether they are using 2-1-1 PrEP dosing and we have obtained an algorithm from our testing lab for assessing 2-1-1 strategy. The protocol was developed based on Truvada for PrEP, although we will note if participants are taking Descovy. Lab protocols including monitoring whether and when participants switch their regimen, which allows proper protocols for analysis, including noting washout periods. Participants living with HIV have blood drawn at each follow-up visit to determine viral suppression. Viral suppression is indicated by an undetectable HIV-1 level on the COBAS AmpliPrep/COBAS TaqMan HIV test kit (Roche Molecular Systems), which has a threshold for undetectability ≤20 copies/mL and is conducted at each follow-up assessment visit. A couple in which both partners are HIV-negative and only engage in condomless sex with one another would be coded as 0 regardless of whether either partner is on PrEP. Given budgetary constraints, we are unable to perform HIV and STI testing at the follow-up visits; however, our exploratory secondary outcomes include self-reported HIV and STI incidence over the 12 months of follow-up.</p>
                  <p>Participants complete the Conflicts Resolution Questionnaire,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> which includes mutual problem-solving skills.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> Collaborative communication is assessed using the Dyadic Coping Inventory<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> which measures the extent to which couples work together, engage in mutual decision making and engage in open communication to alleviate a stressor (eg, HIV). Participants also complete a measure of sexual health goal congruence, which assesses the extent to which partners perceive they are the same page about their sexual health and HIV prevention plan.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></p>

                  <title>Sample size</title>
                  <p>Power analyses were generated using the two-group repeated proportions module in NCSS PASS V.15<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> based on formulas<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> to compute a range of potential minimum detectable effect sizes for the primary analysis proposed to address hypothesis 1. The CHIP pilot study found standardised effect sizes ranging from 0.38 to 0.42,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> so we powered this study to detect similarly sized effects in worst-case scenarios where within-participant clustering of outcomes are substantial. The study will begin with 200 participants from 100 couples evenly assigned to the intervention and control groups. The CR-HIV outcome used to test hypothesis 1 will be measured at the individual level because individuals within dyadic partnerships can have different CR-HIV values based on their sexual behaviours with outside partners. Thus, the unit of analysis for testing hypothesis 1 will be repeated observations collected over time from individuals within dyads. Assuming 20% attrition, data from 160 participants from 80 couples will be available for analysis at all time points. Attrition rates have ranged from 10% to 15% in our previous work with couples of trans women and men, with attrition typically due to male partners becoming incarcerated or relocation. To conservatively allow for the additional demands of intervention participation over 12 months, we estimated attrition to be 20% in this study. Due to the clustered nature of the dyadic data, observations from participants who belong to the same couple will be correlated. In a previous study of 190 trans women and their male partners, for instance, the average within-couple correlation of sexual risk measurements was r=0.07. Accordingly, we lowered the effective sample size (ESS) input for the power analyses to be ESS=N/DEFF, where DEFF is the design effect or variance inflation attributable to using correlated data. DEFF is computed as 1+(M−1)×r, where M is the number of participants per dyad (ie, two). Therefore DEFF=1+(2-1)×0.07=1.07, so ESS=160/1.07=149. Assuming, α=0.05, power=0.80 and ESS=149, we computed the minimum detectable OR, proportion difference (p<sub>diff</sub>) and standardised proportion difference (h) for the time-averaged comparisons for the planned primary analyses, assuming four post-baseline measurements and a wide range of CR-HIV base rates P<sub>0</sub> for levels of risk for trans women and their partners seen in the literature.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 8 44</xref> Since the within-subject correlation ρ for repeated measures is unknown, we varied it across a wide range from 0.20 to 0.80. Minimum detectable ORs ranged from 0.17 to 0.56 (1.79 to 5.88 inverted) and minimum detectable raw proportions ranged from 6.6% to 20.5% resulting in corresponding minimum detectable standardised differences ranging from 0.27 to 0.42. The obtained minimum detectable effect size estimates are similar to or smaller than those detected in our pilot study; this analytic sample provides statistical power to detect the hypothesised effect on our primary outcome, CR-HIV.</p>

                  <title>Recruitment</title>
                  <p>We use a multifaceted approach to recruitment through online advertisements in social media, distributing flyers in targeted venues and outreach to agencies, clinics, bars, meal and shelter programmes, and single-room occupancy hotels.</p>
                  <p>Prospective participants call a toll-free recruitment line to for initial screening, and those who preliminarily qualify have their partner call the recruitment line. Once both partners preliminarily qualify, they both attend an in-person eligibility intake visit. While both partners must attend the initial appointment together, they are separated during their intake visit. We obtain informed consent from each partner and conduct a brief eligibility interview, which includes assessment of full inclusion criteria, as well as an HIV test (for those who do not provide documentation of HIV-positive status). Once both partners are deemed eligible and provide informed consent, they are scheduled for an enrolment visit to complete the remaining activities, including lab work, baseline assessment and randomisation.</p>
                  <p>Targeted recruitment goals were deemed feasible given the investigators’ history of successful research with these populations (trans women and their partners), staff members’ familiarity with community venues and support from community organisations in providing study referrals to their clients. The team will closely review enrolment targets and, in the case of recruitment difficulties and setbacks (eg, due to COVID-19 coinciding with the project period), will consider alternative strategies for participant recruitment and engagement.</p>

Researchers at University of California, San Francisco, have used this method in several RCTs; this method is successful in achieving balance across demographic, mediating and outcome variables.

                  <p>Assessments are conducted in-person for each partner at baseline at 3, 6, 9 and 12-month follow-ups. Couples are scheduled to come in for assessments together, but assessment procedures are conducted separately to preserve the privacy of each individual. Under unique circumstances (eg, social isolation measures due to coronavirus), follow-up assessments are conducted remotely through online survey administration; in these instances, lab procedures are omitted from follow-up. Participants have both a couple ID and a participant ID so that individual data records can be dyadically linked. Participants complete all assessment regardless of whether they broke up and are asked questions to determine whether the intervention had an impact on their break up.</p>
                  <p>A computerised scheduling system tracks due dates and completion status of follow-ups. Participants receive a reminder about follow-up assessments seven and 2 days prior to the appointment. Each follow-up survey assesses relationship dissolution and measures of programme satisfaction. For those reporting relationship dissolution, questions assess whether the dissolution was linked to study participation or some other factor. Calls are made each day to participants who have not been scheduled or missed an appointment.</p>

                    <p>Frequency tables for all variables and measures of central tendency and variability for continuous variables will characterise the sample and will be stratified by study arm to check for imbalances. If the intervention and control groups differ significantly at baseline on one or more covariates, we will use methods based on the Rubin causal model (eg, propensity scores, double-robust estimation) to obtain the desired marginal effect estimates under the counterfactual assumption of balanced groups.<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51–55</xref></p>
                    <p>To address our primary aim, we hypothesise that the odds of CR-HIV will be lower for It Takes Two participants than for control participants. We will use general estimating equations (GEE) for the primary analysis to test our primary hypothesis by a planned time-averaged comparison of post-baseline measurements of CR-HIV from the intervention group with the post-baseline measures of CR-HIV from the control group. Alpha (α) will be set at 0.05 for this planned comparison. Any additional post-hoc comparisons (eg, paired comparisons of groups at each time point) will maintain nominal alpha of 0.05 through the use of simulation-based stepdown multiple comparison methods.<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref> Because each partner within a dyad may have a different CR-HIV value based on sexual behaviour with a new main partner or outside partners, repeated observations from individuals within dyads will be the unit of analysis. The alternating logistic regression approach implemented in SAS PROC GENMOD will be used to address the 3-level clustering of observations within participants and participants within dyads by treating dyads as clusters and participants as subclusters. Couple serostatus will be included as a covariate as required by the stratified randomised design.<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref> Additional relevant covariates such as relationship length, relationship dissolution, as well as intersectionality criteria and structural drivers (eg, age, race/ethnicity, poverty, unemployment) will be pre-specified based on the literature and theory. This primary analysis will follow an intention-to-treat approach.</p>
                    <p>To explore the effect of the intervention on hypothesised mediators, analyses will explore whether participants assigned to It Takes Two report higher mean scores on theory-based constructs such as communication and mutual-solving strategies following the intervention. These analyses will also investigate whether these constructs at 3, 6 and 9 months mediate the relationship between intervention group assignment and CR-HIV at 6, 9 and 12 months, respectively, and whether couple HIV-serostatus and (in line with National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines to consider sex as a biological variable) whether gender moderate these associations. Mediation and moderation will be assessed using the causal inference-based approach of Valeri and VanderWeele, which yields optimal estimates of indirect effects in the presence of moderators and non-continuous outcomes and mediators.<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref> Mplus will be used to fit causal mediation-moderation models because it can adjust standard errors for clustering of participants within couples.<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref></p>

                    <p>It Takes Two is designed to be equally efficacious across intersectional subgroups of participants, so we do not anticipate differential intervention effects by subgroup. However, we will conduct additional exploratory sensitivity analyses to evaluate the moderating effects of age, HIV status, race/ethnicity, poverty and unemployment to explore whether these sociodemographic characteristics enhance or dampen the intervention’s effects on CR-HIV and the theory-based mediators listed above. Where cell sizes permit, subgroup analyses will be performed, stratifying on race/ethnicity, age and poverty. While our study is not formally powered to examine subgroup differences and it would be infeasible to recruit sufficiently large numbers of participants in each category to test for differences formally, these analyses may illuminate trends in group differences, which can inform future studies of specific subpopulations if trends are detected. Moderation and subgroup analyses will be performed using the same GEE and causal inference approaches described earlier.<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref></p>

              <p>To our knowledge, this is the first trial to test the efficacy of a couples-focused HIV prevention programme developed for trans women and their partners. The intervention is designed to facilitate empowerment in couples via knowledge and skills to choose from a range of empirically supported HIV prevention goals best suited to their relationship rather than focus exclusively on one particular HIV prevention option. The results of this study will provide insight as to how a theory-based dyadic approach can foster couple-level motivation for behaviour change and impact mechanisms of change including communication and joint problem-solving skills.</p>
              <p>We updated and refined the original CHIP protocol to reflect the current HIV prevention best practice evidence by incorporating biomedical HIV prevention strategies. It Takes Two consists of four sessions, rather than three and includes new content on biomedical prevention and emphasises partner communication. We also expanded partner eligibility requirements to include trans women’s partners of all genders to better reflect current partnerships in the USA. The primary outcome measure is CR-HIV, a novel composite variable which acknowledges the diversity of HIV prevention needs that couples might have and desire.</p>
              <p>If the It Takes Two intervention demonstrates efficacy in comparison to an HIV prevention information control condition, there will be methodologically rigorous support for implementing this approach within HIV prevention and care settings in order to reduce disparities in HIV transmission and acquisition among some of the highest priority HIV prevention populations in the USA.</p>
