              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="P7">Recent evidence suggests that plasma TMAO concentrations are elevated in kidney disease [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] cardiovascular disease [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], and even exhibit a dose-dependent relationship with severity of atherosclerotic disease [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. But this has not been established in all populations [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and is still being investigated [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Understanding the underlying mechanism between TMAO and CVD is ongoing, may involve HDL [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], inflammation [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], or endothelial dysfunction [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], however, whether any of these are causal or simply correlated remains unclear [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p>
              <p id="P8">Several studies thus far have focused on mechanistic links between specific dietary nutrients and TMAO, since TMAO is produced from dietary choline and carnitine. Red meat is an enriched source of choline and carnitine, as are eggs [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]; other foods–cereals, fruits, and vegetables–contain little, if any, carnitine, and are not as rich a source of choline as meat, fish, or eggs [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In the US, red meat is a primary source of carnitine [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. There is some debate about the association between choline and cardiovascular disease risk [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. While this putative link could be via TMAO or homocysteine concentrations [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], TMAO remains the strongest contender [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Bacterial metabolism of dietary choline and carnitine in the small intestine produces the metabolic intermediate trimethylamine (TMA) [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. TMA is absorbed and subsequently oxidized by one or more hepatic flavin-containing mono-oxygenases (FMO) to generate TMAO [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p>
              <p id="P9">Evidence linking dietary patterns (including animal and vegetable protein sources), TMAO, and cardiovascular disease are sparse and inconclusive. Studies comparing vegetarians to omnivores demonstrated that vegetarians have lower TMAO concentrations [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and reduced cardiovascular disease risk [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, cause-effect cannot be ascertained by these associations. Recently, a 10-y follow-up cohort (n = 760) from the Nurses’ Health Study reported a positive association between change (10 y minus baseline) in circulating TMAO and change in CHD risk [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Further, this association was made stronger by poor diet quality, as assessed by the Alternate Healthy Eating Index score [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] (a modified version of the Healthy Eating Index (HEI) score focused on foods and nutrients set forth by the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA)). However, the CARDIA study did not identify any relationship between TMAO and atherosclerosis [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. To further add complexity, while some foods (red meat, eggs) have been shown to increase TMAO concentrations, and to be positively associated with cardiovascular disease, fish has been shown to increase TMAO concentrations [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] but is often included as a dietary recommendation to protect against cardiovascular disease. Thus, the underlying associations between diet and TMAO remain unclear.</p>
              <p id="P10">While several nutrition studies focus on biochemical aspects of single nutrients, as mentioned earlier, most policy recommendations are made at a diet pattern level, the most relevant to the US being the DGA. The DGAs are indicated for use by the public, with the goal of helping people reduce chronic disease risk and promoting health [<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. It is therefore pertinent to determine if following the DGA pattern is capable of improving vascular health, or reducing circulating TMAO concentrations and its precursor metabolites, as this influence cardiovascular disease risk.</p>
              <p id="P11">We recently completed the first randomized controlled feeding trial comparing a diet based on the DGA (2010) to that of a typical American Diet (TAD) [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The objective of this secondary analysis was to determine whether a diet based on the USDA’s 2010 DGA, differentially affects plasma TMAO concentrations and endothelial function using peripheral arterial tonography, compared to a typical American Diet (TAD). We hypothesized that an 8wk-DGA intervention, which has lower red meat allowance combined with overall higher nutrient-density and quality, would improve vascular function and reduce circulating TMAO, compared to TAD.</p>

                <title>Study population</title>
                <p id="P12">A randomized (1:1 block randomization, blocks of 2), double-blind, controlled 8-wk intervention was conducted in overweight and obese women (BMI between 25.1 and 39.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) aged 20–65 y, with one or more characteristics of metabolic syndrome, defined as high fasting plasma glucose (&gt;100 mg/dL but &lt;126 mg/dL or 2 h postprandial oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) &gt; 140 mg/dL but &lt;199 mg/dL) or fasting triglycerides (&gt;150 mg/dL) or low (&lt;50 mg/dL) HDL-cholesterol (HDL-c). We chose to study women because not only did the prevalence of being overweight and obese increased in women more than men between the years of 1988–2006, but also the prevalence of metabolic syndrome increased in women more than men (by 6%) [<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Since metabolic syndrome is a precursor to chronic metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease [<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], these criteria were chosen. Screened and recruited women were randomly assigned to the DGA or TAD group (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 22 DGA and 22 TAD). The study is registered at <ext-link xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov" ext-link-type="uri">clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> (identifier: <ext-link xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02298725" ext-link-type="uri">NCT02298725</ext-link>) and was approved by the Institutional Review Board at University of California, Davis (UC Davis).</p>

                <title>Diet intervention</title>
                <p id="P13">Detailed information about the design and implementation of this dietary intervention has been previously published [<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Two 8-d cyclic menus were developed, one for DGA and one for TAD, designed to maintain energy balance in participants. The DGA diet was designed based on the DGA 2010 [<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], while the TAD diet was based on what was reported by women between the ages of 20–65 y in the “What We Eat in America Survey” from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES intake data 2009–2010). All food and beverages meant for consumption were prepared, packaged, and provided by the Metabolic Kitchen and Human Feeding Laboratory at the Western Human Nutrition Research Center (WHNRC). The diets were blinded to participants by using same foods and dishes in both diets, but essentially varying in proportions to meet dietary patterns. The menu had a total of 78 recipes, of which 16 had shared ingredients that matched the proportions for DGA and TAD diets respectively, but was assembled in ways to avoid bias [<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. For instance, foods such as hot dogs (most likely associated with a TAD) and fish (more likely to be associated with a DGA) were blended into recipes, instead of being presented as such, to avoid any visual bias. Another example was to layer the ingredients that went into making pizza to show more cheese for the DGA and more vegetables on the TAD, to avoid implicit biases that might suggest to volunteers the type of diet they are on. Aside from the study dietitian and key kitchen personnel, study investigators were also blinded to treatment assignment. And participants were not told what diet they were on and did not meet other study participants (on test days or while eating at the center on specific days) to compare menu plans. Food and drinks were picked up twice a week by participants, with detailed instructions for their storage, re-heating/preparation, and consumption. Diets were developed to maintain energy balance, so as to evaluate the effect of the pattern alone. Dietary adherence was evaluated using checklists that participants filled out for each day they were in the study. In addition, participants were asked to return empty containers just as it is (without emptying out what’s leftover after eating, no washing or cleaning), biweekly, which were weighed back by kitchen staff. Participants’ body weights were also measured during these visits. The weigh-backs from returned containers were used to quantify adherence to consuming provided food and drinks. Based on weight maintenance and returned unconsumed foods, adherence to the diet was estimated at ~95%. The primary red meat sources in both DGA and TAD diets were beef, cold cuts, and sausage. DGA diet had an average of 26 ± 1 g/d of red meat, while TAD had an average of 88 ± 4 g/d of red meat, the primary source of carnitine. Prominent sources of dietary choline included red meat, fish, and seafood (1.1oz/d in DGA vs 0.6 oz/d in TAD), dairy (3.3 cup equivalents in DGA vs 1.5 cup equivalents in TAD), and eggs (~0.45 oz/d in both diets).</p>

EndoPAT technique has been validated [<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and associated with several CVD risk factors in the Framingham cohort [<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The test was administered via placement of two probes on the index fingers of right (ischemic) and left (control) hands. After a 30 min period of resting in a supine position finger probes were fitted to a finger on each hand and baseline readings of peripheral arterial tone (PAT) were recorded for 10 min. A standard blood pressure cuff was placed on one arm (measurement arm) and inflated to achieve a pressure of about 60 mm of mercury above systolic blood pressure. This occluded blood flow in the measurement arm, which was maintained for 5 min. At the end of the occlusion period, the cuff was released, and during post-reactive hyperemia, readings of PAT were recorded for an additional 5–10 min. The Reactive Hyperemia Index (RHI) was calculated as the ratio of average pulse wave amplitude during hyperemia (60–120s of post-occlusion period) to average pulse wave amplitude during baseline in the occluded hand divided by same values in the control hand and then multiplied by a baseline correction factor. The EndoPAT device also generates Augmentation Index (AI), a measure of vascular stiffness (pulse wave reflection) that is calculated from the shape of the pulse wave recorded by the probes during baseline. AI was adjusted to a heart rate of 75 beats/min (AI@75) to correct for independent effect of heart rate on this measure [<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p>

For the current manuscript, statistical analyses were performed in JMP Pro 15.1.0 (SAS Institute Cary NC) and R statistical software (version 3.6.0). Significance was determined at <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.05. All data were screened for normality using QQ plots and Shapiro Wilk tests and transformed using log, cube root, or Johnson transformation to fit normal distribution as necessary. Huber M and Cauchy distribution tests were used for outlier evaluation and none were detected. Linear mixed-effect models were used with participant as the random effect, group (DGA vs. TAD) and week (0, 2, or 8) as fixed effects, wk0 as covariate to determine if the intervention had an effect on outcome variables (i.e., TMAO; betaine; choline; creatinine; carnitine; EndoPAT-based AI@75 and RHI; and vascular age). When appropriate, Tukey’s multiple comparison adjustments were used to identify differences in individual means. To add clarity, in some variables, differences between wk8 and wk0 were calculated, and differences between groups were evaluated using non-parametric van der Waerden’s tests. Spearman’s correlation analyses were used to identify if there were associations between outcome variables at wk0 and wk8. At wk0, all 44 participants were used in the correlational analyses, and at wk8, DGA and TAD groups were evaluated individually. For Spearman’s correlation analyses, Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) multiple comparison correction was used to adjust for false discoveries.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="P27">The primary objectives of the current study were to determine whether a diet based on the USDA’s 2010 DGA, reduces plasma TMAO concentrations or improves peripheral vascular function (peripheral arterial tonography) as compared to a typical American Diet (TAD). The results of our study indicate that 1) a DGA diet without weight loss does not alter plasma TMAO concentrations compared to a TAD diet, and 2) direct measures of vascular function via peripheral arterial tonography were also unchanged. Further, we investigated two composite measures of vascular risk which did indicate subtle effects. Vascular age indices were reduced for subjects consuming the DGA diet when compared to baseline, however, post-intervention values were not different between diet treatment groups. We discuss these results in detail.</p>
              <p id="P28">In the current study, subjects consuming a DGA diet pattern did not have reduced circulating TMAO concentrations as compared to subjects consuming TAD. Since the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) suggests moderation in red meat intake [<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] and red meat intake increases TMAO [<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] we hypothesized that a DGA pattern would reduce plasma TMAO. Our hypothesis, that dietary red meat is associated with TMAO is supported in the literature where a single meal containing steak led to an increase in plasma TMAO [<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], and in the cross-sectional KarMeN study which found significant associations of dietary beef and fish with circulating TMAO concentrations [<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. A recent randomized crossover designed to test the effects of diets containing different protein sources (red meat vs. white meat vs. non-meat), also demonstrated an increase in TMAO when subjects consumed a diet with red meat [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The data linking diet to TMAO is not entirely consistent as a cohort study in Poland failed to find an association between dietary choline or carnitine intake and circulating TMAO concentrations [<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. This suggests there is likely interindividual variability in the ability of TMAO precursors to be converted to TMAO. This variability likely is multifactorial and includes genetic (SNPs for FMOs, albeit mildly impactful [<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]), gut microbiota [<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], and background dietary parameters [<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. A recent study in pigs evaluated the effect of the background diet on its ability to alter TMAO production from red meat [<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. They identified that a ‘Prudent’ diet pattern, which is a nutrient-rich high-quality diet pattern when combined with red meat resulted in lower TMAO concentrations compared to a background ‘Western’ diet. Together, these results suggest that it may be necessary to evaluate a fixed amount of dietary source of TMAO (choline, carnitine, betaine), but also consider the background diet pattern to evaluate the TMAO-inducing effect of red meat.</p>
              <p id="P29">In addition to TMAO, we also assessed several metabolites in plasma that can be converted to TMAO. Quite surprising was a reduction in plasma choline following the DGA diet pattern. This is potentially concerning as choline consumption is specifically mentioned in the 2020 DGA report as under-consumed [<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] although plasma choline may not accurately reflect choline intake [<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The recommended adequate intake for choline for adult women is 425 mg/d. Only the DGA diet reaches this recommendation, while TAD, as well as habitual intakes, fell well below this level. The food matrix could confound measures of choline and choline bioavailability can be affected by the food matrix [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Another possible confounder of plasma choline levels could be changes in the gut microbiome which can alter choline bioavailability [<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. However, when gut microbiota renders choline unavailable for the host, they produce more TMA, which was not seen in the current study as assessed by blood TMAO concentrations. One can only speculate that the diet pattern background, in combination with higher intake of choline altered the gut microbiota to reduce available choline, both to the host and harmful atherogenic gut microbes. Without gut microbiome data, this is difficult to corroborate; however, future studies could factor this into their consideration while evaluating the DGA pattern. Furthermore, a combination of placing adults on a controlled diet, and regression to the mean influence the high variability observed at wk0, which then tapers and becomes narrow by wk8, so any future analyses should factor the variability of baseline microbiome while evaluating the effect of the intervention diet pattern.</p>
              <p id="P30">There were also no differences in endothelial function or arterial stiffness between the two dietary arms. One interpretive caveat of PAT endothelial function indices (RHI and AI@75) measurements in the current report is that they were not taken in fasted state. Postprandial hypertriglyceridemia is suspected to impair endothelial function [<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. In fact, postprandial state lipemia-induced endothelial dysfunction is being increasingly investigated particularly after a high fat or mixed meal [<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], and can be uniquely qualified to provide insight into metabolic disease risk [<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. In the current study, at wk0 and wk8, the meals given to the participants on the same day as PAT measurements were matched. The lack of between-day variations in acute meal compositions, and the strict timeline between ingesting the meals on the test days and PAT measurements, ensure that the effect of our interventions on the PAT parameters was studied under highly controlled conditions in the postprandial state. This enabled a direct comparison of DGA vs. TAD effects on endothelial function under the same physiological state.</p>
              <p id="P31">TMAO may affect endothelial inflammation in mice and humans [<xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. In the current study, however, there were no associations between endothelial function and circulating TMAO. In generally healthy women, there was no association between TMAO and endothelial function [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Further, Koay et al. [<xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] suggested that TMAO is associated with atherosclerotic plaque instability, which leads to downstream ischemic and myocardial perfusion issues, rather than being associated with other vascular factors such as endothelial function. Overall, our data support the notion that there is a complex link between TMAO and the long etiology of cardiovascular disease. The results also suggest that this relationship is not altered by short-term changes in diet patterns.</p>
              <p id="P32">We reported previously [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] that the DGA intervention resulted in a moderate effect on systolic blood pressure which did not occur in the TAD group. The DGA-related reduction in vascular age is likely due to changes in blood pressure as the algorithm to calculate this includes blood pressure. The absence of any effect of the DGA diet on measured vascular and endothelial function is similar to those reported by Shah et al. [<xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Their study compared a vegan diet vs. the American Heart Association recommended diet in patients with CAD, albeit with less dietary control in a cohort of women with coronary artery disease. The endothelial function, as assessed by RHI remained unchanged, and our values are similar to those reported by Shah et al. [<xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. This suggests that in women at risk for cardiometabolic disease or those with coronary artery disease, peripheral endothelial dysfunction may remain unaffected [<xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], and the DGA, vegan, or AHA diets do not affect otherwise ‘healthy’ parameters. Yet another study that compared a weight-reducing, plant protein-based diet against an animal protein-based diet did identify a reduction in arterial stiffness (AI@75), but in both groups, this was a function of weight loss and not diet composition [<xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>].</p>

              <title>Strengths, limitations, and conclusions</title>
              <p id="P33">The study was a controlled feeding trial, one of the first of its kind to evaluate the effects of a DGA based diet pattern in women at risk for cardiometabolic disease. Leveraging such a study to investigate cardiovascular risk factors such as endothelial function and TMAO and related compounds can uncover potential mechanisms that explain why diet patterns protect against or promote cardiovascular risk in the population. However, the sample size was small, and future studies should plan to look at whether an alteration in TMAO due to diet pattern is also mediating endothelial function as a means of altering cardiovascular disease risk. Yet, by closely monitoring compliance, focusing only on women, and with strict inclusion criteria, the study was designed to minimize technical variance and diet-independent variance. The results reported herein provide evidence suggesting that diet effects, if any, are difficult to detect in this population, at least over an 8wk period. Since we see within-group but no between-group differences, the lack of power due to small sample size is highly likely. Further, the study population was overweight/obese women with one or more cardiometabolic risk factors, and extrapolation to other population groups should be made with caution. Future evaluations are warranted in men and in younger and older persons, to understand if diet/TMAO/vascular phenotype relationships differ depending on context. Similarly, gut microbiota or genotype differences could add to inter-individual variability, which might account for the lack of response in TMAO and its related metabolites. In the current 8wk controlled feeding study, the effect of diet pattern on endothelial function or TMAO suggests no effect, and the modest improvements in the 10 y cardiovascular disease risk and vascular age with consumption of the DGA diet appear to be primarily driven by reductions in systolic blood pressure.</p>
