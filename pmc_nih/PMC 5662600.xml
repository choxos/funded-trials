                <p id="Par1">Transcranial electrical stimulation has widespread clinical and research applications, yet its effect on ongoing neural activity in humans is not well established. Previous reports argue that transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) can entrain and enhance neural rhythms related to memory, but the evidence from non-invasive recordings has remained inconclusive. Here, we measure endogenous spindle and theta activity intracranially in humans during low-frequency tACS and find no stable entrainment of spindle power during non-REM sleep, nor of theta power during resting wakefulness. As positive controls, we find robust entrainment of spindle activity to endogenous slow-wave activity in 66% of electrodes as well as entrainment to rhythmic noise-burst acoustic stimulation in 14% of electrodes. We conclude that low-frequency tACS at common stimulation intensities neither acutely modulates spindle activity during sleep nor theta activity during waking rest, likely because of the attenuated electrical fields reaching the cortical surface.</p>

              <p id="Par3">The therapeutic potential of transcranial electrical stimulation (TES) has been examined in over 70 diverse conditions, including major depression, epilepsy, pain, stroke rehabilitation, Parkinson’s disease, and tinnitus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. TES is motivated by the well-established biophysical observation that externally applied electric fields can affect neuronal excitability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. However, behavioral effects in human are often weak and difficult to replicate, which underscores a lack of basic mechanistic understanding of how applied electrical fields interact with brain activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par4">Here, we focus on transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, which has potential to affect neural oscillations relevant to normal cognition and neurological disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Specific oscillation frequencies characterize different arousal states and cognitive processes, and oscillations coordinate activity between local and distant brain regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. For example, in non-REM (NREM) sleep, neocortical slow-wave activity coordinates thalamocortical sleep spindles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. It has been argued that low-frequency tACS, applied during NREM in healthy human subjects, can boost associative memory, presumably by entraining these nested rhythms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Furthermore, low-frequency tACS applied during waking rest has resulted in widespread increases in theta activity, associated with improved encoding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. It has been proposed that tACS applied at the dominant network oscillations may entrain these endogenous rhythms in the gamma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, beta<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, alpha<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, theta<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, and slow frequencies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par5">In this study, we tested a widely cited protocol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, which showed that declarative memory performance could be enhanced by applying low-frequency tACS during NREM sleep. This work has since inspired a number of replication studies, which have shown either positive results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> or no effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. To validate the physiological underpinnings of this promising memory effect, we applied low-frequency tACS during sleep while measuring neural responses intracranially in surgical epilepsy patients. We test, in particular, the widely held belief that brain rhythms are entrained by tACS applied at the frequency that matches the endogenous rhythm. In the case of NREM sleep this is particularly advantageous as one can measure spindle and gamma activity, which is strongly coupled to the slow wave, yet is uncontaminated by the low-frequency stimulation artifact<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par6">Thirteen patients undergoing invasive monitoring for epilepsy surgery were tested with sinusoidal tACS (0.75 and 1 Hz) during a period of NREM sleep and/or waking rest. The primary outcome measure during sleep is phase-amplitude coupling (PAC), which captures the modulation of spindle amplitude (at 10 and 14 Hz) with the phase of tACS. This measure is motivated by the relevance of spindles to sleep-dependent cognitive processes, the strong entrainment of spindles to native slow oscillations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, and the previous reports of tACS enhancement of endogenous slow-wave and spindle activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Our primary outcome measure during wakefulness is PAC of theta frequency (7 Hz) amplitude to tACS phase, as theta power has previously been implicated in tACS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Secondary outcome measures include gamma (70–110 Hz) modulation during NREM sleep<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup> and alpha (10 Hz) and gamma modulation during waking rest. We also tested on an additional subject the configuration of Marshall et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> with identical electrode location, charge density, waveform, frequency, and intensity. Finally, we measured the intensity of induced electric fields at the cortical surface, and leveraged validated computational models to estimate field strengths across the brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. We do not find an acute effect of the applied tACS on brain rhythms and attribute the outcome to the weak-induced fields.</p>
              <p id="Par7">As a positive control, we confirm that spindle power is modulated with the endogenous slow-wave rhythm during sleep in the same subjects across a majority of electrodes. Additionally, we find that acoustic stimulation with brief noise bursts reliably evokes slow-wave and related spindle activity comparable to effects found in healthy subjects using scalp electroencephalography (EEG)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. The null findings on entrainment together with these positive controls rule out the hypothesis that low-frequency tACS applied at conventional current intensities can acutely entrain slow-wave, spindle, gamma, or theta activity. We conclude that previous reports of behavioral effects of slow oscillating tACS applied during NREM sleep and waking rest on memory consolidation are not the result of direct neuronal entrainment. We discuss alternative mechanisms and propose new directions for research.</p>

Overall, we recorded and analyzed signals from 1700 electrodes (mean 131 electrodes per subject) from the 13 patients receiving TES using this protocol. The positions of the recording electrodes sites in each patient are shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. For stimulation, two scalp electrodes (2 cm × 2 cm rubber electrodes) were placed over the frontopolar and occipital poles, accessible under the surgical bandage. The aim was to generate the strongest possible fields in the brain by keeping electrodes at the furthest distance on the skull<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>, while remaining apart from temporal craniotomies so as to replicate the current flow of normal head anatomy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. We confirmed that the craniotomy defect had only minor effects on field intensities as models of current flow with and without the defect yield comparable field intensities (0.05 ± 0.02 V/m and 0.04 ± 0.02 V/m, respectively, mean ± Std across subjects). In one patient (S10), the stimulation electrodes were placed at three additional locations to examine the effects of electrode placement on extracerebral and intracerebral current spread. For three subjects (subjects S11–S13), frontal electrodes were offset to the left or right (Fp1 or Fp2) so that intracranial electrode coverage, which was largely constrained to one hemisphere, covered areas of maximal electric fields and thereby optimize recording of potential entrainment effects. Maximal stimulation intensity of tACS was adjusted for each subject based on amplifier saturation and patient sensation. Intensity ranged from 0.5 to 2.5 mA (current density 0.125–0.625 mA mA/cm<sup>2</sup>), which is stronger than in previous reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Electrode coverage for 18 patients who underwent invasive monitoring for epilepsy surgery and received either tACS or acoustic stimulation.

Four subjects were stimulated during daytime NREM sleep; three were stimulated during nocturnal NREM sleep; and six were stimulated during waking rest. Duration and conditions of stimulation for each subject varied based on clinical constraints and the total time in NREM sleep (sleep stages N2 and N3, American Academy of Sleep Medicine 2012 convention<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>).</p>
                <p id="Par12">Sleep data from the seven subjects (subjects S7–S13) were analyzed over two separate nights without stimulation. We first visually identified periods of NREM sleep in the intracranial recordings. The average duration of the NREM recorded was 30.0 ± 10.5 min. Slow-wave activity spans broad frequency spectrum between 0.5 and 4 Hz with no clear peak in the frequency spectrum within these three octaves (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref> and Supplementary Note <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) consistent with scalp EEG recordings in normal subjects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>.

As a primary outcome measure, we tested the modulation of spindle amplitude (for fast spindles: 14 Hz bandpass filter with 7 Hz bandwidth; for slow spindles: 10 Hz bandpass with 5 Hz bandwidth) by the phase of the endogenous slow oscillations (1 Hz bandpass filter with 1 Hz bandwidth). PAC was measured with the modulation index for individual electrodes and statistical significance was established using surrogate data with randomized phase (see “Methods”), here and in the remainder of the text. Recording sites that exhibited PAC are widespread over the cortex, representing most recorded regions (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>).

                <p id="Par15">In four patients during an afternoon nap, and three patients during night-time sleep, we applied several 5–10-min blocks of continuous stimulation during NREM sleep (Stages 2 and 3). We tested tACS at 0.75 and 1 Hz consistent with previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. We reasoned that if the applied low-frequency tACS entrains endogenous slow-wave activity, then spindle power, which is coupled to slow-wave activity, should occur in phase with the applied fields. Because slow-wave activity cannot be directly assessed during tACS due to the stimulation artifact, spindle power (14, 10 Hz) was used as an index of the slow-wave rhythm. We used identical PAC processing and statistical tests as with endogenous sleep (modulation index <italic>r</italic>, assessed for significance with phase-randomized surrogate data), with the exception that phase could now be inferred exactly from the stimulation artifact, readily observed in the raw recordings (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>).

                <p id="Par18">Unlike applied stimulation waveforms, which remain steady during application, the endogenous slow waves remain periodic for at most two cycles (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>), and are more often isolated events. This lack of temporal coherence is the source of the broadness of the slow-wave activity spectrum and lack of a well-defined peak in most electrodes (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>). Because the endogenous slow-wave oscillation is not reliably discerned during stimulation due to the overwhelming stimulation artifact, we used gamma activity to infer the phase of the endogenous slow-wave rhythm. It is possible that tACS did not entrain spindle activity, but nonetheless interferes with the slow-wave rhythm, which is thought to coordinate activity in higher frequency bands. We therefore tested whether low-frequency tACS disrupts the temporal alignment of gamma and spindle activity, as measured by the cross-correlation of the instantaneous amplitude of these two rhythms (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). As expected from the alignment of the two rhythms to the 0° phase or cortical upstate during endogenous sleep (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>), the cross-correlation of the gamma and spindle power is maximal at zero-time delay (the median across electrodes and subjects S7–S13 ± the interquartile range is 0.0020 ± 0.16 s) for endogenous NREM sleep (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, Nights 1 and 2). During stimulation, the temporal relationship of spindle with gamma activity (with a time lag of zero. Night 1: −0.0156 ± 0.020 s; Night 2: −0.0078 ± 0.023 s) is maintained (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). This suggests that tACS does not disrupt the temporal coordination of spindle and gamma activity.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Cross-correlation between the amplitudes of spindle and gamma oscillations.

                <title>Pulsed auditory stimulation induces slow-wave/spindle entrainment</title>
                <p id="Par21">It could be argued that slow-wave activity cannot be reliably entrained in epilepsy patients. To directly address this possibility, we stimulated an additional four patients (subjects A1–A4) with low-frequency acoustic stimulation (50 ms, pink-noise bursts repeated at 0.75 and 1 Hz) delivered through earphones during nocturnal NREM sleep. Using the same analysis as described earlier (modulation index, assessed for significance with phase-randomized surrogate data), we find a number of electrodes that showed significant PAC entrainment during both 0.75 and 1 Hz auditory stimulation after FDR correction (<italic>q</italic> &lt; 0.05; <italic>p-</italic>values prior to FDR correction are shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10</xref>, Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>; number of electrodes entrained for patient at 0.75 Hz, at 1 Hz, and consistently entrained across stimulation blocks as follows A1: 38, 11, 11; A2: 7, 1, 1; A3: 0, 2, 0; A4: 6, 6, 1). The lower numbers in A3 may be due to the lower sound volume used for sleep comfort. In total, we found 51/343 (14.8%) entrained electrodes during 0.75 Hz, and 20/343 (5.8%) entrained electrodes during 1 Hz acoustic stimulation, when pooled across all subjects.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par23">We set out to test the hypothesis that low-frequency tACS can acutely modulate endogenous slow-wave rhythms during NREM sleep or theta activity during wakefulness. We find that low-frequency tACS, at 1 or 0.75 Hz, applied during NREM sleep at common stimulation intensities does not reliably entrain spindle oscillations during NREM sleep. This contrasts with spindle activity that is strongly entrained by endogenous slow oscillations in almost two-thirds of the electrodes in depth and cortical surface electrodes recorded during two nights of sleep. Gamma activity also reliably entrains to the upstate of slow-wave activity, at a similar phase as spindles. Furthermore, time alignment between the spindle and gamma rhythms is not altered by tACS, suggesting that co-occurrence of these rhythms to the cortical upstate was not disrupted by stimulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. Despite medications, sleep physiology (i.e., coupling of spindle to slow activity during NREM sleep) in this patient population resembles that of healthy subjects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. In contrast, low-frequency auditory stimulation during NREM sleep evokes reliable slow-spindle events as seen in healthy subjects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. Furthermore, low-frequency tACS during waking rest does not modulate theta, alpha, or gamma frequency activity with the phase of stimulation. Thus, low-frequency sinusoidal tACS does not entrain dominant rhythms during NREM sleep or waking rest.</p>
              <p id="Par24">It is tacitly assumed that tACS can entrain ongoing brain rhythms to boost memory performance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. However, previous studies have not directly measured entrainment of these latter rhythms. The present study is the first human experiment to assess the direct physiological effects of tACS by measuring cortical oscillations via invasive EEG. Here, we demonstrate that tACS does not necessarily induce coupled slow-spindle rhythms in human sleep. This specific result is important because of the exciting but mixed results reported with tACS and sleep-dependent memory enhancement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, which highlights the lack of mechanistic understanding of this technique.</p>
              <p id="Par25">The strengths of our study depend on the simultaneous measurement of brain activity directly from the cortical surface during stimulation. Intracranial EEG (iEEG) provides superior signal quality compared to scalp EEG, allowing the direct measurement of induced electrical fields and their acute effect on mesoscopic brain activity. We collected a large data set with 18 subjects, 2156 electrodes (mean 120 electrodes per subject), and 900–3600 trials (oscillation cycles) per subject. Furthermore, to ensure that our null findings are not due to limitations in analytical technique, we included two positive control conditions, including endogenous sleep and acoustic stimulation, which demonstrate that slow-spindle rhythms can be entrained in these surgical patients and that the analytical methods can detect such entrainment.</p>
              <p id="Par26">Previous estimates of entrainment of slow-wave activity with applied slow tACS relied on averaging the periods immediately following stimulation, which gives a much smaller number of trials. In other words, measurement during stimulation with iEEG permits more sensitive detection of PAC as compared to measurement after stimulation with scalp EEG. Finally, we applied stronger stimulation intensities compared to previously published reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. In summary, our experimental and analytical approach permits detection of small changes in modulation, which we do not find.</p>
              <p id="Par27">Previously proposed explanations for how TES may affect neuronal activity rely mainly on in vitro slice preparations and in vivo experiments in rodents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. In vitro studies demonstrate that a weak uniform (DC) electric field can alter the resting transmembrane potential, which increases or decreases average firing rates of the affected neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. In vitro studies using AC stimulation demonstrate single neuron entrainment by modulating the rate and timing of neural firing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. It is assumed that small changes in the firing rate and coherence of the affected neuronal populations may be amplified by network-level activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. However, the weak effects of the applied field also compete with the endogenous neuronal drive, which controls the instantaneous phase and amplitude of the rhythmic activity. For stimulation to entrain neural activity that does not have a steady rhythmic behavior, such as slow-wave activity, one would need fairly strong effects that reset phase in a single cycle. This may explain why several-fold stronger currents are needed to entrain some network oscillations compared to the lower intensities required to alter firing rates of several neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par28">Our null findings likely result from the weak-induced electrical fields. At the highest current intensity applied (2.5 mA), peak intensities reach only 0.16 V/m across recording electrodes. Although the recording electrodes may not capture the maximal electric fields induced by a given stimulation montage, our model-based extrapolations suggest that peak fields do not exceed 0.43 V/m intracranially when stimulating at 2 mA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>, which is comparable to a recent report of 0.5 V/m as maximal intensities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. Thus, field magnitudes may be an order of magnitude smaller than required to entrain slow-wave rhythms, which may explain why experimental attempts to entrain sleep rhythms for memory enhancement have been inconsistent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. To place these weak-induced fields into perspective, synchronous neuronal activity under physiological conditions can generate approximately 1–2 V/m gradient across the CA1 pyramidal layer during theta oscillations in the hippocampus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup> and during slow oscillations in the neocortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Under ideal circumstances when the electric fields are applied in a phase-locked manner coupling directly with the cellular membrane in vitro, 0.25 V/m can bias a single neuron’s spike threshold to induce cumulative effects and entrain network oscillations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>. In behaving rats, hippocampal firing rate, but not local field potential oscillations, was modulated at a threshold of 1 V/m<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. In other scenarios, 5 V/m or more may be needed to entrain network oscillations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par29">The weak electric fields measured in our study suggest that higher intensity stimulation may be required to instantaneously affect network-level neuronal activity. The practical implication of our findings is that new methods of neuromodulation, which increase the amount of current reaching the brain, are needed to advance the field. However, transcranial stimulation intensity is limited by clinical considerations such as sensory perception. These constraints are especially relevant for sleep studies (one of our subjects was wakened by &gt;2 mA stimulation and we had to decrease the intensity), subject blinding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>, and patient safety<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par30">Another possible explanation for our null findings is the observation that endogenous slow-wave activity does not have a steady rhythm, but rather spans wide frequency range (0.5–4 Hz). In human sleep, slow waves appear to be unitary events, and a regular rhythm is preserved for at most two cycles. Thus, the continuous application of a weak, low-frequency stimulation waveform aligns imprecisely to these irregular events. In order for spindle activity to align to the stimulation phase, the effect of stimulation would have to be nearly instantaneous. This would require pacing of the endogenous rhythm on a nearly cycle-by-cycle basis. By contrast, the most sensitive effects of stimulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> (at weak fields of 0.2 V/m) occur when the endogenous rhythm is narrow-band such that stimulation effects can accumulate over many cycles, leading to resonant phenomena. Our results therefore do not rule out more sensitive resonant effects of tACS for more rhythmic narrow-band activity such as alpha and spindle oscillations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par31">Finally, these null effects may result from the anatomical differences seen when scaling from in vitro to rodent to human studies. Due to complex cortical folding in humans, portions of the network that are differently oriented relative to the induced potential field may demonstrate both excitatory and inhibitory behavior.</p>
              <p id="Par32">We acknowledge the difference in stimulating electrode placement between our protocol and previously published protocols, yet do not conclude that the null effect is because of this experimental difference. Because of the clinical limitations of the surgical bandage, we were able to place electrodes in the frontopolar and occipital regions, directly below the surgical dressing. The advantage of maximizing electrode distance as in our protocol is to decrease the amount of current shunted by the scalp (compared to electrode placement in the bilateral frontal regions (F3/F4) and mastoids as prior). This generally should lead to stronger electric fields in the brain as compared to the F3/F4 montage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>, as supported by our recently validated current flow models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par33">The positive control of acoustic stimulation demonstrates that slow-wave and spindle activity can be modulated during NREM sleep in our patients. Acoustic stimulation has previously been shown to enhance sleep oscillations in healthy subjects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup> with an increase in sleep-dependent memory consolidation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Using a low-frequency acoustic analog of tACS during NREM, we observe sleep spindles are modulated by the rhythmic stimulation in 8–14.3% of the electrodes analyzed. Additionally, the timing of spindle activity coincides with the upstate for both acoustic stimulation and endogenous slow waves. Together this suggests that endogenous slow wave may have been entrained by the rhythmic stimulation. Regardless of the mechanism (entrained vs. induced spindle), this indicates that modulation of sleep oscillations is possible, and that the analytic techniques used to assess entrainment are sensitive to the PAC of slow-wave/spindle events.</p>
              <p id="Par34">There are, however, limitations of our study. First, because the recording electrodes are placed according to clinical indication, they do not necessarily capture the maximal electric fields induced by a given stimulation montage. Despite broad coverage of the cortical surface, peak electric fields may occur outside the recorded areas (but should not exceed 0.43 V/m for 2 mA). Nonetheless, spindle entrainment during endogenous sleep and acoustic stimulation show the widespread nature of these cortical rhythms. Even if our electrodes did not capture the maximal electric fields, we would have expected to see a small number of electrodes entrained from tACS. Second, while we did examine changes in power before and after stimulation, the experiments were not optimally designed for this purpose, and thus fluctuations that were found cannot be attributed to tACS, but are likely the result for natural fluctuations of power within and across nights of sleep. Third, we only considered low-frequency stimulation. Given the dependence of oscillatory stimulation of the specific of network rhythms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>, these findings may not generalize to other tACS frequencies. In summary, as with all null results, one cannot rule out effects outside the parameters tested here. In particular, it is possible that there were lasting effects on spindle power, which we did not resolve here because of their natural fluctuations during sleep on the time scales of minutes. Such changes were reported in past studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup> by averaging over many subjects and may have resulted from the net-DC currents used there, which we did not test here.</p>
              <p id="Par35">Patients with refractory focal-onset epilepsy undergoing surgical evaluation represent a unique opportunity to record directly from the cortical surface during non-invasive stimulation. While aberrant local networks involved in seizure propagation are observed, other cortical and subcortical functions are often considered normal. The potential effects of antiepileptic medications may decrease overall excitability, although some patients were tapered off all medications during stimulation. Widespread and strong spindle entrainment by native slow oscillations during sleep demonstrates that our methods detected physiologically meaningful changes despite medication use, similar to what has been reported previously regarding sleep rhythms recorded in epilepsy surgical patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup>. We demonstrate that entrainment of spindle activity in epilepsy patients is possible with acoustic stimulation. Finally, an exact replication experiment of previously published protocols, delivered to a healthy brain, confirmed the absence of acute entrainment of slow waves and further strengthens the generalizability of our results.</p>
              <p id="Par36">We emphasize that our null results for tACS do not contradict the reported behavioral effects. While positive behavioral results have been found in rodents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, a meta-analysis on memory effects reports mixed results in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. There may be other means by which non-invasive stimulation affects brain activity in multiple indirect ways, including activation of afferent nerves<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>, retina and the vestibular apparatus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup>, astrocytes and perivascular elements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref></sup>, glial activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref></sup>, synaptic plasticity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup>, as well as through placebo effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref></sup>, which merit further exploration.</p>
              <p id="Par37">Our findings suggest that investigation of novel methods of stimulation delivery are needed. This may include methods that induce stronger electric fields at the cortical surface (while minding patient safety and sensation), or may be based on acoustic and other modes of sensory stimulation. Furthermore, applying current at the optimal phase of endogenous rhythms in a closed-loop manner may be more effective<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref></sup>. However, such responsive methods can be therapeutic only if the impaired network pattern is identified and continually monitored<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par38">In some medically justified cases, chronic closed-loop feedback stimulation may be beneficial. Electrode plates may be placed directly onto the skull or on the cortical surface to bypass the skin, as illustrated by an FDA-approved therapeutic device, used to detect and disrupt electrographic seizures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref></sup>. Further progress requires the investigation of novel electrode arrangements and stimulation delivery to produce meaningful and reproducible physiological and behavioral effects.</p>
              <p id="Par39">At a minimum, the present data suggests that tACS at stimulation intensities of up to 2.5 mA does not entrain slow-wave activity during NREM sleep. More generally, our result challenges the common assumption that tACS entrains and enhance endogenous rhythms. Thus, future studies will now have the burden of proof when such claims are made.</p>

                <p id="Par41">Stimulation was performed after patients had entered at least 5 min of continuous NREM sleep, during a daytime nap or nocturnal sleep. Initial sleep staging was performed by visual online analysis, for the presence of a slow-wave and spindle activity as detected in the real-time iEEG seen at the bedside by a physician board-certified in clinical neurophysiology, as well as by direct clinical observation. As part of standard practice at NYU, an extradural lead is customarily placed near the vertex of the craniotomy to aid with spindle detection. When the patient aroused or drifted into a lighter stage of sleep, stimulation was stopped. The iEEG segments were later confirmed by a second board-certified physician to be consistent with N2 and N3 sleep. During offline processing, we selected segments of NREM sleep for analysis by comparing raw spectrograms of sleep (after artifact subtraction), to demonstrate that the depth of NREM sleep is similar across testing conditions (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>).</p>

The decision to implant, placement or recording electrodes, and the duration of invasive monitoring were determined solely on clinical grounds and without reference to this study.

                <p id="Par47">We performed 0.75 and 1 Hz sinusoidal tACS on 13 epileptic patients with implanted subdural and depth electrodes. Seven subjects were stimulated during NREM sleep (four daytime nap; three nocturnal sleep) and six subjects were stimulated during waking rest, eyes closed. Patients were over 18 years old and fluent in English. Subjects were excluded if they had frequent (&gt;2) electroclinical seizures in the 24 h preceding stimulation. Patient characteristics and electrode coverage are summarized in Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> and Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.</p>
                <p id="Par48">All subjects tolerated scalp stimulation. All subjects who were stimulated during night-time sleep (<italic>N</italic> = 3, subjects 11–13) and most subjects during an afternoon nap (<italic>N</italic> = 4, subjects 7–10) were able to sleep through trials at stimulation intensities between 0.5 and 2 mA. One subject (subject 13) woke from sleep and reported an itching sensation during one stimulation block with 2.5 mA current intensity. For the tACS experiments, we recorded and analyzed from 1700 electrodes without artifacts (mean of 131 electrodes per subject, example electrode in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). There were no complications from stimulation, and no induced electrographic seizures. One patient (subject 7) had a typical electroclinical seizure during stimulation. Because this patient had frequent spontaneous seizures, it was determined by the patient’s epileptologist that stimulation was unlikely to have caused the seizure.</p>
                <p id="Par49">Furthermore, we enrolled one subject (S14) who had a bilateral subdural strip and depth survey, to perform a precise replication experiment of prior protocols. This patient had multiple target clinical events captured, which were non-epileptic in nature. He did not have any interictal or ictal activity captured during 1 week of monitoring, even while medications were being withdrawn. In other words, the patient did not demonstrate any epilepsy-related pathophysiology.</p>
                <p id="Par50">We reviewed the hour of iEEG recording prior to stimulation to exclude recent seizures. We performed a pre-stimulation clinical assessment (including assessment of the stimulation skin site and neurologic examination). A physician (AL) was present at the bedside during the entire procedure to monitor for safety. The patient’s iEEG recording was monitored in real time at the bedside during stimulation for seizures.</p>
                <p id="Par51">For patients S1–S13, two stimulating electrodes were placed medially over the frontal and occipital poles (2 cm × 2 cm rubber electrodes) for patients S1–S10. In patients S10–S13 the frontal electrode was offset from midline by 3 cm (S10 and S13 left frontal; S11 and S12 right frontal) to minimize distance from stimulating electrodes to recording electrodes. In one patient S10, the stimulation electrodes were placed at three additional locations to examine the effects of electrode placement on extracerebral and intracerebral current spread. Subjects were covered with a nickel-cadmium shroud to reduce environmental artifact during recording, and other sources of environmental noise (60 Hz) were minimized in the patient area. The stimulation protocol used the NeuroConn DC Stimulator Plus (NeuroConn, Germany), with a biphasic sinusoidal waveform at 0.75 and 1 Hz, at variable intensities between 0.3 and 2 mA, for 10 s (cycles) to determine the peak intensity at which amplifier saturation occurred. Thereafter, subjects were stimulated with TES at 0.75 and 1 Hz, at variable intensities up to the peak intensity, for a duration between 5 and 10 min (10 min for A1–A6 and 5 min for S1–S4). Up to four blocks of stimulation were applied, until subjects woke up. The more than ten-fold increase of the subdurally recorded iEEG amplitude, compared to the EEG signal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref></sup>, allowed for simultaneous recording and stimulation (up to saturation levels of the amplifiers). Stimulation was immediately stopped in the event of an electrographic seizure (S7). A repeat clinical assessment (including assessment of stimulation skin site and neurologic examination) was performed after stimulation.</p>
                <p id="Par52">For S14, who was enrolled to perform a replication experiment of prior protocols, we selected a surgical patient who had a bilateral strip and depth survey. There were two windows that were cut into the patient’s surgical bandage to allow electrode placement at the F3/F4 positions. Stimulation electrodes (8 mm Ag/Cl ring type) were applied bilaterally, with anodes at F3/F4 and cathodes on each mastoid. To test for acute effects, we utilized a stimulation protocol using trapezoidal waveform (0.33 s ramp up/0.33 s steady state/0.33 s ramp down/0.33 s zero current), 0.75 Hz, 0–0.26 mA, for 8 cycles on/8 cycles off (10.66 s ON/10.66 s OFF), for 80 cycles.

Sound was delivered via flat-profile headphones (Bedphones, Millwood, NY), which were placed on the patient’s ears. Placement of the headphones required access under the surgical bandage and was administered by an epilepsy physician (AL), with patient verification of correct positioning. Acoustic pulses (50 ms, pink noise, 5 ms on/off ramps) were digitally generated and delivered via a laptop placed at the bedside. The sound level of the stimulation was manually adjusted for each patient to maximize comfort (e.g., ability to sleep with sound playing in the background). The volume was recorded and estimates of the sound level presented to each subject were assessed via an ear simulator (KEMAR Head and Torso simulator, Knowles Research, coupled to a B&amp;K type 3134 Pressure microphone and B&amp;K type 2230 Sound Level Meter, Bruel &amp; Kjaer, Denmark). Resultant peak sound pressure level estimates for each subject are 72 dB SPL (subject A1), 68 dB SPL (subject A2), 46 dB SPL (subject A3), 70 dB SPL (subject A4).</p>
                <p id="Par54">Similar to the procedure used during tACS stimulation, acoustic stimulation was presented at repetition rates of 0.75 and 1 Hz, in blocks of 5 min during NREM sleep. For each subject, we collected a block at each stimulation rate during NREM sleep, which was visually confirmed offline. The order of the presentation blocks was randomized across subjects. An awake control condition was performed for each patient, to verify the presence of acoustic ERPs. Additional time-locked TTL triggers were generated for each stimulus presentation and recorded by the EEG amplifier’s DC input to aid in offline analysis.</p>

                <p id="Par56">During tACS, the current alternates in directionality between two stimulating electrodes. This alternation results in a sinusoidal signal that can be used to determine the magnitude of the stimulation voltages. Magnitude was estimated by fitting a sinusoid to the signal at each electrode location and estimating the magnitude of the fitted signal. The output of this processing was plotted and manually inspected electrode by electrode.</p>
                <p id="Par57">The measured voltage in each location is then used to derive the projected electric field, by subtracting potential values between adjacent electrode pairs and dividing by their distance, resulting in V/m. The adjacent electrode was defined as the closest electrode within a 10 mm vicinity for cortical electrodes on the same grid array and linear strip, and 5 mm vicinity for depth electrodes on the same strip, to reflect the different inter-electrode distance. It is important to realize that this only captures a fraction of the field magnitude at any given location as the field orientation may not be parallel to the direction of two neighboring electrodes. The distant stimulating electrodes were expected to generate the strongest field intensities on the cortical surface directly under the scalp electrodes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. However, recording electrodes lay predominantly orthogonal to field direction (parallel to the cortical surface). Thus, the measured field projections will not capture maximal intensities, except in the rare circumstance that a depth array is precisely underneath one of the stimulating electrode and oriented toward a second, distant stimulating electrode.</p>
                <p id="Par58">The computational models were built following our previous work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref></sup>. Briefly, the MRI for each patient was automatically segmented by the New Segment toolbox<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref></sup> in Statistical Parametric Mapping 8 (Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, London, UK) in Matlab (R2013a, MathWorks, Natick, MA).

The 2 × 2 cm stimulation electrodes were positioned on the model using CAD software.

                <p id="Par59">PAC measures the degree to which the amplitude of a high-frequency oscillations, <italic>A</italic><sub><italic>HF</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic>), is aligned with the phase of a lower frequency, <italic>ϕ</italic><sub><italic>HF</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic>). We were interested in the interaction between the amplitude of spindle activity band at 14 Hz with the phase of endogenous slow oscillations at 1 Hz (or 0.75 Hz) during sleep as well as entrainment to the applied stimulation (tACS and acoustic). This section refers to 14 Hz activity, but the identical analysis was done for power amplitudes in the theta, alpha, and gamma bands (see next paragraph). To measure entrainment of spindle oscillations during endogenous sleep, we compared spindle power against the phase of the endogenous slow oscillation activity (<italic>ϕ</italic><sub><italic>LFE</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic>), low-frequency endogenous). To measure entrainment to tACS, we used the phase of the electrical stimulation artifact (<italic>ϕ</italic><sub><italic>LFS</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic>), low-frequency stimulation; Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). To obtain the phase during acoustic stimulation we used the delay from the onset of each noise burst. To obtain the phase during tACS and remove the stimulation artifact, we first modeled the 1 Hz artifact as a linear superposition of sines and cosines at multiples of a base frequency (harmonics up to 40 Hz) by fitting the amplitude of each sine/cosine and the base frequency. An example of this fitting procedure is shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref> with the top row indicating the raw signals and the bottom row showing the signals after the fitted harmonic artifact has been subtracted. The resulting harmonic fit captures the 1 Hz stimulation artifact including any harmonic distortion that may have resulted from amplifier nonlinearities. We calculated the stimulation phase from the harmonic fit (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1D</xref>). To obtain the phase during endogenous sleep, first we applied a complex-valued Morlet wavelet filter centered at 1 Hz (or 0.75 Hz) with a bandwidth of 1 Hz (or 0.75 Hz; in humans, the center frequency of slow-wave activity is often assumed to be &lt;1 Hz)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. The instantaneous phase can be directly extracted from the complex-valued filtered signal. Peak and trough of the slow oscillation are indicated by 0° and 180°, respectively, which represent the cortical upstate and downstate as discussed in the main text.</p>
                <p id="Par60">To obtain the instantaneous amplitude of the high-frequency rhythm during tACS we subtract the harmonic fit (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>) and filtered the residual iEEG signal with a complex-valued Morlet bandpass for spindle activity (<italic>fc</italic> = 14 Hz, bandwidth = 7 Hz), for alpha activity (<italic>fc</italic> = 10 Hz, 5 Hz bandwidth) and for gamma activity (<italic>fc</italic> = 90 Hz, bandwidth = 40 Hz, Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1C</xref>). The instantaneous HF power was obtained by taking the absolute value of the filtered signal (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1E</xref>). Patient movement and other artifacts resulted in outliers in the HF amplitude estimates. We removed these by removing cycles with excessive power as follows. For each electrode and each LF cycle we compute the mean power of the HF band (square amplitude averaged over one LF cycle). Cycles are removed as outliers if their mean power exceeds two times the interquartile range across all cycles in an electrode. To obtain the amplitude of the high-frequency rhythm during endogenous sleep and auditory stimulation we used the same procedures starting with the raw iEEG signal (no harmonic fit is needed). Outlier rejection was done as before based on the mean power in the high-frequency band. In addition, for endogenous slow wave we excluded cycles for which the slow oscillation amplitude was below 50 µV. For the analysis of the acoustic stimulation we used the same procedures as with the endogenous sleep except that the phase was defined based on the time since the onset of the noise burst, and cycle duration determined from the average inter-stimulus interval (TTL pulse) for each subject.</p>

                <title>Slow-wave detection during auditory stimulation</title>
                <p id="Par66">Additional analyses were performed on the acoustic stimulation data to assess the physiological origin of the PAC entrainment. First, a slow-wave detection algorithm was applied during stimulation segments to assess whether underlying slow-wave activity was altered during stimulation. In contrast to tACS, this is possible for auditory stimulation as there are no electric stimulation artefacts in the iEEG signal. Following previous literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref></sup>, slow-wave detection consisted of bandpass filtering the waveform (<italic>fc</italic> = 0.75 Hz, bandwidth = 0.75 Hz) and using a zero-crossing algorithm to identify events where two subsequent negative zero-crossing (e.g., from positive to negative) were within the range of 0.5–2 s (2–0.5 Hz, bandwidth = 1.5 Hz). Subsequently, once a slow-wave event was identified, the down-state was identified as the minimum voltage within this event. Second, time-frequency response (TFR) functions were calculated to assess whether stimulation trials consisted of physiological sleep spindles. TFRs were computed using a 6-cycle Morlet wavelets between 5 and 25 Hz and averaging the resulting spectrograms (locked to stimulation onset) across all noise bursts (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Significance between conditions (sleep vs. baseline) was assessed via paired sample <italic>t</italic>-test (one-tailed, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) compared across all stimulation trials (<italic>n</italic> = 300).</p>

                <title>Analysis of changes in power before and after stimulation</title>
                <p id="Par67">Qualitative comparison between the NREM during the two nights without stimulation and the stimulation period show no evident changes in the power spectrum (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>). To determine if there were significant changes in power at the different frequency bands before vs. after stimulation we used the Chronux toolbox<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref></sup> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://chronux.org/">http://chronux.org/</ext-link>; version 2.12). Briefly, for each electrode, 30 s immediately after each 5-min stimulation block were compared against 30 s preceding the first block. Differences in power in the slow oscillation (0.5–1 Hz) and spindle bands (10 and 14 Hz) are shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">12</xref>. Statistical significance of power changes is computed with the Chronux toolbox for the fast spindle band and slow oscillation band and FDR corrected (<italic>q</italic> &lt; 0.05).</p>

                <title>Entrainment with electric stimulation assessed after stimulation block</title>
                <p id="Par68">In subject S14 we collected enough stimulation blocks to evaluate slow-wave entrainment in the intervals immediately following tACS. For this, slow-wave entrainment was tested following previous reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Briefly, the 10-s stimulation-free interval immediately after stimulation was fit with a sinusoid (0.5–1.5 Hz) and phase coherence was calculated across all trials. Statistical significance was calculated using a circular test statistic (Rayleigh test for non-uniformity). In addition, to test for after-effects, we utilized the same trapezoidal waveform, frequency, and intensity in five separate 5-min blocks during NREM sleep (5 min ON/5 min OFF). We compared these sessions against two control periods of endogenous NREM sleep for spindle (10, 14 Hz) entrainment. The power in the stimulation-free intervals was calculated for slow oscillations (0.5–1 Hz), slow spindle activity (8–12 Hz), and fast spindle activity (12–15 Hz). This quantity was then compared to the power during a different night, when the subject was in an equal sleep state. Slow oscillations and slow spindle activity were averaged across locations close to Fz. And fast spindle activity was determined across parietal locations.</p>
