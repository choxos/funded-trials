                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>To investigate long-term metformin adherence in the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study (DPPOS) by examining: (1) predictors of long-term adherence to study metformin and (2) whether metformin adherence was associated with incident type 2 diabetes.</p>

                  <title>Research design and methods</title>
                  <p>DPPOS was an open-label continuation of the randomized clinical trial (Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP)) in which eligible participants randomized to the metformin group were offered study metformin and followed over 11 years. A brief structured adherence interview was administered semiannually. Metformin adherence was assessed by pill counts. Predictors of metformin adherence were examined in multivariate regression models. Incident diabetes associated with metformin adherence and other variables was assessed in Cox proportional hazards models.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Of 868 participants eligible to continue taking study metformin, 664 (76%) took at least some metformin over 11 years, with 478 of them reporting problems with adherence. DPPOS cumulative adherence showed significant associations of higher adherence (â¥80%) with early adherence at 3âmonths in DPP (p&lt;0.001) and lower depression scores during DPPOS (p&lt;0.001); significant differences were also seen by race/ethnicity (p&lt;0.004). Predicting adherence by multivariate modeling showed odds of adherence significantly lower for Black participants and for participants reporting more than one barrier. Odds for adherence were significantly higher for those adherent early in DPP and those reporting at least one planned strategy to improve adherence. Higher metformin adherence was significantly associated with a lower diabetes risk (p=0.04), even after adjustment for demographic variables, depression, and anxiety scores.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>In this long-term diabetes prevention study, early metformin adherence and planned strategies to promote adherence improved long-term adherence over 11 years; higher adherence to metformin was related to lower diabetes incidence. Incorporating strategies to promote adherence when initially prescribing metformin and counseling to support adherence over time are warranted.</p>

              <p>Individuals with an established disease are often presumed to have an intrinsic motivation to adhere to prescribed medications in order to alleviate symptoms or slow progression of their disease.

              <p>Primary prevention of type 2 diabetes requires long-term adherence to proven lifestyle or medication interventions. Metformin has proven safety, efficacy, and tolerability from the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP)<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> and the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study (DPPOS).<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> It has been recommended in recent standards of medical care for diabetes prevention;<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> despite this, providers rarely prescribe metformin for diabetes prevention.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 8</xref> While issues related to metformin use for diabetes prevention are multifactorial and at several levels, improved understanding of patient-level factors associated with metformin adherence over time is essential to expanding its use as a preventive medication.</p>
              <p>During the first 3âyears of DPP, cumulative metformin adherence (defined as the proportion of visits at which participants took <inline-formula><mml:math id="M1"><mml:mo>Â§amp;gt;</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>80% of prescribed metformin doses) was 71%. While patient-reported barriers were associated with decreased odds of adherence, the use of adherence strategies was associated with increased odds of adherence. Importantly, participants who were adherent to metformin had approximately 25% reduced risk of developing diabetes compared with those who were not adherent.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p>
              <p>This report describes long-term metformin adherence during DPPOS from 2002 through 2013. We examined sociodemographic predictors of adherence over 11 years of follow-up and, based on earlier DPP findings,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> we hypothesized a significant association between patient-reported barriers and non-adherence. Among those who reported problems with taking metformin, we expected planned strategies to be associated with improved adherence. Based on prior evidence from diverse chronic health conditions, including diabetes, we also hypothesized that poorer physical or mental health and more symptoms of depression or anxiety<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 10â12</xref> would be associated with metformin non-adherence. Early non-adherence in DPP and a higher number of concomitant medications were expected to be associated with lower metformin adherence over the follow-up. We explored evidence for cumulative effects of the number of adherence barriers and strategies, as well as effects of specific barrier and strategy types. In addition, the relationship between long-term metformin adherence and time to development of type 2 diabetes was assessed.</p>

                <p>The intervention for study-supplied metformin adherence in DPPOS was less intensive than during the DPP and included a brief structured interview at semiannual visits. Participants also received mailed reminder cards intermittently containing motivational messages to promote adherence. The structured adherence interview (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">online supplemental figure S1</xref>) assessed self-reported barriers to adherence and participantsâ planned strategies to improve adherence. Only participants who took any amount of study-provided metformin since the last visit, and who endorsed having problems taking their metformin as prescribed, completed this interview. The rationale for restricting the interview to this subgroup was the need to reduce the caseload burden of clinic staff. Case managers could initiate telephone counseling between visits for problem-solving medication-taking behaviors, as feasible for staff and acceptable to participants. Participants received token incentives for taking their metformin (eg, a $10 gift card annually). Because of budgetary constraints in this long-term study, metformin was dispensed in two large containers, each accommodating a 3-month supply.</p>

                  <p>Demographic and psychosocial variables used to predict adherence were selected based on prior adherence research as well as DPP results. For visits at which a participant was actively taking metformin and reported problems taking it as prescribed, information was recorded during the structured interview on barriers to metformin use over the prior 6âmonths and planned strategies to overcome these barriers during the subsequent 6âmonths. Participants could decline to strategize with staff.

                <p>The visit adherence outcome was analyzed using generalized estimating equation (GEE) models with a binomial distribution and autoregressive covariance structure to account for the correlation in participantâs repeated measurements during follow-up. For barriers to adherence, those reporting only one problem taking study metformin were the reference group. Planned strategy analyses were limited to those reporting problems taking metformin; those declining to discuss adherence strategies were the reference group. The time to diabetes outcome was analyzed using Cox Proportional Hazards models among participants who had not developed diabetes by the beginning of DPPOS. Fit for the Cox Models was assessed using Harrellâs c-statistic.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> The c-index used in a proportional hazards model is interpreted as a probability that among a randomly chosen pair of individuals, the one with longer survival has an estimated event risk (ie, hazard) that is less than or equal to the event risk for the individual with shorter survival. If the c-statistic were 0.50, this would indicate that the model has no ability to discriminate between individuals with different survival experience. Values above 0.5 indicate increased model discrimination above pure chance, with values near 1 indicating the model has almost perfect discrimination. These models use all follow-up information of participants until they either develop diabetes or they have their last visit. All models are adjusted for demographic variables, psychosocial variables (depression, anxiety, and SF-36 scores), as well as other concomitant medications and early metformin adherence. Except where noted, p&lt;0.05 were considered nominally statistically significant, with no adjustments made for multiple tests. Analyses were conducted using R (V.3.4.1) and SAS (V.9.4) statistical software.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>The DPPOS medication adherence results are a unique contribution to clinical, behavioral literature as they represent 11 years of follow-up, a diverse cohort and an open-label study occurring after the report of positive results for prevention or delay of type 2 diabetes using metformin. A report of long-term safety and tolerability of metformin during DPP and the first 7âyears of DPPOS<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> showed that weight loss was associated with better adherence to metformin and that long-term metformin use was safe and well tolerated. To our knowledge, there are no publications comparable to this report regarding long-term preventive medication adherence, predictors, and clinical outcomes over 11 years. Systematic reviews on interventions to enhance medication adherence note that long-term interventions in chronic disease require more research; few studies report effects on both adherence and clinical outcomes.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> In addition, most studies are of therapeutic rather than preventive medications.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> This DPPOS adherence report fills important knowledge gaps.</p>
              <p>Among those eligible to take study metformin in DPPOS, participants who took at least some metformin were more adherent to metformin early in DPP, had higher income, and took more concomitant medications than those who took no metformin. An important medication adherence finding from the DPP, that early medication adherence predicted adherence at 1âyear and 3âyears,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> was sustained as predictive of cumulative adherence during the 11 years of DPPOS. This effect of early DPP adherence was evident and significant in analyses grouping categories of participants by their level of adherence throughout DPPOS and in analyses that predicted the odds of achieving the adherence threshold over time</p>
              <p>Results of analyses (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>) grouping participants into different levels of adherence over time also supported our hypotheses linking both lower depressive symptoms and a higher physical component score on the SF-36 to better medication adherence. Significant differences among the racial/ethnic categories of participants in DPPOS by categories of adherence (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>) must be considered with caution because of some small cell sizes. Adherence challenges for Black participants require further exploration. These challenges seemed to have more to do with difficulties achieving consistently high levels of adherence in DPPOS rather than increased risk for stopping metformin. Black participants were at risk for lower adherence across study visits over time, even in multivariate models that controlled for potentially confounding socioeconomic and psychosocial variables. Those retired at DPPOS baseline were also more likely to have consistently high levels of adherence, perhaps having developed routines for taking metformin.</p>
              <p>Compared with the 71% cumulative metformin adherence during DPPâs 3âyears,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> cumulative adherence during the 11 years of DPPOS was 60%. Although adherence to metformin was a priority for DPPOS staff, some potential explanations for the decline include: aging participants; less personal contact time than during DPP; staff or participant study fatigue and other unmeasured variables.</p>
              <p>The majority (ranging from 72% to 84% over time) of participants taking any metformin reported no problems/barriers taking metformin as prescribed. For those who did report problems/barriers, the most frequently reported barrier was forgetting to take metformin, similar to reports during the DPP years.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> A recent Randomized Clinical Trial (RCT) by Choudhry <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> assessed the effect on medication adherence of using low-cost reminder devices delivered with no behavioral intervention; there were no significant differences in adherence compared with controls.</p>
              <p>Our consistent patterns of adherence over 11 years of DPPOS could be attributed to modest behavioral interventions coupled with optional reminder devices. Most reported barriers significantly declined over time, perhaps the result of problem-solving routines. Medication-taking behaviors may have stabilized for taking or not taking metformin. The participants who continued taking metformin were more likely to be adherent atÂ <underline>&gt;</underline>80% of prescribed dose.</p>
              <p>Planned strategies to improve adherence to metformin were variable over 11 years of DPPOS, with reminder devices significantly declining in use and activity-related strategies significantly increasing. Comparison of DPP adherence strategy results<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> and DPPOS results reported here should be done cautiously, as the strategy interview query in DPP was retrospective, that is, strategies used during the last 3âmonths; the query in DPPOS was prospective, that is, a strategy to improve adherence over the next 6âmonths.</p>
              <p>The models in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3</xref> inform predictors of medication adherence in this long-term study. Early adherence in DPP increased the odds of adherence in DPPOS. Black participants had significantly lower odds of adherence during DPPOS, whereas during DPP, Black race was only predictive of lower medication adherence in multivariate analyses for the placebo group.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Early metformin adherence was a strong predictor of adherence at 1âyear and 3âyears in DPP; this same covariate continued predicting adherence through DPPOS. It is critical to plan adherence interventions from the first dose of a preventive medication, rather than waiting for problems to surface and exposure time lost.</p>
              <p>Reporting multiple barriers lowers the odds of adherence and reporting multiple planned strategies raises odds of adherence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3</xref>). These results were remarkably similar during DPP for the metformin group and in DPPOS despite the following: DPPOS participants were made aware of DPP positive results for taking metformin to prevent/delay diabetes; the less intensive intervention (eg, reduced frequency of contact) during DPPOS; and limited incentives for adherence during DPPOS.</p>
              <p>Survival analyses for diagnosis of diabetes during the DPPOS 11 years (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4</xref>) showed metformin adherence in DPPOS and higher education decreased the HR, while Black race and mean anxiety score increased it. The significance of DPPOS cumulative adherence depended on adjustment for early adherence in DPP. When early DPP adherence was not controlled, the effect of DPPOS adherence fell slightly below the significance threshold. Therefore, accounting for overlap with early DPP adherence improved, rather than attenuated, the predictive power of DPPOS cumulative adherence for time to diabetes diagnosis. Early DPP adherence was not a significant predictor of time to diabetes in these DPPOS analyses; however, our previously reported results demonstrated a significant association between metformin adherence and time to diabetes within the 2.8 years of DPP.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Taken together, these findings suggest that more proximal metformin adherence is predictive of diabetes risk, irrespective of an earlier history of adherence.</p>
              <p>Those who took any metformin during DPPOS (n=664) reported taking more concomitant medications than those who were taking no metformin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">online supplemental table S1</xref>), a finding opposite to the inverse relationship between complexity of medication regimens and adherence found in earlier reviews.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 21 24 25</xref> There is some evidence that this relationship depends on drug class.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Some studies in type 2 diabetes have found no decrease in adherence linked to poly-pharmacy.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> A more recent systematic review summarizes inconsistent findings across studies in type 2 diabetes.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> We are aware of no robust studies that have investigated this relationship for adherence to preventive medications. Perhaps providers could take advantage of patientsâ poly-pharmacy to promote preventive medication adherence by assisting patients to adopt their established routines to include metformin.</p>
              <p>Since forgetting was the most frequently cited barrier in both DPP and DPPOS, new ways of meeting this challenge must be implemented for preventive medication adherence in prediabetes, including behavioral interventions begun at initiation.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> For long-term adherence, innovative technologies should be explored. Digital reminders on smart phones are an obvious target for implementing a time-oriented routine,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> although the feasibility of taking medications may be challenging when a digital cue (alarm, text message) occurs, unless the medication supply is carried by the individual.</p>
              <p>Research on long-term medication adherence for primary prevention in chronic diseases is limited. Newby <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> reported on long-term adherence to prevention therapies in coronary artery disease in 31â750 patients. Adherence was suboptimal for aspirin, lipid-lowering agents, and beta-blockers; they concluded that more attention be focused on understanding and improving long-term adherence. A systematic review of 62 interventions<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> to improve medication adherence in chronic disease concluded that while reduced out-of-pocket expenses and case management improved medication adherence, there was no evidence for its effect on long-term adherence and outcomes. Our data may fill some gaps regarding long-term preventive medication adherence.</p>
              <p>One limitation of this study is that results do not address non-adherence related to the common barrier of refilling prescription medications; study metformin was dispensed to participants every 6âmonths. A second limitation is that the time burden of the adherence interview was intentionally decreased for feasibility in this long-term study; it was only asked of participants who reported problems taking their study medication. This limits the generalizability of our findings, as we do not have responses from participants who reported no barriers; they may have used effective strategies to overcome barriers. We did, however, report similar data during the DPP.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> The pill count measure of medication adherence has sources of error,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> and especially in a long-term study where reported as a dichotomous variable. Finally, we chose to define metformin adherence as exposure (ie, actually taking metformin) versus intention to take metformin among participants who temporarily discontinued use for protocol reasons. Thus, estimates of actual metformin adherence are lower in our study compared with studies in which adherence is primarily defined in behavioral terms (eg, participants who stop study medication for protocol reasons being classified as adherent). We believe each limitation is more than balanced by the strengths of this long-term adherence study with behavioral and clinical outcomes for a preventive diabetes medication in a diverse, well-described cohort.</p>
              <p>Lessons from the DPPOS experience can help develop feasible patient-level interventions to improve adherence to metformin for diabetes prevention in the real world. Clearly, early adherence remains an important goal in both clinical practice and research in order to implement effective interventions. Implementing long-term, effective strategies to promote adherence to a preventive medication is a crucial piece of the ongoing type 2 diabetes prevention challenge. Prescription of metformin for diabetes prevention, however, remains underused at the provider and health system levels;<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 8 33 34</xref> thus a multilevel approach is required to prevent or delay diabetes with metformin.</p>
