                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p><italic>Ebolavirus</italic> and <italic>Marburgvirus</italic> cause severe hemorrhagic fever with high mortality and are potential bioterrorism agents. There are no available vaccines or therapeutic agents. Previous clinical trials evaluated transmembrane-deleted and point-mutation <italic>Ebolavirus</italic> glycoproteins (GPs) in candidate vaccines. Constructs evaluated in this trial encode wild-type (WT) GP from <italic>Ebolavirus Zaire</italic> and <italic>Sudan</italic> species and the <italic>Marburgvirus</italic> Angola strain expressed in a DNA vaccine.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>The VRC 206 study evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of these DNA vaccines (4 mg administered intramuscularly by Biojector) at weeks 0, 4, and 8, with a homologous boost at or after week 32. Safety evaluations included solicited reactogenicity and coagulation parameters. Primary immune assessment was done by means of GP-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>The vaccines were well tolerated, with no serious adverse events; 80% of subjects had positive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay results (≥30) at week 12. The fourth DNA vaccination boosted the immune responses.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>The investigational <italic>Ebolavirus</italic> and <italic>Marburgvirus</italic> WT GP DNA vaccines were safe, well tolerated, and immunogenic in this phase I study. These results will further inform filovirus vaccine research toward a goal of inducing protective immunity by using WT GP antigens in candidate vaccine regimens.</p>

            <p><italic>Ebolavirus</italic> and <italic>Marburgvirus</italic> belong to the family Filoviridae and are known to cause outbreaks of viral hemorrhagic fever, a severe and often fatal disease. Filoviruses are negative-strand RNA viruses. A single glycoprotein (GP) facilitates viral entry likely through receptor mediated endocytosis into monocytes and macrophages, endothelial cells, and hepatocytes [<xref rid="JIU511C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="JIU511C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The wild-type (WT) GP antigen is the primary antigen targeted by candidate vaccines.</p>
            <p>There are 5 species of <italic>Ebolavirus</italic>: <italic>Zaire</italic> (EBOV), <italic>Sudan</italic> (SUDV), <italic>Reston, Taï Forest,</italic> and <italic>Bundibugyo</italic>. EBOV and SUDV have been responsible for several human outbreaks, with case fatality rates of 41%–90% [<xref rid="JIU511C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. They are therefore targeted species for vaccine development. <italic>Marburgvirus</italic> has a single species, <italic>Marburg marburgvirus</italic> with 2 viruses that include Marburg virus (MARV) and Ravn virus, and several strains, including Angola [<xref rid="JIU511C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], that are currently targeted for vaccine development.</p>
            <p>Outbreaks of <italic>Ebolavirus</italic> and <italic>Marburgvirus</italic> have occurred in Africa and have intermittently reemerged, with varying case fatality rates. A 2014 outbreak of <italic>Ebolavirus</italic> disease (species <italic>Zaire ebolavirus</italic>) in West Africa, including Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Nigeria, has been the worst outbreak to date and the first to be localized primarily in urban areas [<xref rid="JIU511C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. A case fatality rate ranging from 60% to 87% was reported in the first few months of the outbreak. This outbreak affected community members as well as healthcare workers and seems to have spread person to person through regional and international travel. <italic>Marburgvirus</italic> disease has primarily occurred in travelers [<xref rid="JIU511C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="JIU511C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and, has case fatality rates of 23%–90% [<xref rid="JIU511C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], the potential to spread internationally with increasing global travel, and the potential threat to be used as a biological weapon.</p>
            <p>Several candidate vaccine platforms have been investigated in animal models, including vectors such as vesicular stomatitis virus, DNA plasmids, viruslike particles, and recombinant adenovirus (rAd), alone or as part of a prime-boost strategy [<xref rid="JIU511C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="JIU511C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="JIU511C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>–<xref rid="JIU511C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Research and development toward a vaccine that would provide protective immunity against these infections has been an iterative process requiring the clinical evaluation of interim candidate GP vaccine antigens, in part because of theoretical safety concerns.</p>
            <p>In 2006, we reported the first clinical trial evaluating a multigene DNA vaccine encoding transmembrane-deleted GP from EBOV and SUDV and nucleoprotein from EBOV [<xref rid="JIU511C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The vaccine was well tolerated, with no significant adverse events or coagulation abnormalities. The vaccine elicited GP-specific antibody and T-cell responses that were not cross-reactive, but after further preclinical evaluation of GP antigens, we found that a transmembrane-deleted GP did not provide optimal protection and that the nucleoprotein antigen was not required for protection.</p>
            <p>The subsequent clinical trial evaluated an rAd5 vector vaccine expressing an EBOV GP with a single amino acid point mutation (point mutation GP). The product was found to be safe and well tolerated but elicited modest immunogenicity, possibly in part because of suppression by preexisting immunity to the Ad5 vector [<xref rid="JIU511C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Nonhuman primate studies have further shown that transmembrane-deleted and point mutation GP antigens are partially protective but WT GP constructs are safe and provide the highest level of protection [<xref rid="JIU511C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Therefore, the WT GP antigen is the current focus of Vaccine Research Center (VRC) research and development for <italic>Ebolavirus</italic> and <italic>Marburgvirus</italic> vaccines. Here we report the results of a phase I clinical trial evaluating 2 DNA vaccines, one that encodes for MARV Angola GP and the second for EBOV and SUDV WT GP.</p>

                <title>Study Design and Procedures</title>
                <p>VRC 206 was a single-site, phase 1, open label study examining the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of 2 investigational DNA vaccines, one (MAR) expressing GP from MARV Angola strain (GP [AN]) and the other (EBO) expressing WT GP from EBOV (GP [Z]) and SUDV (GP [S]) in healthy adults aged 18–60 years. The study was conducted at the NIH Clinical Center by the VRC, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, Maryland (clinicaltrials.gov NCT00605514). The study was reviewed and approved by the NIAID Institutional Review Board. The US Department of Health and Human Services human experimental guidelines for conducting clinical research were followed. All subjects gave written informed consent before participation.</p>
                <p>A schema of the study is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="JIU511F1">Figure 1</xref>. The study groups were not randomized because approval to proceed with the MAR DNA vaccine was received before approval to proceed with the EBO WT DNA vaccine owing to a delay in receiving preclinical data with the EBO WT DNA vaccine. Thus, group 1 was fully enrolled first to receive the MAR DNA vaccine. Later, group 2 enrolled to receive the EBO WT DNA vaccine. No more than 1 subject per day was administered vaccine for the first 3 injections in each group, and safety data through 2 weeks after these injections were reviewed by a protocol safety review team before continuing enrollment of that group.</p>

                <p>A 4-mg dose of vaccine was administered as 1 mL by intramuscular injection in the deltoid muscle, using the Biojector 2000 Needle-Free Injection Management System (Bioject). In both groups, the immunization series was a 3-dose priming regimen with an optional single-dose homologous booster. The schedule for the 3-dose priming series was targeted to study days 0, 28, and 56, within permitted windows. Based on results from preclinical immunogenicity data available after the VRC 206 study began, an optional homologous booster dose at week 32 or later was offered to subjects who had completed all 3 injections and remained in clinical follow-up.</p>
                <p>Laboratory and clinical evaluations were completed at scheduled study visits. Local and systemic reactogenicity was self-reported by subjects using 5-day diary cards after each vaccination. Clinical assessment and laboratory evaluations for creatinine, alanine aminotransferase, complete blood cell count, prothrombin time, and partial thromboplastin time were completed at scheduled study visits. Adverse events were reported for the entire duration of the study, coded using the <italic>Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities</italic> and graded for severity using the Division of AIDS table for grading the severity of adverse events (December 2004) [<xref rid="JIU511C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].

                <title>Vaccines</title>
                <p>Both the EBO plasmid DNA vaccine VRC-EBODNA023-00-VP and the MAR plasmid DNA vaccine VRC-MARDNA025-00-VP were developed by the VRC. The EBO plasmid DNA vaccine was manufactured by the VRC/NIAID Vaccine Pilot Plant, operated by Leidos in Frederick, Maryland, and the MAR plasmid DNA vaccine was produced by Althea Technologies in San Diego, California. Both were manufactured under good manufacturing practice conditions. The MAR vaccine consists of a single, closed, circular plasmid DNA macromolecule (plasmid VRC 6712) designed to express WT GP of the MARV Angola strain (GenBank accession No. DQ447653). The EBO vaccine is composed of 2 plasmids combined in equal concentrations (milligrams per milliliter) in which the amino acid sequences for the GP antigens expressed are identical to WT GP of <italic>Ebolavirus</italic>. These plasmids are VRC 6611, which expresses the GP gene from the SUDV strain (GenBank accession No. U28134) and VRC 6614, which expresses the GP gene from the EBOV strain (GenBank accession No. U23187). The WT GP inserts were codon modified to optimize antigen expression in human cells [<xref rid="JIU511C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The plasmids in both vaccines are incapable of replication in human cells.</p>
                <p>The VRC constructed plasmids containing complementary DNAs used to subclone the WT GP gene inserts into the CMV/R [<xref rid="JIU511C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] plasmid DNA expression vector [<xref rid="JIU511C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This CMV/R expression vector has been tested in previous clinical trials of DNA plasmid vaccines for human immunodeficiency virus, West Nile virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and avian influenza conducted by the VRC [<xref rid="JIU511C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="JIU511C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>–<xref rid="JIU511C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p>
                <p>The DNA plasmids were produced in master cell banks using plasmid DNA to transform commercially available strains of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and produce large-volume cultures yielding mass quantities of plasmid DNA. Bacterial cell growth was dependent on the cellular expression of kanamycin resistance protein encoded in the plasmid DNA. After the growth of bacterial cells, the bulk plasmid drug substances were filtered and formulated in phosphate-buffered saline as a sterile liquid injectable dosage form for intramuscular injection.</p>

Cells were stained with Aqua Blue at room temperature for 20 minutes, followed immediately by staining with the surface markers (CD3, CD28, CD45RA, and CCR7) for another 20 minutes. Cells were washed twice, permeabilized with CytoFix-CytoPerm reagent (BD; 100 µL per well) with 20-minute incubation at 2°C –8°C, and then washed twice with PermWash (BD). Intracellular cytokine staining (CD4, CD8, IFN-γ, interleukin 2, tumor necrosis factor α) was in a total of 100 µL per well at room temperature for 20 minutes, followed by 3 washes with PermWash. The cells were resuspended in 1% paraformaldehyde and stored at 4°C for ≤36 hours before flow cytometric analysis. Multiparameter flow cytometric analysis was performed on a LSR-II flow cytometer (BDIS); 50 000–250 000 events were acquired.</p>
                <p>Results were analyzed using FlowJo software Version 9.4.10 (Tree Star Software). The same gating strategy is used for all clinical testing.

                <p>Both vaccines were well tolerated, and there were no serious adverse events. Coagulation parameters of study subjects were closely monitored as per protocol owing to a theoretical concern over GP-mediated cytopathology [<xref rid="JIU511C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and complete cell blood counts were evaluated at baseline and throughout the study. No laboratory or clinical coagulation abnormalities were detected. Local and systemic solicited reactogenicity (<xref rid="JIU511TB2" ref-type="table">Tables 2</xref> and <xref rid="JIU511TB3" ref-type="table">3</xref>) was generally mild in both groups and similar to that seen in previous studies of DNA vaccines with other constructs [<xref rid="JIU511C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="JIU511C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="JIU511C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="JIU511C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. One subject reported a moderate local reaction, and 2 reported ≥1 moderate systemic reaction. Two adverse events, mild transient lightheadedness and mild pyuria, were assessed as possibly related to vaccination. One adverse event, a mild superficial lesion at the injection site that resolved without treatment, was assessed as definitely related to the study vaccines based on temporal relationship and biological plausibility.</p>

                <title>Vaccine-Specific Antibody Responses</title>
                <p>EBO and MAR specific antibody responses were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Four weeks after the third vaccination, 80% of subjects (8 of 10) in group 1 tested positive for GP (AN) antibody. In group 2, 89% (8/9) tested positive for GP (S) and 56% (5/9) tested positive for GP (Z). The frequency of responses decreased over time, and 24 weeks after the third vaccination 11% of subjects (1 of 9) were positive for GP (AN) and GP (S), and none were positive for GP (Z).</p>
                <p>Seven subjects in group 1 and 8 in group 2 received the optional fourth vaccine (homologous boost) between study weeks 32 and 49. Four weeks after the fourth vaccination, 100% of subjects (7 of 7) were positive for GP (AN), 75% (6/8) for GP (S), and 63% (5/8) for GP (Z). Between 8 and 12 weeks after the boost, 57% (4 of 7) in group 1 had sustained positive responses for GP (AN), and 50% (4 of 8) in group 2 had sustained positive responses for GP (S) and GP (Z). Cumulative GP-specific response rates in the study were 90% (9 of 10) for GP (AN), 89% (8 of 9) for GP (S), and 67% (6 of 9) for GP (Z).</p>
                <p>The magnitude of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay titers peaked 4 weeks after the third vaccination and then decreased during the next 24 weeks. The geometric mean titers to GP (AN), GP (S), and GP (Z) 4 weeks after the third vaccination were 36.3 (95% CI, 22.3–59.3), 51.1 (95% CI, 29.8–87.8), and 31.8 (95% CI, 16.8–60.2), respectively, and then decreased close to baseline levels. Four weeks after the fourth vaccination, geometric mean titers to GP (AN), GP (S), and GP (Z) increased to 48.0 (95% CI, 27.9–82.7), 50.1 (95% CI, 21.3–117.7), and 30.4 (95% CI, 16.4–56.1), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JIU511F2">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>There are currently no available effective vaccines or therapies against filoviruses. An effective vaccine would be a key preventive health measure for limiting the spread of infection, protecting healthcare workers and military troops, and containing natural outbreaks.</p>
              <p>This is the first clinical trial report of an <italic>Ebolavirus</italic> WT GP construct and the first report of a <italic>Marburgvirus</italic> vaccine clinical trial. We have shown elsewhere that earlier-generation gene-based constructs were safe and immunogenic, including a DNA vaccine with an EBO transmembrane-deleted GP and an rAd5 vector encoding EBO GP containing a point mutation. Nonhuman primate studies have clearly demonstrated that full-length WT GP constructs are safe and protective in cynomolgous macaques [<xref rid="JIU511C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and WT GP is considered the antigen most likely to induce protective antibody and T-cell responses. In this phase I study (VRC 206), both the EBO and MAR WT GP vaccines were well tolerated. The WT GP constructs evaluated in the current study were immunogenic and induced both humoral and T-cell responses to all 3 GP immunogen inserts.</p>
              <p>We also saw that administration of a fourth dose of DNA as a homologous boost improved the otherwise waning antibody titers and T-cell responses. It is known that DNA provides a priming response for numerous antigens, typically with a protein or more potent vector boost, and that a prolonged boost interval improves the overall effect of DNA priming [<xref rid="JIU511C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], but this report is unique in that homologous DNA vaccine induced a demonstrable boost of preexisting memory B cells.</p>
              <p>In the current trial, antibody responses dominated the immune response, and CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses were more frequent than CD8<sup>+</sup> responses. The induction of T-cell responses by the vaccine is significant because recent nonhuman primate studies suggest that CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses play an important role in protection induced by an EBO GP construct vaccine and are known to be important for efficient viral clearance [<xref rid="JIU511C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="JIU511C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p>
              <p>This study (VRC 206) demonstrated that WT GP DNA vaccines for <italic>Ebolavirus</italic> and <italic>Marburgvirus</italic> were safe and immunogenic in humans. The results from this study paved the way for further evaluation of these 2 candidate vaccines in the first clinical trial of candidate <italic>Ebolavirus</italic> and <italic>Marburgvirus</italic> vaccines in Africa. A phase Ib clinical trial evaluating these vaccines opened to accrual in Kampala, Uganda, after interim safety analysis of the VRC 206 study. The successful evaluation of DNA vaccines targeting <italic>Ebolavirus</italic> and <italic>Marburgvirus</italic> reported here provides the opportunity to further explore WT filovirus GP antigen delivery in other vaccine platforms with greater immunogenicity and potential for protective immunity. These results will guide further filovirus vaccine research and development and also provide important generalizable data regarding DNA-based priming and boosting in humans.</p>
