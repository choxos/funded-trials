                <p id="Par1">Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) is a standard-of-care for medically-inoperable-early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). One third of patients progress and chemotherapy is rarely used in this population. We questioned if addition of the immune-checkpoint-inhibitor (ICI) atezolizumab to standard-of-care SABR can improve outcomes. We initiated a multi-institutional single-arm phase I study (NCT02599454) enrolling twenty patients with the primary endpoint of maximum tolerated dose (MTD); secondary endpoints of safety and efficacy; and exploratory mechanistic correlatives. Treatment is well tolerated and full dose atezolizumab (1200 mg) is the MTD. Efficacy signals include early responses (after 2 cycles of ICI, before initiation of SABR) in 17% of patients. Biomarkers of functional adaptive immunity, including T cell activation in the tumor and response to ex-vivo stimulation by circulating T cells, are highly predictive of benefit. These results require validation and are being tested in a phase III randomized trial.</p>

              <p id="Par3">Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) targeting programmed death (PD)-1 and programmed death ligand (PD-L1) have become a component of standard front-line therapy for metastatic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, locally advanced<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, and resectable<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Several mechanistic biomarkers for ICI efficacy have been reported, including PD-L1 expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, density and dysfunction of T cells in the TME<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, and tumor mutational burden<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par4">Immunotherapy may also be very effective in eradicating micro-metastatic disease in early-stage patients, given its proven efficacy in large, bulky tumors that have established immune suppression systemically and within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Clinical data supports this hypothesis with the randomized phase III trials IMpower 010 and CheckMate 816 demonstrating efficacy for adjuvant or neoadjuvant administration of ICIs leading to FDA approvals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par5">For medically inoperable early-stage NSCLC patients who cannot tolerate surgical resection or chemotherapy due to comorbid conditions, stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) is a standard of care. Clinical studies demonstrate rates of in-field tumor control exceeding 90% at 3 years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. However, rates of regional and distant failure have remained unacceptably high, with distant recurrence rates exceeding 30% at 5 years with long-term follow up<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Recurrence rates are even higher in patients with high-risk features, including large tumor diameter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, high standardized uptake value (SUV) on fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, and high histologic grade<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, among others. In a multi-institutional study evaluating SABR for tumors &gt;5 cm, disease-free survival (DFS) at 2 years was only 53.5%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, and increasing SUV was an independent predictive factor for decreased survival. In a National Cancer Institute Database analysis, overall survival (OS) at 3 years was only 33% among patients with tumors &gt;4 cm treated with SABR alone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. For surgically managed early-stage NSCLC, adjuvant chemotherapy is frequently offered for node-negative tumors larger than 4 cm based on prospective randomized trials suggesting a benefit for select patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. However, adjuvant chemotherapy has not been consistently offered to SABR patients due to a lack of supporting prospective data and a lack of tolerance to platinum-based chemotherapy in this typically frail population. ICI’s milder side effect profile is ideal for evaluation in the medically inoperable population. Furthermore, preclinical<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> and early clinical<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> data suggest potential synergy between radiotherapy and ICI, although the optimal timing of radiation plus ICI is not well defined.</p>
              <p id="Par6">We conducted a multi-institutional phase I study with an expansion cohort testing the addition of six cycles of atezolizumab to SABR in high-risk, medically inoperable, early-stage NSCLC accompanied by in-depth correlative analyses (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>). Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and safety analyses found escalation to full dose atezolizumab (1200 mg) is well tolerated in combination with SABR. Preliminary signals of ICI efficacy in this population were also observed with early responses to ICI after just two cycles and before initiation of SABR, and a dose–response effect on post-hoc analysis with significantly improved freedom from progression (FFP) in patients receiving full dose atezolizumab compared to dose levels 1 and 2. The correlative analysis demonstrated that an immune signature of heightened T cell functionality in the TME and periphery correlates with clinical outcomes, as opposed to biomarkers such as T cell dysfunction or dormancy reported in advanced stage NSCLC, suggesting biological and mechanistic differences in the immune landscape of early vs. advanced stage NSCLC. Conclusions regarding efficacy and correlative outcomes are limited by small patient numbers and the early-stage nature of this trial and should be viewed as hypothesis-generating.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Clinical outcomes.</title><p><bold>A</bold> Schema of a clinical trial. <bold>B</bold> Overall survival of clinical trial patients from the date of enrollment estimated by the Kaplan–Meier method (<italic>n</italic> = 19). <bold>C</bold> Progression-free survival of clinical trial patients from the date of enrollment by the Kaplan–Meier method (<italic>n</italic> = 18). <bold>D</bold> Waterfall plot depicting the relative change in tumor volume following two cycles of neoadjuvant atezolizumab stratified by PD-L1 status, smoking status, and histology (<italic>n</italic> = 18).

                <p id="Par9">Among 15 patients on the phase 1 component, 12 were evaluable for DLT. Four patients enrolled on dose level 1 (3 mg/kg). One patient withdrew from the trial due to travel hardship and was replaced. The remaining patients had no DLTs and completed six cycles of atezolizumab. Six patients enrolled on dose level 2 (10 mg/kg). One of the first three patients developed a grade 3 rash and was removed from protocol therapy for DLT but continued study evaluation. An additional three patients enrolled at dose level 2 and completed six cycles of protocol therapy without DLT. Five patients enrolled on dose level 3 (1200 mg). Two patients on dose level 3 discontinued protocol therapy early for non-DLT reasons after cycle 2 (grade 2 LFT abnormalities and a COPD exacerbation) and were replaced. The other 3 patients completed six planned cycles of therapy without DLT, and this was declared the recommended phase 3 dose. Five patients enrolled in the expansion cohort, one of whom discontinued protocol therapy after cycle 5 due to toxicity after experiencing dose delays for cycles 2 and 5. Other grade 3 adverse events not meeting DLT criteria included LFT abnormalities outside the 9-week DLT window (<italic>n</italic> = 1), lymphopenia (<italic>n</italic> = 3), and musculoskeletal events (<italic>n</italic> = 2).

After ICI, the frequency of TNF-α + T cells declined significantly in progressors in comparison to baseline values, whereas TNF-α production remained stable in non-progressors, resulting in a loss of the differential seen at baseline (median: P 49.2% vs. NP 51.8%, <italic>p</italic> = 0.120; Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6P, Q</xref>).

              <p id="Par21">Our results demonstrate the tolerability, safety, and feasibility of adding full-dose atezolizumab to SABR in a frail, medically inoperable, early-stage NSCLC patient population. This study was not powered for robust estimates of PFS or OS, and our eligibility criteria were more liberal than most trials in this space, so a direct comparison of treatment outcomes to other trials is inappropriate. However, in our patient population with extensive comorbidities and high-risk factors, the observed median PFS of almost 26 months is encouraging in patients generally not suitable for systemic chemotherapy. Most patients expired from intercurrent illness without evidence of disease progression, limiting the utility of PFS. Thus, FFP was also analyzed post hoc to better evaluate progression. Evaluation of FFP needs to be interpreted with caution as this analysis was post-hoc and did not use a competing risks approach introducing potential biases into the KM estimates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Median FFP was not reached (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>). As there was no control group (SABR alone), we examined an atezolizumab dose–response effect as a potential indicator of activity. Half of the patients were treated at dose level 1 or 2, which is below the approved dose for advanced-stage NSCLC. More than 50% of patients at dose level 1 or 2 progressed, but no patients at full dose (dose level 3) atezolizumab progressed. Patients at dose level 3 had significantly improved FFP (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>). Another indicator of activity was a 17% rate of early radiographic response by RECIST after two cycles of atezolizumab prior to SABR. All early responses occurred at dose level 3.</p>
              <p id="Par22">ICIs have become a standard-of-care front-line treatment for metastatic and locally advanced NSCLC following randomized phase III trials demonstrating survival benefits as compared to chemotherapy alone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Data in surgically resected NSCLC from the phase III Impower010 and Checkmate 816 trials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> support the integration of ICI therapy into earlier-stage disease. The primary rationale for adding systemic therapy in early-stage, medically inoperable patients is to prevent progression and increase the cure rate. ICI is particularly appealing in this setting, given the limited systemic therapy options in these frail patients and the potential for synergy with standard-of-care SABR.</p>
              <p id="Par23">Preclinical studies demonstrate synergy between radiotherapy and ICI, and some studies find that synergy is suboptimal if ICI is initiated after the completion of radiotherapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Clinical data confirming the utility of combining radiotherapy and ICI have been equivocal, but trials in NSCLC, such as PACIFIC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, a re-analysis of KEYNOTE-001<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, and a randomized phase II trial by Formenti and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> suggest a benefit. Also, a phase II study comparing pembrolizumab alone vs. SABR + pembrolizumab in metastatic NSCLC, while not meeting its endpoint, doubled the ORR from 18% to 36% (<italic>p</italic> = 0.07)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Clinical data also corroborate that the timing of therapy may be key to efficacy. In the PACIFIC trial, patients receiving durvalumab within 14 days of radiotherapy derived greater benefits than those with a longer interval<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Another study of 758 patients found that initiation of ICI at least 30 days prior to radiation with continuation during radiation was predictive of increased survival<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Our study also suggests the efficacy of SABR and ICI, and the timing of therapy was modeled after the above data.</p>
              <p id="Par24">Our study incorporated robust translational studies in a hypothesis-generating manner to identify potential biomarkers for future clinical trials. A limitation of our correlative analyses was the small patient numbers in this phase I trial, which limits the conclusions that can be drawn. These potential biomarkers and mechanistic findings require validation in larger phase III trials that are underway. PD-L1 expression in the TME is a highly validated predictive biomarker for ICI efficacy in advanced-stage NSCLC. Likewise, the presence of dormant/dysfunctional T cells in the TME can predict ICI response in advanced stage NSCLC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. We did not observe an association between PD-L1 expression and clinical outcomes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>, Supplemental Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2A</xref>). TILs demonstrated importance in our study, but TIL functionality, rather than dysfunction, predicted improved outcomes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).</p>
              <p id="Par25">There is a lack of reliable peripheral blood biomarkers predictive of ICI response. We found differing pre-treatment levels of circulating T cell subsets and transcriptomic signatures of T cell activation between patients who progress versus those free from progression (Figs. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> and <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Using ROC analysis (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, Supplemental Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref>), we demonstrated that many of these markers are highly predictive for distinguishing progressors vs. non-progressors. Surprisingly, at baseline, circulating T cell frequencies, PD1 expression, and transcriptomic signatures of activation were higher in progressing patients. This is in contrast to the TME, where T cell frequencies and function were higher in patients free from progression and at odds with published data in advanced malignancies where high circulating T cell levels and PD1+ expression correlate with ICI response. Interestingly, while the frequency of circulating T cell subsets and PD1 expression on these were higher in progressors, the frequency of Tim3+ T cell subsets was higher in patients without progression. One possible explanation for these observations, and the differences between the TME and peripheral T cells, is that T cells in the TME are largely tumor antigen specific<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> whereas those in the periphery are largely resting and not tumor antigen-specific. Tim3 expression is thought to identify T cells that are antigen-specific in chronic viral infections and cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Thus, Tim3+ T cells in the periphery may better mirror the phenotype of T cells in the TME, but additional studies are needed to test this hypothesis.</p>
              <p id="Par26">To further explore these findings, we tested T-cell functionality after ex-vivo stimulation. After one cycle of ICI, stimulated T cell functionality increased in non-progressors and decreased in progressors compared to pre-treatment values (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). This supports the idea that the functionality capacity of T cells and the ability to be re-invigorated after ICI are important for favorable clinical outcomes in this population. Taken together, our correlative findings suggest that while T cell dysfunction and a suppressive TME are important ICI biomarkers in advanced NSCLC, in early-stage NSCLC, T cell functionality is strongly linked to treatment outcomes. The differences in our findings, as compared with prior reports, could be attributed to a lack of statistical power or a genuine difference in biology. The highly significant association between clinical outcomes and correlative parameters, despite limited patient numbers, argues for the latter. Genuine biological differences in ICI mechanisms of action are plausible due to a different immune landscape in early-stage vs. advanced NSCLC and/or in this relatively immunocompromised population. These findings are hypothesis-generating and will be tested in a larger randomized phase III trial. Additionally, many other novel biomarkers currently under study, such as a recent preclinical report of putative secreted biomarkers for combined radiotherapy + immunotherapy in NSCLC, will also need to be considered in future trials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>.</p>

S1914 randomizes patients between standard-of-care SABR and SABR with a total of 8 cycles of neoadjuvant, concurrent, and adjuvant atezolizumab. A total of 480 patients are planned to be randomized, with a primary endpoint of OS. This study will also test the correlative biomarkers reported here, and the presence of a control arm will allow the determination of whether these biomarkers are prognostic for early-stage NSCLC in general or predictive of response to atezolizumab. Two other ongoing randomized phase 3 trials are also testing the integration of ICI and SABR for medically inoperable, early-stage NSCLC, PACIFIC-4 (NCT03833154), and KEYNOTE-867 (NCT03924869).</p>

The study design and conduct complied with all relevant regulations regarding the use of human study participants and was conducted in accordance with the criteria set by the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients provided written informed consent prior to any study procedures. The trial was registered on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02599454). The first patient was enrolled on 5/3/2016, and the last patient was enrolled on 8/9/2019. Eligible patients were ≥18 years of age with histologically confirmed T1-3 NSCLC ≤ 7 cm diameter. Although patients with EGFR or ALK mutations would not be expected to respond to ICI based on data from advanced NSCLC, these patients were not excluded since there is limited tissue available for NGS testing in this population. Patients with chest wall invasion (T3) and 2 nodules within the same lobe of the lung were eligible. Patients were required to have one or more features predictive of increased recurrence risk: diameter ≥1 cm for the phase I component and ≥2 cm for the expansion cohort; SUV ≥ 6.2 on FDG PET; or moderately/poorly differentiated histology. Patients were required to be either medically inoperable as determined by multidisciplinary evaluation or to have refused surgery, had a forced expiratory volume over 1 s (FEV1) ≥ 700 cc, and a diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) ≥ 5.5 m/min/mm Hg on pulmonary function testing (PFT), and had a Zubrod performance status (PS) ≤ 2. Exclusion criteria included New York Heart Association class II or greater cardiovascular disease, severe infections within 4 weeks of enrollment, history of autoimmune disorders, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and active human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C. Prior malignancies did not disqualify as long as they were not active at the time of enrollment. Required staging workup included PFTs within 3 months of registration and computed tomography (CT) of the chest within 28 days of registration. PET/CT staging was not mandated but was encouraged.</p>

Atezolizumab was delivered intravenously (IV) in 21-day cycles. Three atezolizumab dose levels were evaluated: 3 mg/kg IV, 10 mg/kg IV, and 1200 mg IV flat dosing (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>). Patients received a planned 6 cycles of atezolizumab with SABR initiated with cycle 3, 24–48 h following the atezolizumab infusion. SABR was delivered to 50 Gy over 4–5 fractions.

Four-dimensional (4D) CT simulation was strongly encouraged but not required. For patients simulated with 4DCT, an internal target volume (ITV) was created using the 10 respiratory phases, and a 5 mm planning target volume (PTV) margin was added in all directions. For patients simulated without 4DCT, a 5 mm PTV margin was added in the axial plane, and a 1.0–1.5 cm margin craniocaudally was added depending on tumor motion as assessed by fluoroscopy. A motion management strategy (abdominal compression, respiratory gating, tumor tracking, or breath-hold) was required if respiratory motion, as assessed by fluoroscopy, exceeded 1 cm. SABR was delivered to 50 Gy over 4 fractions for peripherally located tumors (&gt;2 cm from the proximal bronchial tree and not touching mediastinal pleural) and to 50 Gy over 5 fractions for centrally located tumors.

                <title>Outcomes</title>
                <p id="Par31">The primary objective was to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of atezolizumab when delivered with SABR in early-stage, medically inoperable NSCLC. MTD was defined as the highest dose at which no more than one of six patients developed a DLT or dose Level 3 if the MTD was not reached. Secondary objectives included the safety profile of the experimental regimen using common toxicity criteria for adverse events (CTCAE) version 4 and preliminary efficacy data by objective response rate (ORR) and PFS by response evaluation in solid tumors (RECIST) version 1.1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. This patient population is at very high risk for developing additional primary aero-digestive tract malignancies due to “field cancerization” effects. In order to distinguish the development of a new primary NSCLC from local or systemic disease progression, the development of disease in the contralateral lung without evidence of ipsilateral or systemic recurrence was reviewed and characterized by a multidisciplinary tumor board. In addition to PFS, OS, and FFP were analyzed. FFP (time from enrollment to documentation of disease progression) was a post-hoc analysis undertaken because of the significant rate of death from an intercurrent illness unrelated to cancer or study treatment. Survival and progression were measured from the day of trial enrollment. ORR was assessed following cycle 2, prior to initiation of SABR, as the lung changes post-SABR make response assessment inaccurate.</p>

                <p id="Par32">Baseline tumor samples were required for study participation and were taken from tissue blocks or fresh tumor biopsies. Samples were formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE), and fresh sections of FFPE were used for immunohistochemistry (IHC) and multi-plex immune fluorescence (IF). Blood samples were collected at baseline, after every cycle, and end of treatment. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and plasma were isolated from the whole blood. PBMCs were cryopreserved for batched analysis. Stool samples were collected at baseline, end of cycle 2, and end of treatment. Determining response by RECIST criteria after radiotherapy ablation in NSCLC is difficult to interpret and is generally not performed as radiotherapy scar tissue cannot be distinguished from tumors. This makes applying RECIST criteria and determining response rates after lung SBRT problematic in this population which only has a single lesion to evaluate for a response. As an indicator of ICI efficacy, early response to ICI alone (before SBRT) is reported. Post-ablation imaging was not used to determine or confirm responses.</p>
