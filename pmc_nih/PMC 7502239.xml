                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>The US lags behind &gt;120 countries in implementing graphic warning labels (GWLs) on cigarette packs. US courts prevented implementation of FDA's 2012 rule requiring GWLs citing the need for more evidence on effectiveness. After more research, in 2020, the FDA proposed a revised rule mandating GWLs. This trial will test how the introduction of GWLs influence cognitions and behavior in US smokers.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Method</title>
                  <p>To investigate the “real-world” impact of GWLs in US smokers, we are conducting a randomized trial involving a 3-month intervention and 8-month follow-up. The study recruited California smokers between September 2016 through December 2019 and randomly assigned them into 3 groups (1) Blank Pack devoid of any cigarette branding; (2) GWL Pack featuring 1 of 3 rotating images added to blank pack; or (3) their usual Standard US Pack. Throughout the 3-month intervention, participants purchased study-packaged cigarettes and reported daily cognitions and behavior through ecological momentary assessments. We will validate self-reported tobacco use with saliva cotinine concentrations following the 3-month intervention and 8-month follow-up.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>The trial enrolled 359 participants (average age 39 years; average cigarette consumption half a pack/day). The 3 study groups were balanced on age, gender, race-ethnicity, education and income (17% low income) as well as on smoking related variables.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>This 3-month real-world randomized trial will test the effect of repackaging cigarettes from standard US packs to GWL plain packs on smokers' perceptions of the risks of smoking, their perception of the appeal of their cigarettes, and on their smoking behavior.</p>

              <p id="p0030">Cigarette brands use packaging as part of their overall marketing communication strategy [<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] to influence consumers' perception of their products including taste, quality, satisfaction, and reduced harm compared to other brands [<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>]. To disrupt this communication channel, public health agencies have adopted 2 interconnected strategies, removing tobacco industry branding and applying graphic warning labels (GWLs). Removing tobacco industry branding can reduce brand appeal and the perceptions that the cigarettes are safer than other brands [<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>]. GWLs on cigarette packs are harder to ignore than text warnings and elicit strong cognitive and emotive reactions, which have been linked to increased intentions to quit [<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p>
              <p id="p0035">Although the US was the first to introduce warning labels on cigarette packages in 1966, these did not evolve and were not effective [<xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Canada was the first nation to introduce GWL's in 2001. Over 120 other countries have upgraded to the minimum GWLs required by the 2003 World Health Organization's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) treaty [<xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Seven countries have now gone further, following Australia's 2012 introduction of standardized packaging, which removes all branding and adds large GWLs. The US Tobacco Control Act of 2009 mandated GWLs on cigarette packs [<xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], but the FDA's 2012 implementation rule was struck down by the courts on First Amendment grounds citing a lack of evidence supporting smoking behavior change [<xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The FDA's revised rule in March 2020[<xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] was immediately challenged in another lawsuit [<xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p>
              <p id="p0040">With few exceptions, most GWL studies have either involved brief exposures (many limited to virtual exposures) in laboratory settings or observational reports in countries with GWL policies [<xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Evans et al. [<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] randomized smokers to have text-only warnings or a GWL affixed to their cigarette packs (for 4 weeks - 244 completers). GWLs were more effective in encouraging smokers to consider quitting. Using a similar text vs GWL design, Brewer et al.[<xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] randomized 2149 smokers and showed that, over 4 weeks, affixing GWLs to participant packs was associated with more self-reported quit attempts than text-only warnings (40% vs 34%). Compared to the text-only warnings, GWLs were more likely to increase future intentions to quit, successful 7-day cigarette abstinence and forgoing a cigarette. GWLs increased quit attempts by increasing attention to the warning, eliciting negative emotional reactions, avoidance of the warning and thinking about the warning message [<xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p>
              <p id="p0045">Two large ecological studies reported conflicting findings on the effectiveness of GWLs in changing smoking behavior. Canada introduced GWLs in 2001; a pre-post policy period analysis found that GWLs were associated with lower smoking prevalence and increased quit attempts [<xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, analysis of Euromonitor International Surveys with data from 60 countries did not replicate this finding [<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p>
              <p id="p0050">This randomized trial seeks to advance the research on the influence of cigarette packaging on smoking cognitions and behavior. It includes a number of innovations that improve on previous studies. There is a real-world experience: for 3 months, participants purchase their US cigarettes repackaged into specially manufactured study packs. The study uses a blank pack (devoid of all advertising) as one control group for GWL packs to identify whether differences observed are from removing tobacco industry advertising or from using GWLs. We assess initial participant appeal-aversion responses to the study packaging to explore whether upfront reactivity modifies any downstream GWL effects. We use ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to obtain daily real-time measures of cognitions and behavior over the 3-month intervention. Finally, smoking behavior is validated biochemically after the intervention and after an additional 8 months.</p>

                <title>Overview and study design</title>
                <p id="p0055">This randomized trial recruited US smokers who were not ready to quit from San Diego County, California. Following a 1-month run-in period, participants were randomized into 3 groups, and, for a period of 3 months, purchased discounted cigarettes through the study website packaged as follows: Group 1-Blank Pack devoid of any cigarette branding; Group 2-GWL Pack featuring 1 of 3 rotating images; and Group 3-Standard US Pack used by smoker.</p>
                <p id="p0060">The study will test whether 3 months of cumulative exposure to GWLs influences cognitions and behavior about smoking and whether such effects are maintained through a further 8 months when participants reverted to using their standard US packs. The GWL images (standardized packs) were obtained under license from Australia and we conducted a substudy to identify the 3 most effective images. For the GWL and Blank Pack groups, we manufactured cigarette packs labelled with the participant's cigarette brand. <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>

                <p id="p0065">During the 12-month study, assessments occurred at 3 clinic visits (V1, V2, V3) and through weekly electronic surveys. Additional assessments during the 3-month intervention included frequent repeated measures of perceived sensory attributes of cigarettes and quitting cognitions collected twice daily through ecological momentary assessments (EMA). Clinic visit assessments included a detailed study questionnaire (Q1, Q2, Q3) a GWL appeal-aversion “willingness to pay” conjoint assessment, and a saliva sample to biochemically validate cigarette consumption. Clinic Visit 1 (V1) included a GWL Verbal/Nonverbal response task in which the participant's initial ‘stream of consciousness’ response to the study packs was recorded and coded. In addition, at V2 and V3, research staff recorded (audio) participant responses to a study feedback questionnaire (open-ended questions about their study experience).</p>
                <p id="p0070">During the 8-month follow-up, participants purchased their cigarettes through their regular sources and continued to receive the weekly e-mail survey. The trial was named “CASA – <bold>CA</bold>lifornia <bold>S</bold>mokers in <bold>A</bold>ustralia” to convey the “real-world” experience of purchasing and smoking cigarettes with Australian-style packaging.</p>

                <p id="p0100">We manufactured cigarette packs for the GWL and Blank Pack study groups using an olive-green pack background. The front and back of the GWL packs pictured an Australian GWL (neonatal baby, foot gangrene, or throat cancer) chosen based on our GWL pretest described below. Because the Australian packs included a quitline number for smokers to call, we replicated this on our manufactured packs, providing a study phone number. The packs featured a standard US Surgeon General warning label on the side and we designed 2 pack sizes to accommodate both regular and 100 mm cigarette sizes. Using information on brands purchased prior to randomization, the study purchased cigarette packs and repackaged cigarettes into study packs manufactured specifically for the GWL and Blank Pack study groups. The only component of the typical cigarette pack that we were unable to match was the tear-off cellophane cover. We cellophane wrapped each pack without an easy tear-off tab. (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>

                <p id="p0110">We obtained a license from the Commonwealth of Australia to use up to 8 of the GWLs that were in use in Australia in 2014. To reduce pack manufacturing costs, we pretested the Australian images with US smokers to select 3 of these GWLs to rotate on our study packs [<xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. For this pretest, we recruited a non-representative sample of 403 US-adult cigarette smokers (aged 21–50 years), via Amazon Mechanical Turk (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mturk.com" id="ir0005">www.mturk.com</ext-link>) [<xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The majority of this sample was younger than 40 years (82%), male (61%), white (77%), did not live with children &lt;5 years (83%), smoked on a daily basis (58%), had completed at least some college (85%). This sample took a brief survey that included 2 tasks related to the 8 Australian GWLs (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>

                <p id="p0115">The first component was a between-subjects design in which respondents were randomly exposed online to one of the 8 Australian images and asked to rate it on a number of constructs. One of these constructs was the Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS) which includes ratings on 6 separate questions on emotion [<xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Participants rated each of these items on a 5-point scale from 1 = very slightly to not at all, 2 = a little, 3 = moderately, 4 = quite a bit, 5 = extremely. When comparing the psychometric properties of the PANAS in the entire sample of respondents across conditions, the internal consistency was high (Cronbach's α = 0.95) and results from an exploratory factor analysis suggested that all items loaded highly on a single factor (factor loadings &gt;0.75). Accordingly, we averaged responses across items. Additional constructs were ratings on the following 4 single questions: “To what extent does the health warning in this image make you think about the health risks of smoking? How likely are smokers to experience this health consequence? To what extent does the health warning in this image make you concerned about the health risks of smoking? The image you have seen is already printed on cigarette packs in Australia; Do you think if this image was printed on US packages it would affect the amount of cigarettes you smoke?” Participants scored each question on a digital- analog scale where 1=”downplays risk” and 10=”exaggerates risk.” The second component exposed respondents to all 8 images simultaneously and they were asked to rank them based on “how effectively each image communicates the health risks of smoking” and this was published separately [<xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].

All regression models simultaneously adjusted for smoking status, age, level of education, race/ethnicity, the presence of children less than age 5 in the home and gender. The mean of each randomized group and 95% confidence intervals were calculated by using 1000 randomly drawn sets of estimates from the coefficient covariance matrix of each model and with all other variables held at their mean values.</p></caption><alt-text id="al0020">Fig. 4</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr4_lrg"/></fig></p>

                <p id="p0160"><bold>c) Pack Handling Task/GWL Verbal/Nonverbal Response.</bold> In a randomized order, study staff presented a brand matched GWL Pack, Blank Pack, and Standard US Pack to the participant and asked them to rotate the pack and “think aloud” speaking their thoughts as they processed elements of each pack design, prompting for responses if the participant was silent. The GWL packs were randomized to 1st, 3rd or 5th presentation, and the Blank Pack and Standard US Pack were randomized to the 2nd or 4th presentation. As expected, participants took longer to explore the GWL Packs (median averaged across GWLs 1.1 min) than the standard US pack (median 0.9 min) with the Blank Pack having the shortest viewing time (median 0.6 min). We used the participant's own words (recorded) to score their reaction to each of the study packs. We used 3 levels (high, medium, low) for both appeal and aversion as well as a neutral score. Additionally, to further characterize participant responses we conducted natural language processing using a semantic analysis of their transcribed speech to quantify the polarity of word choice [<xref rid="bb0215" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] and frequency of emotive words [<xref rid="bb0220" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] that each pack elicited.</p>
                <p id="p0165"><bold>d) GWL Appeal-Aversion Task.</bold> We have developed a new tool to identify the utility participants associate with pack marketing attributes using an adaptive choice-based conjoint (ACBC) task [<xref rid="bb0225" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Using a web interface, first, participants indicated which components of pack design (pack marketing, tobacco origin, and presence of Quitline number) they preferred and the price of their current pack. Then, using an adaptive fractional factorial design [<xref rid="bb0230" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], we presented a series of choice tasks, each comprising 3 alternative pack designs based on the participant's preferred pack design. This appeal-aversion task did not feature the same 3 GWLs used in the intensive intervention (<italic>Foot Gangrene, Neonatal Baby,</italic> and <italic>Throat Cancer</italic>). Based on our GWL substudy, we maintained <italic>Foot Gangrene</italic> (the image associated with the most aversion), and chose 2 other images to cover a range of emotional responses: <italic>Teeth</italic> (significantly lower negative emotion responses than <italic>Foot Gangrene)</italic>; and <italic>Blindness</italic> (significantly lower negative emotion than <italic>Teeth.</italic> Overall, there were 5 pack marketing options (current industry marketing, Blank Pack, and 3 GWL Packs), 2 tobacco origin options, and 2 Quitline number options. The 3 pack designs included in the repeated choice tasks was built on the participant's previous answers (adaptive design). The trade-offs made by participants across these repeated discrete choice tasks reveal the importance they place on cigarette pack attributes and their perceived level of utility (i.e., pay more) or disutility (i.e. pay less) associated with each level of an attribute.</p>
                <p id="p0170"><bold>e) Saliva Collection.</bold> Study staff assisted participants to rinse their mouth at the start of a clinic visit and then collected a saliva sample some 40 min later using a standard saliva collection kit that included a 2 mL cryovial and a straw for ease of getting the sample into the cryovial. Participants were instructed to fill the cryovial at least 1 mL of saliva (a minimum 75 ul is required). Saliva was stored in a -20<sup>o</sup> C freezer before being transferred to -80<sup>o</sup> C freezer for later analysis. Salivary cotinine will be biochemically analyzed in duplicate using Enzyme-Linked Immuno Sorbent Assay (ELISA) kit from Salimetrics, USA. We will use a cotinine value of 15 ng/mL as the cut-point for stated tobacco abstinence.</p>
                <p id="p0175"><bold>f) Introduction to EMA, Weekly Survey, and Cigarette Purchase.</bold> Study staff instructed participants on the daily EMA and weekly surveys and practiced these tasks with participants.

                <p id="p0310">Willingness to pay will be calculated at baseline (V1) and after the 3-month intervention (V2). A multinomial logit hierarchical Bayes analysis of the conjoint task will be used to deconstruct cigarette packaging into its various parts (i.e., attributes) and varying options across products (i.e., levels) by estimating the importance of each part (i.e., attribute importance), the preference for each level of an attribute (i.e., part-worth utility), and the corresponding price thereof (i.e., willingness to pay) [<xref rid="bb0250" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Part-worth utility estimates are relative to the set of examined levels and sum to zero with positive scores indicating greater preference. Attribute importance scores that sum to 100 are calculated by dividing the range the utility scores by the sum of the ranges and reflect the preference for that attribute in comparison to all other examined attributes. To examine the relative effect of GWLs on willingness to pay, part-worth utility estimates for the design attribute will be re-centered with the blank pack design as the referent level. Utilities will be converted to dollar values by multiplying each individual utility by the median value of the dividend between the difference in the spread of the reported pack prices (i.e., $3.00–$15.00) and the difference in the utility of the pack prices [<xref rid="bb0255" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The resulting estimations reflect the appeal-aversion valuations (i.e., willingness to pay) attributed to each pack design. Differences in willingness to pay for GWLs will be estimated using one way ANOVAs run on the posterior distributions of attribute importance, price utilities, and price utility differences for each study arm. The Benjamini– Hochberg <italic>p</italic>-value adjustment will be used to account for false discovery [<xref rid="bb0225" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].</p>

                  <p id="p0315">In order to explore effect modification of nicotine dependence and appeal-aversion response to pack designs on study outcomes (Aim 4), for all planned analyses we will include a cross product interaction term between study arm by each modifier of interest (e.g. nicotine dependence, appeal-aversion valuations and reactions). Wald's method will be used for statistical inference of the interaction on the multiplicative scale. Models with significant interactions will be stratified to facilitate the interpretation of the effects.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="p0320">In this real-world randomized trial of US smokers, we investigate how cigarette pack design influences smoking behavior and cognitions. Our trial investigates 3 cigarette pack conditions: a standard US cigarette pack and 2 study-designed packs: the first involved a blank olive-colored pack without any tobacco industry marketing (Blank Pack); the second condition was a standardized pack with rotated 3 GWL images currently sold in Australia (GWL Pack). This standardized GWL Pack involves a higher level of GWLs than those proposed by the US FDA for implementation in 2021 (GWLs cover 75% vs 50% of the pack) and the FDA will allow reduced Industry marketing to remain on the pack. We used standardized packs for 2 reasons: first, this enabled a cleaner test of the study hypotheses as the Blank Pack condition removed all tobacco marketing images and the standardized GWL Pack <italic>added</italic> GWLs to the Blank Pack condition. We did not use the FDA-proposed hybrid condition (smaller GWL + Industry marketing). To have such a condition would have meant that we needed to modify current tobacco imagery on packs, and University Counsel strongly advised us against manipulating copyrighted images. Rather, they suggested that we use a pack that was already available for retail somewhere in the world. As cigarette brand varieties are quite different in other English language countries with hybrid GWLs, it proved quite difficult to identify available hybrid pack options that would be close to the FDA's proposed GWL + Industry marketing pack design.</p>
              <p id="p0325">This trial includes several important innovations to current research on cigarette pack design that has been reported in the peer review literature. First, we assessed the appeal-aversion responses when participants had their first opportunity to handle and explore the study packs (the US smokers recruited for this trial had limited previous experience purchasing GWL packs). The negative emotional response to GWL packs is a major component in the Tobacco Industry lawsuit to prevent the implementation of the FDA rule in 2021 [<xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Not only did we undertake a detailed assessment of negative emotional response of the GWLs, but we also conducted a baseline “willingness-to-pay” assessment to see the discount that the smoker would want before they would voluntarily purchase their cigarettes in a GWL pack. There is a literature from countries that have implemented GWL packaging [<xref rid="bb0250" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="bb0255" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. that smokers become desensitized to GWLs [<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bb0245" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. By repeating the willingness-to-pay assessment at the end of the 3-month intensive intervention, we will be able to test if smokers became desensitized to the GWL associated with the highest emotional response during this period as well as whether any such desensitization extended to other GWLs that were not included in the study intervention.</p>
              <p id="p0330">Our trial is a real-world study in which we provide incentives to smokers to purchase their cigarettes from the study. Of course, at any time, the participant can revert to purchasing their cigarettes from local community sources. One might expect that those smokers who had a major aversive reaction to the study GWL packs at the start of the study would be less than adherent to purchasing their cigarettes from the study if they were randomized to the GWL group. To properly test the effect of GWLs on smoking cognitions and behavior, it is very important that all participants obtain an extensive exposure to their study pack. Our measures of exposure include data on the number of cigarettes purchased from the study for all 3 pack groups and the twice daily EMA responses during the 3-month intervention; these data included a question asking the smoker twice daily whether their last cigarette was from a study pack. The EMA data also allows us to identify the timing of study effects on participant cognitions and behavior.</p>
              <p id="p0335">However, the twice daily EMA data and the weekly surveys add up to a significant participant burden in this study. While study incentives can be sufficient to ensure that participants complete study assessments, participants may be inclined to change their smoking behavior and cognitions in response the frequent measurements [<xref rid="bb0260" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="bb0265" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. As this was a randomized trial, the Standard Pack group controls for this measurement effect. We tried to minimize this effect by only enrolling smokers who had no immediate intention to quit smoking. Nevertheless, the price of getting daily data on cognitions and smoking behavior may well be that the study encouraged quitting in all study groups. The other effect of the considerable participant burden was the difficulty in recruiting otherwise eligible smokers once they understood fully what would be required of them throughout the study. Only 14% of eligible participants who contacted the study attended the initial Clinic Visit where they were first exposed to the study packs. This level of recruitment limits the generalizability of study results.</p>
              <p id="p0340">The challenges of conducting a real-world experiment were evident in this study. In response to tobacco control concerns about young people purchasing cigarettes over the internet, the US postal service changed its policies and would no longer deliver cigarettes through the mail. This occurred between the time of our grant proposal and study initiation and forced us to seek a funding supplement to deliver cigarettes through an expensive courier service. Further, in 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic led to significant restrictions on clinic visits, which resulted in higher than expected rates of missing data toward the end of the study period. Nevertheless, the 3-month real-world exposure to the different cigarette pack designs is a significant strength of the study, especially because of the many repeated measures used. These data will allow us to analyze important daily reactions to the packs over 3 months (perceived quality of their cigarettes, willingness to display their study packs in social settings, and smoking behavior including avoidance of cigarettes from study packs).</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p id="p0345">This randomized trial of the effect of implementing GWLs on US cigarette packs is timely given that the Tobacco Industry has filed a recent lawsuit to prevent the implementation of the FDA proposed rule on GWLs on the grounds that they are associated with unacceptable negative emotions and violate the first amendment. In addition to having detailed measures of appeal-aversion of different cigarette packaging before the start of the trial, US smokers have an in-depth 3-month real-world experience of smoking cigarettes from the different study packs, during which they respond to daily EMA measures of their cognitions and behavior. The results of this trial will significantly add to the literature on the role of GWLs as an influence on a) increasing smokers' perception of risks, b) decreasing perceptions of appeal of tobacco industry marketing on US packs and their subjective reinforcing effects on smoking. It will also provide validated evidence of GWL packs on both short- and long-term effects on smoking behavior.</p>
