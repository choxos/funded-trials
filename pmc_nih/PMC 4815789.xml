                  <title>Background:</title>
                  <p>The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of bevacizumab alone and in combination with cytotoxic therapy on tumour vasculature in osteosarcoma (OS) using DCE-MRI.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods:</title>
                  <p>Six DCE-MRI and three <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET examinations were scheduled in 42 subjects with newly diagnosed OS to monitor the response to antiangiogenic therapy alone and in combination with cytotoxic therapy before definitive surgery (week 10). Serial DCE-MRI parameters (<italic>K</italic><sup>trans</sup>, <italic>v</italic><sub>p</sub>, and <italic>v</italic><sub>e</sub>) were examined for correlation with FDG-PET (SUV<sub>max</sub>) and association with drug exposure, and evaluated with clinical outcome.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Results:</title>
                  <p><italic>K</italic><sup>trans</sup> (<italic>P</italic>=0.041) and <italic>v</italic><sub>p</sub> (<italic>P</italic>=0.001) significantly dropped from baseline at 24â h after the first dose of bevacizumab alone, but returned to baseline by 72âh. Greater exposure to bevacizumab was correlated with larger decreases in <italic>v</italic><sub>p</sub> at day 5 (<italic>P</italic>=0.04) and week 10 (<italic>P</italic>=0.02). A lower <italic>K</italic><sup>trans</sup> at week 10 was associated with greater percent necrosis (<italic>P</italic>=0.024) and longer event-free survival (<italic>P</italic>=0.034).</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions:</title>
                  <p>This is the first study to demonstrate significant changes of the plasma volume fraction and vascular leakage in OS with bevacizumab alone. The combination of demonstrated associations between drug exposure and imaging metrics, and imaging metrics and patient survival during neoadjuvant therapy, provides a compelling rationale for larger studies using DCE-MRI to assess vascular effects of therapy in OS.</p>

          <body>
            <p>Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common malignant bone tumour in children. The current treatment strategy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgical resection of the primary tumour and postoperative chemotherapy yields a long-term survival rate of â¼60% to 70% in patients with localised disease and &lt;30% in those with metastatic disease at diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rosen <italic>et al</italic>, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bacci <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Longhi <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). Unfortunately, with no new cytotoxic agents available, survival rates have remained unchanged over the past two decades.</p>
            <p>Antiangiogenic agents have shown promise in treating solid cancers and are known to be more effective when combined with cytotoxic therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jain, 2005a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dickson <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). Tumour vasculature can be tortuous, causing irregular blood flow and high interstitial fluid pressures that may impair the delivery of oxygen and cytotoxic agents to the tumour. Bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), is thought to prune tumour blood vessels, thus normalising structure and improving oxygenation and drug delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Shih and Lindley, 2006</xref>). However, bevacizumab can cause additional loss of blood vessels that would hinder the delivery of therapy. Understanding the time course of these changes in OS would aid in determining the optimum time to deliver the cytotoxic agents. Therefore, noninvasive methods that can monitor tumour vascular changes could be critical for the management of patients during neoadjuvant therapy with bevacizumab.</p>
            <p>Imaging modalities commonly used to assess OS during neoadjuvant therapy include MRI and positron emission tomography (PET). Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) is used to measure properties of tissue microvasculature, such as tissue perfusion, capillary permeability, and interstitial volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tofts <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Verstraete and Lang, 2000</xref>). Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI monitors signal changes during and after the intravenous injection of a gadolinium contrast agent. Regions of necrosis, muscle, vessel, and viable tumour display distinct signal enhancement in dynamic images. Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI is widely used in clinical studies for the assessment of treatment response and as a potential prognostic biomarker for histologic response and survival in children with OS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Reddick <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dyke <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hoang <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bajpai <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guo <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amit <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>). Positron emission tomography with <sup>18</sup>F-FDG, an analogue of glucose, also generates measures that can be used for staging, and monitoring of response in OS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ye <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cheon <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hawkins <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>).</p>
            <p>The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of bevacizumab alone and in combination with cytotoxic therapy on tumour vasculature in pediatric OS patients treated on a multi-institutional trial. Serial DCE-MRI kinetic parameters were compared with FDG-PET, explored for associations with bevacizumab and methotrexate (MTX) exposure, and evaluated with clinical end points of histologic response and survival.</p>

                <p>A total of 42 subjects (23 male and 19 female), younger than 30 years of age, with newly diagnosed, high-grade OS were enrolled on a phase II therapeutic trial at four medical centres in the United States between May 2008 and April 2012 (NCT00667342). The median age was 12.5 years at diagnosis. Thirty-one patients had localised, resectable disease and 11 patients had metastatic disease at diagnosis.</p>
                <p>Neoadjuvant therapy consisted of two cycles of cisplatin, doxorubicin, and methotrexate administered over 10 weeks followed by gross total resection. Bevacizumab was administered 3 days before the first dose of chemotherapy at week 0 with subsequent doses given on day 1 of week 3 and week 5. Imaging modalities used to monitor response to treatment included DCE-MRI (all 42 subjects) and <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET (34 subjects). The treatment and imaging schedules are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. This study was approved by the institutional review board of the participating institutions, and written informed consent was obtained from the patient, parent or guardian, as appropriate.</p>

                <p>The bevacizumab sampling strategy, sample analysis, and development of the population pharmacokinetic model have been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Turner <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>). Bevacizumab concentrationâtime data were fit to a two-compartment model with first-order elimination from the central compartment. Bevacizumab exposure (area under curve (AUC)) from the first dose to time of imaging was calculated for each patient in NONMEM (version 7.3; ICON Solutions, Hanover, MD, USA).</p>
                <p>Methotrexate pharmacokinetic studies were performed in 33 patients for clinical monitoring purposes with samples routinely collected at 4, 24, 48, and 72âh post infusion.

The MTX AUC was determined by taking each patient's MTX dosage divided by the <italic>post hoc</italic> BSA normalised clearance and used to calculate the MTX average AUC (AUC<sub>avg</sub>) of week 3 and week 4 doses.</p>

To evaluate the effect of bevacizumab alone, the first bevacizumab administration was administered 3 days before the first chemotherapy administration, and chemotherapy was not administered until after the DCE-MRI examination on day 1. For subjects enrolled at the primary institution (<italic>n</italic>=27), three serial <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT examinations were acquired at baseline before any treatment and week 5 and week 10.</p>

                <p>The DCE-MRI data were acquired on 1.5âT MRI scanners (Avanto; Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany; Signa HDxt; GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI, USA) using torso and spine coil arrays. The baseline spin lattice relaxation time T<sub>10</sub> was measured before each DCE-MRI scan using the inversion recovery method (inversion times=100, 300, 900, 1500, 2200, and 3300âms; 16 slices with 5âmm thickness; FOV and position matched to DCE-MRI acquisition; TR/TE=4000/78âms). Subjects were given intravenous injections of 0.1âmmolâkg<sup>â1</sup> of a gadolinium contrast (Magnevist Bayer Schering Pharma AG, Berlin-Wedding, Germany) at a constant rate of 1âmlâs<sup>â1</sup>, followed by a saline flush using a power injector synchronised with the MRI scanner. The DCE-MRI data were acquired using a fast 3D Cartesian gradient-echo pulse sequence with radiofrequency spoiling (16 slices with 5âmm thickness; 75% partial Fourier slice encoding; FOV kept same for each subject; TE/TR=1.24/3.5âms). Total acquisition time was 350âs for 50 measurements for a temporal resolution of 7âs for each measurement.</p>
                <p>The DCE-MRI images were transferred to an offline workstation where a pediatric radiologist (MBM) used an interactive display to select the region of interest (ROI) on each slice and ensured tumour boundary selection was consistent across all time points. Data were then analysed using a two-compartment pharmacokinetic model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tofts <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>) that required an arterial input function (AIF) and the baseline spin-lattice relaxation time (T<sub>10</sub>). A modified experimentally derived AIF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Parker <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>) was used because a measured AIF was not evaluable for all subjects. The fitting of the pharmacokinetic model for each pixel produces three quantitative measures (<italic>K</italic><sup>trans</sup>, <italic>v</italic><sub>e</sub>, and <italic>v</italic><sub>p</sub>). Pearson's <italic>Ï</italic><sup>2</sup> test was used to evaluate the goodness of the fit and to exclude pixels with poor fitting in non-enhancing tissues. In this study, <italic>K</italic><sup>trans</sup>, the volume transfer constant, <italic>v</italic><sub>e</sub>, the fractional volume of extravascular extracellular space, and <italic>v</italic><sub>p</sub>, the fractional blood plasma volume, were used to evaluate clinical outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tofts and Kermode, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tofts <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>). The average for the distribution of each quantitative measure across the whole ROI was calculated as a summary measure for each data set. In addition, the skewness, kurtosis, and P95 of each kinetic parameter in each tumour were computed to explore possible non-normality of the histograms and their relationship to response and survival. P95 denotes the level of each kinetic parameter exceeding 95% of its values in each tumour.</p>

                <p>Following an overnight fast, or minimum 4âh of fast for afternoon studies, patients were injected with 0.15âmCiâkg<sup>â1 18</sup>F-FDG (maximum 12âmCi) intravenously. Patients were kept in a quiet dark room after injection and encouraged to remain recumbent and relaxed. Transmission CT images for attenuation correction and lesion localisation, and PET emission images were acquired â¼1âh later using a GE Discovery LS PET/CT system (GE Medical Systems, Waukesha, WI, USA). Following CT scanning for attenuation correction, PET images were obtained from the top of the skull through the feet for 5âmin per bed position in 2D mode. After August 2011, images were acquired on a GE Discovery 690 PET CT device in 3D mode. Images were reconstructed using standard vendor-supplied software. In heterogeneous tumours such as OS, the highest single standardised uptake value (SUV<sub>max</sub>) within the tumour is the most commonly used measure for describing the metabolism of the overall tumour. For each data set, SUV<sub>max</sub> in the tumour was determined.</p>

Because the presence of metastatic diseases is an overwhelming factor in determining survival, only patients with localised disease were included in the analyses of event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival. Event-free survival was defined as the time interval from the date of study enrollment to the date of the first event (disease progression, relapse, secondary malignancy, or death) or to the date of last follow-up for patients without events. Overall survival was defined as the time from the date of study enrollment to the date of death from any cause or to the last follow-up date.</p>

                <p>Nonparametric Wilcoxon signed-rank tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wilcoxon, 1945</xref>) were used to examine the difference of DCE-MRI parameters between any two time points. Nonparametric exact Wilcoxon rank-sum tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wilcoxon, 1945</xref>) were used to examine the difference of each parameter between responders and nonresponders. In all, 40 subjects for DCE-MRI and 32 subjects for PET were included in response analysis, and 2 subjects were excluded because one had a delayed surgery with additional chemotherapy and the other had an early surgery because of the progressive disease. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to compare <italic>K</italic><sup>trans</sup> and SUV<sub>max</sub> at week 10 for differentiating responders and nonresponders. Area under the curve, standard error (s.e.), 95% confidence interval (95% CI), and optimal cutoff were estimated in the ROC analyses. In addition, pairwise comparisons among three ROC curves were tested using the method of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Delong <italic>et al</italic> (1988</xref>). Thirty-one patients with localised, non-metastatic disease at diagnosis were included in survival analyses. Cox proportional hazards models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cox, 1972</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">1975</xref>) were used to explore associations between outcome (EFS and overall survival) with each DCE-MRI parameter. Patients were categorised into two groups using the median <italic>K</italic><sup>trans</sup> parameter value at week 10 as a cut-point and EFS curves were estimated using the method of Kaplan and Meier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kaplan and Meier, 1958</xref>) and differences in EFS curves were examined using the log-rank test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bland and Altman, 2004</xref>). The DCE-MRI parameters were analysed against pharmacokinetic parameters using pair-wise Pearson's correlation tests.

The association between EFS as a continuous measure and each DCE-MRI parameter was examined. Lower week 10 measures of average <italic>K</italic><sup>trans</sup> was significantly associated with longer EFS (<italic>P</italic>= 0.034). An additional categorical analysis of the average <italic>K</italic><sup>trans</sup> at week 10 was performed using KaplanâMeier curves stratified according to the median value for the cohort (0.054âmin<sup>â1</sup>).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>This study was the first to assess the impact of bevacizumab alone on tumour vasculature in pediatric OS. Average <italic>K</italic><sup>trans</sup> and <italic>v</italic><sub>p</sub> were both significantly lower than baseline values at 24âh (day â2) after the first administration of bevacizumab alone, demonstrating a sensitivity of OS vasculature to VEGF inhibition. These drops of <italic>K</italic><sup>trans</sup> and <italic>v</italic><sub>p</sub> may indicate a decrease in tumour permeability and tumour vessel density, and could be a sign of a transient ânormalisation'. This transient ânormalisation' decreases the tumour interstitial fluid pressure and improves tumour perfusion that consequently improves the drug delivery to tumour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dickson <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). However, <italic>K</italic><sup>trans</sup> and <italic>v</italic><sub>p</sub> rapidly increased back to baseline levels at 72âh (day 1), demonstrating a relatively short optimal window for the addition of cytotoxic therapy. Measures of bevacizumab exposure were not significantly associated with changes in DCE-MRI parameters during this upfront window, but this analysis may have been limited by the small sample size of patients with pharmacokinetic data.</p>
              <p>The serial DCE-MRI kinetic parameters during neoadjuvant therapy were compared with FDG-PET, explored for correlations with bevacizumab and MTX exposure, and evaluated for associations with clinical end points of histologic response and survival. The DCE-MRI parameters of <italic>K</italic><sup>trans</sup> and <italic>v</italic><sub>p</sub> were significantly lower than baseline at both the mid-point and end of neoadjuvant therapy. In addition, SUV<sub>max</sub> was moderately correlated with <italic>v</italic><sub>p</sub> at week 5 and <italic>K</italic><sup>trans</sup> at week 5 and week 10 that may indicate that the impact of therapy on the integrity of the vasculature resulted in a corresponding decrease in tumour viability indicated by the decreased metabolism. The DCE-MRI and <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET imaging provide complementary and consistent information for the evaluation of OS response. Although the cumulative radiation exposure from the three FDG PET CT scans was higher than allowable for radiation workers in a single year (30 <italic>vs</italic> 20âmSV), in the context of an often fatal disease treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy, we believe this is unlikely to have any clinical significance.</p>
              <p>A decrease in <italic>v</italic><sub>p</sub> at the end of neoadjuvant therapy was correlated with increased exposure to both bevacizumab and MTX but was not associated with increased necrosis, longer EFS, or overall survival. This may indicate that although the addition of bevacizumab had an acute impact on <italic>v</italic><sub>p</sub>, it did not have an appreciable impact on clinical outcome. In contrast, a decrease in <italic>K</italic><sup>trans</sup> at week 5 was associated with increased MTX exposure and a smaller <italic>K</italic><sup>trans</sup> at week 10 was significantly associated with clinical outcomes of greater percent necrosis, longer EFS, and overall survival. Only pharmacokinetic measures of MTX exposure were estimated in this study, and this is the central component of the neoadjuvant therapy with four high-dose courses administered at weeks 3, 4, 8, and 9. The other two components of therapy were cisplatin and doxorubicin that were administered in two cycles at week 0 and week 5 and may play a less significant role. The associations between imaging metrics and drug exposure are consistent with the pharmacological activity of bevacizumab binding VEGF-A to reduce and prevent angiogenesis, whereas cytotoxicity of chemotherapy drugs (MTX and so on) can cause vasculature cell death, resulting in necrosis.</p>
              <p>The early effects of bevacizumab alone in clinical human trials have been rarely reported as it is usually administered concurrently with cytotoxic therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hurwitz <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). In one human study, <italic>K</italic><sup>trans</sup> and <italic>v</italic><sub>p</sub> were reported to be significantly decreased in glioblastoma patients 24âh after the administration of bevacizumab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Port <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>), consistent with our results in OS. In preclinical animal studies, permeability in DCE-MRI was reported to significantly decline 24âh after a single dose of bevacizumab in a human melanoma model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cyran <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>), but results in other studies 3 days after bevacizumab treatment in a breast xenograft model were inconsistent with increased <italic>v</italic><sub>p</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Moestue <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>) but decreased <italic>K</italic><sup>trans</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kim <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>).</p>
              <p>The DCE-MRI parameters have been associated with clinical outcome measures of histologic response and survival in other OS trials not incorporating antiangiogenic agents. One such trial found that lower k<sub>ep</sub> at the completion of neoadjuvant therapy was significantly predictive of EFS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Reddick <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>). This is very similar to the results in the current study in which a lower <italic>K</italic><sup>trans</sup> at week 10 was significantly associated with better EFS. In another study, the difference of <italic>v</italic><sub>e</sub> (extravascular, extracellular space) between the outer and inner halves of tumour at baseline was significantly associated with the EFS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guo <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>). In the current study, we found that none of the differences in DCE-MRI kinetic parameters between the outer and inner halves of tumour were significantly associated with EFS at any time point. This contradiction could be because of differences between the 2D single slice acquisition in the older study and the 3D acquisition (i.e., covering the entire tumour volume) used in this study. This contradiction could also be partially because of the different treatments that could lead to a different association between the imaging measures and EFS. Another consideration could be that the normalisation of the tumour vasculature by antiangiogenic therapy makes the tumour appear more homogeneous with reduced differences between the outer and inner halves of tumour at the later time points. It has been recognised, as shown in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buckley (2002</xref>), that the extended Tofts model with the vascular term can underestimate the true plasma volume. However, although acknowledging the limitations of the model used to analyse the data, the potential underestimations should be similar across the imaging data analysed and should not significantly impact the results of the associations demonstrated in this study.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, this is the first study to demonstrate significant changes of the plasma volume fraction and vascular leakage in OS with bevacizumab alone. Although bevacizumab had an acute impact on <italic>v</italic><sub>p</sub> and increased exposure to both bevacizumab and MTX corresponded to decreased <italic>v</italic><sub>p</sub> at end of neoadjuvant therapy, these changes did not have an appreciable impact on the clinical outcome. However, increased MTX exposure was associated with decreased <italic>K</italic><sup>trans</sup> during neoadjuvant therapy and smaller <italic>K</italic><sup>trans</sup> before surgery was significantly associated with clinical outcomes of greater percent necrosis, longer EFS, and overall survival. These same DCE-MRI parameters were correlated with <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET measures of tumour metabolism during neoadjuvant therapy, and this could provide complimentary information for understanding the underlying changes in tumour physiology and response to therapy. The associations between imaging metrics and drug exposure are consistent with bevacizumab binding VEGF-A to reduce and prevent angiogenesis, whereas MTX cytotoxicity could cause vasculature cell death, resulting in increased necrosis. Although not directly seen in this limited sample size, it is believed that the combination of demonstrated associations between drug exposure and imaging metrics, and imaging metrics and patient survival, provide a compelling rationale for larger studies using DCE-MRI to assess vascular effects of neoadjuvant therapy in OS.</p>
