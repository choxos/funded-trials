                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>We hypothesized that propofol, a unique general anesthetic that engages N-methyl-D-aspartate and gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors, has antidepressant properties. This open-label trial was designed to collect preliminary data regarding the feasibility, tolerability, and efficacy of deep propofol anesthesia for treatment-resistant depression.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Ten participants with moderate-to-severe medication-resistant depression (age 18–45 years and otherwise healthy) each received a series of 10 propofol infusions. Propofol was dosed to strongly suppress electroencephalographic activity for 15 minutes. The primary depression outcome was the 24-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. Self-rated depression scores were compared with a group of 20 patients who received electroconvulsive therapy.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="s3">
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Propofol treatments were well tolerated by all subjects. No serious adverse events occurred. Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores remained stable. Hamilton scores decreased by a mean of 20 points (range 0–45 points), corresponding to a mean 58% improvement from baseline (range 0–100%). Six of the 10 subjects met the criteria for response (&gt;50% improvement). Self-rated depression improved similarly in the propofol group and electroconvulsive therapy group. Five of the 6 propofol responders remained well for at least 3 months. In posthoc analyses, electroencephalographic measures predicted clinical response to propofol.</p>

                <p>Treatment-resistant depression afflicts tens of millions of individuals worldwide, causing enormous suffering, economic costs, and mortality. Novel interventions are needed. This study provides the first evidence suggesting that propofol, a widely available anesthetic agent, has rapid and long-lasting antidepressant effects. Future studies are warranted to further evaluate propofol’s antidepressant efficacy and mechanisms of action.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Depression is among the most common and debilitating of mental disorders. Although many patients respond to currently available treatments, about one-third have a form of the illness that is not responsive to optimized treatment with antidepressant medications (<xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">Rush et al., 2006</xref>). Many individuals with severe, treatment-resistant depression pursue electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)—still considered the most effective treatment for depression—but the cognitive side effects of ECT cause many patients to avoid this treatment (<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">Lisanby, 2007</xref>). Consequently, each year millions of individuals in the United States alone are debilitated by treatment-resistant depression and left with limited treatment options, at enormous societal costs (<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">Mrazek et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
              <p>The urgency of this problem has encouraged investigations of novel antidepressant interventions. Agents that target N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptors and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors have appeared particularly promising. Substantial clinical evidence now supports the efficacy of ketamine for treatment-resistant depression (<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Berman et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">Zarate et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">McGirr et al., 2015</xref>), and a recent randomized controlled trial demonstrated antidepressant effects of nitrous oxide (<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">Nagele et al., 2015</xref>). Several studies have suggested efficacy of another inhaled anesthetic, isoflurane, at high doses in humans (<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Langer et al., 1985</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">Weeks et al., 2013</xref>) and rodent models (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Antila et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Brown et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, positive GABA-A receptor modulators have shown promising antidepressant effects (<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Kanes et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">McMurray et al., 2018</xref>). These agents may share pharmacodynamic mechanisms, including inhibition of NMDA receptors and activation of GABAergic neurotransmission, as reviewed recently (<xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">Zanos et al., 2018</xref>). Indeed, ECT has been reported to reduce NMDA receptor expression and function (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Fumagalli et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">Park et al., 2014</xref>), alter glutamatergic synaptic function (<xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">Stewart and Reid, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2012</xref>), and increase cortical GABA levels in humans (<xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">Sanacora et al., 2003</xref>). The convergent observations among these diverse interventions suggest a new class of antidepressant agents that rapidly trigger plasticity within glutamate and GABAergic circuitry to induce antidepressant effects (<xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">Tadler and Mickey, 2018</xref>).</p>
              <p>Propofol is a unique, intravenous, general anesthetic that potentiates the function of GABA-A and glycine receptors (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Hales and Lambert, 1991</xref>) and inhibits the function of NMDA receptors (<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">Orser et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">Yamakura et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Kingston et al., 2006</xref>). It has been widely used for over 25 years for procedural sedation and general anesthesia. Propofol is known for its rapid onset and offset of action, tolerability, and safety (<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Lamperti, 2015</xref>). Similar to isoflurane, at high doses propofol induces burst-suppression, a state of intrinsic cortical hyperexcitability that is quantifiable using electroencephalography (EEG) and that is disrupted by blockade of GABA, NMDA, or α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (<xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">Steriade et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">Lukatch et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Kroeger and Amzica, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Ferron et al., 2009</xref>). Taken together, these properties of propofol led us to hypothesize that high-dose propofol would have antidepressant effects and a favorable side-effect profile. To collect preliminary evidence of feasibility, tolerability, and efficacy among individuals with treatment-resistant depression, we performed an open-label trial of deep propofol anesthesia.</p>

                <title>Design and Participants</title>
                <p>This open-label study was approved by the University of Utah Institutional Review Board and preregistered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02935647). All participants provided written informed consent. We recruited outpatients who were seen for consultation in a referral clinic for treatment-resistant mood disorders. Assessment included a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation, full medical history, physical examination, screening blood tests (complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, thyroid-stimulating hormone), 12-lead electrocardiogram, and urine pregnancy test as indicated. Inclusion and exclusion criteria (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) were confirmed by a psychiatrist and an anesthesiologist. Importantly, we excluded many individuals with medications or conditions that increased risk of experiencing adverse effects during propofol treatments (e.g., advanced age, severe obesity, hypertension, heart disease). Bipolar depression was not excluded because previous studies of ECT and ketamine have shown similar response rates for bipolar and unipolar depression (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Dierckx et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Coyle and Laws, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">Haq et al., 2015</xref>). Of 249 patients screened, 36 met criteria for the study, 11 consented to participate in the study, and 10 received at least 1 treatment. Baseline assessments incorporated the Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) with Atypical Depression Supplement (<xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">Williams et al., 1988</xref>) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) (<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">Nasreddine et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">Srisurapanont et al., 2017</xref>).

                <title>Treatments</title>
                <p>Anesthesiologists administered a series of 10 propofol infusions at a frequency of 3 times per week (1 subject received only 9 treatments due to a holiday schedule conflict). The decision to deliver a series of treatments rather than a single treatment was based on prior experience with ECT, ketamine, and isoflurane, all of which appear to produce higher response rates with 6 to 12 administrations (<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">Langer et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">Lisanby, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">Weeks et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Coyle and Laws, 2015</xref>). Monitoring included continuous EKG, pulse oximetry, blood pressure by noninvasive cuff, respiratory rate, and end-tidal carbon dioxide. A BIS Monitor (BIS VISTA Monitoring System, Aspect Medical Systems) was applied with a 4-electrode sensor (BIS Quatro, Covidien) to measure the left frontal EEG throughout the procedure. After preoxygenation, the anesthesiologist administered an induction dose of propofol (2,6-diisopropylphenol; Diprivan injectable emulsion; Fresenius Kabi) i.v., started a continuous infusion, and gave additional small boluses as needed. (Propofol dosing is described below.) A laryngeal mask airway and mechanical ventilation were employed. Trendelenburg positioning, IV fluids, and small boluses of pressors were used as needed for hypotension. During the recovery phase, a nurse monitored the participant in a postanesthesia care unit until discharge criteria were met.

                <title>Propofol Dosing</title>
                <p>Because brain concentrations and pharmacodynamic effects of a given dose of propofol vary substantially between individuals (<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Ludbrook et al., 2002</xref>), propofol dosing was guided by real-time EEG feedback via the BIS Monitor. This approach enabled us to produce relatively consistent pharmacodynamic effects across participants and across treatment sessions. Propofol induction (200–600 mg) was followed by a continuous infusion (300–650 µg/kg/min) and augmented with repeated small boluses (50–100 mg) as needed. Lower induction doses of 200 to 400 mg were used during each subject’s initial treatment to assure hemodynamic stability, and higher induction doses were introduced during later treatments as tolerated. After induction, the infusion rate was adjusted, and additional boluses were given with the goal of maintaining a burst-suppression state with a suppression ratio (SR) of 80% to 100% for 15 minutes. The SR is a metric calculated by the BIS Monitor that indicates the fraction of time the EEG is completely suppressed (isoelectric) during each 1-minute epoch. The rationale for suppressing EEG activity for 15 minutes was that previous studies of burst suppression using isoflurane anesthesia reported antidepressant effects using a similar protocol (<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">Langer et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">Weeks et al., 2013</xref>).</p>

                <p>After the procedure, EEG parameters calculated by the BIS Monitor were exported for off-line analysis. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, we defined the burst-suppression period of each treatment session as the interval during which SR was &gt;50%. The duration at SR target was defined as the time during which SR was ≥80%. SR intensity was defined as the median SR value during the burst-suppression period. The integral of the SR curve (sum of SR values across all 1-minute epochs during the session) represented the cumulative time spent in the isoelectric state. The average signal quality index calculated by the BIS Monitor exceeded 95% throughout the burst-suppression period of all recording sessions.</p>

For each treatment session, 3 summary measures were calculated from the SR curve, as shown in histograms to the right. (C) The duration of the burst-suppression state (number of 1-minute epochs during which SR &gt;50%) characterized the “width” of the SR curve. (D) The “height” of the curve was quantified by the SR intensity (median SR value during the burst-suppression period). (E) The integral of the SR curve (sum of SR values across all 1-minute epochs during the treatment session) summarized EEG suppression with a single number that represented total time in the isoelectric state. Histograms show the distributions of these summary measures across all participants and treatments.</p>

                <p>The 24-item HDRS (HDRS-24) (<xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">Williams et al., 1988</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">Williams 2001</xref>) was administered via a structured interview at baseline, mid-series (48–72 hours after the 5th treatment), and post series (48–72 hours after the final treatment) using a time frame of the most recent 7 days. The MoCA was administered at the same 3 time points (versions 7.1, 7.2, and 7.3, respectively). Self-rated symptoms were collected using the 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS-SR) immediately preceding each treatment and monthly for up to 6 months during the follow-up phase. Duration of unconsciousness was defined as the time from discontinuation of propofol to eyes open. To monitor the acute subjective effects of propofol, the 5-item Drug Effects Questionnaire (<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">Morean et al., 2013</xref>) was completed following each treatment session. See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">supplementary Information</xref> for details about clinical outcome measures.</p>

                <title>Statistical Analysis</title>
                <p>The intended sample size of 10 patients (100 treatments) was chosen to allow us to characterize the feasibility and tolerability of the procedure as well as variation between individuals while adhering to budgetary constraints. Study data were collected and managed using Research Electronic Data Capture hosted at the University of Utah (<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Harris et al., 2009</xref>). All hand-entered data were double checked. Analyses were performed with R statistical software (version 3.2.4) (<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">R Development Core Team, 2008</xref>).</p>
                <p>The primary, preregistered, depression outcome was HDRS-24 total score, assessed 48 to 72 hours after the final treatment session (3–4 weeks after the first treatment). A positive response was defined a priori as a &gt;50% reduction in the HDRS-24 total score relative to baseline, and remission as a HDRS-24 total score &lt;10. This pilot study was not designed to test the hypothesis that propofol has antidepressant effects, so we report descriptive statistics only, as recommended (<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">Leon et al., 2011</xref>). Effect sizes were calculated using the effsize package (version 0.6.2). Posthoc exploratory analyses employed Pearson correlation and linear mixed models, as described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">supplementary Information</xref>.</p>

                <title>Comparison Group</title>
                <p>Because the nonspecific effects of the propofol intervention are expected to be very similar to the nonspecific effects of a series of ECT treatments, we gathered outcome data from an ECT cohort as an active comparator arm. A chart review was performed under an institutional review board-granted exemption to collect clinical data from a comparison group of 20 patients who were treated with ECT 3 times per week in the same clinic during the same period as the propofol study. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were similar but not identical to those used for the propofol group (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Treatments employed standard anesthesia monitoring, methohexital, succinylcholine, and glycopyrrolate. Bifrontal brief-pulse stimulation was used to elicit motor seizures of at least 30 seconds. As with propofol treatments, self-rated symptoms were collected using the QIDS-SR as part of routine clinical care immediately prior to each treatment. Further details about the comparison group are provided in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">supplementary Information</xref>.</p>

All had moderate-to-severe depression despite 2 or more medication trials of adequate dose and duration within the past 2 years, and all were considered good candidates for ECT.

Eight subjects had other medical conditions, all of which were adequately treated.</p>

Approximately 5 minutes after induction, the targeted state of deep anesthesia (SR 80%–100%) was reached, and this state was maintained for 10 to 17.5 minutes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">supplementary Table 1</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> shows a representative example of the EEG effects of this procedure. After propofol was discontinued, participants remained unconscious with eyes closed for 20 to 47 minutes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">supplementary Table 2</xref>). Once eyes opened, recovery was typically rapid: on average, subjects became fully oriented to time and place 6 minutes after opening their eyes, and they met discharge criteria 10 minutes after eyes open (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">supplementary Table 2</xref>).</p>

                <p>Deep propofol anesthesia was well tolerated. Some hypotension was expected given the doses administered, but blood pressure was usually well managed with IV fluids and Trendelenburg positioning. Pressors were typically not needed, but small doses were given occasionally, as used routinely during general anesthesia (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">supplementary Table 1</xref>). During the recovery phase, participants reported neutral or mildly pleasant drug effects on the 5-item Drug Effects Questionnaire (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">supplementary Table 2</xref>). No pressors or other medications were needed during recovery. The most commonly reported side effects were sore throat and discomfort at the IV site; nausea was uncommon (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">supplementary Table 2</xref>). One subject reported double vision, which resolved during recovery after each treatment. No pain was reported. All side effects were described as mild and temporary. No treatment was interrupted due to adverse effects, no participant left the trial early, and no serious adverse events occurred.</p>
                <p>Cognitive function did not change substantially during the trial. MoCA total scores improved slightly from 27.7±1.9 (mean±SD) at baseline to 28.9±1.0 at the mid-series time point and 29.1±0.9 at the post-series time point. No participant experienced postprocedure delirium or reported subjective memory problems due to the treatments.</p>

                <p>We performed posthoc analyses to test the hypothesis that more intense treatment with propofol would be associated with 3 key outcomes, specifically worse intraoperative hypotension, longer postinfusion recovery, and greater improvement in depression. These exploratory analyses used 2 different measures of treatment intensity as predictors: total propofol dose administered and propofol-induced EEG suppression (as quantified by the SR integral). None of these predictors or outcomes were associated with age or sex (all <italic>P</italic>&gt;.05).</p>
                <p>Propofol dose was not significantly associated with any outcome (all <italic>P</italic>&gt;.10), but analyses did reveal associations with SR integral (i.e., EEG suppression). As hypothesized, greater SR integral predicted worse hypotension at a trend level (χ<sup>2</sup>=2.6, df=1, <italic>P</italic>=.10, linear mixed model) and also predicted longer duration of unconsciousness (χ<sup>2</sup>=22.0, df=1, <italic>P</italic>=2.7 × 10<sup>–6</sup>, linear mixed model). Counter to our expectation, SR integral was negatively associated with depression improvement (r=−0.78, <italic>P</italic>=.0077, n=10, Pearson correlation; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>,B). In contrast to nonresponders, the treatments of responders were characterized by a duration of burst-suppression &lt;20 minutes and SR intensity &lt;95% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>,D). In summary, key outcomes were associated with propofol-induced EEG suppression but not with propofol dose.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>This study is the first to our knowledge to examine the antidepressant effects of propofol. We found that deep propofol anesthesia was feasible and well tolerated in a small sample of physically healthy adults with treatment-resistant depression. This open-label trial also generated preliminary evidence for antidepressant effects, with 6 participants responding after a series of 10 treatments. Improvement of self-reported depressive symptoms among propofol participants was similar to the improvement seen in a matched cohort of ECT patients, and improvements following the propofol intervention typically persisted for months. The cognitive side effects that are typical of ECT were not observed among propofol participants.</p>
              <p>Our findings indicate that treatment with high-dose propofol is well tolerated among individuals with treatment-resistant depression who are otherwise in good health. Based on propofol’s known effects on blood pressure in other clinical populations, we expected that pressors would be required routinely and that treatment intensity might be limited by hypotension in some patients, but that was not the case. Hypotension may have been less severe than expected because we did not routinely coadminister propofol with an opioid, as commonly done during surgery. Subjects generally awoke from propofol anesthesia without significant nausea or dysphoria. Self-reports indicated that the drug effects of propofol were typically perceived as neutral or mildly pleasant, consistent with previous reports of low-dose propofol effects in humans and rats (<xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">Zacny et al., 1993</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">Pain et al., 1996</xref>). Notably, to optimize safety and tolerability during this pilot trial, we only enrolled individuals age 18 to 55 years, and we excluded concurrent opioid and benzodiazepine medications as well as chronic physical health problems, so tolerability among more typically encountered patients remains unknown. Furthermore, the sample size of our study allows us to only imprecisely estimate the safety of deep propofol anesthesia. Based on the lack of serious adverse events during the 99 treatments administered (one participant received 9 treatments), the frequency of such events is likely less than approximately 1% per treatment session. Finally, addiction and abuse are potential consequences of repeated administration of propofol. Future studies in humans and animal models will be required to fully assess this risk.</p>
              <p>We observed no objective or subjective cognitive side effects from propofol beyond the expected drowsiness for several hours following each treatment. Subjects became fully oriented and met postanesthesia discharge criteria approximately 10 minutes after eyes open (approximately 40 minutes after propofol discontinuation). Furthermore, MoCA scores measured during and after the treatment series remained stable in all cases, suggesting that repeated treatments did not cause major cognitive deficits. However, it is important to note that the MoCA is a coarse instrument that is insensitive to mild deficits, and cognitive effects are likely to be subtle among this sample of relatively young, highly educated adults. Future studies incorporating a more extensive neurocognitive battery are needed to determine whether deep propofol anesthesia causes deficits that are mild or confined to specific cognitive domains.</p>
              <p>The most important limitation of this study was the open-label trial design. Participants were not randomly assigned to propofol vs a comparison intervention, and neither participants nor research staff were blinded to the intervention. Therefore, although the observed improvement in depression might have been caused by specific effects of propofol, we cannot rule out nonspecific effects. The key nonspecific effects that were not controlled for are: other study-related procedures (e.g., fasting, interactions with research staff, other medications administered); placebo effects (e.g., expectation of improvement); natural history of the disease (i.e., spontaneous fluctuations in symptoms); and statistical regression to the mean. Thus, although the rapid, robust, and durable improvement we observed among the 6 responders was compelling (particularly given this severe treatment-resistant cohort), this open-label study cannot provide definitive proof that propofol has antidepressant effects.</p>
              <p>Nonetheless, 3 observations support a specific antidepressant effect for propofol. First, we found that the effects of propofol on self-reported depressive symptoms were similar to the effects of ECT. Because the nonspecific effects of the propofol intervention were very similar to those of the ECT intervention, and ECT is known to be highly effective, the ECT cohort serves as a kind of active control group. Yet, it is important to recognize that the ECT group was selected to be similar to the propofol group and subjects were not randomized to propofol vs ECT, so the 2 groups may have differed systematically in unknown ways, causing bias. Second, we observed that most of those who responded to the propofol intervention experienced lasting effects (not unlike ECT). If the effects of the intervention were nonspecific, we would expect the beneficial effects to wane during the months following the intervention when nonspecific factors are no longer active. Third, our posthoc analyses revealed an association between the degree of EEG suppression during treatments and subsequent improvement in depression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). Although the direction of this association was opposite to our prediction, any association would be unexpected if depression improvement were caused by nonspecific effects. In summary, although these results do not allow us to draw definitive conclusions about propofol’s antidepressant effects, we believe the findings are compelling enough to warrant a blinded randomized controlled trial.</p>
              <p>The finding that propofol’s EEG effects—and not propofol dose—were associated with clinical outcomes supports the use of EEG as a pharmacodynamic biomarker and argues against rigid mg- or mg/kg-based dosing of propofol. Furthermore, these posthoc analyses suggest that propofol may elicit antidepressant effects only within an optimal range of EEG suppression. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>, the treatments of responders were characterized by a median burst-suppression period of 18 to 19.5 minutes and an SR intensity of 80% to 95%, while treatments of nonresponders were longer (&gt;20 minutes) or more intense (&gt;95%). Although caution is warranted when drawing conclusions based on unexpected posthoc findings from such a small sample, these observations raise the possibility that shorter or less intense treatments could be effective. The existence of such a therapeutic window might in part explain the mixed findings from previous studies of isoflurane and sevoflurane (<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Langer et al., 1985</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Greenberg et al., 1987</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Carl et al., 1988</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Engelhardt et al., 1993</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">Langer et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">García-Toro et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">Weeks et al., 2013</xref>). Future studies of propofol should carefully characterize the EEG effects of this intervention.</p>
              <p>Our findings may seem at odds with sham-controlled ECT trials indicating that general anesthetics alone lack the robust antidepressant effects of ECT (<xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">Rasmussen, 2009</xref>), but we believe this older literature is fully consistent with antidepressant effects of high-dose propofol. Notably, to our knowledge, no sham-controlled ECT trial has used propofol in an anesthesia-only comparison group. Furthermore, the propofol doses we used (9–20 mg/kg) were substantially higher than the doses used for procedural sedation (typically 2–3 mg/kg) and produced EEG effects not typically seen during ECT (i.e., a prolonged burst-suppression state). If propofol has true antidepressant effects, those effects are likely to be dose dependent and may require fine-tuning of the induced EEG or neurochemical effects. Nonetheless, others have highlighted the relatively high sham response rates in some of the older literature, raising the possibility that anesthetics beyond ketamine have measurable antidepressant effects when used at lower doses (<xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">Rasmussen, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">Vutskits, 2018</xref>).</p>
              <p>In conclusion, deep propofol anesthesia is feasible and well-tolerated among individuals with treatment-resistant depression. Controlled trials in humans and mechanistic studies in animal models are warranted to further examine propofol’s antidepressant effects. If it proves effective, propofol might become a viable therapeutic alternative for many patients with severe depression and limited treatment options. Beyond propofol’s clinical application, dissection of propofol’s mechanisms of action could provide a novel conceptual framework for understanding depression and developing new antidepressant interventions.</p>
