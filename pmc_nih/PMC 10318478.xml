              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Administration of thrombolysis for acute ischemic stroke reduces poststroke disability, yet it is underused.<sup><xref rid="zoi230635r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Thrombolysis is time dependent, and administration requires a complex multidisciplinary care team often involving emergency medical services (EMS) professionals, nurses, emergency department (ED) physicians, and neurologists. Decreasing the time from stroke symptom onset to the presentation at the hospital (prehospital delay) and optimizing ED processes for acute stroke treatment could increase the number of patients with stroke eligible to receive thrombolysis and improve the effectiveness of acute stroke treatments.<sup><xref rid="zoi230635r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230635r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230635r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Acute stroke treatment is a model for the codependence of the community and the medical system. Patients with stroke must arrive at the ED soon after stroke symptom onset, and the ED must be optimized to treat them. Prehospital delay is predominantly due to patient-related factors, such as decision delay (ie, the time from symptom onset to the decision to seek medical attention) or the presence of stroke bystanders, given that patients with stroke may be unable to seek help.<sup><xref rid="zoi230635r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Although stroke is a common condition, the absolute lifetime risk of stroke for most individuals is low, so efforts to increase stroke preparedness, recognition of stroke warning signs, and the importance of calling EMS must be made community wide. Prehospital-focused interventions depend on receiving optimized acute stroke care upon hospital arrival. ED quality improvement initiatives have been promising,<sup><xref rid="zoi230635r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230635r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> yet less is known about such initiatives in lower-resource settings.</p>
              <p>Given the existence of stroke racial disparities, complexities of racial and income discrimination, and mistreatment within disinvested communities, it is crucial to partner with the community and local health system to design and test interventions. In this context, we present the results of the Stroke Ready project, an ED and community intervention to increase thrombolysis treatment by decreasing prehospital delay and optimizing ED acute stroke care developed and implemented through a community-based participatory research approach. We also hypothesized that Stroke Ready would increase EMS utilization and decrease the time from ED arrival to thrombolysis for stroke in Flint, Michigan.</p>

The institutional review board from the University of Michigan granted a waiver of informed consent because the community stroke preparedness intervention presented no more than minimal risk of harm to participants and involved no procedures for which written consent is normally required outside the research context, in accordance with 45 CFR §46.

                <p>Stroke Ready was conducted in Flint, Michigan, home to approximately 61 750 adults. The city’s population is predominantly Black people (54%), and more than 40% of the population lives below the poverty level.<sup><xref rid="zoi230635r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Flint has the highest poverty rate among US cities, with at least 65 000 residents, and it experienced a water crisis.<sup><xref rid="zoi230635r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230635r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Three hospitals in Genesee County care for Flint residents. All 3 hospitals participated in Get with the Guidelines–Stroke and achieved primary stroke center or comprehensive stroke center status prior to the start of the ED intervention. Similarly, acute stroke activations were managed locally without telemedicine stroke support during the study period. In 2010, Flint had one of the lowest acute stroke treatment rates of any community its size in the US.<sup><xref rid="zoi230635r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p>

                <title>Stroke Ready Program Overview</title>
                <p>Stroke Ready was conducted through a long-standing community-based participatory research partnership established in 2010. The overarching goal of the Stroke Ready partnership is to improve the health and well-being of the Flint community. The partnership is co-led by a vascular neurologist (L.E.S.) and a community leader (S.B.). The community advisory board consisted of academic researchers, community members, representatives from community organizations, all Flint hospitals, emergency medical services, the county health department, and city government (see Additional Contributions at the end of the article) who partnered on all project phases.</p>
                <p>The Stroke Ready program was a multilevel intervention that included an ED-based, implementation science–based intervention to optimize acute stroke care and a multimedia community intervention to increase stroke preparedness.<sup><xref rid="zoi230635r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> The ED intervention was conducted in the safety-net hospital only because it was the hospital perceived by the community to care for the highest-risk patients with stroke in Flint. Although the intervention was focused on the ED, some of its aspects spilled into inpatient and other hospital care locations. We began with an assessment of the determinants of acute stroke care based on the Tailored Implementation for Chronic Diseases framework; with engaged ED partners, we selected implementation strategies to address the determinants.<sup><xref rid="zoi230635r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230635r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> These strategies, implemented from October 2017 to May 2018, included external facilitation, audit and feedback, and development of a learning health collaborative with representatives across all stages of the stroke pathway and roles (eMethods in <xref rid="note-ZOI230635-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 1</xref>). Ultimately, this combination of implementation strategies led to the learning health collaborative implementing additional strategies, including additional quality monitoring, educational sessions, changing physical structure and equipment, and revising professional roles.<sup><xref rid="zoi230635r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230635r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup></p>
                <p>From June 2018 to March 2020, we conducted a community-wide stroke preparedness intervention guided by the Theory of Planned Behavior, Social Cognitive Theory, and Behavioral Economics to reach adults in Flint.<sup><xref rid="zoi230635r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> The community intervention consisted of peer-led individual and group education workshops with 5 standardized options ranging from 5 to 60 minutes delivered at community events, schools, community organization meetings, faith-based organizations, workplaces, senior centers, shelters, and beauty salons and barber shops. The workshops focused on subjective norms, outcome expectations, self-efficacy, precommitment, and nudges to call 911. Peer educators recorded observational demographics of participants. A total of 34 research team observations of peer educator–led workshops were conducted to assess intervention fidelity (eMethods in <xref rid="note-ZOI230635-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 1</xref>). None of the peer educators assessed required any additional training. In addition to the peer education, the community intervention consisted of (1) print materials, including mailers, brochures, and action plans (precommitment tool), and (2) digital, social, and broadcast media campaigns, including Stroke Ready website, music video, Facebook posts, Instagram posts, and public service announcements.<sup><xref rid="zoi230635r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> The community intervention was rolled out sequentially across Flint quadrants over months and was intended to conclude in June 2020. However, given the restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the intervention ended in March 2020, shortening intervention and data collection time by 3 months.</p>

The primary data source was the electronic medical record and administrative data from all Genesee County hospitals, accounting for 96.2% (3579 of 3718 treatments) of all thrombolysis treatments among Flint residents. Stroke included ischemic stroke (<italic>International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision [ICD-9]</italic> codes 433.x1, 434.x1, and 436; <italic>International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision [ICD-10]</italic> code I63*), transient ischemic attack (TIA) (<italic>ICD-9</italic> code 435; <italic>ICD-10</italic> code G45*), intracerebral hemorrhage (<italic>ICD-9</italic> code 431; <italic>ICD-10</italic> code I61*), and subarachnoid hemorrhage (<italic>ICD-9</italic> code 430; <italic>ICD-10</italic> code I60*). Patient demographics (including race and ethnicity), stroke type, insurance status, EMS arrival (10.2% missing), and acute stroke treatment were abstracted from the medical record. Because of the changing definition of stroke and TIA during the study period, thrombolysis outcomes were assessed among all patients with ischemic stroke or TIA.<sup><xref rid="zoi230635r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230635r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Addresses of patients with stroke and TIA were geocoded to identify Flint residents. The eligibility criteria for endovascular treatment evolved during the study period.<sup><xref rid="zoi230635r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Thus, the primary outcome was stroke thrombolysis (Medicare Severity Diagnosis-Related Group 61-63, <italic>ICD-9 </italic>procedure code 99.10, <italic>ICD-10</italic> procedure code 3E03317, <italic>ICD-9</italic> diagnosis code V45.88, or <italic>ICD-10</italic> diagnosis code Z92.82) among patients with ischemic stroke or TIA who resided in Flint and were admitted to 1 of the 3 hospitals. A secondary outcome included endovascular treatment (Medicare Severity Diagnosis-Related Group 22-24; <italic>Current Procedural Terminology</italic> codes 37184-6, 37201, 75896, and 61645; <italic>ICD-9</italic> procedure code 39.74; <italic>ICD-10</italic> procedure code 03CG3ZZ) or the combination of thrombolysis and endovascular treatment. Another secondary outcome was the proportion of patients with stroke (ie, ischemic stroke, TIA, intracerebral hemorrhage, or subarachnoid hemorrhage, because all have similar presentations) who arrived by EMS. In the safety-net hospital’s Get With the Guidelines database, we explored a secondary outcome of time from ED arrival to thrombolysis treatment among patients with ischemic stroke. The final data set was the Michigan State Inpatient Database from 2010 to 2020, which includes all acute care hospitalizations in Michigan within a given year. Demographics, stroke type, and thrombolysis by the city were ascertained.</p>

                <p>To maximize statistical power, the prespecified primary analysis parameterized the combined intervention, ED, and community components as a single variable.

                <title>Statistical Analysis</title>
                <p>Descriptive statistics were used to describe the reach of the community intervention and the preintervention and postintervention population. The primary analysis was an interrupted time series design. The preintervention period was defined as 87 months before the start of the intervention (October 2017). Logistic regression was used to estimate the overall intervention association (indicator variable) in a model estimating receipt of thrombolysis (binary variable) accounting for stroke type (TIA vs ischemic stroke), time (month since start of intervention), and clustering at the hospital level (as a random effect). In a secondary analysis, the intervention period was separated into the ED and community intervention periods. We did not use this for our primary analysis because we suspected we would be underpowered to identify independent associations. We parameterized the ED intervention as turning on and sustaining over the entire period (binary variable representing periods before vs after the ED intervention) and the community intervention as turning on and changing over time as more people were reached with the sequential quadrant rollout (continuous variable representing months from the start of the community intervention period).<sup><xref rid="zoi230635r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> We summarized model outcomes using average marginal effects. Sensitivity analyses assessed the robustness of our findings to different modeling assumptions: limiting the study population to only patients with ischemic stroke, expanding the study population to include all patients admitted to all Genesee county hospitals, accounting for patient factors associated with thrombolysis (ie, age, race [Black vs White and any other other race and ethnicity], and insurance status) and the outcome to include patients treated with thrombolysis and/or endovascular thrombectomy. Sensitivity analysis limited to Flint residents in the Michigan State Inpatient Database were also performed.</p>
                <p>Additional secondary analyses explored how likely the association between Stroke Ready and outcomes were to be causal. Because the community intervention was delivered sequentially by Flint geographic quadrants, we explored whether increases in acute thrombolysis treatment rates paralleled the geographic pattern of intervention rollout by including an indicator of months from quadrant intervention. Finally, we conducted a logistic regression to examine thrombolysis trends in Flint vs other large Michigan metropolitan regions in which Black people comprise more than 25% of the population (Detroit, Saginaw, Muskegon, and Benton Harbor) to account for regional trends by using the Michigan State Inpatient Database.</p>
                <p>For the secondary outcome of EMS utilization among all Flint patients with stroke, we performed a logistic regression model and accounted for known demographics associated with EMS utilization, including age, insurance status (insured vs not insured), and race (Black vs other race and ethnicity).<sup><xref rid="zoi230635r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> For the secondary outcome of time from ED arrival to thrombolysis treatment among patients with ischemic stroke at the intervention ED, we explored the association of log-transformed time from ED arrival to thrombolysis treatment and the ED intervention adjusting for time, sex, age, and race (Black vs other race and ethnicity).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Stroke Ready, a multilevel ED optimization and community stroke preparedness intervention, was not associated with increased use of thrombolysis. However, when analyzing the Stroke Ready intervention components separately, we found that the ED intervention was associated with increased thrombolysis, but the community intervention was not. In the last decade, Flint improved from one of the lowest-performing US communities for delivering stroke thrombolysis to a higher-performing community.</p>
              <p>Stroke Ready did not increase thrombolysis more than would be expected by the time trend in Flint alone. The failure to detect an association may be related to trends in thrombolysis that were insufficiently accounted for in our study design. There has been a consistent worldwide increase in thrombolysis. In 2009, the US thrombolysis rate was approximately 4.6%, compared with approximately 11% in 2018, and varied across communities.<sup><xref rid="zoi230635r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230635r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> In planning Stroke Ready in 2015, we powered the study for a relative 100% increase (ie, a doubling) in thrombolysis treatment rates or an absolute increase of 2% from the low baseline 2% treatment rate observed in Flint.<sup><xref rid="zoi230635r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> The absolute observed change in thrombolysis rate over the study period was, in fact, 10%. As such, we were substantially underpowered to differentiate the effect of Stroke Ready from the robust observed time trend.</p>
              <p>The Stroke Ready ED intervention was associated with a statistically significant increase in thrombolysis and decreased time from ED arrival to thrombolysis. Notably, this increase was found in hospitals that participated in Get With the Guidelines–Stroke and had achieved stroke center certification. Cluster-randomized ED thrombolysis implementation trials in the US, Australia, and the Netherlands have shown small, non–statistically significant increases in use of thrombolysis.<sup><xref rid="zoi230635r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230635r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230635r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> These trials did not specifically select EDs with low thrombolysis usage, and in fact, 1 trial<sup><xref rid="zoi230635r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> found no change in thrombolysis in EDs that were higher users of thrombolysis at baseline, suggesting that some EDs may be at their capacity. Selecting low-performing EDs leads to a larger opportunity to improve and maybe one approach to future interventions to increase thrombolysis.</p>
              <p>The Stroke Ready community intervention was not associated with thrombolysis treatment rates. In addition to the power concerns, several points suggest a more cautious interpretation of the findings: (1) our study design precludes true independent evaluation of the hospital and community intervention (eg, the community intervention may have led to more thrombolysis-eligible patients with stroke presenting to the safety-net ED); (2) the community intervention and data collection were shortened by 3 months because of research restrictions necessitated by COVID-19<sup><xref rid="zoi230635r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230635r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>; and (3) thrombolysis in Flint increased faster than in comparator Michigan cities, suggesting that Stroke Ready might have had some benefit not directly accounted for by our analysis. However, our findings are consistent with recent community intervention studies that found no benefit on prehospital delay, EMS use, or thrombolysis,<sup><xref rid="zoi230635r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230635r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> except in communities with low baseline stroke preparedness.<sup><xref rid="zoi230635r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> Furthermore, community stroke preparedness interventions are resource intensive, and the long-term fidelity and sustainability are uncertain. Thus, moving forward more effective community stroke preparedness interventions are needed.</p>
              <p>Stroke Ready highlights some of the strengths and challenges in performing complex, multilevel interventions in the context of a community-based participatory research partnership. Strengths of the community intervention include the depth of community engagement, including community ideation, intervention development guided by health behavior theory, pilot testing with Black churches, delivery of stroke preparedness intervention by peer educators to facilitate sustainability, and co-led results dissemination.<sup><xref rid="zoi230635r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230635r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> Our community-engaged approach likely facilitated the substantial reach of Stroke Ready into the community (ie, 10% of the Flint adult population received an in-person intervention). Challenges include the scale needed to test community-level interventions. The ideal study design would be a cluster-randomized trial of matched communities across the US, yet this requires multiple, often at least 10, communities to attain statistical power. These trials also require substantial resources, including the engagement of community partners across communities and an evidence base to suggest that the trial resources are warranted.<sup><xref rid="zoi230635r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230635r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup></p>

                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p>There are additional limitations of our study worth considering. First, this was a single community, and thus our results may not be generalizable to other cities. Second, data were not available on patient eligibility for thrombolytics, including stroke onset to ED arrival times. Data on whether Flint patients with stroke or their social networks were exposed to Stroke Ready were also unavailable. Third, stroke and TIA diagnosis and acute stroke outcomes were obtained via diagnosis codes from the medical record. Fourth, we do not have measures of EMS use appropriateness. Fifth, the secondary outcome of EMS use was limited by missing data slightly greater in the postintervention period. Missing EMS data are more likely among patients who do not arrive to the ED by EMS and, thus, should be biased toward the null.</p>
