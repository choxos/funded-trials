                <p>​​​​​​
<bold>Background</bold>: Most spinal cord injuries (SCI) are not full transections, indicating that residual nerve circuits are retained. Rehabilitation interventions have been shown to beneficially reorganize motor pathways in the brain, corticospinal tract, and at the spinal level. However, rehabilitation training require a large number of repetitions, and intervention effects may be absent or show transient retention. Therefore, the need remains for an effective approach to synergistically improve the amount and duration of neuroplasticity in combination with other interventions. Remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) demonstrates several potential advantages as a candidate for such an approach. Therefore, we propose a protocol to investigate RIC coupled with physical training to promote neuroplasticity in hand muscles.</p>
                <p><bold>Methods</bold>: This will be a prospective randomized-order crossover trial to be performed in eight able-bodied participants and eight participants with chronic cervical SCI. Patients will participate in two experimental sessions consisting of either active or sham RIC preceding a bout of pinch movement exercise. Serial evaluations will be conducted at baseline, after RIC, immediately after pinch exercise, and follow up 15-minutes later. The primary outcome is the change in corticospinal excitability (primarily measured by the motor evoked potential of abductor pollicis brevis muscle). Secondary outcomes will include maximal volitional pinch force, and inflammatory biomarkers. To ensure safety, we will monitor tolerability and hemodynamic responses during RIC.</p>
                <p><bold>Discussion</bold>: This protocol will be the first to test RIC in people with cervical SCI and to investigate whether RIC alters corticospinal excitability. By sharing the details of our protocol, we hope other interested researchers will seek to investigate similar approaches – depending on overlap with the current study and mutual sharing of participant-level data, this could increase the sample size, power, and generalizability of the analysis and results.</p>

                <title>Background and rationale</title>
                <p>Between 250-350,000 individuals live with chronic spinal cord injury (SCI) in the United States. Among this population, ~60% have injuries at the cervical level
<sup><xref rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. Impairments of arm and hand function in individuals with cervical SCI greatly reduce quality of life and adversely impact the level of independence
<sup><xref rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. Previous research on the needs of individuals with cervical SCI has shown that improvement of hand function is ranked more important than walking
<sup><xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. Most spinal cord injuries are not full transections, indicating that functional nerve circuits exist after injury
<sup><xref rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. Rehabilitation interventions such as physical training and neural stimulation have been shown to reorganize motor pathways in the brain, corticospinal tract, and at the spinal level to promote functional gains
<sup><xref rid="ref-5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>–
<xref rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
</sup>. Neural activation drives neuroplasticity. Thus, enhancing residual neural circuit excitability after SCI could improve hand function in the long term by increasing neuroplasticity
<sup><xref rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>–
<xref rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
</sup>.</p>
                <p>However, even a large number of repetitions of physical training often leads to transient, poorly retained benefits, and some individuals with SCI remain non-responders. Investigators must find new ways to enhance the magnitude and duration of neuroplastic effects. Acute intermittent hypoxia (AIH) is one such approach. Preliminary research has shown that AIH coupled with task-oriented physical rehabilitation enhances the learning effects of task-specific motor training after SCI
<sup><xref rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>, presumably through activation of raphe serotonergic neurons
<sup><xref rid="ref-17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. This leads to intermittent spinal serotonin release, which further induces synthesis of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and activation of the high-affinity receptor tyrosine kinase, potentially leading to neuroplasticity
<sup><xref rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. However, AIH requires a hypoxicator system to provide systemic low oxygen exposure, and highly trained staff are needed to administer AIH, making it difficult for home use. Therefore, a need remains for developing an accessible, low-risk method to promote lasting neuroplasticity and potentially be used in the home setting.</p>
                <p>Ischemic conditioning occurs when a specific organ or tissue is exposed to one or more transient episodes of sublethal ischemia. This leads to several reactions that protect the organ system or tissue from subsequent ischemia
<sup><xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>–
<xref rid="ref-21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>
</sup>. Murry
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> first introduced this technique in 1986
<sup><xref rid="ref-22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>, showing that a brief cycle of occlusions and reperfusion to the coronary artery reduced the size of myocardial infarction in the canine heart. Subsequent studies have demonstrated that these endogenous protective effects are not limited to the heart or the ischemic organ/tissue alone – the protective effects are systemic and they are transferrable to other organ systems or tissues
<sup><xref rid="ref-23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>–
<xref rid="ref-25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>
</sup>. This phenomenon is called remote ischemic conditioning (RIC)
<sup><xref rid="ref-26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>, and for example, cardioprotective effects have been reported by simply occluding arterial blood flow to one upper extremity for 3-5 cycles of 5 minutes each using a tourniquet. Additionally, the neuroprotective effect of RIC has been shown in animal studies. Studies in rats and rabbits have shown that RIC can protect the spinal cord from acute ischemia-reperfusion injury
<sup><xref rid="ref-28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>–
<xref rid="ref-31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>
</sup>, possibly through upregulation of antioxidant enzyme activity, alteration of endocannabinoids system, or modulation of heat shock protein expression. Among the potential mechanisms supporting the
<underline>cardio</underline>protective benefits of RIC, two might promote
<underline>neuro</underline>plasticity: induction of trophic and anti-inflammatory factors. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) may have neuroprotective effects via triggering the expression of genes related to oxygen transport, glycolytic metabolism, and apoptosis
<sup><xref rid="ref-32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>. Albrecht and colleagues found that upper limb RIC induced H1F-1α accumulation and activation in right atrial tissue of patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass
<sup><xref rid="ref-33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is another potentially neuroprotective factor shown to be induced by RIC
<sup><xref rid="ref-34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>. Whether the activation of H1F-1α and VEGF induced by RIC extends to corticospinal areas and regulates neural excitability is unknown.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, RIC may reduce systemic inflammation
<sup><xref rid="ref-35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>. The systemic inflammation has been shown to attenuate expression of BDNF in the brain
<sup><xref rid="ref-37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>–
<xref rid="ref-40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>
</sup>. One study demonstrated broadly elevated inflammatory gene expression in persons with chronic SCI, which was particularly evident in persons with higher level injuries
<sup><xref rid="ref-41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>. Specifically, elevated expression of members of the Toll-like receptor 2/4 (TLR) signaling pathway, metalloproteinases (ADAM10), caspases (CASP1, 3, 8) and chemokine gene families were identified in individuals with SCI compared to able-bodied individuals. One study in four able-bodied adults showed that RIC (by inflating pressure cuff on forearm to 200 mm Hg for three cycles of 5-min occlusion and 5 min reperfusion) reduced proinflammatory gene expression in circulating leukocytes 15 minutes and 24 hours later

                <p>Cherry-Allen and colleagues recently published the first study testing the synergistic effects of RIC on motor task learning
<sup><xref rid="ref-42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup>. Able-bodied adults (n=18) were randomly assigned into active or sham RIC groups to undergo seven consecutive weekday sessions. Active or sham RIC (five cycles of 5-min inflation and 5-min deflation by upper arm blood cuff inflation to 200 mm Hg in active RIC and 10 mmHg below the subjects’ diastolic blood pressure in sham RIC) was conducted before training each day. Daily training consisted of stability platform balance training and training of a hippocampal-dependent cognitive task. The authors noted significantly improved performance on the stability platform task in the active RIC group compared to the sham group immediately after the completion of seven-day training programs; these effects were retained at the 2- and 4-week follow-up visits. The authors hypothesized that the improved performance might be due to increased BDNF production by hippocampal and corticospinal neurons induced by RIC. However, they did not report significant changes in serum BDNF, cognitive learning, or generalized muscle activation measured by finger flexor EMG activity and grip force in the RIC compared to the sham group. Corticospinal excitability was not directly measured in that study. Therefore, the mechanism of improved balance was unclear. We hypothesize that RIC acutely modulates corticospinal excitability as measured by utilizing transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).</p>
                <p>Although RIC has been shown to be safe in the healthy able-bodied population as well as in individuals with heart disease and critically ill patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage
<sup><xref rid="ref-43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>–
<xref rid="ref-46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>
</sup>, there are no data describing the safety of RIC in the SCI population. However, widespread sensory impairment, including a limited ability to feel pain/discomfort, may compromise the safety profile of such techniques in participants with SCI. In addition, damage to the autonomic nervous system (ANS) after cervical SCI contributes to cardiovascular dysregulation, which may alter hemodynamic responses to RIC. Several studies
<sup><xref rid="ref-47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>–
<xref rid="ref-50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>
</sup> have reported stable heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) responses before and after RIC in healthy participants, and also in participants with heart disease or vascular stenosis. However, sympathetic hypoactivity after cervical SCI might result in altered or delayed hemodynamic responses, possibly leading to fluctuation of HR and BP during RIC. These possibilities make it essential to investigate HR, BP and oxygen saturation (SaO
<sub>2</sub>) in real-time and document acute pain/discomfort and any other adverse effects during RIC in individuals with cervical SCI.</p>
                <p>Therefore, we propose a proof of concept study to investigate the acute synergistic effects of active versus sham RIC with motor task training (isometric hand exercise) in persons with chronic SCI. The primary outcome measure will be change in corticospinal excitability. Secondary outcomes will include pinch force and inflammatory biomarkers specifically on TLR signaling pathway. To ensure safety, we will monitor beat-to-beat changes in HR, BP and SaO
<sub>2</sub> during RIC, since ANS damage in individuals with SCI might dysregulate hemodynamic responses during ischemic conditioning. This protocol details our experimental design and explores the possible benefits of RIC on neuroplasticity. An important advantage of RIC is that it can be simply applied using a regular blood pressure monitor and a timer. Therefore, if a beneficial effect of RIC on neuroplasticity is demonstrated, RIC can be easily coupled with rehabilitation training in the clinic or home setting. </p>
                <p>As far as we know, this will be the first study in the SCI population to (1) investigate the synergistic effects of RIC with physical training on corticospinal excitability, (2) measure changes in inflammatory mediators after RIC, and (3) observe in real time the responses of HR, BP and SaO2 during RIC.</p>

                <p>This is an exploratory prospective randomized-order crossover trial to be performed over 24 months in 16 participants, including eight able-bodied participants and eight participants with cervical SCI. In two separate sessions, active or sham RIC will be performed prior to isometric hand exercise.

Participants with SCI will undergo a screening session prior to the first experimental session to determine eligibility. Participants will be randomly assigned the order of the two experimental sessions: active or sham RIC. The isometric hand exercise will be performed in both sessions. Clinical and physiological measurements will be made during each session before and after sham/active RIC, and after isometric hand exercise (
<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Blood samples will be drawn before and after sham/active RIC. The washout period between the two experimental sessions will be at least 14 days to prevent any carry-over effects.</p>

                <p>The purpose of the screening session is to ensure that participants with SCI meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria including detectable electrophysiological signals induced by TMS. Subjects will first undergo neurological examination according to the International Standards for the Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury (ISNCSCI). The ISNCSCI neurological level of injury must be between C2–C8, with muscle strength of at least 3/5 in finger extension, finger flexion, or finger abduction in either hand. In order to qualify for the study, all participants must demonstrate the capability of performing a pinch grip between the tips of the thumb and third finger with detectable pinch force on at least one hand. Maximal volitional contraction (MVC) during thumb-third finger pinch will be recorded using a load cell dynamometer. Supramaximal electrical stimulation will be delivered at median and ulnar nerves at wrist level to induce maximal peak-to-peak amplitude of M wave (Mmax) and F wave. Recorded peripheral nerve parameters include the latency and the peak-to-peak amplitude of the M/F waves. After determining each participant’s optimal scalp location for hand motor cortex stimulation using TMS (Magventure X100 with D-B80 coil) with neuronavigation (Brainsight), TMS will be performed to determine resting motor threshold (RMT), which will be defined as the lowest intensity at which at least 5 out of 10 stimuli result in a response of at least 50 uV from the targeted APB. If RMT cannot be detected at the APB muscle at stimulus intensity below 90% of maximal stimulator output, then active motor threshold (AMT) will be determined while the participant performs a pinch maneuver at 20% maximal effort. Participants will be ineligible for study participation if neither RMT nor AMT can be detected at the APB muscle at stimulus intensity below 90% of maximal stimulator output. If MEPs are detected, then an intensity-response curve will be recorded at 10–20% intervals between 100% and 200% of threshold in pseudorandom order. Peak-to-peak amplitude of 10 responses will be averaged per intensity. To account for possible changes in electrode placement and skin conductance over different testing sessions, MEPs will be normalized during each session to peripherally evoked Mmax

                <p>This project is the first to test RIC on people with SCI and investigate whether RIC alters nerve excitability in the pathway from the brain to the spinal cord to facilitate motor learning. For the primary efficacy outcome measure (MEP) of corticospinal excitability, we utilized G*Power 3.1
<sup><xref rid="ref-75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref></sup> to estimate the sample size of four groups (Condition: SCI-RIC, SCI-sham, AB-RIC, AB-sham) by four measurements (Time: baseline, post-RIC, post-RICx-0, post-RICx-15) within-between (mixed) ANOVA. A sample size of 16 with 80% power would be needed to detect a large effect size (Cohen’s f) of 0.4 at a significance level of 0.05. This pilot study emphasizing safety and feasibility will enroll 16 participants (8 SCI and 8 able-bodied) to more specifically determine the effect size for subsequent efficacy trials.</p>

                <p>Veterans will be recruited from the SCI Service and from ongoing research studies taking place at the JJPCAMC. After our veteran population has been given first option to participate, eligible non-veterans from the tri-state New York/New Jersey/Connecticut metropolitan area will be permitted to participate. This will allow for a larger pool of subjects and will help to ensure balanced allocation among treatment groups. Our research Center has enrolled almost 1,000 participants with chronic SCI in various clinical research studies over the past two decades.</p>
                <p>Eligible women, minorities, and economically or socially disadvantaged individuals will be included. These individuals, potentially classified as vulnerable populations, will be given the same treatment as individuals who are not considered to be vulnerable. No special classes of subjects such as pregnant women, prisoners, or institutionalized individuals will be recruited for this study.</p>
                <p>There will be no exclusions based on gender, race, or ethnic status. However, regarding gender, please note that approximately 80% of traumatic spinal injuries occur in males. Furthermore, although our research is open to non-veterans, the predominant component of our population at the VA is male.</p>

A researcher outside the research team will randomize the order of active and sham RIC for each participant and configure the personal tourniquet system. The inflation pressure value will be concealed throughout the whole period of RIC. The researcher will feed data into the computer in separate datasheets so that the research team can analyze data without having access to information about the allocation.</p>

<sup><xref rid="ref-76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref></sup> will be used to determine relative gene expression. This standard method to quantify PCR products uses the cycle threshold (Ct) needed for the fluorescent signal derived from SBYR Green dye incorporation into the PCR product to increase above a background level (determined by a negative control, such as lack of cDNA included in the PCR reaction). The Ct is inversely proportional to the amount of target sequence in the substrate cDNA. The delta Ct is the Ct of the housekeeping or control gene minus the Ct of the gene of interest. The delta Ct method calculates the difference in the delta Ct values in two conditions, such as between a control (baseline) and an experimental time point.</p>

                <p>This clinical trial has multiple levels of data and safety monitoring, beginning with every study personnel involved, extending to the protocol PI, the mentor, a non-affiliated physician safety monitor, the JJPVAMC IRB, the JJPVAMC Information Safety Officer, and all applicable oversight committees on local, state, and national levels.
</p>
                <p>As detailed in the “Protection of Human Subjects”, this study incorporates many safeguards to exclude participation by subjects at higher risk of adverse events (AEs), and to prevent AEs from occurring in those that are eligible to participate. However, the team knows to always expect the unexpected. Participants will be questioned before, during, and after testing to determine if they have noticed any AE. Any unexpected complications that may occur will lead to immediate termination of that study visit, and discussion with NYH (an experienced neurologist) and the study physician.</p>
                <p>All AEs and severe AEs (SAEs) that occur throughout the study, whether study-related or non-related, will be documented and reported to the IRB, as per IRB regulations. AE/SAE report forms will be completed within 48 hours throughout the study for each participant. We will keep a running log of all AE/SAEs (anticipated and unanticipated) throughout the study. Any SAE will be reported to the IRB within 24 hours, and the study will be discontinued until the study physician states that it is safe to resume the study. A formal Data Safety Monitoring Board is not needed for this study. However, depending on the type of SAE or number of SAEs, the investigators and study physician, in consultation with the IRB, could recommend that the study be amended to include a data safety monitoring board, or end earlier than planned. Unanticipated SAEs will warrant suspension of new enrollment until further consultation with the IRB and approval of necessary modifications of the consent and protocol summary to include these risks.</p>
                <p>Any significant new information that becomes available during the course of the study that may prevent future related AE/SAEs will be incorporated into the study through appropriate amendments submitted for IRB approval as necessary. Furthermore, if we observe any unanticipated SAEs determined to be related to the study, we will provide oral and written information to update Participants already enrolled in the study, and explicitly remind them of their right to cease participation at any time.</p>
                <p>The IRB annually reviews and oversees the risk/benefits within the study. All risks and newly published literature related to this study are reported annually. Ongoing review of the data assures that the study can continue without jeopardizing participant safety.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Many approaches to stimulating residual nerve circuits in individuals with SCI have been tested. In this study, we propose a new approach using RIC to transiently impede upper extremity blood flow, to determine if RIC alone, or in combination with task specific exercise training, enhances hand function. Furthermore, we investigate the possible mechanism by examining changes in electrophysiology within the motor cortex and corticospinal tract, and gene expression of inflammatory mediators. Importantly, we will carefully monitor cardiovascular parameters and document pain/discomfort to understand hemodynamic stability and tolerability when applying RIC in persons with cervical SCI. By sharing the details of our NIH-funded research protocol (Grant number: R03HD097709), we hope other interested researchers will seek to investigate similar approaches – depending on overlap with the current study and mutual sharing of participant-level data, this could increase the sample size, power, and generalizability of the analysis and results.</p>
              <p>Importantly, given the pilot nature of this study, several limitations are anticipated. First, applying RIC to facilitate motor task learning is a relatively new area with little preliminary data. Therefore, our primary hypothesis that RIC will promote increased corticospinal excitability to hand muscles involved in motor tasks is speculative. Additionally, SCI individuals with neuronal damage to motor and sensory pathways might show diminished responses to RIC on acute post-exercise facilitation compared to non-disabled participants. Heterogeneity in injury level and residual nerve circuits among participants with SCI might result in wide variation in outcomes and we will find some non-responders. Nevertheless, the proposed protocol is designed to provide clear answers. If brief isometric hand exercise plus RIC does not improve corticospinal transmission or pinch strength in participants with cervical SCI, our next step might test RIC in combination with more advanced interventions such as non-invasive paired stimulation, a technique that our research team is actively studying in other protocols (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03414424, NCT02469675 and NCT03806023). Finally, our protocol will test maximal pinch force as the only functional outcome. If the pilot study shows a significant synergistic effect of RIC on the isometric hand exercise task, our future goal will be not only coupling RIC with more prolonged rehabilitation training to promote long-term beneficial effects, but also investigating the benefits in international classification of functioning outcomes.</p>
              <p>Additionally, using standard gene expression profiling techniques, if we do not observe changes in gene expression of the TLR signaling pathway, the next step would be to use RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) to obtain a broader and unbiased gene expression profile. Initial RNA-seq runs could be limited to 8 million reads/sample, 100bp single end, which would yield a general overview of relative changes in gene expression of the high to moderately expressed genes.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, this study is the first to test RIC in people with cervical spinal cord injury and investigate whether RIC alters nerve excitability in the pathway from the brain to the spinal cord to intrinsic hand muscles involved in fine motor tasks. If synergistic effects of RIC with physical training are demonstrated in this study, then effects of RIC coupled with various other rehabilitation interventions can be tested in future studies. In addition, we expect the analysis of neurophysiology and inflammatory mediators before and after RIC to provide some preliminary information regarding the mechanism by which RIC promotes neuroplasticity and improves functional training effects. Thus, results from this study will give us the information to apply RIC coupled with rehabilitation interventions to enhance long-term functional movements in people with cervical spinal cord injury.</p>

              <p>This study protocol aims to investigate the effect of remote ischemic conditioning on corticospinal excitability, gene expression of inflammatory biomarkers, hemodynamic responses, and functional outcomes. The authors proposed an innovative and well-designed study that will inform future rehabilitation in spinal cord injury.</p>

However, the exercise program is not designed to gain strength as the intensities are submaximal (at 10%, 25%, and 50%).

                      <p><bold>Author response: </bold>Thank you very much for this suggestion. We developed a LabVIEW program that provides visual and auditory prompts to participants, so they can follow the prompts to accurately perform the pinch exercise with different submaximal MVC intensity and duration in a pseudo-random submaximal. Please find the video that illustrates how the program works.</p>

              <p>The authors plan an innovative and well-designed proof of concept study on the effects of remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) on hand function after iSCI. This population requires novel therapeutic options to address dosage and retention limitations of current rehabilitation protocols. In a well-written report, the authors describe a protocol to explore the short-term effect of remote ischemic conditioning on pinch force, corticospinal excitability as well as the gene expression inflammatory mediators. The motivation for the study derives from the lack of understanding of both the time course of RIC in the iSCI population and the mechanisms underlying functional gains. Given the lack of available evidence on both the functional and mechanistic changes after iSCI, the testing of this construct is novel with implications for potential clinical translation.</p>
              <p> As the study protocol has been peer reviewed by an external funding body, it perhaps does not require additional peer review. However, please consider addressing the following clarification questions:

                      <p><bold>Author response: </bold>Sorry for the confusion. The rationale is that individuals with SCI sustain chronic inflammation which could possibly attenuate the gene expression of the brain BDNF. RIC has been shown to reduce chronic inflammation which might increase corticospinal excitability. Therefore, we measure the MEP and analyze the gene expression of inflammatory biomarkers before and after RIC.</p>

                      <p> (b) RIC could reduce systemic inflammation possibly including the protective effects on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced systemic inflammation.</p>

                      </p>
                      <p><bold>Author response: </bold>Due to the nature of the intervention, neither participants nor the research coordinators can be 100% blinded to allocation but are strongly inculcated not to disclose the allocation status of the participant during the experiment. A researcher outside the research team will randomize the order of active and sham RIC for each participant and configure the personal tourniquet system. The researcher who configures the tourniquet pressure would fully cover the pressure indicator.</p>
                      <p> Thank you very much for the suggestion to consider a blind integrity analysis. The participants certainly can tell which protocol they have after receiving both active and sham RIC.</p>

                        <bold>The authors select a homogenous sample of patients with MEPs as part of inclusion criteria for neurophysiological outcomes. This could assume that pinch force gains are primarily due to enhanced excitability.

                      <p><bold>Author response: </bold>As mentioned in the inclusion/exclusion criteria, we conduct the ISNCSCI for each participant with SCI. The participants must show a score of 3 or more (out of 5) on manual muscle testing of finger extension, finger flexion, or finger abduction in the left or right hand. Therefore, we would not enroll the participants using tenodesis grip alone.</p>
                      <p> In terms of floor/ceiling effects in AB, we do not have any specific methods applied to the situation. We will definitely discuss the issue when publishing the results if we observe the floor/ceiling effects. We really appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion.</p>

                      <p><bold>Author response: </bold>We really appreciate the suggestion of using peak EMG. We do agree that we will not observe any significant pinch force changes after RIC.</p>
                      <p> In terms of the fatigue, we design the hand exercise to involve more cortical control (e.g. the participants will need to maintain different certain levels of their peak force (10%, 25%, and 50% MVC) with different duration (2, 4, and 6 secs)) to induce the increase in MEP. We try to see whether active and sham RIC could induce different levels of MEP changes. For the MVC measurement, participants will perform three attempts of maximal pinch force and the best one will be recorded and each time point of the MVC measurement is at least 15 mins apart. We try to prevent the fatigue but the fatigue could still possibly occur.</p>
