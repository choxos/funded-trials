                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>In this 6-month natural history assessment (n = 37) followed by a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial, 33 eligible participants were block-randomized (1:1) to receive NAC (n = 16) or placebo (n = 17), orally for 6 months (adult dose 2,700 mg/d; pediatric dose 30 mg/kg/d). The primary endpoint was urine 15-F2t isoprostane concentration and the clinically meaningful co-primary endpoint was 6-minute walk test (6MWT) distance.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>When compared to the general population, participants had elevated baseline 15-F2t isoprostane concentrations and most had a decreased 6MWT distance (mean Â± SD 3.2 Â± 1.5 vs 1.1 Â± 1.7 ng/mg creatinine and 468 Â± 134 vs 600 Â± 58 m, respectively, both <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.001). 15-F2t isoprostane concentration and 6MWT distance did not change over the 6-month natural history assessment (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.98 and <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.61, respectively). NAC treatment did not improve 15-F2t isoprostane concentration (least squares means difference 0.1 [95% confidence interval [CI] â1.4 to 1.6] ng/mg creatinine, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.88) or 6MWT distance (least squares means difference 24 [95% CI â5.5 to 53.4] m, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.11). NAC was safe and well-tolerated at the doses administered in this study.</p>

            <p>Ryanodine receptor 1<italic toggle="yes">-</italic>related myopathies (<italic toggle="yes">RYR1</italic>-RM) are the most frequently encountered nondystrophic neuromuscular disorders, with an estimated pediatric prevalence of &gt;1:90,000.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>
<italic toggle="yes">RYR1</italic>-RM are allelic to malignant hyperthermia susceptibility and affected individuals exhibit diverse clinical manifestations with variable expressivity ranging from hypotonia, proximal muscle weakness, and fatigue to ophthalmoplegia and respiratory insufficiency.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>
<italic toggle="yes">RYR1</italic>-RM have an unmet medical need as there is currently no approved treatment.</p>
            <p><italic toggle="yes">RYR1</italic>-RM are caused by pathogenic variants in the <italic toggle="yes">RYR1</italic> gene (19q 13.2), which is highly intolerant to change and encodes the major calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) channel in skeletal muscle (RyR1).<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>
<italic toggle="yes">RYR1</italic> variations can result in dysregulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, hypersensitivity or hyposensitivity to channel agonists, and decreased RyR1 protein expression.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Data from <italic toggle="yes">RYR1</italic>-RM cell culture and animal models have consistently demonstrated elevation of oxidative stress owing to intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> dysregulation.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">â</xref><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>
<italic toggle="yes">N</italic>-acetylcysteine (NAC), a direct precursor to the ubiquitous antioxidant glutathione, was subsequently shown to protect <italic toggle="yes">RYR1</italic>-RM patient myotubes against a hydrogen peroxide challenge and, when tested in <italic toggle="yes">ryr1b</italic> mutant zebrafish, improved measures of physical endurance and skeletal muscle histopathology.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> An additional study, in the Y522S mouse model of <italic toggle="yes">RYR1</italic>-RM, reported elevated lipid peroxidation, which compromised the structural integrity of mitochondria and decreased force production. Histopathology and force production were rescued upon treatment with NAC.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup></p>
            <p>Given the potential therapeutic efficacy of NAC for <italic toggle="yes">RYR1-</italic>RM, we conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to determine whether NAC treatment decreases oxidative stress in this rare disease population.</p>

                <title>Study design</title>
                <p>The study had 2 components: a prospective natural history assessment and a parallel-group, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The study was conducted at the NIH Clinical Center, Bethesda, MD, between 2015 and 2017. The total study duration was 12 months and consisted of a 6-month natural history assessment followed by a 6-month intervention phase. Participants attended 3 study visits: baseline (month 0), preintervention (month 6), and postintervention (month 12).</p>
                <p>The allocation scheme was computer-generated using random permuted blocks (block size of 4) to maintain balance of the 2 study arms between children and adults. Participants were randomized (1:1) to receive NAC or placebo by a pharmacist who was independent of the study team. All participants and study investigators were blinded to the allocations until study completion (i.e., after the study was closed and the database locked).</p>
                <p>Participants randomized to receive NAC were provided with a 6-month supply of 900 mg effervescent tablets (PharmaNAC; BioAdvantex Pharma Inc., Toronto, Canada). The NAC content of tablets was verified by an independent laboratory using high-performance liquid chromatography (Hermes Arzneimittel GmbH, Pullach, Germany) and found to be compliant with the stated dose. For the first week, all participants received approximately half of the final dose (15 mg/kg/d divided 3 times daily; no more than 1,800 mg/d). Participants who weighed &lt;50 kg continued with a weight-based dose from the second week (30 mg/kg/d, divided 3 times daily) for the duration of the study (not to exceed 2,700 mg/d). For the 30 mg/kg/d dose, participants were provided with a marked syringe and trained how to take the appropriate liquid dose. Participants who weighed &gt;50 kg received a 2,700 mg total daily dose, divided 3 times daily. The 2,700 mg total daily dose was deemed suitable based upon (1) evidence of safety and tolerability in pediatric and adult populations and (2) evidence that 2,700 mg/d is sufficient to elicit a beneficial effect on oxidative stress.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Participants randomized to receive placebo were provided with a 6-month supply of 900 mg effervescent tablets that were identical but did not contain NAC. Placebo tablets were also manufactured by BioAdvantex Pharma and dosages were prescribed identically to the NAC group. All participants were instructed to self-administer 3 effervescent tablets per day with water or clear liquid as recommended in the package insert. Both NAC and placebo were produced in accordance with good manufacturing practice. Participants were asked to return all remaining tablets at the final study visit. Percentage compliance with intervention was then assessed by a postintervention pill count at month 12 ([pills returned at final study visit, n Ã· expected number of pills to be returned at final study visit, n] Ã 100). At each study visit, blood, urine, and saliva samples were obtained following an overnight fast. Participants also completed a range of physical performance tests, underwent clinical assessments, participated in a qualitative interview, and answered several self-report questionnaires. Adult participants who opted to have skeletal muscle biopsy underwent this procedure immediately preintervention and postintervention (months 6 and 12). Safety and adverse events (AEs) were assessed on-site for 24 hours following each participant's first dose and at monthly intervals thereafter.</p>

                  <title>Primary endpoints</title>
                  <p>The primary endpoint was urine 15-F2t isoprostane concentration (corrected for creatinine), a widely reported biomarker of in vivo oxidative stress and byproduct of lipid peroxidation. This was assessed at the Eicosanoid Core Laboratory (Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN) using a validated gas chromatography/negative ion chemical ionization mass spectrometry (GC/NICI-MS) method with stable isotope dilution and (2H4)-15-F2t-IsoP as the internal standard. The GC/NICI-MS assay methodology used in this study has been described in detail by Milne et al.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> with a precision and accuracy of Â±6% and 96%, respectively. Urine free 15-F2t isoprostane concentrations were corrected for urinary creatinine (15-F2t isoprostane ng/mg creatinine). Creatinine was quantified using a colorimetric assay based on the Jaffe reaction (Roche COBAS Integra 800; F. Hoffmann-La Roche AG, Basel, Switzerland).</p>
                  <p>The clinically meaningful coâprimary endpoint was 6-minute walk test (6MWT) total distance (meters), as a measure of physical endurance. At each study visit, participants completed a 6MWT at the NIH Clinical Center, Rehabilitation Medicine Department. Participants were asked to walk along a corridor for 6 minutes with total distance walked recorded to the nearest meter. The 6MWT was administered by physical therapists according to American Thoracic Society recommendations.</p>

Additional secondary endpoints included Motor Function Measureâ32 (percentage of maximum scores for each domain); peak torque (nM); time to ascend/descend 4 steps, supine to stand, and 10-meter walk/run (seconds); grip/pinch strength (kg); Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) and quality of life in neurologic disorders quality of life scale (<italic toggle="yes">t</italic>) scores; and multidimensional fatigue inventoryâ20 and functional assessment of chronic illness therapyâfatigue questionnaires (total/subscale scores).</p>

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p>Sample size was estimated based on oxidative stress data from a study that tested the effects of NAC therapy on glutathione concentrations in an HIV-positive population. This approach was taken because the current study was the first clinical trial in the <italic toggle="yes">RYR1</italic>-RM population.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> An a priori power calculation, with power at 80% and a 2-sided Î± of 0.05, determined that n = 76 participants (n = 38 per group) would be required to detect a statistically significant postintervention difference in plasma glutathione concentration between NAC and placebo groups. An Î± of 0.05 was used to determine statistical significance for all subsequent tests. To refine the initial sample size estimate, based on the <italic toggle="yes">RYR1</italic>-RM population, a sample size reevaluation was conducted once 30 participants completed the study. This consisted of a formal comparison between treatment and placebo groups and was inclusive of cases subject to intent-to-treat (ITT). Due to technical difficulties with the GSH:GSSG analysis, the primary endpoint for oxidative stress for the randomized controlled trial was changed to urine 15-F2t isoprostane, an alternative, well-established biomarker of oxidative stress. Data for urine 15-F2t isoprostane had been successfully obtained for all study participants as a secondary endpoint.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> This decision was made before unblinding and final statistical analyses. Changing of the primary endpoint was approved by an IMC, an independent scientific review committee, and the IRB, all of which were blind to the treatment allocation scheme. All members came to this conclusion independent of study data.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> As such, the abovementioned sample size reevaluation was based on urine 15-F2t isoprostane data collected on the first 30 study completers. The reevaluation determined that a larger sample (total n = 182) would be required to detect an effect of NAC treatment on urine 15-F2t isoprostane concentration. The study was closed at this point because the new sample size was unlikely to be feasible given the rarity of the disease.</p>
                <p>Once 30 participants completed the 6-month preintervention study visit, disease progression was assessed by using paired <italic toggle="yes">t</italic> tests to determine change over time between 0- and 6-month visits for each outcome measure.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> In addition, the baseline means (Â±SD) of 15-F2t isoprostane concentration and GSH:GSSG ratio of participants were compared to previously reported general population values using summary independent <italic toggle="yes">t</italic> tests.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> The normal distribution assumption was tested prior to running parametric analyses. In the case of 15-F2t isoprostane, the standardized mean difference in concentration between <italic toggle="yes">RYR1-</italic>RM affected and otherwise healthy individuals was also calculated using Hedges <italic toggle="yes">g</italic>.</p>
                <p>For 6MWT distance, the baseline mean (Â±SD) for <italic toggle="yes">RYR1â</italic>RMâaffected individuals was compared to the mean (Â±SD) of general population predicted values,<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">â</xref><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> using a summary independent <italic toggle="yes">t</italic> test, accounting for age, height, and sex of the individual. A disease-specific minimum clinically important difference (MCID) for 6MWT distance was also determined, using preintervention data, by a combined distribution and anchor-based cross-sectional approach. This provided an MCID range (in meters) derived from the standard error of measurement, 1/3 SD at baseline, and difference in 6MWT distance between participants who achieved a <italic toggle="yes">t</italic> score Â± 60 (moderate fatigue) on the PROMIS fatigue subscale.</p>
                <p>To determine the effect of the intervention on primary and secondary outcome measures, statistical analyses included all randomized participants ITT and therefore conformed to the Consolidated Standards for Reporting Trials guidelines. Missing data, considered unrelated to the intervention (i.e., categorized as missing at random), were imputed based on the average of 40 imputed datasets. Imputed datasets were subject to minimum and maximum value constraints, based on per protocol data. Following assessment of data distribution, generalized linear modeling was employed to compare postintervention oxidative stress measure concentration between NAC and placebo groups with preintervention value included as a covariate. Generalized linear modeling was also used to compare postintervention 6MWT distance between NAC and placebo groups with preintervention 6MWT distance and participant height included as covariates. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).</p>

                <p>The study population comprised mild to moderately affected individuals, as ambulation was a required eligibility criterion for 6MWT performance. Participants' clinical manifestations were consistent with previous reports, in which recessive cases were typically more severe than dominant and de novo cases.

              <p>We present results from a natural history assessment and randomized controlled trial of NAC in individuals with <italic toggle="yes">RYR1-</italic>RM. We show that <italic toggle="yes">RYR1</italic>-RMâaffected individuals have increased oxidative stress, disrupted redox equipoise, and decreased physical endurance compared to the general population. This is consistent with findings in cell culture and animal models of the disease (mice, zebrafish, and patient-derived myotubes).<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">â</xref><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> At baseline, all participants had urine 15-F2t isoprostane concentrations greater than the general population mean reference value (1.1 ng/mg creatinine) despite wide variability in genotype and clinical phenotype, indicating that this may be a promising biomarker of oxidative stress for <italic toggle="yes">RYR1</italic>-RM. Moreover, this is consistent with prior reports of elevated 15-F2t isoprostane in other genetic disorders including Rett syndrome, cystic fibrosis, and sickle cell anemia.<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> We also corroborate a stable or slow disease course of <italic toggle="yes">RYR1</italic>-RM in ambulatory individuals over a 6-month time frame, which has only been reported anecdotally to date.<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> This observation lends support to future <italic toggle="yes">RYR1</italic>-RM clinical trials that focus on detecting improvements in clinical manifestations, such as weakness and impaired motor function, rather than stabilization of disease course over this time frame, especially in ambulatory individuals. However, a longer natural history study that includes both ambulatory and nonambulatory affected individuals is needed in this population.</p>
              <p>NAC was safe and well-tolerated at the doses provided in this study, with a total of 9 SAEs observed, and no difference in the frequency of AEs between NAC and placebo groups. In the 33 randomized individuals, a total of 4 SAEs occurred in the NAC group, of which only 2 were considered possibly or probably related to study drug. The probably related event, chest tightness, is a known side effect of inhaled and IV NAC formulations.</p>
              <p>Despite increased 15-F2t isoprostane concentrations at baseline, NAC provided in effervescent tablet formulation over a 6-month period did not ameliorate increased 15-F2t isoprostane concentrations at the doses provided. This is contrary to a recent study of otherwise healthy individuals stratified by baseline erythrocyte glutathione concentrations, in which those with low erythrocyte glutathione concentrations had a 22% decrease in 15-F2t isoprostane concentration with oral NAC treatment (2,400 mg total daily dose for 30 days).<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup></p>
              <p>The ability of NAC to benefit systemic redox equipoise has been reported previously, but a relevant question may be whether NAC can elicit a beneficial effect in skeletal muscle by crossing the sarcolemma and targeting intracellular redox imbalance. In otherwise healthy male patients undergoing an exercise challenge, IV infusion of NAC (125 mg/kg for 1 hour) resulted in increased cysteine and glutathione availability in skeletal muscle tissue.<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> However, the route of NAC administration may influence skeletal muscle bioavailability, especially as NAC is rapidly deacetylated in the gastrointestinal tract, and it undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism.<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> Following oral administration, NAC is distributed to skeletal muscle, albeit at lower concentrations than other tissues such as the kidney, liver, adrenal gland, and lung.<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> It is possible that the absence of a treatment effect with NAC in our study may have been due to the route of administration. Also, all adults received the same dose, but adult weights ranged from 50 to 105 kg, thus dose may have contributed to the lack of effect.</p>
              <p>It is worth considering whether the intervention actually did make a clinical difference, but the low sample size or imperfect oxidative stress biomarker simply did not allow for detection of this. However, we did not observe a treatment effect on muscle DCFH, a biomarker of general oxidative stress at the target tissue. Of note, DCFH was only assayed in those who underwent a muscle biopsy, which limited the sample size (n = 10). A longer natural history study evaluating isoprostane levels and other measures of oxidative stress in more individuals, including those with greater disease severity, would be beneficial to address the conundrum identified in this study of borderline improvements in 6MWT, descend stairs, supine to stand, but not in oxidative stress levels. Nevertheless, 15-F2t isoprostane was substantially elevated over a period of 1 year in <italic toggle="yes">RYR1</italic>-RMâaffected individuals, supporting further investigation of oxidative stress biomarkers in this population.</p>
              <p>Secondary outcomes with a <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> value â¤0.05 included graded functional tests (time to descend 4 steps and move from the supine to sitting position). Interestingly, these endpoints measure changes in motor function rather than physical endurance. However, it should be noted that these <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> values were not corrected for multiple testing. Finally, several other secondary outcomes and all exploratory outcomes did not improve post-NAC treatment, suggesting that the borderline clinically meaningful improvement seen in the 6MWT and graded functional test results should be interpreted with caution.</p>
              <p>We established an <italic toggle="yes">RYR1</italic>-RM MCID for 6MWT distance of 25â83 m, which fell within the MCID range for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (29 m) and a broad range of other diseases (range 14â31 m).<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> The relatively wide 6MWT MCID range for <italic toggle="yes">RYR1-</italic>RM likely reflects the clinical heterogeneity of the disease. Obtaining an <italic toggle="yes">RYR1</italic>-RM-specific MCID for 6MWT is of value for future studies using this outcome measure to test the effects of other interventions. However, 6MWT is known to have limitations, including a large SD and a volitional component, that can decrease objectivity of the measure. We intentionally used 6MWT as a measure of physical endurance in this study based on findings of increased swim endurance post-NAC in <italic toggle="yes">ryr1b</italic> mutant zebrafish.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Similarly, future trial outcomes should not be limited to 6MWT but, rather, should also be based on observations identified in preclinical work testing the drug compound of interest. To that end, the data obtained in this study, including descriptive statistics on &gt;20 other outcome measures throughout the 6-month natural history component, will contribute to powering future <italic toggle="yes">RYR1</italic>-RM trials. Despite being a rare disease, this study has demonstrated that recruitment of approximately 50 <italic toggle="yes">RYR1-</italic>RMâaffected individuals is feasible at a single site. However, our data indicate that sample sizes of approximately 80â100 would be required to detect treatment effects on several motor function-related endpoints (including 6MWT, descend stairs, supine to stand), and 182 for 15-F2t isoprostane. Future phase 2 efficacy trials in <italic toggle="yes">RYR1</italic>-RM should consider a multicenter design to maximize the likelihood of reaching sufficient participant accrual in a timely manner to a detect potential treatment effects in this clinically heterogenous population.</p>
              <p>Our observation of elevated 15-F2t isoprostane concentrations, and hence lipid peroxidation, in <italic toggle="yes">RYR1</italic>-RMâaffected individuals raises the question of whether dietary intervention with omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) could represent a low-risk therapeutic approach to alleviate the pathologic sequalae of RyR1 dysfunction.<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> This is plausible given that n-3 PUFAs have been shown to target ion channels, may inhibit RyR activity, and can alter skeletal muscle lipid composition, favoring an increase in % total n-3 PUFA/total fatty acid content, in as little as 2 weeks in humans.<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">â</xref><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> In support of this, lipid peroxidation has been shown to compromise the integrity of muscle mitochondrial membranes in <italic toggle="yes">RYR1</italic> mutant Y522S mice, and n-3 PUFA supplementation decreases lipid peroxidation byproducts in other genetic disorders.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> Future trials may also consider investigating mitochondria-targeted antioxidants such as the coenzyme Q<sub>10</sub> analog, mitoquinol mesylate, and the tetrapeptide, Szeto-Schiller-31.<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> Indeed, both compounds can permeate the mitochondrial membrane and therefore hold the prospect of addressing redox imbalance at the source. Alternatively, the Rycal RyR stabilizer (S48168) acts directly on RyR1 by restoring ligand binding of calstabin1 (FKBP12) to RyR1. This serves to improve channel integrity and decrease RyR1-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> leak.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> It is therefore foreseeable that a combination of channel stabilization and targeted antioxidant therapy could yield the greatest clinical benefit in future trials.</p>
              <p>Although compliance with intervention was assessed by means of a pill count, this was not verified using a biomarker approach and may be considered a study limitation. The well-established instability of redox analytes, such as glutathione, systemic reduced-to-oxidized ratio for glutathione, cysteine, and reduced-to-oxidized ratio for cysteine, make these challenging as clinical trial endpoints. Indeed, at 6 months, GSH:GSSG values were unreliable due to methodologic issues, and the protocol was amended to switch the primary endpoint to 15-F2t isoprostane. Switching the primary endpoint could be considered a limitation, however, this practice is not infrequent in clinical trials.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Importantly, in this study, the change was performed before unblinding and was reviewed by the IMC, IRB, and Food and Drug Administration. 15-F2t isoprostane may represent a more appropriate endpoint for assessing oxidative stress in clinical trials as it is not affected by collection time, sample volume, or long-term storage and can be reliably quantified.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Nevertheless, there is evidence that 15-F2t isoprostane concentration may be influenced by age, sex, and exercise, as well as dietary and lifestyle factors.<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> In this study, age and sex did not affect 15-F2t isoprostane concentration and were therefore not included in the final statistical model. To address potential confounding, future trials that assess 15-F2t isoprostane should consider monitoring for habitual changes in diet and exercise, prior to and during intervention. Nonambulatory individuals were excluded from this study, owing to the requirement of 6MWT completion. Future studies assessing oxidative stress in <italic toggle="yes">RYR1</italic>-RMâaffected individuals should consider enrolling nonambulatory individuals to determine the potential benefits of antioxidant therapy in those with greater clinical severity. The absence of a statistically significant treatment effect may also have been due to the limited sample size.</p>
              <p>NAC was safe and well-tolerated in the <italic toggle="yes">RYR1</italic>-RM population at the dose provided. <italic toggle="yes">RYR1</italic>-RMâaffected individuals had elevated lipid peroxidation and disrupted redox equipoise; however, this was not rescued following 6 months of NAC treatment at the stated doses. This study provides Class I evidence that, for individuals with <italic toggle="yes">RYR1</italic>-RM, treatment with oral NAC does not decrease oxidative stress as measured by 15-F2t isoprostane. <italic toggle="yes">RYR1</italic>-RMâaffected individuals also had decreased physical endurance, as measured by 6MWT distance. Although this did not significantly change with NAC intervention, 6MWT distance did approach a clinically meaningful improvement in NAC-treated participants. This study, comprising a natural history assessment and randomized controlled trial, provided information on feasibility of recruitment for trials in this rare disease population, stability of disease course in ambulatory individuals over a 6-month time frame, descriptive statistics of a broad range of endpoints in <italic toggle="yes">RYR1</italic>-RMâaffected individuals to power future trials, and identification of a biomarker of oxidative stress suggesting lipid peroxidation as a promising therapeutic target.</p>
