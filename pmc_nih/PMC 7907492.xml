                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Herpes zoster may significantly impact quality of life (QoL) in older adults. The recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) is efficacious in adults aged ≥50 and older and is associated with increased reactogenicity compared to placebo. We report here on the impact of reactogenicity of the second RZV dose on the QoL and physical functioning (PF) of vaccine recipients, and summarize findings following both doses.</p>

                <sec id="s0101">
                  <title>Method</title>
                  <p>In this single-arm study, 401 adults aged ≥50 and older were enrolled to receive two RZV doses 2 months apart. Change in mean Short Form Survey-36 (SF-36) PF and EuroQol-5 Dimension (EQ-5D) scores, reactogenicity, safety, productivity loss, and healthcare resource utilization were evaluated.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>In total, 391 (97.5%) participants received dose 2. Post-dose 2, the most common solicited local symptoms were injection site pain (75.1%), erythema (22.4%), and swelling (13.9%), and the most common systemic symptoms were fatigue (46.3%), headache (37.5%), and myalgia (32.9%). Grade 3 solicited (local and systemic) adverse events were reported by 61 (15.6%) participants and were associated with a transient clinically significant decrease in SF-36 PF score on Days 1–2 post-dose 2 that recovered by Day 3. Overall, no clinically important reduction in mean SF-36 PF scores was observed from baseline to post-dose 2 (mean change −0.4), and no quality-adjusted-life-year loss was recorded.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>Overall, QoL and PF of RZV vaccinees were not affected by vaccine-related reactogenicity. A transient reduction was observed in the first 2 days after RZV vaccination in individuals with Grade 3 adverse events. No safety concerns were identified.</p>

            <p>Herpes zoster (HZ) consists in a vesicular dermatomal rash associated with pain resulting from the reactivation of latent varicella zoster virus (VZV) (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The increased risk of HZ in older adults correlates with a decline in VZV-specific T cell-mediated immunity associated with immunosenescence and the presence of some chronic medical conditions and immune-suppressive illnesses or therapies (<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). HZ and its complications significantly impact patients’ quality of life (QoL) and activities of daily living (ADL), as well as the life of their partners and caregivers (<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3–6</xref>).</p>
            <p>Two types of vaccines are licensed to prevent HZ and associated complications in adults ≥50 years of age, single-dose live-attenuated HZ vaccines and a two-dose adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine (<italic>Shingrix</italic>, RZV; GSK). RZV demonstrated efficacy &gt;90% in preventing HZ in older adults (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) and proved cost-effective from both a payer and societal perspective (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). The estimated vaccine efficacy in reducing HZ burden of illness and HZ burden of interference was greater than 90% in both the ZOE-50 and the pooled ZOE-70 analyses (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Pivotal phase III trials conducted in approximately 30,000 adults aged 50 years or older (randomized 1:1 to receive either RZV or placebo) reported Grade 3 solicited or unsolicited events (preventing normal daily activities) for 17.0% (ZOE-50) and 11.9% (ZOE-70) of RZV recipients, after the two-dose schedule (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p>
            <p>The primary objective of the present study was to assess the impact of RZV-related reactogenicity on the QoL of recipients by evaluating the change in Short Form Survey-36 (SF-36) Physical Functioning (PF) scale score from pre- to post-each RZV dose. Secondary objectives included RZV-related changes in (i) SF-36 PF single item scores, (ii) SF-36 role physical scores, (iii) Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY), (iv) healthcare resource utilization, (v) work loss by participants and non-dedicated caregivers, (vi) extra work for dedicated caregivers, and (vii) occurrence, intensity, causality and duration of adverse events (AEs). Results of this study will assist Health Care Professionals in informing their patients about the potential impact of vaccine reactogenicity on their QoL, which may affect patients’ decision to receive RZV.</p>
            <p>We recently reported the QoL and daily functioning of participants in this study following the first RZV dose. Overall, no clinically significant negative impact was observed, though, as expected, a transient clinically important decrease in daily SF-36 PF score (affecting activities such as walking, carrying groceries, climbing stairs) was recorded on Days 1–2 post-first dose for participants experiencing Grade 3 solicited AEs (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Here, we present the QoL and PF results, along with safety findings, following the second vaccine dose and provide an overview of the impact of RZV reactogenicity on participants’ daily physical activities after receiving both doses.</p>

                <p>This was a phase III, single-arm, open-label clinical trial conducted in 13 centers in the United States from 16 January 2017 to 24 May 2018 (NCT02979639). Participants were men and women aged ≥50 and older at enrollment, who provided written informed consent before the study start. Each participant was to receive two 0.5 mL intramuscular doses of RZV on Day 0 and Day 60.

                <p>Systemic AEs (fatigue, fever, gastrointestinal symptoms, headache, myalgia, shivering) were recorded prior to vaccination on Days −7 and 0. For 7 days following each vaccination (Days 1–7 post-dose 1 and 61–67 post-dose 2), participants recorded solicited local (injection site pain, redness, swelling) and systemic AEs on diary cards. Unsolicited AEs were recorded for 30 days following each vaccination. Serious adverse events (SAEs) and potential immune-mediated diseases (pIMDs) were recorded over the entire study period from the receipt of the first dose until 12 months following administration of the second dose. The intensity of all AEs was graded from 1 to 3, where a Grade 3 event was defined as diameter &gt;100 mm (injection site redness and swelling), temperature &gt;39.0°C (fever), and “preventing normal activity” (all other events). <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S1</xref> summarizes the intensity scale used for AEs grading. All solicited local symptoms were considered as causally related to vaccination; the causality of all other AEs was assessed by the investigator.</p>

                <title>QoL Assessments</title>
                <p>Two health surveys, SF-36 (<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) and EuroQol-5 Dimension (EQ-5D) (<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), utilized during this trial have been described elsewhere (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Briefly, the SF-36 comprises 36 questions, with answers aggregated to generate eight scales with values ranging from 0 to 100 are derived for PF, Role Physical, Bodily Pain, Systemic Health, Vitality, Social Function, Role Emotional, and Mental Health. Higher scores represent greater QoL; mean change from pre-vaccination of 3.3 in PF score was considered to be clinically relevant based on the minimal clinical importance threshold defined by Angst et al. (<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). EQ-5D defines health in terms of mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. These five items are converted to provide a single index utility score, where a higher score represents a better QoL. Both questionnaires were completed at the study center at Day −7 (7 days pre-dose 1), Day 0 (before receiving dose 1), Day 7 (7 days post-dose 1), Day 60 (before receiving dose 2), and Day 67 (7 days post-dose 2). All participants also completed the PF component of the SF-36 and the entire EQ-5D questionnaire at home on a daily basis for 6 days post-dose 1 and post-dose 2. For dose 2 analysis, baseline values for individual participants were calculated as the mean of the Day −7, Day 0, and Day 60 assessment scores. The mean post-dose 2 scores were defined as the mean of the seven assessment scores recorded from Days 61–67. The changes from pre- to post-dose 2 were calculated on an individual basis, as the difference between the mean post-dose 2 score and baseline score. The participants thereby served as their own control (ie, by using each participants’ own pre-vaccination values).</p>

                <p>Daily diary cards captured self-reported healthcare resource utilization associated with reactogenicity, including medication for related AEs and medically attended visits and consultations as a result of reactogenicity. On Day 7 post-vaccination, participants self-reported vaccine-related lost productivity, which included missed time from work by employed participants and non-dedicated caregivers and extra work expended by dedicated caregivers.</p>

                <title>Statistical Analyses</title>
                <p>A sample size of 360 participants was considered necessary to generate an estimate of the mean PF scores change with a precision of 2.2 (<italic>SD</italic> of 21.2). Assuming a non-evaluable proportion of approximately 10% of participants, a total of 400 individuals were planned to be enrolled in the study. Reactogenicity and safety assessment was performed on the total vaccinated cohort (TVC), which included all vaccinated participants. The percentage of participants with at least one solicited (local and systemic) and unsolicited AE, SAE, and pIMD was calculated with exact 95% confidence interval (CI). The QoL analysis was also carried out on the TVC. The eight SF-36 scales and the EQ-5D utility scores were presented by age category and overall. The SF-36 PF scores were also presented by gender, frailty status (categorized as non-frail, pre-frail, and frail), AE type, and reactogenicity grade. The SF-36 PF individual items were presented over time by reactogenicity grade in a <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis and the change from baseline for each item was presented by frailty status also in a <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis. The EQ-5D QALY loss was analyzed by age, frailty status, AE type, and reactogenicity grade. The EQ-5D utility scores were assessed overall and in <italic>post hoc</italic> analyses by reactogenicity grade. Details of the development of the frailty assessment are presented elsewhere (<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). The QALY loss was estimated using the area-under-the-curve method, where area under the curve was calculated using the trapezoidal rule (<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). All statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.2.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>In this study, we examined both the frequency of AEs following vaccination and the impact of reactogenicity on the QoL of study participants. Very high second-dose compliance by participants was observed, and nearly all returned their symptom sheets. The pattern of reactogenicity was similar to that reported after the first RZV vaccination (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) and is also in line with the reactogenicity profile observed in the two large pivotal efficacy studies, that enrolled a much larger population than the current study, thus providing more robust results with respect to the frequency of AEs (<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Consistently across studies, injection site pain was the most frequently reported solicited local AE and fatigue, headache, and myalgia were the most frequent solicited systemic AEs after each dose (<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Frequency of all-grade solicited systemic AEs tended to be higher after dose 2 compared to dose 1.</p>
              <p>Overall, no reductions of more than 3.3 (threshold of minimal clinically important difference (<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15)</xref>) in the mean SF-36 PF scores were observed post-each dose. Overall mean change of SF-36 PF score was +1.9 from pre-vaccination to post-dose 1 (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) and -0.4 from baseline to post-dose 2. A transient but clinically meaningful decrease in mean daily SF-36 PF score from baseline to post-second vaccination was recorded for participants reporting Grade 3 solicited AEs. A similar trend was also observed post-dose 1 (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Considering the definition of Grade 3 (preventing normal daily activities), this observation was not unexpected. Changes in other SF-36 scales from baseline to post-dose 2 were small, suggesting a minimal impact of RZV vaccination on PF and other QoL parameters.</p>
              <p>Overall, no QALY loss associated with RZV vaccination was observed, although transient QALY daily losses were observed in participants with Grade 3 reactogenicity. The overall estimated QALY loss per vaccine recipient was 0.000064 post-dose 1 (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) and 0.00012 post-dose 2. The higher QALY loss post-dose 2 versus post-dose 1 is consistent with the incidence of Grade 3 reactogenicity after the first and second doses in this study. In comparison with the results presented here, a recent study reported that reactogenicity after an adjuvanted monovalent influenza A vaccine resulted in a QALY loss of 0.00011 (<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), similar to that observed in the present study. By contrast, it has been previously reported that QALY losses due to HZ, including postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), ranged from 0.021 to 0.22 (<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>).</p>
              <p>Five of 391 recipients receiving the second vaccine dose sought medical attention for reactogenicity and 13 reported work loss. In comparison, three out of 401 participants sought medical attention and five reported missing work due to reactogenicity symptoms following the first dose (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). No non-dedicated caregivers missed work and no extra work for dedicated caregivers was recorded after either dose. Previous studies indicated that most affected employees undergo work loss or impaired productiveness due to HZ and PHN symptoms with an average duration of work loss ranging between 27 and 116 hours per employed person (<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23–25</xref>); caregivers have also reported lost work due to an HZ episode (<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Taken together with the QALY data reported above, these data demonstrate that the benefits of vaccination in preventing disease greatly outweigh any impact of reactogenicity.</p>
              <p>The limitations of this study include the open study design, lack of a control group, and a “response shift” phenomenon (<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), as increases in mean SF-36 PF scores were predominantly observed in participants with Grade 0 reactogenicity. In the absence of data on clinically meaningful change of PF scores following vaccination, the threshold of 3.3 determined in patients with osteoarthritis was used in this study. One of the strengths of the study is the thorough evaluations of the pre-vaccination period, that is, allowing for a more precise definition of baseline (mean of the Day −7, Day 0, and Day 60 assessment scores). Other strengths of the study are the high compliance (97.5%) receiving the second dose, the high proportion (99.5%) of participants returning the diary cards completed by Day 67 and the high compliance in returning QoL surveys (98.2% of the participants from Day 61 to Day 66, and 74.4% of the participants on Day 67).</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>Overall, the QoL and PF of adults ≥50 years were not affected by vaccine-related reactogenicity experienced after RZV dose 1 and dose 2; as expected, a transient, clinically meaningful impact was observed in adults who reported Grade 3 solicited AEs. No safety concerns were reported in this study. The observed safety and reactogenicity are consistent with the previously published profile of RZV. The results of the study suggest that the benefits of preventing HZ, acute HZ episode-associated pain, and PHN through vaccination outweigh the minimal and transient loss in PF and QoL caused by vaccine-related reactogenicity.</p>
