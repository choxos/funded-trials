              <p id="Par2">Viral lower airway infections are common in infants and preschool children, and the severity respiratory symptoms can vary from mild cough and congestion to respiratory failure requiring endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. We cannot predict which children will recover quickly versus those who will progress to severe ARDS. No ARDS-specific pharmacological treatments exist, rather treatment is supportive using lung-protective ventilation strategies and the administration of antibiotics for suspected bacterial infection. The study of immune regulation in children is needed because both the lung and immunity are maturing during this critical stage of development and the primary cause of PARDS is direct lung injury due to infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par3">ARDS is characterized by refractory hypoxemia and non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema due to damage to the lung epithelium and pulmonary endothelium. In adults with ARDS increased counts of airway neutrophils are associated with more severe lung injury and mortality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Airway neutrophils from adults with ARDS have enhanced survival, a primed respiratory burst response, and increased phagocytic capacity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. In patients with pulmonary diseases characterized by chronic bacterial infections, such as cystic fibrosis, airway neutrophils inhibit T-cell function via two pathways — by depletion of arginine following degranulation and activation of Arginase-1 (Arg1), and by activation of the programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1)/programmed death-1 (PD-1) axis, resulting in reduced proliferation and impaired effector functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. By contrast, pulmonary environmental influence on immune cell regulation is poorly characterized in PARDS due to the lack of a model system able to recapitulate the airway neutrophil phenotype in severe paediatric lung injury.</p>
              <p id="Par4">Clinical information obtainable at the bedside is often used to prognosticate yet is insufficient for determining the pathobiology of the lung injury. Understanding the biology of neutrophils recruited to the lung during PARDS is crucial for advancing prognostication, risk stratification, and development of novel therapeutic strategies for children who progress to severe PARDS. Herein we hypothesized that markers of degranulation on the surface of airway neutrophils and in the cell-free airway fluid within 24-hours of intubation would be associated with bacterial respiratory co-infection. We used an <italic>in vitro</italic> model based on blood neutrophil transepithelial migration into the airway fluid of endotracheally intubated children with suspected or confirmed lower airway viral infections at risk for progressing to or with PARDS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. We hypothesized that neutrophils recruited to the cell-free airway fluid of children with bacterial coinfections would have a defective respiratory burst and ability to kill bacteria compared to children with no bacterial coinfection.</p>

                <title>Human subjects</title>
                <p id="Par5">This prospective observational study was performed in the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) at Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta at Egleston from January to April 2018. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Emory University, and we confirm that all research was performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. Informed consent was obtained from the parents of all subjects prior to collection and use of their samples.</p>
                <p id="Par6">All patients greater than 48 hours of age, with a corrected gestational age of at least 40 weeks, who were 18 years old or younger admitted to the PICU, and who met criteria for being at risk or having PARDS as defined by the Pediatric Acute Lung Injury Consensus Conference (PALICC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> were screened for eligibility. To be enrolled in the study, children had to have lung injury within 7 days of a known clinical insult, new infiltrate(s) consistent with acute pulmonary parenchymal disease on chest imaging and be receiving oxygen delivered either non-invasively or invasively to maintain an oxygen saturation in the 88–97% range. Respiratory viral infections were confirmed by respiratory viral polymerase chain reaction testing as ordered at the discretion of the primary medical team caring for the patient. Although a viral infection may have been suspected, not all patients had clinical identification of the virus by laboratory testing.</p>
                <p id="Par7">Children were excluded if they had any perinatal related lung disease, respiratory failure fully explained by cardiac failure or fluid overload, chronic respiratory failure with mechanical ventilation via a tracheostomy or RAM cannula, confirmed immunodeficiency disorder, immunosuppression from chemotherapy for an oncologic process, chronic immunosuppression in a bone marrow transplant or solid organ transplant recipient, no parent or legal guardian present to provide written informed consent, or the attending physician did not wish the patient to participate in the study.</p>

Variables included demographics; fraction inspired oxygen, mean airway pressure, arterial oxygen saturation or arterial oxygen pressure used to calculate an oxygen saturation index (OSI) or oxygenation index (OI), respectively; laboratory and microbiology results; length of mechanical ventilation and need for reintubation; length of PICU stay, use of high frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO); and vital status. Severity of illness was determined by the Pediatric Risk of Mortality (PRISM)-III and Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction (PELOD) scores were calculated within 24 hours of PICU admission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Need for mechanical ventilation to 28-days was monitored to calculate ventilator-free days<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Lung injury severity was categorized according to PALICC criteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> as follows: At Risk = OI &lt; 4 (OSI &lt; 5); Mild = 4 ≤ OI &lt; 8 (5 ≤ OSI &lt; 7.5); Moderate = 8 ≤ OI &lt; 16 (7.5 ≤ OSI &lt; 12.3); Severe = OI ≥ 16 (OSI ≥ 12.3).</p>

                <title>Blood and tracheal aspirate sample collections</title>
                <p id="Par9">A 4 mL blood specimen was collected in a K-EDTA vacutainer (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) within 24 hours of endotracheal intubation for children weighing greater than 6 kg who had either an arterial or central venous catheter. Serial blood samples were collected every other day for up to one week, and then weekly thereafter, for the duration of mechanical ventilation and/or the presence of either an arterial or central venous catheter. Assays for neutrophil activation were performed within an hour of blood collection and cells were kept at 4 °C until the assay was performed.</p>
                <p id="Par10">Tracheal aspirates were obtained from patients on conventional mechanical ventilation by instilling 1–5 mL of sterile saline through the inline Ballard suction catheter and into a sterile Luken’s trap as part of routine suctioning. Serial tracheal aspirate samples were collected every other day for up to one week, and then weekly thereafter, for the duration of mechanical ventilation. There was no weight limit below which a tracheal aspirate could be obtained on a patient. Children who were mechanically ventilated with high frequency oscillation ventilation were suctioned only if clinically indicated and approved by the attending physician. Tracheal aspirate samples were immediately placed on ice for transport to the laboratory for processing.</p>

                <p id="Par11">Blood was spun at 400 × g to separate cells from platelet-rich plasma. Plasma was spun at 3,000 × g to generate platelet-free plasma, aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C. Pelleted blood cells were resuspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) with 2.5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) up to the original whole blood volume for flow cytometry analysis or for neutrophil purification, as described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Neutrophils were purified by negative selection from PBS-EDTA-washed whole blood using the EasySep Direct Human Neutrophil Isolation kit (STEMCELL Technologies Inc., Cambridge, MA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.</p>
                <p id="Par12">Tracheal aspirate was gently dissociated using repeated passage through an 18 G needle after the addition of 6 ml of PBS-EDTA. Dissociated tracheal aspirate was then centrifuged at 800 × g to generate a cell pellet and a fluid fraction.

The range of respiratory burst intensity at rest and after fMLF and PMA stimulation is illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">E5A–D</xref>, with some patients demonstrating blood neutrophils that are primed to respond to fMLF and some that are not (Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">E5C,D</xref>).</p>
                <p id="Par28">Surface expression of CD16 and CD62L were measured on neutrophils from patient blood obtained within 24 hours of intubation, at rest and following stimulation with fMLF or PMA. Neutrophils that shed CD62L and have high CD16 expression have been previously associated with an immunosuppressive phenotype, while neutrophils with low levels of both CD62L and CD16 are considered immature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. We did not observe elevated percentages of either of these immunosuppressive or immature neutrophil populations in our patients on Days 1 and 3 (Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">E5E</xref>).

              <p id="Par31">Blood neutrophils recruited to the lungs of children at risk of or with PARDS due to lower airway viral infections are generally believed to rapidly die therein, leading to the passive release of HNE and other toxic by-products that promote lung injury<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. In contrast with this conventional paradigm, the findings presented here support the notion that a large population of neutrophils remains viable and undergo profound changes upon recruitment to the airways of these patients. Viable airway neutrophils demonstrated surface mobilization of multiple sets of granules, and lose surface expression of CD16, a key phagocytic receptor. Furthermore, airway neutrophils increased expression of HLA-DR, typically associated with professional antigen-presenting cells, thus reflecting functional changes. To further investigate this process, we adapted an airway inflammation model developed in our group to study diseases of chronic lung inflammation (CF, asthma, COPD) to acute lung inflammatory processes occurring in children with acute respiratory failure due to lower airway infections. This model allowed for transepithelial recruitment and pathological conditioning of neutrophils by cell-free patient airway fluid and recapitulated cardinal features of airway neutrophils collected from these patients <italic>in vivo</italic>. In addition, we identified an association between active HNE exocytosis and bacterial coinfections within 24 hours of endotracheal intubation in these patients and observed that neutrophils recruited to the cell-free airway fluid of patients coinfected with bacteria become deficient in their respiratory burst capacity and in their ability to kill bacteria.</p>
              <p id="Par32">HNE is a serine protease contained in primary granules, and elevated levels in bronchoalveolar lavage and plasma are associated with severity of lung injury in ARDS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. While extracellular HNE can reflect live neutrophil activation and degranulation, in the tracheal aspirate both necrotic and neutrophils releasing neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) may also contribute to increased extracellular levels of HNE, thus precluding the use of extracellular HNE activity as a stringent marker of live neutrophil degranulation. Elevated levels of MMP-9 in the lung epithelial lining fluid of patients with ARDS has also been associated with increased severity of lung injury<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Primary granule exocytosis in airway compared to blood neutrophils is evidenced by the increase in CD63 expression in addition to decreases in CD16 and CD35 expression as the latter proteins contain HNE and MMP cleavage sites and may also be removed by membrane reuptake<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. While CD62L downregulation is expected, CD16 expression is generally increased upon transmigration due to degranulation of secretory vesicles and tertiary granules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>; however, CD16 can be downregulated if endocytosed and cleaved by high activity levels of HNE and MMP-9<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Secondary granule exocytosis in airway neutrophils is evidenced by an increase in CD66b expression compared to blood neutrophils. Whether this abnormal activation response can be leveraged therapeutically remains unclear. Indeed, HNE inhibitors, such as sivelestat, have failed to improve mortality in ARDS patients likely due to competing proteases, release of other damage-associated molecular pattern molecules and alarmins, and the immunomodulatory effects of neutrophils on T-cells in the airways of ARDS patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. Significant differences in neutrophil activation markers between the blood and airway compartments observed in our patient population is consistent with prior studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Our results highlight the importance of studying the airway fluid and cells recruited therein, rather than simply inferring airway neutrophil behavior and function based on cells isolated from blood.</p>
              <p id="Par33">Neutrophil priming by agents such as GM-CSF, tumor necrosis factor α or lipopolysaccharide delay apoptosis of neutrophils at sites of inflammation and increase their degranulation and respiratory burst responses to an activating agent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Interestingly, one of the roles assigned to the healthy pulmonary vasculature is to selectively retain primed neutrophils, deprime and release them into the bloodstream<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. This depriming mechanism may be dysfunctional in ARDS, resulting in release of primed neutrophils into the systemic vasculature that can damage extra-pulmonary organs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Migration of healthy donor neutrophils through our small airway epithelial model primes these neutrophils to undergo a respiratory burst; however, migration to ASN with high NE activity had an attenuated respiratory burst upon fMLF stimulation. The decreased respiratory burst in the presence of HNE-rich ASN from bacterially coinfected patients may serve as rapidly assessed biomarker of bacterial coinfection. The mechanism to explain the poor killing of <italic>H</italic>. <italic>influenzae</italic> and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> by neutrophils transmigrated to HNE-rich ASN in our model, which is associated with the clinical outcome of a bacterial coinfection, remains to be explored. An increase in relative Arg1 gene transcript levels has been shown in blood neutrophils from ARDS patients relative to healthy volunteers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> consistent with our finding of an upregulation in Arg1 surface expression in neutrophils transmigrated to bacterial coinfected ASN. The influence of other immunoregulatory pathways, such as the PD-L1/PD-1 axis, are under investigation as a possible mechanism to explain bacterial coinfection in some children for viral induced respiratory failure.</p>
              <p id="Par34">While our transepithelial neutrophil migration model sets up the possibility for controlled studies of the fate of neutrophils in PARDS patients, we acknowledge several limitations. First, we did not perform full functional analyses on primary airway neutrophils due to limited cellular material from patients. Instead, we used cell surface markers of activation as a proxy to inform how well our transepithelial migration model compared to the changes seen in blood and airway neutrophils from patients. In addition, most of our experimental data comes from the transepithelial migration model which recapitulates the small airways – respiratory generation 8 to 16. The tracheal aspirates from the patients were actually collected from airway generation 1 to 2; however, bronchoalveolar lavage of children is not commonly performed unless needed for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes for severe lung injury. Second, we are limited in our ability to collect blood samples from children with a weight under 6 kg or without a central venous or arterial catheter for blood sampling, which made paired comparisons between blood and airway neutrophils from each patient impossible. Nevertheless, despite our limited numbers of patients, we sampled enough patients to identify significant differences in activation and immunomodulatory markers on neutrophils. Although we previously showed differential neutrophil behavior comparing hypertonic saline-induced sputum cells from CF patients and healthy adults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, we were not able to include controls in this study owing to ethical limitations on obtaining non-clinically indicated airway lavage samples on children intubated for elective surgeries. In addition, children intubated for airway protection, rather than for respiratory failure due to a pulmonary cause, do not have neutrophil-rich airway lavage samples making a direct comparison of cellular material impossible to perform. Instead, we focused on serial blood and airway compartment sampling over time in the PICU to profile how neutrophils change such that each patient may act as their own control in future studies. While children in this study ranged in age from 9 days to 16 years, the majority were under 2 years of age limiting comparisons of neutrophil behavior stratified by age. Finally, patients included in this study were infected with a variety of respiratory viruses and due to limited sample size, we cannot determine the effect of any one virus on airway neutrophil behavior or susceptibility to bacterial coinfection. Despite the infectious heterogeneity of our limited number of samples, we were able to detect a significant neutrophil dysfunction signal in the presence of an activated neutrophil environment.</p>
              <p id="Par35">In summary, our study highlights phenotypic differences between airway and blood neutrophils in patients at risk of or with PARDS due to lower respiratory tract viral infections with or without bacterial coinfection, emphasizing the need to study compartment-specific behaviors of neutrophils. In addition, we showed that bacterial coinfections on Day 1 of illness may be predicted using markers of neutrophil granule release, immunomodulatory proteins, and metabolic activities, which may inform antimicrobial treatment of patients. Finally, we showcased a novel <italic>in vitro</italic> transmigration model to study airway neutrophil function following recruitment to and conditioning by patient cell-free airway fluid, laying critical foundations for future mechanistic and therapeutic studies of airway neutrophils in PARDS.</p>
