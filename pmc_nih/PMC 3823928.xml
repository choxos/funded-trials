                  <p>The EHR algorithm that identifies MS patients has an area under the curve of 0.958, 83% sensitivity, 92% positive predictive value, and 89% negative predictive value when a 95% specificity threshold is used.

                  <p>Incorporation of sophisticated codified and narrative EHR data accurately identifies MS patients and provides estimation of a well-accepted indicator of MS severity that is widely used in research settings but not part of the routine medical records.

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>With the increasing integration of electronic health records (EHR) into routine clinical care, there is an emerging interest in harnessing the wealth of EHR data for clinical research that ultimately improve patient care. Optimal use of EHR data for clinical research that would ultimately improve patient outcomes requires efficient extraction of meaningful information from codified data (e.g., demographics, billing codes for diagnoses and procedures, laboratory results, electronic prescriptions) and narrative data (e.g., clinical encounter notes, imaging reports) to accurately identify patient cohorts and measure clinically relevant outcomes <xref rid="pone.0078927-Kohane1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0078927-Jensen1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. The prevailing approach that relies exclusively on administrative billing codes can be limited in accuracy and may miss relevant phenotypes <xref rid="pone.0078927-Quan1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. The growing availability and functionality of the EHR system together with advances in natural language processing (NLP) and bioinformatics methods that are essential for extracting meaningful clinical information from the EHR data have converged to enable efficient and cost-effective development of EHR-derived patient cohorts and large-scale assessment of phenotypes relevant to patient care <xref rid="pone.0078927-Kohane1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0078927-Jensen1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0078927-Murphy1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Our group has built a framework <xref rid="pone.0078927-Kohane2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0078927-Murphy2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0078927-Murphy3" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> to successfully leverage EHR for research in diseases such as asthma <xref rid="pone.0078927-Himes1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, depression <xref rid="pone.0078927-Perlis1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, inflammatory bowel disease <xref rid="pone.0078927-Ananthakrishnan1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, and rheumatoid arthritis <xref rid="pone.0078927-Carroll1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0078927-Kurreeman1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0078927-Liao1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0078927-Liao2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. In parallel, important work led by the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network has further demonstrated the broad potential of EHR-based approaches in discovery and clinical research <xref rid="pone.0078927-Ritchie1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0078927-Newton1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0078927-Kho1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.</p>
              <p>Neurological research leveraging the EHR data is just emerging <xref rid="pone.0078927-Ritchie1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, in part because the complexity of neurological diseases creates challenges in deriving relevant disease outcomes not available from routine clinical encounters. Using multiple sclerosis (MS) as a proof of principle, we set out to develop a potentially generalizable informatics approach that would enable EHR research in neurological diseases. MS typically consists of a relapsing-remitting inflammatory phase and, in many patients, an underlying progressive neurodegenerative course that makes this demyelinating disease of the central nervous system a leading cause of neurological disability in younger adults <xref rid="pone.0078927-Compston1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. One of the best predictors of long-term neurological disability in MS is atrophy on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) <xref rid="pone.0078927-Bermel1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.</p>
              <p>Given that MS patients display heterogeneity in their disease course and the increasing options for MS treatment have reduced the number of patients on any specific medication, sample size is limited for conducting patient-oriented research in MS such as pharmaco-epidemiology or pharmacogenomic studies. Outcome data traditionally come from well-designed prospective cohorts, including the Comprehensive Longitudinal Investigation of MS at Brigham and Women’s Hospital (CLIMB) <xref rid="pone.0078927-Gauthier1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, which provided critical data for this study. While EHR-derived cohorts will not replace clinic or population-based studies, they capture a larger number of patients and provide unique and complementary features not found in traditional cohorts. Clinically relevant outcomes not easily attainable from routine medical records are crucial for research in EHR-derived cohorts. Here, we report a rigorous EHR-based informatics approach to (1) accurately identify MS patients and (2) provide a surrogate measure of disease severity in MS patients. Our study makes the first step towards realizing a major goal in personalized medicine: leveraging each individual’s unique, routinely collected health information to inform clinical outcome and improve patient care.</p>

                <title>EHR Algorithms for Classifying MS</title>
                <p>From the Partners HealthCare EHR system, we developed an EHR-based classification algorithm to identify MS patients (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078927-g001"><bold>Figure 1A</bold></xref> for summary of the overall approach). As a first step, we included any patient with at least one MS-related International Classification of Disease 9<sup>th</sup> edition (ICD-9) code (340, 323 or 341). Using these 22,610 patients, we created an “MS data mart” containing the complete medical records (as of February 2011) of all their visits to Partners HealthCare sites. Similar to our prior efforts to identify patients with rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease from the EHR system <xref rid="pone.0078927-Ananthakrishnan1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0078927-Liao1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, we generated a list of clinician expert-defined, MS-relevant codified and narrative variables from the EHR data for each patient. Variables are excluded if the frequency of occurrence in the data mart was 10% or less.</p>

                <p>Codified variables were derived from billing codes for diagnoses and procedures, demographic information and electronic prescriptions. For codified variables, we counted the number of occurrences per patient (e.g., ICD-9 code for MS, procedure code for MRI of the brain or cervical spine or orbit, electronic prescriptions for any of the MS disease-modifying medications). We also included derivatives of billing codes (e.g., annualized ICD-9 code for MS, proportion of the total ICD-9 codes in the EHR belonging to MS).</p>
                <p>Narrative variables on symptoms, signs, medications, MRI reports, and neurologist’s impression and treatment plan were extracted from free-text clinical narratives (outpatient notes, discharge summaries, imaging reports and pathology reports) using the clinical Text Analytics and Knowledge Extraction System (cTAKES) NLP system (ctakes.apache.org) <xref rid="pone.0078927-Savova1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, which parses the texts to identify clinically relevant concepts and the associated qualifying attributes (negated, non-negated). Two neurologists with subspecialty expertise in MS and neuroimmunology created a customized dictionary of MS-relevant terms based on their clinical experiences and further refined the dictionary after reviewing 60 randomly selected clinical notes or imaging reports from known MS patients that were annotated by cTAKES. Additional MS neurologists reviewed the list of narrative terms and provided feedback. The refined list of expert-defined terms were mapped to two health care terminology indices to allow for language variations: (1) Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (SNOMED-CT) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/Snomed/snomed_main.html">http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/Snomed/snomed_main.html</ext-link>) serves to organize terms for signs and symptoms, anatomical sites, disease terms and procedures; (2) RxNorm (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/rxnorm/">http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/rxnorm/</ext-link>) serves to organize terms for generic and brand name medications. For each narrative variable, we determined the sum of positive and negative mentions per patient.</p>
                <p>Based on an estimation of the number of subjects needed to develop a classification algorithm, 595 patients from the MS data mart were randomly selected for a training set to develop the MS-classifying algorithm. One neurologist reviewed the medical records of all patients in the training set to establish whether a patient had a definitive diagnosis of MS, which was supported by documentation in a neurologist’s clinical note or a relevant MRI report. We fit LASSO penalized logistic regression models with Bayesian Information Criterion <xref rid="pone.0078927-Zou1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> to select informative EHR variables for predicting MS diagnosis and estimated their regression parameters.</p>
                <p>To assess the performance of these MS-classifying models, we calculated the area under the curve (AUC) using a receiver operating characteristic analysis as well as sensitivity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) at 95% specificity. To correct for overfitting bias, the 0.632 bootstrap cross-validation was used to obtain bias corrected estimates of all performance parameters <xref rid="pone.0078927-Efron1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. The standard error estimates were obtained using a bootstrap procedure with 1,000 replicates. For all models, we selected a probability threshold corresponding to 95% specificity and classified patients with a probability exceeding the threshold value as having a definitive diagnosis of MS. The best algorithm was then applied to all 22,610 patients in the MS data mart to assign a probability of definitive MS for each patient and established an EHR-based cohort of MS patients. From this cohort, two neurologists reviewed the medical records of 100 randomly selected patients for independent validation of MS diagnosis.</p>

                <title>Multiple Sclerosis Center Patients</title>
                <p>A subset of the EHR-derived MS cohort receives neurological care at the Partners Multiple Sclerosis Center, including patients who are enrolled in CLIMB, an ongoing prospective natural-history cohort study <xref rid="pone.0078927-Gauthier1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. To develop EHR-based algorithms for brain volume and MS severity, we used the subset of MS patients with existing brain MRI and clinical outcomes collected prospectively and available from the MS Center database. These outcomes are collected separately from the EHR data. All patients met the revised McDonald diagnostic criteria for MS <xref rid="pone.0078927-Polman1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. We established an interface between the EHR system and the MS Center database to access data that are not available from routine medical records, including manually corrected brain parenchymal fraction (BPF), the multiple sclerosis severity score (MSSS), and MS disease category (relapsing-remitting, RR; secondary progressive, SP; primary progressive, PP). Disease outcome data are based on values collected at each patient’s last available visit as of August 2012. The supplemental text contains details on the neuroimaging approach and MSSS measure.</p>

Briefly, dual-echo proton density and T2-weighted axial images of 3-mm thick sections from routine clinical brain MRI scans on a 1.5 Tesla system were segmented using a semi-automated pipeline. MRI scans underwent quality control with manual correction of detected tissue misclassification to provide corrected BPF. For each patient, only the corrected BPF measure from the most recent brain MRI scan was used for algorithm development.</p>
                <p>MSSS is a method for quantifying MS disease severity in the course of MS, based on a single assessment of a clinical indicator of MS disability known as the Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score, adjusted for disease duration <xref rid="pone.0078927-Roxburgh1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Disease duration is defined as the time interval from the self-reported symptom onset to the recorded clinic encounter. Using EDSS and disease duration from the most recent clinic visit, we calculated the MSSS for each patient. We excluded any EDSS measures captured within the first two years of symptom onset, given that MSSS is not robust at this stage of the disease.</p>

                <title>EHR Algorithms for Deriving Brain Volume and Disease Severity in MS</title>
                <p>Using a list of expert-defined EHR variables (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0078927.s005">Table S1</xref></bold>) and existing brain MRI and clinical features, we develop algorithms for brain volume and MS disease severity. We included all patients with available BPF and MSSS after 2004 to maximize sample size. To reduce the confounding effects of race and ethnicity, which influence disease course <xref rid="pone.0078927-Cree1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, we only included patients with self-reported European ancestry (representing approximately 90% of the patients in the MS Center, n = 789 for BPF, n = 1,835 for MSSS).</p>
                <p>To develop EHR algorithms for BPF and MSSS, we took a double cross-validation approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078927-g001"><bold>Figure 1B</bold></xref>). Subjects are divided into a training (50%), test (30%) and validation (20%) subgroup. In the <italic>training</italic> set, we performed a 5-fold cross-validated stepwise regression to select EHR variables to be included in the algorithms. To avoid over-fitting the algorithms in the training set, we determined, in the independent <italic>test</italic> set, the magnitude of the beta coefficient (or the weight) of each EHR variable selected from the training set, to create the final algorithms. We applied the algorithms to the independent <italic>validation</italic> set to assess algorithm performance as measured by the correlation between algorithm-derived and corresponding known outcome (either BPF or MSSS) using R<sup>2</sup> adjusted for the number of variables. The entire process, starting with dividing the subjects into test, training and validation set, was repeated 100 times to obtain the mean R<sup>2</sup> for the BPF and MSSS algorithms.</p>
                <p>EHR variables that had a non-zero value in &lt;10% subjects were removed. In addition to EHR variables, we evaluated the algorithm performance when considering the following variables that are obtained from the MS Center database: age at first symptom, sex and disease duration for BPF, and age at first symptom and sex for MSSS. The details of determining the optimal frequency threshold for the EHR variables are described in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0078927.s010">text S1</xref> (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0078927.s006">Table S2</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0078927.s003">Figure S3</xref></bold>).</p>

The algorithm containing both codified and narrative variables exhibited superior performance (better sensitivity, PPV, NPV and accuracy) when compared with the other three versions of the MS classification algorithm: the model based only on the MS ICD-9 code (the prevailing approach), the codified data-only model and the NLP data-only model (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0078927-t001"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>).</p>

                <p>To address whether EHR data can be harnessed to provide clinically meaningful phenotypes, we studied a subset of the MS patients in the EHR-derived cohort who receive neurological care at an MS Center (“clinical cohort”). From the MS Center database, we obtained two types of MS disease course data that have been prospectively collected but are not available in routine medical records: (1) brain parenchymal fraction (BPF), a measure of whole brain volume derived from semi-automated segmentation of brain MRI scans with manual correction, (2) multiple sclerosis severity score (MSSS), a measure of disease severity and disability adjusted for disease duration.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Using a medical informatics framework and rigorous statistical methodology, our study showcases an approach that begins to harness routine EHR data for accurate identification of patients with a complex neurologic disease and for deriving a highly relevant clinical outcome heretofore only available in research studies. Specifically, our study leverages the EHR data of a large cohort of MS patients to provide the Multiple Sclerosis Severity Score, an important indicator of disease severity that is not part of routine medical records. Although the derived MSSS measure is not yet robust for research, this approach provides the first steps towards harnessing existing EHR data for patient-oriented research in neurological diseases that will enable exploration of the many unique features of the EHR data as EHR systems become widely adopted across the health care landscape.</p>
              <p>Our approach embraces the rich complexity of the EHR data. The incorporation of sophisticated codified data and NLP-extracted narrative data improved the performance of the EHR algorithm to identify MS patients when compared to the approach relying only on ICD-9 codes. With this approach, we established a cohort of 5,495 MS patients, including a subset that is part of a patient cohort based at MS Center. This unique “virtual cohort” enables analyses that integrate the new EHR-derived variables with traditional clinical research data. Further, we demonstrated that NLP-extracted narrative data are necessary for generating an informative estimate for MSSS. As a demonstration of its clinical relevance, EHR-derived MSSS captures the difference between the two main subgroups of MS patients: relapsing-remitting patients who generally recover neurological function after a relapse and progressive patients who experience decline in function. With future improvement in EHR data and informatics methods, we will enhance the MSSS algorithm (to reach at least R = 0.8) so that this surrogate measure may be potentially integrated into the EHR system to allow better monitor of patient outcomes and for research.</p>
              <p>EHR data did not contribute meaningfully to the performance of the BPF algorithm, which can be almost entirely explained by variables obtained from the clinical cohort database: age of first symptom and disease duration. This illustrates the limitation that EHR variables considered here are not sufficient to inform every pertinent outcome measure. To provide a surrogate of brain volume, critical information to supplement EHR data can be obtained using questionnaires to ascertain age of symptom onset and disease duration. Thus, integration of EHR data and data from clinical research tools such as questionnaires provides a path for future investigations that leverage the strengths of both approaches. Brain volume is not routinely measured in clinical care, but it is correlated with disease course and is an important research measure in MS. Surrogate measures of brain volume derived from these combined approaches could enable the exploration of hypotheses that cannot be effectively investigated at smaller sample sizes, despite the use of more accurate measures. In the future, we plan to enhance the algorithm development for whole brain volume by applying automated feature selection methods to the entire narrative text based on the medical ontology systems such as SNOMED-CT instead of only expert-selected EHR variables. Further, disease duration may be derived if the date of the first neurological symptom can be captured by more sophisticated NLP capability.</p>
              <p>Our study has two other limitations. First, our algorithms for MS were developed and tested within a single EHR system that links two major tertiary care hospitals and affiliates. We have not yet tested the portability of our algorithms. This is an important next step, as we will seek replication of the EHR algorithms for classifying MS and deriving MS disease outcomes in the EHR systems of other healthcare institutions. If proven portable, this approach promises efficient and cost-effective development of multi-center cohorts to address research questions highly relevant to neurological patients. It is reassuring that our group has developed a similar EHR algorithm for classifying rheumatoid arthritis and demonstrated its portability in two other academic medical centers with limited retraining of the algorithm <xref rid="pone.0078927-Carroll1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p>
              <p>The second limitation involves our current inability to finely dissect the temporal relationship between the EHR data and indicators of MS disease severity. Specifically, the EHR data used for algorithm development represent aggregate information as of the time of the MS data mart creation, and the latest available measures of BPF and MSSS from the MS Center clinical cohort do not necessarily occur after the aggregate information has been collected. Thus, our study demonstrated cross-sectional associations and should not be construed as predictive algorithms as this would imply that the EHR data occurred before the BPF or MSSS measures. As medical informatics technologies continue to improve the parsing of temporal relationships, truly predictive algorithms for brain volume and disease severity will emerge and be translated into the clinical arena to guide patient management.</p>
              <p>In the age of personalized medicine, EHR data provide another complementary layer of biomedical data. The challenge is to integrate EHR data with other data to improve patient care. Our study in MS showcases an informatics approach that harnesses routine EHR data to derive MSSS, a well-accepted and clinically meaningful disease measure heretofore available only in research studies. If replicated, our novel informatics approach will enable the development of multi-center cohorts and facilitate testing of a variety of new hypotheses leveraging the unique features of the EHR data to address MS disease activity, comorbidities, treatment response and presymptomatic disease. These efforts also hold the promise of establishing automated monitors of an individual patient’s disease trajectory using EHR and aiding clinician’s task of delivering more individualized patient management. Finally, while MS was used as a proof of principle in this study, our approach has the potential of being applied in other complex neurological diseases.</p>
