                <p>Transplantation of human neural stem/progenitor cells (hNSCs) as a regenerative cell replacement therapy holds great promise. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We, here, focused on the interaction between hNSCs and allogeneic peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in a co-culture model. We found that hNSCs significantly decrease the CD3<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, reduce the gamma delta T cells and increase the regulatory T cells, along with reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines and increased anti-inflammatory cytokines after co-culture. We also found that PBMCs, in turn, significantly promote the proliferation and differentiation of hNSCs. Our data suggest that hNSCs cross-talk with immune cells.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Neural stem/progenitor cells (NSCs) derived from human fetal forebrain [<xref rid="pone.0117432.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] or embryonic cells [<xref rid="pone.0117432.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] have the potential to reconstitute the damaged nervous tissues in some neurological disorders and traumatic nervous system lesion after being transplanted into the brain. The improvement of outcomes and recovery of functional deficits after transplantation of NSCs have been confirmed in numerous animal models for therapeutics of multiple sclerosis, Parkinsonâs disease, spinal cord injury, and ischemic stroke [<xref rid="pone.0117432.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117432.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117432.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117432.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p>
              <p>However, one of the major hurdles to cell therapy is how the hostâs immune system responds to transplanted cells. More often than not, an immune response is induced thus leading to rejection reactions to allogeneic NSCs [<xref rid="pone.0117432.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. A crucial step therefore, toward efficient clinical application of NSCs transplantation is to reveal the interaction between immune cells and expanded NSCs <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Interestingly, expanded NSCs <italic>in vitro</italic> displayed different levels of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I or class II, most likely owing to different culture conditions and tissue origin [<xref rid="pone.0117432.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Despite expressing MHC class I and II molecules as well as co-stimulatory molecules, human NSCs were shown not to induce an allogeneic T cell response <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0117432.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Thus, there was still a need to further elucidate the activation and differentiation of human NSCs (hNSCs) in the interaction with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), in which there are many kinds of immune cells. Here, we investigated if NSCs can induce proliferation and differentiation of T lymphocytes <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>
              <p>Conversely, it is also important to know whether T cells, which may potentially affect the function of NSCs in immunomodulation, could in turn influence the maturation, proliferation and differentiation of NSCs. Mezey et al [<xref rid="pone.0117432.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] suggested a link between the immune system and survival of NSCs stating that transplanted bone marrow cells could differentiate into mature neurons. The inflammatory response after ischemic stroke is known to induce reparative mechanisms including neurogenesis [<xref rid="pone.0117432.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Following insult-induced neurogenesis, subsequent events happen including the proliferation of NSCs, migration of neuroblasts, and survival and maturation of neurons <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0117432.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Despite that, the details of this link are still unclear.</p>
              <p>In addition to cell replacement therapy, in-depth studies have shown that transplanted NSCs play therapeutic roles through their migration into inflammatory sites and releasing neurotrophic and immunomodulatory factors to interact with immune cells, termed as âchaperone effectâ [<xref rid="pone.0117432.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117432.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117432.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Similarly, NSCs exert their beneficial effects not only by cell replacement but also by immunomodulation and trophic support [<xref rid="pone.0117432.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. It was reported that NSCs could inhibit inflammatory responses mediated by interleukin 2 (IL-2) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) [<xref rid="pone.0117432.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The secretion of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-Î²) could also down-regulate the proliferative response in mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) [<xref rid="pone.0117432.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, the current knowledge of underlying mechanisms by which NSCs modulate immune response is still limited.</p>
              <p>To identify the cross-talk of hNSCs with immune cells, we examined the fates of NSCs and T cells during co-culture. Our data showed that hNSCs were able to reduce the proportion of CD3<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes especially the CD8<sup>+</sup> and gamma delta T (Î³Î´T) lymphocyte subpopulations. We also found that hNSCs could significantly increase the proportion of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup>, and alter cytokine profiles involved in immune-modulation and inflammation.

                <p>Brain tissue from human first trimester (6â12 weeks of gestation; n = 12) was obtained following routine abortions by vacuum aspiration as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0117432.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The complete study was approved by the Human Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University and followed the guidelines of the US Public Health Service, which includes written informed consent from pregnant women. Standard health screens were performed before abortion. The human fetal forebrain tissues were mechanically dissociated under sterilized conditions into small cubes using steriled scissors and repeatedly pipetted using plastic Pasteur pipette in Neurobasal medium (Gibco, USA), then cell suspensions were filtrated through 400 strainer. The filtrated single cells were washed once and immediately seeded in 25 cm<sup>2</sup> culture flask (1 x10<sup>6</sup> cells) in NEF medium (consisting of a 1:1 mixture of Dulbeccoâs modified Eagleâs medium-F12 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 1% N2 supplement (Invitrogen); 0.5% B27 (Invitrogen); 25 mg/ml insulin (Sigma-Aldrich); 6 mg/ml glucose (Sigma-Aldrich); 5mM HEPES (Invitrogen); 20 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor (Sigma-Aldrich) and 20 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (Sigma-Aldrich)) [<xref rid="pone.0117432.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].

We found that aggregates of dividing cells derived from the human fetal forebrain could form neurospheres (about 3 days) and displayed small bright spheres (<xref rid="pone.0117432.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1A Fig.</xref>), which share some similar features with hNSCs.

              <p>In this study, we found evidence of the direct interaction between hNSCs and peripheral T lymphocytes. Firstly, hNSCs profoundly affected total CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells, in particular, subpopulations of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, Î³Î´T cells, and Tregs, along with decreased pro-inflammatory cytokines and increased anti-inflammatory cytokines, implying that hNSCs were able to modulate inflammatory responses induced by T cells <italic>in vitro</italic>. Secondly, the PBMCs in turn affected the proliferation and differentiation of hNSCs. Our data suggest that the immunomodulatory capacity of hNSCs is likely derived from their ability to selectively delete deleterious and support protective actions of inflammatory cells and cytokines.</p>
              <p>Our data was consistent with previous findings by Julia Knight [<xref rid="pone.0117432.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], which suggested that neural stem/progenitor cells can specifically reduce pro-inflammatory T subtypes in a contact-dependent manner and illuminated the immunomodulatory capacity of NSCs. In addition, we found that at both 5:1 and 1:1 ratio, Î³Î´T cells were profoundly decreased after co-culture with hNSCs compared to control group (<xref rid="pone.0117432.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C and 2D</xref>). Several studies confirm that CD3<sup>+</sup> T are involved in infiltration of inflammation [<xref rid="pone.0117432.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117432.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and Î³Î´T cells, which are a major source of IL-17 production <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0117432.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], induces neuronal damage in the brain [<xref rid="pone.0117432.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. No doubt, decrease of total CD3<sup>+</sup> and Î³Î´T cells reduces neuronal damage.</p>
              <p>T cells, particularly CD8<sup>+</sup> and Î³Î´T cells, are known to be critical T cell subsets associated with detrimental effects, while CD4<sup>+</sup> Th2 and CD4<sup>+</sup> Treg cells are associated with protective effects in the surrounding neural parenchyma after cerebral ischemia or degenerative diseases upon activation [<xref rid="pone.0117432.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Some reports proposed that the expression of MHC class molecules in NSCs can be strongly up-regulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0117432.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], whose immunogenicity can induce proliferative responses in T lymphocytes. Despite that, hNSCs share similar immunosuppressive characteristics with BMSCs and are known to have strong immune-suppressive properties on all cells of the immune system [<xref rid="pone.0117432.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Of note, we found that hNSCs did not induce the apoptosis but rather delete the proportion of total CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells (mostly CD8<sup>+</sup> subset) in a dose-dependent manner, showing immune inhibitory effect by hNSCs, consistent with results defined by Li [<xref rid="pone.0117432.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and Liu [<xref rid="pone.0117432.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Although the percentage of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells significantly increased in the cellâcell contact system in the presence of hNSCs for 3 days[<xref rid="pone.0117432.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], increased CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were likely Treg cells. This difference may be due to the different co-culture duration or other factors such as pre-incubation with IFN-Î³ and different immunogenicity of hNSCs with regards to its derivation of tissue and state of differentiation [<xref rid="pone.0117432.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p>
              <p>Furthermore, Tregs appear to be good candidates for cellular therapy, as they can prevent development of autoimmune diseases, tumor immunity, graft rejection, and graft-vs-host disease [<xref rid="pone.0117432.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Emerging evidence suggests that Tregs are involved in immunomodulation following mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) infusion [<xref rid="pone.0117432.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. It has been proved that Tregs can prevent secondary injury expansion and the depletion of Tregs increased delayed brain damage and deteriorated functional repair [<xref rid="pone.0117432.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. As for Î³Î´T cells, expanded Î³Î´T cells have been previously reported to exert a strong cytotoxic activity to plasma cell and melanoma cell lines [<xref rid="pone.0117432.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Based on the therapy of cell transplantation, IL-17-inducing Î³Î´T cells have been implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory lesions, in which Th1 cytokines and cytotoxic factors are thought to play a critical role [<xref rid="pone.0117432.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Our data now show that hNSCs can induce an increase of Tregs and a dramatic reduction of Î³Î´T cells. These findings suggest that hNSCs can modulate T cell subpopulations as shown in our previous published <italic>in vivo</italic> data[<xref rid="pone.0117432.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p>
              <p>Finally, our results show that hNSCs had no influence over the apoptosis of T cells when co-cultured, which is consistent with Einsteinâs work, showing that hNSCs do not directly induce T cell apoptosis, but rather inhibit T cell activation in a non-specific manner [<xref rid="pone.0117432.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Similarly, we found that PBMCs did not exert any influence over the apoptosis of hNSCs in the in a 2 day co-culture. Various groups have reported that PBMCs have an effect on the apoptosis of hNSCs and attributed it to the ratio of hNSCs vs. PBMCs, the differences of medium, manner, and co-culture durations. Further investigation into this phenomenon should be performed.</p>
              <p>hNSCs of fetal origin or derived from human ESC have the potential to differentiate into mature neurons after transplantation into the CNS[<xref rid="pone.0117432.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Others have confirmed that endogenous neurogenesis in the hippocampus is suppressed by lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation [<xref rid="pone.0117432.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117432.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], which means that the suppression of immune response can promote neuronal differentiation [<xref rid="pone.0117432.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Our data show that PBMCs affects hNSC proliferation and differentiation after their co-culture, where levels of hNSC special surface markers were increased, and so did the number of mature neurons and astrocytes. This phenomenon may be related to the suppression of immune response and the release of cytokines. Among those cytokines, IL-6 appears to play an important role in the fate of hNSCs [<xref rid="pone.0117432.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. It was reported [<xref rid="pone.0117432.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] that the proliferation of microglials promoted by hNSCs was involved in the increasing secretion of IL-6, which can, in turn, influence microglials in phenotype. Ideguchi [<xref rid="pone.0117432.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] and Gomi [<xref rid="pone.0117432.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] found that the IL-6 decreased the neuron:astrocyte ratio, and showed that the neutralizing antibody against IL-6 was able to abolish this effect. These all suggest that the proliferation of microglial cells is related to the increased levels of IL-6[<xref rid="pone.0117432.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Our results show increased IL-6 during co-culture of hNSCs with PBMCs and increased expression of GFAP, which is the surface marker of astrocytes, implying that there is a positive relationship between the increased level of IL-6 and the proliferation of astrocytes. TNF-Î± and IFN-Î³ have been shown to have dual effects on neurogenesis and neuronal differentiation [<xref rid="pone.0117432.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117432.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], and our data showing the decrease of IFN-Î³ in co-cultures may also explain the differentiation of hNSCs. The fact that hNPCs can migrate into the damaged CNS [<xref rid="pone.0117432.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117432.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] together with their chronic presence within the brain tissue may enhance neuroprotective effects and make cell transplantation therapies possible.</p>
              <p>Our data suggested that T cells affect proliferation of NSCs. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Some studies indicate that hNSCs suppress the activation of human T cells through cell to cell physical contact [<xref rid="pone.0117432.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117432.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Other studies indicated that hNSCs exert their modulatory effects by secreting an array of immunomodulatory cytokines and trophic support. The release of IL-6 can suppress neuronal differentiation and promote glial cell fate[<xref rid="pone.0117432.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] and upregulate other primary pro-inflammatory cytokines (for example, TNF-Î±, IL-2, IFN-Î³) thus rendering transplanted hNSCs being unable to fully differentiate[<xref rid="pone.0117432.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], while TGF-Î² and IL-10 secreted by hNSCs are considered to be neuroprotective [<xref rid="pone.0117432.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Whatever the underlying mechanism, it is now confirmed that hNSCs not only form neural cells for replacement, but also produce immunomodulatory and trophic molecules capable of promoting tissue repair [<xref rid="pone.0117432.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Our <italic>in vitro</italic> data show that anti-inflammatory cytokines TGF-Î², IL-10, and IL-4 were apparently increased and pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN-Î³ and IL-17 were reduced in the co-cultures. In addition, the levels of IL-6 were higher than control groups, which might be related to the differentiation of hNSCs. Inflammatory responses that take place following transplantation of stem cells after ischemia mostly involved immune cells like microglial cells and astrocytes [<xref rid="pone.0117432.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. These microglial cells are activated to secrete immune mediators, among which both astrocytes and microglial cells can secrete IL-6, IL-1Î², TNF-Î±, and other chemotactic factors [<xref rid="pone.0117432.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Although it was mostly reported that the level of IL-6 was decreased after cell transplantation or in co-cultures involving stem cells and T cells, there was a recent study that showed the increase of IL-6 release in co-cultures or microglial mono-cultures than hNSC mono-cultures [<xref rid="pone.0117432.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. This increased IL-6 release could be partially explained by the proliferation of astrocytes in co-cultures. Moreover, other factors that we did not investigate may also play vital roles in the process of immunomodulation. The production and release of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) by NSCs could also contribute to increased neuronal viability and improved neuro-functional deficits [<xref rid="pone.0117432.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>Taken together, our results demonstrated that hNSCs exert the character of suppression on inflammation by ridding detrimental and supporting beneficial inflammatory cells and mediators. Moreover, the suppression of inflammatory reactivity could promote neurogenesis and astrocytogenesis, and this result could be linked with the findings reported by Makoto [<xref rid="pone.0117432.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Our previous <italic>in vivo</italic> study showed that transplantation of hNSCs improved outcomes and promoted recovery of neuronal function from ischemia [<xref rid="pone.0117432.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Although hNSCs suppress inflammation and enhance neuronal viability to benefit function of injured CNS both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, the underlying mechanisms of hNSC immunomodulation thus need further studying.</p>
