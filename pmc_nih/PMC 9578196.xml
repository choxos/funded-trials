                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Studies have shown associations among food and activity behaviors and body weight of Latino fathers and adolescents. However, few Latino father-focused interventions have been designed to improve energy balance-related behaviors (EBRBs) and weight status among early adolescents. Thus, this efficacy study aims to evaluate the Padres Preparados, JÃ³venes Saludables (Padres) youth obesity prevention program for positive changes in EBRBs (fruit, vegetable, sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB), sweet/salty snack, and fast-food consumption, physical activity, and screen time) and weight status among low-income Latino fathers and adolescents (10-14âyears).</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">A two-arm (treatment versus delayed-treatment control group) randomized controlled trial was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of 8 weekly experiential learning sessions (2.5âhours each) based on social cognitive theory. The sessions included food preparation, parenting skills, nutrition, and physical activity. The program was delivered to father-adolescent dyads (mothers were encouraged to attend) in trusted community-based settings in a Midwest metropolitan area between 2017 and 2019. In March 2020, in-person implementation was discontinued due to COVID-19 pandemic restrictions, which limited the sample size. Father/adolescent dyads were randomized to treatment or control group within each site. Surveys and measurements were completed by fathers and adolescents to assess changes in food and activity behaviors from baseline to post-intervention. Adolescents also completed 24-hour dietary recall interviews at baseline and post-intervention. Intervention effects were assessed using linear regression mixed models adjusted for covariates and accounting for clustering of participants within sites.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">Data from 147 father/adolescent dyads who completed at least the baseline data collection were used. No significant differences were observed for baseline to post-intervention changes in adolescentsâ and fathersâ EBRBs or weight status between treatment and control groups. Fathersâ SSB and fast food intakes were not statistically significant (<italic>p</italic>â=â0.067 and <italic>p</italic>â=â0.090, respectively).</p>

                  <p id="Par4">The Padres program resulted in no significant improvements in adolescent and father EBRBs and weight status. Additional Latino father-focused interventions are needed to examine intervention effects on EBRBs among Latino adolescents.</p>

              <p id="Par11">Childhood obesity is a major public health concern. U.S. nationally representative data (2017-2018) indicate that the prevalence of obesity among children and adolescents (2-19âyears) by Mexican American and Hispanic origin is 25.6 and 26.9%, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Childhood obesity is a health risk factor that can affect adult obesity, diabetes, metabolic disorders, and heart disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In addition, children withÂ overweight/obesity can experience lower self-esteem, a higher likelihood of being bullied, lower school attendance levels and performance, and fewer job prospects and lower-paid employment as an adult compared to children with a BMI below the 85th percentile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Individual, socioeconomic, and environmetal factors that increase the risk of childhood obesity include calorie dense, nutrient poor food choices, sedentariness, low caregiver education, household poverty, lack of access to physical activity resources, and living in a food desert [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par12">The behavioral determinants of excessive weight gain and obesity for children and adolescents include energy balance-related behaviors (EBRBs), namely high intake of energy-dense foods, low levels of physical activity, and frequent screen time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Mexican American and other Hispanic children, like many Americans, under consume fruits and vegetables [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and have excessive intakes of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], sweet/salty snacks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], and fast food [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] compared to Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGAs) recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].

              <p id="Par13">Family resilience, which refers to the ability to meet challenges to effective functioning, has four domains related to the health and wellbeing of Latino families, including individual factors, family strengths, cultural values, and community support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Familism is a well-studied cultural value that has been identified as a protective factor for Latino families because of its association with family cohesion, functioning, and communication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Parents (including fathers and other male caregivers) can play a crucial role in preventing obesity through the development of healthy food- and activity-related behaviors among adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Thus, focusing on the protective factors such as familism and family resilience in obesity prevention interventions with Latino families can foster positive parental involvement in EBRBs by both mothers and fathers.</p>
              <p id="Par14">Yet, most studies primarily focus on mothers when examining parental influence on adolescentâs diet with little attention on the role of the father [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].

A review of qualitative and cross-sectional studies indicated that Latino fathers are more engaged in childrenâs physical activity related behaviors than dietary behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par15">Latino fathers are underrepresented in existing obesity prevention interventions that promote a healthy lifestyle for Latino families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].

              <p id="Par16">The Padres Preparados, JÃ³venes Saludables (Padres) program was developed and implemented from 2017 to 2019 to address the lack of childhood obesity prevention interventions focused on Latino fathers in low-income families.

Community partners and Latino parents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] had requested additional education programs to address obesity prevention among Latino early adolescents.

Consistent with the principles of community-based participatory research (CBPR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], community partners were engaged with researchers in all steps of the program design and implementation process. The Padres program curriculum was based on social cognitive theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] because health and lifestyle behaviors are influenced by personal, social, and environmental factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. For low-income families, these factors may include availability of community resources, family culture, education, social norms, employment, and chronic life stressors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. The purpose of the current study is to assess whether Latino father and adolescent EBRBs, father BMI, and adolescent BMI percentile differed from baseline to post-intervention after the Padres program. The primary hypothesis was that father and adolescent EBRBs will be improved in the treatment group compared to the delayed-treatment control group based on baseline and post-intervention assessment.</p>

Participants were Latino fathers or male caregivers with an adolescent (10-14âyears). Eligibility criteria for fathers/caregivers were identifying as Latino, speaking Spanish, and having meals at least three times a week with their adolescent. While fathers and adolescents were the primary research participants, mothers were encouraged to attend sessions and complete data collection procedures. Fathers and mothers provided consent and adolescents provided assent to participate in the study. Fathers and adolescents received separate cash compensation for their participation.

Parents and adolescents participated in skill-building activities together and separately in parent only, youth only, or parent/youth joint activities (See Table S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> for a more detailed description). Each session included food preparation, eating a meal together, parenting skills education, nutrition/physical activity education (together and separately), and physical activity (together). Participants prepared culturally tailored, simple recipes to support the nutrition concepts included in the sessions. Group physical activities were those that could be done easily indoors or outdoors regardless of time and resource constraints. Education for parents focused on parenting skills related to parent-child interactions and food- and activity-related parenting practices. Education for youth focused on EBRBs and building strong family communication and connections. Parent and youth joint activities involved explanations of basic nutrition and physical activity concepts and hands-on practice/discussion based on their experiences. The intervention highlighted healthy eating and physical activity and their associations with overall health instead of weight loss (Table S<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref> for a more detailed description). Discussion guide handouts and take-home activity sheets were provided at each session.</p>
                <p id="Par24">Parent intervention group sessions were delivered in Spanish by two trained bilingual facilitators who were parents themselves (one male and one female). Facilitators were Extension educators, community partner staff members, or participants in previous Extension parenting classes. Facilitators for the parent group sessions were trained by the project coordinator and two bilingual Extension and community educators who were involved in curriculum development and regularly met with the project team. Youth intervention group sessions were taught in English by two trained community partner staff members or graduate or undergraduate research assistants.

              <p id="Par44">A total of 303 father-adolescent dyads expressed interest in participating in the study (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Of those, 266 were screened for eligibility via a telephone interview, and 234 were identified as eligible. Data were not available from 54 father-adolescent dyads who did not attend the baseline data collection session and 33 dyads were excluded from the data analysis due to age criteria, absence of father, incomplete assent, and left before completing tasks in the baseline data collection. At the baseline data collection sessions, a total of a 147 father/adolescent dyads were randomized to intervention (<italic>n</italic>â=â77) or delayed-treatment control (<italic>n</italic>â=â70). Of those, 11 participants did not correctly follow the random assignment. Four participant dyads randomized to intervention attended the delayed-treatment control group educational sessions while 7 participant dyads randomized to delayed-treatment control group attended the intervention group. Thus, 80 participant dyads attended intervention group educational sessions and 67 participant dyads attended delayed-treatment control group educational sessions.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>CONSORT diagram (Father/adolescent dyads)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12889_2022_14284_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par53">This study examined whether fathersâ and adolescentsâ EBRBs and weight status were improved after they completed the Padres program (<italic>n</italic>â=â147). No reductions were observed in mean consumption of SSBs and fast food by intervention group fathers compared to delayed-treatment control group fathers (<italic>p</italic>Â =â0.067 and <italic>p</italic>Â =â0.090, respectively). No significant differences in mean change in father and adolescent EBRBs and weight status were observed between the intervention and delayed-treatment control groups. Thus, the present study did not support the primary study hypothesis.</p>
              <p id="Par54">Calories consumed from beverages slightly increased among Hispanic adults in the US between 1977 and 2012, with SSBs ranked as the third highest source of snacks (kilocalories per capita per day), respectively, according to the findings from dietary recalls of eight nationally representative surveys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. SSBs were shown to have little nutritional value and linked to weight gain and dental caries as well as obesity and obesity-related health problems including metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, coronary health disease, and stroke in the U.S. and worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. While not significant at the <italic>p</italic>Â &lt;â0.05 level, the current study showed results in the desired direction regarding lowering fathersâ SSBs intake from baseline to post-intervention, consistent with the evaluation of a family-based intervention (Familias Unidas for Health and Wellness (FUHW), where 12% of parents were fathers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. The FUHW intervention promoted healthy eating and activity strategies in overweight Hispanic adolescents and their parents and resulted in a reduction in added sugar intake among Hispanic parents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. This study addressed a gap in the literature by involving Latino fathers as the primary research participants in an intervention program to improve EBRBs for fathers and adolescents.</p>
              <p id="Par55">The Padres program showed no significant intervention effects on Latino adolescent EBRBs and BMI percentile and on father EBRBs and BMI. The lack of significant changes could be because the program was effective, but the study was underpowered or the program was ineffective. Other reasons that could explain the lack of significant changes may be limited resources that constrained access to healthy foods and physical activity opportunities needed to implement intervention strategies. Structural inequities in food access and affordability can impact healthy eating behaviors for people of color in the U.S. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. Based on the Hispanic Community Childrenâs Health/Study of Latino Youth (HCHS/SOL) between 2012 and 2014, 42% of Hispanic/Latino youth (ages 8-16) lived in food-insecure households, and 10% lived in a severe food-insecure household where family members experienced hunger [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. In the current study, 39% of fathers reported that they were food insecure, and about 86% reported annual incomes less than $50,000. Thus, limited resources may have constrained the ability to make healthy food and activity behavior changes among Latino families in the current study.</p>
              <p id="Par56">Another possible explanation for lack of significant changes in adolescent EBRBs after participation in the Padres program may be the lack of time to practice improved behaviors prior to post-intervention data collection. Adolescent post-intervention measurements (diet, physical activity and weight status) were completed 1Â week after the final session with additional 24-hour dietary recalls conducted 2-3âweeks after the final session. Because dietary intake can vary substantially from day to day, short-term success in making positive dietary changes regarding fat, fiber, fruit and vegetables, and sodium was defined as consistent change for several weeks or months, while long-term success was defined as change for 6âmonths to 1 or more years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. Thus, measuring dietary and activity behaviors soon after the final session may not adequately document potential short- or long-term success. Three months of follow-up data after completing the intervention in the current study were not included in the analysis because of the limited number of families participating in the 3-month data collection sessions. Changing living situations and other life events pose ongoing challenges to research in community-based settings.</p>
              <p id="Par57">There were several limitations of this study. The study findings may not be generalizable to the broader Latino population because participants of the Padres program were from one geographic location (Minneapolis/St. Paul metropolitan area), represented several Latin American countries, and most were from low-income households. Most of the data including EBRBs were self-reported by fathers and adolescents. Participants might over-report healthy behaviors and under-report unhealthy behaviors due to poor recall or social desirability. In-person program delivery was discontinued in March 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in a smaller sample size than planned for according to the sample size calculations and limited power to detect significant changes. Randomization assignments were not followed correctly for eleven dyads which could have introduced bias into the group comparisons since groups were defined by randomization assignment, not by group participation. Because the intervention was community-based, some participants within sites may have known each other, and therefore, preferred to attend sessions based on attending with their friends, neighbors, and relatives at more convenient times or when they could share transportation. However, sensitivity analysis results comparing groups defined by participation instead of by randomization were similar. Because participants may have known each other, delayed-control participants may have been exposed to the intervention, which is a potential limitation. Finally, some of the fathers and adolescents who participated in the study might have enrolled because of their interest in nutrition and wellbeing, which would make them different from the general population.</p>
