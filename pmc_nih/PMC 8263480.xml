              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="P33">The National Human Genome Research Institute’s (NHGRI’s) genomic medicine research programs have explored and tested appropriate uses of genomic information in clinical care through collaborative networks that evaluate electronic health record (EHR)-driven phenotyping and return of genomic results <sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>, newborn and clinical genome sequencing <sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>, variant curation <sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>, and dissemination of genomic medicine approaches to diverse clinical settings outside specialized centers <sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>. It has become clear that a major barrier to large-scale genomic medicine implementation is the lack of convincing clinical evidence that would compel clinicians to adopt promising strategies and payers to pay for them. This gap in evidence stems from a) that many genomic tests are laboratory developed tests and thus are subject to enforcement discretion by the Food and Drug Administration; as a result, few if any are used as the intervention in clinical trials, and b) studies conducted to validate the tests, that is to demonstrate that the report on the phenotype of interest, are not sufficient to show clinical utility – that the test result changes provider and/or patient behaviors and clinical and/or economic outcomes as a result. Clinical trials are the usual strategy to develop evidence of clinical utility and owing to their expense, low margin testing firms have seldom, if ever, conducted these studies.</p>
              <p id="P34">The Implementing Genomics in Practice (IGNITE) Network was created in 2013 to enhance the use of genomic medicine by supporting the development of methods to incorporate genomic information into clinical care and explore the methods for their effective implementation.</p>
              <p id="P35">A 2017 National Academy of Medicine report highlighted the need for rigorous evaluation of the validity and utility of genomic medicine interventions and the best approaches for incorporating them in medical practice.<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> Although randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have been regarded traditionally as the gold standard for determining clinical utility, pragmatic clinical trials (PCTs) have been promoted as a means of addressing the weaknesses in RCTs<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>. Genomic interventions are particularly well suited for PCTs to determine the impact of the intervention on the full spectrum of populations and clinical settings in which and to which the intervention will eventually be applied. RCTs are constrained by inclusion and exclusion criteria and often by additional training and feasibility assessment for the sites involved in these studies.</p>

                <title>The IGNITE PTN Network</title>
                <p id="P37">IGNITE PTN, initiated in July 2018, will conduct PCTs of genomic medicine interventions. Each applicant proposed one trial to test a genomic medicine intervention that:</p>
                <p id="P38">1) has evidence of feasibility from prior studies;</p>
                <p id="P39">2) addresses clinically important outcomes achievable within one year of randomization; and</p>
                <p id="P40">3) is adaptable to a wide range of clinical settings.</p>
                <p id="P41">Suitable topics included prescribing pharmacogenomics-based drugs, reducing risk in genetically defined high-risk individuals, and making early genomic-based diagnoses in critically ill newborns. Proposed trials included assessing approaches for real-world applications and providing generalizable knowledge about using PCTs in genomic medicine. Applicants were asked to include a plan to compare results of each trial to those from existing non-interventional studies to identify potential biases affecting the generalization of observational data to clinical practice.</p>
                <p id="P42">The goals for recruitment were to include at least 50% of patients from diverse clinical settings such as community hospitals, family medicine or primary care practices, and at least 35% from underrepresented populations, underserved populations, or populations who experience poorer medical outcomes. A second RFA solicited clinical groups with at least 75% enrollment from underrepresented populations, underserved populations, or populations who experience poorer medical outcomes. The criteria the network chose to capture date relevant to these goals were: Self-reported non-white non-Hispanic race/ethnicity; Health Resources Services Administration defined medically underserved areas; and Medicaid insurance. Of note, the race and ethnicity data were captured to assure compliance with the criteria for the RFAs as set by NHGRI to engage underrepresented populations but will not be used in the primary analyses for the trials.</p>

                <title>PCT Selection:</title>
                <p id="P43">5 groups were selected for funding along with a coordination center. Funding criteria included the capabilities of each site to carry out genomic medicine clinical trials across a range of possible testing interventions and their abilities to recruit participants meeting the diversity criteria for the RFA they responded to. Each group proposed a PCT that could be carried out by the network. An independent protocol review committee (PRC) evaluated and ranked the 5 proposals based on criteria, defined by NHGRI, in <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>.</p>

                <sec id="S16">
                  <title>RCTs vs PCTs.</title>
                  <p id="P57">RCTs have classically been the primary methodology used to answer clinical questions. The design of RCTs include a high degree of control to isolate a treatment effect. The strictness of RCTs is ideal for testing whether a new investigational treatment has the intended effect. However, this strict control means that the environment of an RCT is divorced from actual clinical care.</p>
                  <p id="P58">PCTs are designed from the start with input from healthcare providers, participants, and systems to produce practical evidence on improving outcomes of greatest value to these stakeholders. PCTs are designed to improve practice and policy, and unlike most traditional RCTs, take place in settings where routine care occurs, such as community clinics, primary care practices, hospitals, and pharmacies. They allow the inclusion of diverse, representative populations in multiple, heterogeneous clinical care settings and compare selected interventions to real-world alternatives rather than to placebo or no intervention. The IGNITE PTN is taking advantage of the following pragmatic features of PCTs:</p>
                  <p id="P59">1. The trials are conducted in real-life settings encompassing the full spectrum of the population to which an intervention will be applied.</p>
                  <p id="P60">2. There are minimal inclusion or exclusion criteria.</p>
                  <p id="P61">3. Practitioners are not constrained by guidelines on how apply the experimental intervention. Practitioner guidance is facilitated through clinical decision support in the electronic health record.</p>
                  <p id="P62">4. The best alternative treatments are used for comparison with no restrictions on their application, covering the full spectrum of clinical settings.</p>
                  <p id="P63">5. The primary outcome is a clinically meaningful one that does not require extensive training to assess.</p>
                  <p id="P64">6. There are no plans to improve or alter compliance and no special strategy to motivate practitioner’s adherence to the trial’s protocol.</p>
                  <p id="P65">PCTs for IGNITE PTN were selected to emphasize assessment of effectiveness (in routine settings) rather than efficacy (in ideal settings) and to produce results that will directly inform decision-making of healthcare providers, patients, administrators, and policymakers. The clinical questions of the IGNITE PTN make are a natural fit for PCTs and focus on how the knowledge of genetic status affects the behavior and/or treatment of participants as well as behavior of providers.</p>

                <sec id="S17">
                  <title>Use of Electronic Health Records and Clinical Decision Support</title>
                  <p id="P66">To support the generalizability and reproducibility of IGNITE PTN interventions, the Network specified that all trials would return genomic results to the electronic health record (EHR) with clinical decision support (CDS) informing and guiding care providers. The CDS includes an interpretation of the results (aka ‘passive CDS’) and recommended specific clinical actions (e.g., a change in dosing, drug selection, monitoring laboratory test).</p>

                <p id="P69">Genetic testing to Understand Renal Disease Disparities across the United States (GUARDD-US) is a prospective, multicenter, unblinded, two-arm, randomized pragmatic clinical trial expanding on a previous study<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>. Participants are randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive immediate <italic>APOL1</italic> risk genotype results and or delayed <italic>APOL1</italic> testing 6 months after enrollment (control arm). The hypothesis for GUARDD-US is that immediate knowledge of genotype in <italic>APOL1</italic> high risk patients (with two <italic>APOL1</italic> risk alleles) will result in better blood pressure control compared to high-risk controls who are delayed in receiving this information.</p>
                <p id="P70">The primary endpoint is the change in systolic blood pressure from enrollment to three months post-enrollment between the high-risk control and intervention subjects. Secondary outcomes include urine microalbumin or proteinuria testing and an appropriate diagnosis of chronic kidney disease in the electronic health record. To achieve adequate power, the study will enroll 5435 total individuals to recruit over 500 individuals with high-risk genotypes in each arm. The high-risk genotype frequency in the general African Ancestry population is 14%, but up to 29% in populations with existing cardiovascular and kidney disease<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>. Genotype frequency was considered in recruitment targets and power calculations, balancing expected enrollment of subjects with and without existing kidney disease.</p>
                <p id="P71">GUARDD-US also includes a sub-study that randomizes low risk participants in the intervention arm who test negative for <italic>APOL1</italic> to a pharmacogenomic (PGx) intervention, specifically, immediate PGx return of results vs. delayed PGx return of results in a 1:1 ratio. The genes that are tested are <italic>NAT2</italic> (hydralazine), and <italic>YEATS4</italic> (thiazides) for guiding antihypertensive therapy.

                <title>ADOPT PGx</title>
                <p id="P72">A Depression and Opioid Pragmatic Trial in Pharmacogenetics (ADOPT-PGx) is a set of pragmatic, multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trials to test the efficacy of genotype-guided therapies to treat depression and pain. The Network will conduct three individually powered trials targeting three prescribing scenarios: control of post-operative acute pain, control of chronic pain, and relief from depressive symptoms. Each trial will be randomized to receive immediate (on enrollment) or delayed (at 6 months after enrollment) pharmacogenetics testing. The primary intervention genes include <italic>CYP2D6</italic> for all three trials and additionally <italic>CYP2C19</italic> for the participants enrolled for the depression treatment. <italic>CYP2D6</italic> is known to activate opioids (tramadol, codeine, and hydrocodone), and variability in the <italic>CYP2D6</italic> gene contributes to efficacy and toxicity of these opioids. For antidepressants, <italic>CYP2D6</italic> also metabolizes, but inactivates, fluvoxamine and paroxetine, while <italic>CYP2C19</italic> metabolizes and inactivates citalopram, escitalopram, and sertraline.</p>
                <p id="P73">The hypothesis for ADOPT PGx is that genotype-guided interventions will improve pain control and depressive symptoms. All endpoints are patient-reported through PROMIS (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System) based surveys administered at baseline and at various times up to six months. Trial-specific outcomes will be compared between participants in the intervention arm (immediate genotyping) and control arm (delayed genotyping) who have an actionable <italic>CYP2D6</italic> or <italic>CYP2C19</italic> predicted phenotypes. Phenotypes for <italic>CYP2C19</italic> will be based on genetic test results alone, whereas <italic>CYP2D6</italic> phenotypes will also incorporate phenoconversion resulting from drug interactions. Both opioid and antidepressant prescriptions will generally be guided by recommendations published in the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guidelines.</p>

                <title>CDS content (GUARDD-US)</title>
                <p id="P74">To support the pragmatic GUARDD-US study, a robust CDS system is required. Given the lack of consensus nor society guidelines surrounding <italic>APOL1</italic>, GUARDD-US CDS content development working group focused on crafting CDS to attain current BP targets rather than create new thresholds based on <italic>APOL1</italic> genotyping <sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup>. All subjects regardless of genotype receive advice on blood pressure control and education on the relationship between high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease. The CDS system is designed to alert providers to elevated blood pressures in individuals with high risk <italic>APOL1</italic> genotypes and facilitate expeditious blood pressure control and chronic kidney disease screening.</p>
                <p id="P75">The five institutions participating in this PCT vary in their current utilization of clinical risk criteria to define blood pressure targets. Some sites plan to enroll participants with lower cardiovascular risk and almost universally preferred to target a &lt;140/90 mm Hg threshold. Other sites plan to enroll patients across the spectrum of cardiovascular risk, already integrating clinical risk factors into routine BP care algorithms. Since target blood pressure guidelines vary across clinical societies, the GUARDD-US CDS system emphasized a threshold of &lt;140/90 mm Hg for most individuals in the CDS, but allowed flexibility for stricter control at sites considering cardiovascular disease risk factors. Given a lack of evidence, one clear decision by the investigators was to <italic>not</italic> consider the <italic>APOL1</italic> high-risk genotype alone as a cardiovascular risk factor equivalent. Instead, the CDS recommends screening for chronic kidney disease with a urine microalbumin test in individuals who have not been screened in the previous six months. Chronic kidney disease is already a cardiovascular disease risk factor. If practitioners are made aware of the presence of chronic kidney disease, they can elect to target a stricter threshold of &lt;130/80 mm Hg based on current guidelines. Individuals randomized to immediate genotyping but were not found to possess two <italic>APOL1</italic> risk alleles are re-randomized to a sub-study of immediate or delayed pharmaco-genotyping for two antihypertensive gene-drug pairs. The first drug-gene pair links genotype for an expression quantitative trait locus in <italic>YEATS4</italic> to thiazide diuretic response<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup>. The second drug-gene pair uses <italic>N-acetyltransferase 2</italic> (<italic>NAT2</italic>) genotype to guide dosing of hydralazine<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup>. Neither drug-gene pair possesses dosing recommendations from CPIC; thus, CDS algorithms were created based on current pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic evidence. Blood pressure targets were set analogously to the GUARDD-US study.</p>

                <title>CDS Content (ADOPT-PGx)</title>
                <p id="P76">The CDS content development process for ADOPT-PGx focused on creating standardized, evidence-based, genotype-informed drug therapy recommendations that incorporated effects of drug-drug-gene interactions, when applicable.</p>
                <p id="P77">The working group relied primarily on CPIC guidelines for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and codeine. Since publication of the CPIC guidelines, members of the IGNITE PCT network had completed clinical trials of genotype-informed opioid therapy in acute and chronic pain <sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup>. These additional data were used to further inform recommendations for opioids with lower levels of evidence in the CPIC guideline, including tramadol and hydrocodone. The working group also identified clinical areas of uncertainty with the use of genotype information in practice, such as genotype-guided dosing recommendations for CYP2D6 intermediate metabolizers and ranged phenotypes (<italic>CYP2D6</italic> NM-UM) in patients taking codeine, tramadol, or hydrocodone. In these cases, the group conducted additional review of the literature and iterative discussions to reach consensus on clinical recommendations.</p>
                <p id="P78">Given the pragmatic nature of the ADOPT-PGx clinical trial, it was necessary to develop consistent clinical recommendations and/or interventions that could be implemented among diverse clinical settings with variability in EHRs, health informatics capabilities, degree of experience with implementing pharmacogenomics in clinical practice, and population age ranges (e.g., adult versus pediatrics). The working group created templates for synchronous CDS that could interrupt providers during the prescribing process as well as asynchronous clinical notes that could be returned to providers electronically. This approach allowed for maximal flexibility: some sites used existing CDS as available, while other sites built CDS <italic>de novo</italic> as part of the trial. It also allowed for each site to choose which CDS to employ while ensuring the core components of the intervention were preserved across the network. Examples of CDS alerts developed are in <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 1</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">2</xref>.</p>
                <p id="P79">Part of the intervention in ADOPT-PGx relies on clinical decisions that incorporate the effects of CYP2D6 phenoconversion, or the combinatorial impact of concomitant medications with the patient’s genetic profile to provide a more precise prediction of the patient’s CYP2D6 enzyme function. While the concept of this approach is not new, to our knowledge, there were no standardized algorithms for clinical application. Through an exhaustive literature review, the working group arrived at a consensus algorithm to guide clinical interpretation of possible <italic>CYP2D6</italic> genotypes when patients were taking concomitant enzyme inhibitors, including accounting for copy number variation. Each site will apply this algorithm either electronically or manually as part of the intervention and make recommendations concordant with the patient’s predicted clinical phenotype.</p>

                <title>CDS Process</title>
                <p id="P80">A CDS Process working group was established to develop laboratory result reporting and clinical decision support for each pragmatic trial; one subgroup was devoted to ADOPT-PGx trial and another to GUARDD-US. As trial sites within IGNITE PTN use a variety of EHR vendors, the working group established knowledgebases and design guidelines to standardize the presentation of genomic risk to clinicians at the point of care. Through this workgroup, sites shared methods for developing alerts, screenshots of in-progress and developed CDS, and criteria for timing the genomic risk message and the scope of the recipients.</p>

                <title>Genotyping</title>
                <p id="P81">The goal of the genotyping working group was to harmonize genes and variants for the studies and assignments of phenotypes based on genetic test results. The group initially discussed harmonizing to a common platform but ultimately decided against a common platform as there would be a significant cost in equipment and/or resources for each site to obtain and validate a common platform. Part of genotyping group discussion and decision making was impacted by the safety communication from the FDA <sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup>. The working group decided only the genotype and phenotype would be reported. No other interpretive language would be provided by the clinical laboratory report as these were covered by the CDS working group. The working group also discussed preferred and alternative specimen types for clinical testing. Since both ADOPT-PGx and GUARDD-US are PCTs, it was decided that the validated specimens did not need to be harmonized. Of note, most laboratories preferred whole blood collected in EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) for clinical testing. Other non-invasive acceptable specimens were either buccal swabs or saliva samples.</p>

                <title>Data harmonization</title>
                <p id="P82">The Data Harmonization working group was convened to facilitate cross-network analyses by aligning data elements across Network-wide clinical trials where possible. Because the Network clinical trials each have specific aims and populations, the working group adopted a “flexible” approach to data harmonization <sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup>. Appropriate for a collaborative environment, a flexible approach does not require that each clinical trial capture data using identical tools or measures. Rather, researchers from the different clinical trials agree on a core set of variables with flexibility regarding how those variables will be collected or measured. However, because the working group was formed as the Network began, it has been possible to prospectively define a minimum core set of common data elements across the clinical trials <sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup> that will allow for rapid dissemination of cross-network patient characteristics. The working group finalized this core set of data elements iteratively, through multiple rounds of discussion during the protocol and database development phases <sup>[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup>.</p>

                <title>Cost Effectiveness</title>
                <p id="P83">One crucial goal of studies addressing the value and process of implementation is long-term sustainability, and an essential component of sustainability is an understanding of costs as compared to the clinical effectiveness of the intervention. To this end, the network established a working group that consists of decision and economic modelers, genomics experts, clinical specialists, and epidemiologists to assess healthcare utilization and evaluate the cost effectiveness of the two trials. Novel to evaluating the impact of genomic interventions on healthcare utilization and cost will be the use of claims records for a subgroup of the trial samples with coverage by Medicare or Medicaid that will be linked to trial data. Claims records will enhance patient report and EHR-based capture of healthcare utilization and allow direct extraction of reimbursed charges (i.e., cost to the payer). Cost-effectiveness analyses will assume the perspective of the payer to inform reimbursement decisions of genomic and pharmacogenetic testing.</p>

              <title>Conclusions:</title>
              <p id="P84">IGNITE PTN is applying the rigor of PCTs to develop the evidence base that, if positive, will be used to support the widespread adoption of a suite of genomic medicine interventions by patients, providers, and payers. Whether or not the trials show a benefit to genetic testing, IGNITE PTN will have defined the standards and processes required to carry out genomic guided rigorous PCTs to determine clinical utility of these tests filling and important gap in strategies to assess the value of genomic medicine.</p>
              <p id="P85">IGNITE PTN expands the reach of the Network to a wider range of socio-economic demographics and populations as well as health care delivery settings. Importantly, it will explore genomic testing and return of results among underrepresented populations with an expectation that the research program will capture diverse populations of patients complimenting efforts underway in other federally funded programs to do so (e.g. in the <italic>All of Us</italic> Research Program and in eMERGE).</p>
              <p id="P86">IGNITE PTN will foster the exchange of genomic testing implementation protocols within and outside the Network. The evidence genereated will support implementing genomic medicine broadly and will build on the initial findings from IGNITE to expand collaborations with external groups and expert organizations (such as CMS, FDA) to define what additional evidence is needed to move genomic testing from the realm of research to become the standard of care.</p>
