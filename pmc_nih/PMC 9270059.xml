                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Tixagevimab–cilgavimab is a neutralising monoclonal antibody combination hypothesised to improve outcomes for patients hospitalised with COVID-19. We aimed to compare tixagevimab–cilgavimab versus placebo, in patients receiving remdesivir and other standard care.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>In a randomised, double-blind, phase 3, placebo-controlled trial, adults with symptoms for up to 12 days and hospitalised for COVID-19 at 81 sites in the USA, Europe, Uganda, and Singapore were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive intravenous tixagevimab 300 mg–cilgavimab 300 mg or placebo, in addition to remdesivir and other standard care. Patients were excluded if they had acute organ failure including receipt of invasive mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, vasopressor therapy, mechanical circulatory support, or new renal replacement therapy. The study drug was prepared by an unmasked pharmacist; study participants, site study staff, investigators, and clinical providers were masked to study assignment. The primary outcome was time to sustained recovery up to day 90, defined as 14 consecutive days at home after hospital discharge, with co-primary analyses for the full cohort and for participants who were neutralising antibody-negative at baseline. Efficacy and safety analyses were done in the modified intention-to-treat population, defined as participants who received a complete or partial infusion of tixagevimab–cilgavimab or placebo. This study is registered with <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov" id="interrefs10">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="ClinicalTrials.gov" xlink:href="NCT04501978" id="interrefs20">NCT04501978</ext-link> and the participant follow-up is ongoing.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>From Feb 10 to Sept 30, 2021, 1455 patients were randomly assigned and 1417 in the primary modified intention-to-treat population were infused with tixagevimab–cilgavimab (n=710) or placebo (n=707). The estimated cumulative incidence of sustained recovery was 89% for tixagevimab–cilgavimab and 86% for placebo group participants at day 90 in the full cohort (recovery rate ratio [RRR] 1·08 [95% CI 0·97–1·20]; p=0·21). Results were similar in the seronegative subgroup (RRR 1·14 [0·97–1·34]; p=0·13). Mortality was lower in the tixagevimab–cilgavimab group (61 [9%]) versus placebo group (86 [12%]; hazard ratio [HR] 0·70 [95% CI 0·50–0·97]; p=0·032). The composite safety outcome occurred in 178 (25%) tixagevimab–cilgavimab and 212 (30%) placebo group participants (HR 0·83 [0·68–1·01]; p=0·059). Serious adverse events occurred in 34 (5%) participants in the tixagevimab–cilgavimab group and 38 (5%) in the placebo group.</p>

                  <title>Interpretation</title>

                  <p id="para60">Mortality is common among patients hospitalised with COVID-19, despite improvements in standard care (including remdesivir, dexamethasone, other immune modulators, and anticoagulants). Neutralising monoclonal antibodies selectively bind to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, suppress viral replication in vitro and in animal models, and prevent clinical progression and hospitalisation when given early to high-risk outpatients with COVID-19. Treatment of hospitalised, seronegative individuals with the monoclonal antibody combination casirivimab–imdevimab significantly reduced mortality in the RECOVERY trial. However, SARS-CoV-2 omicron variants are fully resistant to this combination monoclonal antibody and show reduced susceptibility to others. Tixagevimab–cilgavimab, a combination of two monoclonal antibodies with an approximately 90-day half-life, prevented symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection when given as pre-exposure prophylaxis, reduced hospitalisations by more than 50% when given during early COVID-19 in participants who are not hospitalised, and maintained antiviral activity against omicron variants. This is the first phase 3 study evaluating the efficacy of tixagevimab–cilgavimab in patients who are hospitalised.</p>

                    <bold>Added value of this study</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para80">In this phase 3 trial, we evaluated a single intravenous dose of tixagevimab–cilgavimab, in addition to remdesivir and other standard care. Tixagevimab–cilgavimab did not improve the primary endpoint of sustained patient recovery, but it was safe and led to a clinically relevant reduction in mortality. The mortality signal was numerically larger in patients requiring high-flow oxygen or non-invasive mechanical ventilation at study entry and in patients infected with the delta SARS-CoV-2 variant. In contrast to some previous monoclonal antibody studies, there were no differences in any of the efficacy or safety study outcomes by baseline endogenous neutralising antibody serostatus.</p>
                  <p id="para90">
                    <bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para100">A single intravenous dose of tixagevimab–cilgavimab might provide additional clinical benefits to current standard care in patients hospitalised with COVID-19. Benefits might actually be greatest in patients with more advanced respiratory failure. The mortality reduction observed in this study belong to a secondary endpoint and thus requires additional validation. As baseline serostatus was not associated with efficacy or safety outcomes, antibody testing might not be required to administer this treatment.</p>

                <p id="para120">Adult, hospitalised patients were eligible if they had confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and symptoms for up to 12 days. Patients were excluded if they had acute organ failure including receipt of invasive mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, vasopressor therapy, mechanical circulatory support, or new renal replacement therapy. At the beginning of the trial (Feb 10, 2021), patients on high-flow nasal oxygen or non-invasive ventilation were excluded. On July 19, 2021, after 743 (51%) of 1455 patients were enrolled, eligibility was expanded at the recommendation of the US Food and Drug Administration and data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) to include these patients.

Hospitalised adults with COVID-19 were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either tixagevimab 300 mg–cilgavimab 300 mg or placebo.

This outcome captures patient-centred, clinically important events after hospital discharge, given that hospital discharge might occur quickly particularly during pandemic conditions and the omission of post-discharge events might underestimate disease burden. Key secondary efficacy outcomes included all-cause mortality up to day 90 and a composite of sustained recovery and mortality up to day 90. Other secondary outcomes are seven-category pulmonary ordinal outcome scale, a seven-category pulmonary-plus ordinal outcome scale, time to discharge from the index hospitalization, a composite safety outcomes through days 5, 28 and 90, reactions associated with the infusion of the study treatments (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix pp 26–29</xref>).</p>
                <p id="para190">The main safety outcome was a composite of death, serious adverse events, incident organ failure, and serious co-infections up to day 90.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="para330">In this multinational phase 3 trial involving patients hospitalised with COVID-19, treatment with a single infusion of tixagevimab−cilgavimab, compared with placebo, did not improve the primary outcome of time to sustained recovery, but led to a 30% relative risk reduction for mortality up to day 90<bold>.</bold> Absolute risk reduction was 3·6%. In contrast to earlier results with other monoclonal antibody treatments that showed more favourable results for seronegative than seropositive patients,<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> results for tixagevimab−cilgavimab did not differ by baseline serostatus. There was also no evidence of harm either overall or by baseline serostatus. Taken together, these results suggest that tixagevimab−cilgavimab is safe and might reduce mortality among patients hospitalised with COVID-19. The reason for different results for sustained recovery and mortality might be related to the relatively high proportion of participants receiving no or low (&lt;4 L/min) supplemental oxygen (59%), who tended to recover quickly with remdesivir and other standard care, or might be due to chance.</p>
              <p id="para340">Outcomes with tixagevimab−cilgavimab differ from previous monoclonal antibodies in several ways. Tixagevimab−cilgavimab is the first in the ACTIV-3 platform that the DSMB recommended to proceed to full enrolment after early futility assessment and also the first to ultimately suggest lower mortality. Whereas two of the three agents previously studied were associated with possible harm in patients who are seropositive,<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> as was casirivimab−imdevimab in the RECOVERY trial but not in a company sponsored trial,<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> a safety signal was not observed with tixagevimab−cilgavimab in this subgroup, despite an approximately 90-day half-life that is longer than previous monoclonal antibodies.<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> It is unknown whether this different result is attributable to the specific epitopes targeted by tixagevimab−cilgavimab or the Fc modifications that might reduce potential risk of antibody dependent enhancement of disease,<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> versus changes over time in patients (such as vaccination), viral variants, or other epidemiological factors. More generally, these discordant results suggest that potential harm in patients who are seropositive is not a class-wide effect among all monoclonal antibodies.</p>
              <p id="para350">As with other antiviral therapies, treatment earlier in the COVID-19 disease course might be more likely to be effective. Several monoclonal antibody treatments have shown benefit in reducing progression of disease when administered to outpatients in the first week of illness.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> In the present trial, almost all participants still had detectable viral antigen concentrations at baseline (median 8 days of symptoms), and nearly half did not have endogenous neutralising antibodies, suggesting that antivirals might remain an important component of the treatment approach in patients who are hospitalised. This result aligns with the first stage of the Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial,<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> in which treatment with the antiviral remdesivir was beneficial in patients enrolled at a median of 9 days, as well as with the RECOVERY trial, in which casirivemab−imdevimab showed a mortality reduction in patients who had been hospitalised who were seronegative at a median of 7 days of symptoms.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> Additionally, tixagevimab−cilgavimab was evaluated with concomitant remdesivir, in contrast to the RECOVERY trial in which only approximately 25% of patients received remdesivir. Although there are conflicting guidelines regarding its use for patients hospitalised with COVID-19, concomitant remdesivir treatment in this trial ensures that any observed benefits of tixagevimab−cilgavimab are additive to this background antiviral therapy. In RECOVERY, 28-day mortality was 20% compared with 10% in the current study. The results from the present trial suggest that monoclonal antibodies might provide clinical benefit in patients irrespective of whether they are receiving a direct-acting antiviral agent. As this benefit was not apparent with the pulmonary ordinal scale at day 5 (used for early futility assessment in all TICO trials), future clinical trials in inpatients with COVID-19 might be best served by assessing early futility by means of a later timepoint, a different outcome, or both.</p>
              <p id="para360">Strengths of this trial include a large, diverse patient population enrolled at experienced sites on four continents. Additionally, there was blinded administration of the investigational agent, detailed attention to outcome ascertainment, and continuous review from the DSMB. Although ACTIV-3/TICO is a multi-arm platform, patients were randomly assigned to only one investigational agent and contemporaneous placebos were used, so the results are not influenced by other investigational agents. Although underpowered for subgroup analyses, there was no compelling evidence of differences between tixagevimab−cilgavimab and placebo in either efficacy or safety by baseline serostatus, region, comorbid conditions, including immunocompromised state, or by vaccination status, suggesting that the results are broadly generalisable. The potential for benefit in patients receiving high-flow nasal cannula or mechanical ventilation merits further study.</p>
              <p id="para370">Our trial has several limitations. First, enrolment concluded before the emergence of the omicron variant, so we do not have direct evidence for patients infected with this or future variants. However, in vitro data suggest that although the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) for tixagevimab−cilgavimab is higher against the omicron (B.1.1.529 or BA.2) variant as compared with previous variants,<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> clinical activity might be retained, albeit higher doses might be required.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Second, only a minority of participants were fully vaccinated, making it difficult to extrapolate our results to vaccinated or boosted patients. Third, critically ill patients already requiring mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, or new renal replacement therapy were excluded. Reassuringly, nominal differences for efficacy and safety favoured tixagevimab−cilgavimab for participants receiving high-flow nasal cannula or non-invasive ventilation at baseline. Fourth, since almost all patients received remdesivir per protocol, the benefit of tixagevimab−cilgavimab if used as antiviral monotherapy is unknown. Broad adherence to guideline-recommended treatment, including remdesivir and corticosteroids, might reduce the potential for larger effect sizes, and the study had limited power to detect a modest treatment effect for sustained recovery. Yet, the observed mortality benefit highlights the ongoing need for further rescue interventions for patients hospitalised with COVID-19.</p>
              <p id="para380">A single infusion of tixagevimab−cilgavimab, added to background therapy with remdesivir and other standard care, did not reduce time to the primary outcome of sustained recovery among patients hospitalised with COVID-19. However, this combination monoclonal antibody was safe and resulted in a 30% lower mortality than standard care alone, suggesting that tixagevimab−cilgavimab might be a useful treatment option for patients hospitalised with COVID-19.</p>
