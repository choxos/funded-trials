                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Inhibition of parasite growth is a major objective of blood-stage malaria vaccines. The <italic>in vitro</italic> assay of parasite growth inhibitory activity (GIA) is widely used as a surrogate marker for malaria vaccine efficacy in the down-selection of candidate blood-stage vaccines. Here we report the first study to examine the relationship between <italic>in vivo Plasmodium falciparum</italic> growth rates and <italic>in vitro</italic> GIA in humans experimentally infected with blood-stage malaria.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>In this phase I/IIa open-label clinical trial five healthy malaria-naive volunteers were immunised with AMA1/C1-Alhydrogel+CPG 7909, and together with three unvaccinated controls were challenged by intravenous inoculation of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infected erythrocytes.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>A significant correlation was observed between parasite multiplication rate in 48 hours (PMR) and both vaccine-induced growth-inhibitory activity (Pearson r = −0.93 [95% CI: −1.0, −0.27] <italic>P</italic> = 0.02) and AMA1 antibody titres in the vaccine group (Pearson r = −0.93 [95% CI: −0.99, −0.25] <italic>P</italic> = 0.02). However immunisation failed to reduce overall mean PMR in the vaccine group in comparison to the controls (vaccinee 16 fold [95% CI: 12, 22], control 17 fold [CI: 0, 65] <italic>P</italic> = 0.70). Therefore no impact on pre-patent period was observed (vaccine group median 8.5 days [range 7.5–9], control group median 9 days [range 7–9]).</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>Despite the first observation in human experimental malaria infection of a significant association between vaccine-induced <italic>in vitro</italic> growth inhibitory activity and <italic>in vivo</italic> parasite multiplication rate, this did not translate into any observable clinically relevant vaccine effect in this small group of volunteers.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Recent trends in the incidence of <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> in several African countries have returned malaria eradication to the global health agenda <xref rid="pone.0022271-Roberts1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. An effective multi-stage malaria vaccine combining pre-erythrocytic and blood-stage components would significantly contribute towards eradication <xref rid="pone.0022271-Plowe1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, whilst maintaining blood-stage immunity which could protect against epidemic malaria once natural immunity waned in vaccinated populations. However, despite considerable efforts, no blood stage vaccine has demonstrated clinical protection in a field trial to date (reviewed in <xref rid="pone.0022271-Goodman1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022271-Ellis1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>).</p>
              <p>Antibodies from malaria-immune individuals and vaccine recipients can inhibit parasite growth and invasion of erythrocytes <italic>in vitro</italic>, as assessed by the standardised assay of growth inhibitory activity (GIA) <xref rid="pone.0022271-Crompton1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Assays of GIA are regarded as surrogates for candidate vaccine efficacy and are used for the down-selection of blood-stage vaccine candidates <xref rid="pone.0022271-Goodman1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. However, there are conflicting data regarding the clinical relevance of assays of GIA (reviewed in <xref rid="pone.0022271-Goodman1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>), and to our knowledge no study to date has examined the relationship between <italic>in vitro</italic> growth inhibitory activity of vaccine-induced antibody and <italic>in vivo</italic> parasite growth rates in humans.</p>
              <p>Experimental malaria infections of healthy vaccinated volunteers by mosquito bites (sporozoite challenge) or inoculation of blood-stage parasites (blood-stage challenge) provide direct evidence of candidate vaccine efficacy before progression to field trials <xref rid="pone.0022271-Moorthy1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Since the number of parasites in the infecting inoculum can be calculated after administration, blood-stage challenge allows modeling of parasite multiplication rate (PMR) for individuals <xref rid="pone.0022271-Bejon1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> or groups <xref rid="pone.0022271-Hermsen1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> with greater accuracy <xref rid="pone.0022271-Sanderson1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, providing greater power to detect partial efficacy of blood-stage vaccines <xref rid="pone.0022271-Sanderson1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022271-Cheng1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. In addition the lower starting blood-stage inocula following blood-stage challenge results in a prolonged period of sub-patent parasitaemia during which protective vaccine-induced immune responses can operate. However just thirty-one humans have been enrolled in four blood-stage challenge studies to date <xref rid="pone.0022271-Sanderson1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022271-Cheng1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022271-Lawrence1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022271-Pombo1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Only one was a vaccine efficacy trial, in which no relationship was observed between PMR and the modest vaccine-induced antibody and T cell responses; GIA was not measured <xref rid="pone.0022271-Lawrence1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p>
              <p>Apical membrane antigen-1 (AMA1) is a leading blood-stage vaccine candidate antigen <xref rid="pone.0022271-Goodman1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022271-Ellis1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The recombinant protein vaccine AMA1-C1 is a combination of the 3D7 and FVO alleles of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> AMA1 <xref rid="pone.0022271-Ellis2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. AMA1-C1 adsorbed on Alhydrogel was safe and immunogenic in phase I trials <xref rid="pone.0022271-Dicko1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022271-Lyke1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022271-Roestenberg1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> but demonstrated no protective efficacy in a phase IIb trial in children in Mali <xref rid="pone.0022271-Sagara1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Combining AMA1-C1/Alhydrogel with the novel oligodeoxynucleotide adjuvant CPG 7909 enhanced immunogenicity in phase I trials in adults in the US <xref rid="pone.0022271-Ellis2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022271-Crompton2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022271-Mullen1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> and Mali <xref rid="pone.0022271-Sagara2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> and induced GIA of up to 96%.

                <p>The primary objective was to assess the relationship, if any, between <italic>in vitro</italic> parasite growth inhibition and parasite multiplication rate <italic>in vivo</italic>. The secondary objective was to attempt to detect differences in the parasite multiplication rates between the vaccinated and unvaccinated subjects.

                <title>Study Design</title>
                <p>This was a phase I/IIa open-label blood-stage malaria vaccine and challenge trial, including a control group of unvaccinated volunteers as infectivity controls. Allocation to study groups occurred at screening based on volunteer preference, as previously described <xref rid="pone.0022271-McConkey1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022271-Webster1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022271-Thompson1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. The vaccine recipients received a single intramuscular dose of the experimental vaccine AMA1-C1/Alhydrogel+CPG 7909 on days 0 and 56, and underwent intravenous blood-stage 3D7-strain <italic>P.falciparum</italic> challenge 14 days after the second immunisation (on day 70). Control volunteers underwent simultaneous intravenous blood-stage challenge. Twice daily <italic>P.falciparum</italic> quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) samples obtained from all challenged volunteers during the intensive post-challenge follow-up period were used to estimate parasite multiplication rates per 48 hours for individual volunteers, using a published mathematical model <xref rid="pone.0022271-Bejon1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. These individual PMRs were compared to results of the <italic>in vitro</italic> assay of parasite growth inhibitory activity (GIA) of purified IgG obtained from individual volunteers on the day of challenge (day 70), to address the primary study outcome described above.</p>

                <p>The clinical trial protocol and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as Supplementary Information; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0022271.s004">Protocol S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0022271.s005">Checklist S1</xref>. The study was conducted between July 2009 and September 2010 at the Centre for Clinical Vaccinology and Tropical Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK. Screening began in July 2009, and the first volunteers were enrolled in January 2010. Healthy, malaria-naïve males and non-pregnant females aged 18–50 were invited to participate in the study. Inclusion and exclusion criteria for participation have been previously described <xref rid="pone.0022271-Sanderson1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022271-Thompson1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. As the donor of the parasite inocula was seropositive for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV), EBV and CMV seropositivity was included as an inclusion criterion. Due to the potential risk of inducing autoimmunity with CPG, volunteers were also screened for anti-double stranded DNA antibodies (ds-DNA) <xref rid="pone.0022271-Ellis2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Urine pregnancy testing of female volunteers was performed at screening, and prior to vaccination, challenge and administration of malaria treatment.</p>

                <title>Interventions</title>
                <p>Vaccinated volunteers were immunised intramuscularly with AMA1-C1 (80 µg)/Alhydrogel (800 µg), mixed immediately prior to administration with 564 µg CPG 7909 formulated in saline (total volume of 0.55 ml), in alternate upper arms on days 0 and 56. Details of the manufacture and formulation of both AMA1-C1/Alhydrogel and CPG 7909 in saline, and the mixing procedure used in the clinic have been described in detail elsewhere <xref rid="pone.0022271-Ellis2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022271-Kennedy1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Briefly, the AMA1-C1 vaccine contains two 533 amino acid recombinant malaria proteins based on the AMA1 sequences of the FVO and 3D7 clones of <italic>P. falciparum</italic>. The recombinant proteins consist of the correctly folded ectodomain portions of the antigens, with the addition of a six-histidine C-terminal tag to enable protein purification, and are expressed separately in <italic>Pichia pastoris</italic>.</p>
                <p>Vaccinated volunteers underwent challenge two weeks after final immunisation (day 70) together with unvaccinated control volunteers, by intravenous injection of approximately 1000 erythrocytes infected with 3D7-strain <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasites. Details of the inocula preparation and administration are described below.</p>

                  <title>Preparation of Inocula</title>
                  <p>The origin of the blood-stage inoculum has previously been described in detail <xref rid="pone.0022271-Cheng1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. All volunteers were challenged with the same preparation of inocula. The intended inoculum was 1000 infected erythrocytes per volunteer, thawed and prepared under strict aseptic conditions. Briefly, a single vial of cryopreserved erythrocytes was thawed in a containment level III laboratory using solutions licensed for clinical use and single-use disposable consumables. A class II microbiological safety cabinet (MSC) that had not previously been used for pathogen work was used to prepare the inocula. The MSC was fumigated with formaldehyde prior to use and no contamination of the hoods was detected by settle plates. Two hundred microliters of 12% saline was added dropwise to 1 ml of thawed infected blood, left for 5 min, and an additional 10 ml of 1.6% saline added dropwise. This was centrifuged for 4 minutes at 830× g, the supernatant was removed, and 10 ml of 0.9% saline was added dropwise. The cell pellet was washed twice in 0.9% saline and resuspended in 0.9% saline in a sterile syringe for injection. The injection volume per volunteer was 5 ml containing an estimated 1000 parasitised erythrocytes based on microscopic estimates of the donor's parasite density prior to freezing. The clinical inoculum was also cultured following preparation to exclude bacterial contamination. Alternating between vaccinees and controls, all subjects were inoculated intravenously within 40 minutes of inocula preparation to maximise standardisation of the infecting dose between vaccinees and controls and to avoid potential loss of parasite viability within the syringe <xref rid="pone.0022271-Lawrence1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p>

The culture period was shortened to 6 days. Quantitative PCR was used to score wells positive or negative for replicating parasites. Because the qPCR assay could also detect dead parasites, a plate of identical dilutions of inocula that had been frozen without incubation was used as a negative control. Wells were scored positive only when post-incubation parasite density was &gt;100-fold higher than the mean of un-incubated wells at the same inoculum dilution. The number of viable parasites/ml of inoculum could then be calculated and viability expressed as a percentage of the pre-freezing microscopy-estimated parasitaemia calculated using the RBC count/ml of inoculum.</p>

                  <p>Treatment was initiated in response to one of the following: the identification of a single parasite by thick blood film microscopy; the onset of significant clinical symptoms of malaria (fever &gt;37.6°C, rigors, moderate or severe myalgia) in the presence of a positive qPCR but negative blood film; or reaching day 16 without becoming symptomatic or thick film positive. Treatment was with a standard course of artemether/lumefantrine (or chloroquine if artemether/lumefantrine was contra-indicated). Volunteers were followed-up post-treatment to observe adherence to the treatment regime and to confirm that drug cure was successful <xref rid="pone.0022271-Thompson1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.

For the control group volunteers the day of enrolment was the same as the day of parasite challenge. GIA assays were performed as previously described <xref rid="pone.0022271-Malkin1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. IgG fractions were purified from individual sera obtained on day 0 and day 70 using protein G columns (Pierce Inc., Rockford, IL); the eluted fractions were dialyzed against RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD) and concentrated with centrifugal filter devices (Millipore, Billerica, MA) to a concentration of 40 mg/ml. The purified IgGs were preadsorbed with uninfected human O-negative erythrocytes (25 µl of RBCs per 1 ml of serum sample) for 1 h to remove any anti-human erythrocyte immunoglobulins. Purified IgGs were sterilised by filtration through a 0.22-µm filter (Nalge Nunc, Rochester, NY). The GIA assay was performed on these samples using human erythrocytes parasitised with late trophozoite and schizont stages of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> prepared by Percoll gradient and/or 5% sorbitol treatment, with a final concentration of IgG in the test well of 10 mg/ml. Parasite growth after 40 h of culture (for 3D7 parasites) and approximately 47 h of culture (for FVO parasites) was determined by a biochemical assay specific for parasite lactate dehydrogenase, and the results were determined by the O.D.<sub>650</sub>. The assays were performed once with samples tested in triplicate. As a positive control, rabbit AMA1-C1 IgG was used for each GIA plate. The negative control was infected RBC without any IgG. Starting parasitemia was 0.3+/−0.1%. Haematocrit was 1%, and final parasitemia was 2–3% for the negative control after 40 (3D7) or 47 (FVO) hours of culture. The results of the GIA assay with the purified IgGs were expressed as percent inhibition calculated as follows: 100−[(O.D.<sub>650</sub> of infected RBCs with tested IgG−O.D.<sub>650</sub> of normal RBCs only)/(O.D.<sub>650</sub> of infected RBCs without any IgG−O.D.<sub>650</sub> of normal RBCs only)×100].

                <p>Sample size calculations for challenge trials must balance the need for an adequate sample with the need to reduce risk to volunteers from exposure to malaria. In most blood-stage challenge studies performed to date group sizes have been in single figures. This reflects both practical limitations on the numbers of individuals that can be recruited and challenged, and ethical constraints on challenging large numbers of volunteers with vaccines without any prior evidence of efficacy. The primary endpoint sample size calculation for this study estimated that with 5 control subjects and 12 vaccinated subjects there was greater than 80% power to demonstrate a correlation coefficient &gt;0.5 if the true correlation coefficient was 0.7. The study was not specifically powered to assess the secondary endpoint. Although the planned sample size included 12 vaccinated volunteers and 5 controls (with a total 6 controls and 15 vaccinated volunteers to allow for drop-outs), recruitment was halted after interim primary endpoint analysis on the vaccinated volunteers (unadjusted for interim monitoring), which demonstrated that the primary endpoint had been reached after the initial challenge of 5 vaccinated volunteers and 3 controls.</p>
                <p>To assess the primary and secondary endpoints, data from all challenged subjects for which there were adequate data were analysed.

                  <p>All volunteers were inoculated within 40 minutes of inocula preparation. All volunteers developed microscopy positive parasitaemia on thick-film by day 9 post-challenge (range 7–9). Although not surprising for a small sample, there was no significant difference in pre-patent period between the vaccine and control groups by survival analysis (vaccine group median 8.5 days (range 7.5–9), control group median 9 days (range 7–9) <italic>P</italic> = 0.45 log-rank test, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022271-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). There was also no significant difference in days to first positive PCR between the vaccine and control groups by survival analysis (vaccine group median 5.5 days (range 5–5.5), control group median 5.5 days (range 5–6.5) <italic>P</italic> = 0.40 log-rank test, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022271-g007">Figure 7B</xref>).

Parasite density at diagnosis (vaccine group median 4602 p/ml [IQR: 1472–19632], control group median 3613 p/ml [IQR: 543–11402]) was not significantly different (<italic>P</italic> = 0.79 Mann-Whitney test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022271-g008">Figure 8C</xref>). Only 2/8 volunteers developed a malaria symptom (grade 1 myalgia in 2/8, feverishness in 1/8) at the time of blood-film diagnosis. After treatment initiation six volunteers developed minor grade 1 malaria symptoms. None had objective fever. There were no challenge-related laboratory abnormalities.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>We observed a significant inverse relationship between vaccine-induced GIA and parasite multiplication rate in vaccinated subjects. This is an important observation in a small sample, and needs to be confirmed in larger studies. However, there was no evidence to suggest that the magnitude of the vaccine-induced effect was sufficient to impact overall PMR in the vaccinated volunteers, and there was consequently no effect on pre-patent period. However the small sample size, particularly that of the control group, limited the statistical power to assess differences in PMR between the groups.</p>
              <p>GIA induced in most vaccinated volunteers may have been insufficient to significantly reduce PMR in comparison to unvaccinated controls. Although the volunteer with 90% <italic>in vitro</italic> growth-inhibitory activity had the lowest parasite multiplication rate (10-fold), in most volunteers the GIA did not reach this level. Other adjuvanted AMA1 vaccines have induced similar levels of GIA without a significant impact on estimated PMR, albeit after sporozoite challenge <xref rid="pone.0022271-Spring1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Modelled estimates suggest much greater antibody levels are required to control <italic>in vivo</italic> parasite growth <xref rid="pone.0022271-Hermsen1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Non-human primate studies have shown that very high antibody titers and <italic>in vitro</italic> growth inhibition of &gt;70% (using serum, not purified IgG) are needed for protection with AMA1 <xref rid="pone.0022271-Dutta1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Similar results in primates have been reported for another blood-stage antigen, MSP1 <xref rid="pone.0022271-Singh1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. A recent study indicates the pre-patent PMR in semi-immune Gambian adults is significantly lower than has ever been achieved by a blood-stage vaccine candidate in humans <xref rid="pone.0022271-Douglas1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>.</p>
              <p>As well as antibodies <xref rid="pone.0022271-Fowkes1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, other immune responses are likely to be involved in determining <italic>in vivo</italic> PMR, including, cytokines <xref rid="pone.0022271-Walther1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, T effector <xref rid="pone.0022271-Pombo1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> and T regulatory cells <xref rid="pone.0022271-Walther1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> and antibody-dependent cellular inhibition (ADCI) by monocytes <xref rid="pone.0022271-BouharounTayoun1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022271-Chimma1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> and neutrophils <xref rid="pone.0022271-Joos1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. We observed a clear relationship between homologous-strain log<sub>10</sub> ELISA titre and PMR in vaccinees but there was no relationship between PMR and the modest vaccine-induced CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses measured by <italic>ex-vivo</italic> IFN-γ ELIspot or ICS. This may reflect the insufficient magnitude of the T cell response, lack of statistical power to detect such a relationship, analysis of the non-protective T cell phenotype, or the absence of an association.</p>
              <p>The association between GIA and PMR in vaccinees reported in this study provides some support for a protective role of very high levels of GIA-inducing antibodies, but this result need not imply causation. A recent meta-analysis of prospective sero-epidemiological studies demonstrated an association between IgG to merozoite proteins and reduced clinical malaria <xref rid="pone.0022271-Fowkes1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Fewer studies have prospectively assessed functional antibody responses such as GIA <xref rid="pone.0022271-Goodman1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022271-Fowkes1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Most of these studies suggest that antibody demonstrating inhibitory activity <italic>in vitro</italic> contributes to a reduced risk of clinical malaria <xref rid="pone.0022271-Crompton1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022271-John1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022271-Dent1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, although some do not <xref rid="pone.0022271-Murhandarwati1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref> (reviewed in <xref rid="pone.0022271-Goodman1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>). The data are similarly conflicting in numerous animal models <xref rid="pone.0022271-Dutta1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022271-Singh1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022271-Murhandarwati2" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, suggesting that multiple potential immune effector mechanisms may operate in humans (reviewed in <xref rid="pone.0022271-Goodman1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>). Data from a sporozoite challenge trial of an AMA1-containing multi-stage virosomal vaccine demonstrated significant reduction in PMR without detectable GIA or cellular responses <xref rid="pone.0022271-Thompson1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. However, there was also a trend to reduced liver-emerging parasites. A similar significant reduction in liver-emerging parasites was observed with the adjuvanted AMA1 vaccine discussed above <xref rid="pone.0022271-Spring1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, which may have also induced strain-specific efficacy in a field trial in Malian children [Ouattara A., Takala-Harrison S. et al. Allele-Specific Efficacy of the Monovalent Apical Membrane Antigen 1 (AMA1) Malaria Vaccine FMP2.1/AS02A, American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, November 2010, Abstract #803]. In these studies it is therefore difficult to rule-out the possibility that PMR could have been influenced by immune responses to sporozoites, liver-stage parasites or liver-emerging merozoites, all of which express AMA1 <xref rid="pone.0022271-Spring1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. An inherent limitation of the blood-stage challenge model is thus an inability to detect any pre-erythrocytic vaccine efficacy. Another limitation specific to this inoculum is the requirement for volunteer EBV and CMV seropositivity, which adversely impacted recruitment in this study.</p>
              <p>There was an unexpectedly low frequency of clinical malaria symptoms pre-diagnosis (2/8 subjects) in this study in comparison to published data on the clinical features of experimental malaria in healthy volunteers following sporozoite challenge <xref rid="pone.0022271-Epstein1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. Parasite density at microscopic diagnosis (geometric-mean 4012 p/ml) was similar to that recorded in sporozoite-challenged control volunteers in a recent study (geometric-mean 4030 p/ml), 10/12 of whom were symptomatic at diagnosis [Ewer K, O'Hara GA, Duncan CJA <italic>et al.</italic>, submitted], suggesting potential attenuated pathogenicity of the blood-stage challenge parasites. Differential expression and rate of switching of expressed <italic>var</italic> genes by parasites in this inoculum after blood-stage passage has been reported, which could explain the reduction in clinical symptoms observed <xref rid="pone.0022271-Peters1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>.</p>
              <p>This is the first trial in humans to explore the relationship between vaccine-induced inhibitory antibodies and <italic>in vivo</italic> parasite growth rates following experimental blood-stage malaria infection. It increases by more than a quarter the total number of volunteers who have been experimentally infected with this inoculum, and is only the second vaccine efficacy study using this model. As the first Phase IIa challenge trial of AMA1-C1/Alhydrogel+CPG 7909, it contributes further safety and immunogenicity data on this protein-adjuvant combination. However, there is insufficient evidence to support future phase IIb clinical trials of this vaccine formulation in the immunisation regimen assessed here. While the blood-stage challenge model has limitations, the use of challenge studies (both blood-stage and sporozoite) should greatly speed the clinical development of blood-stage vaccines, allowing early demonstration of possible benefit and rational down-selection of vaccine candidates prior to field trials.</p>
