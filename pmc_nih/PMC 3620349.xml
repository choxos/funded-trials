              <abstract>
                <p>The development of resistance to chemotherapy is a major cause of relapse in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Though several mechanisms associated with drug resistance have been studied in detail, the role of carbohydrate modification remains unexplored. Here, we investigated the contribution of 9-<italic>O</italic>-acetylated <italic>N</italic>-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) to survival and drug resistance development in ALL cells. A strong induction of 9-<italic>O</italic>-acetylated Neu5Ac including 9-<italic>O</italic>-acetyl GD3 was detected in ALL cells that developed resistance against vincristine or nilotinib, drugs with distinct cytotoxic mechanisms. Removal of 9-<italic>O</italic>-acetyl residues from Neu5Ac on the cell surface by an <italic>O</italic>-acetylesterase made ALL cells more vulnerable to such drugs. Moreover, removal of intracellular and cell surface–resident 9-<italic>O</italic>-acetyl Neu5Ac by lentiviral transduction of the esterase was lethal to ALL cells in vitro even in the presence of stromal protection. Interestingly, expression of the esterase in normal fibroblasts or endothelial cells had no effect on their survival. Transplanted mice induced for expression of the <italic>O</italic>-acetylesterase in the ALL cells exhibited a reduction of leukemia to minimal cell numbers and significantly increased survival. This demonstrates that Neu5Ac 9-<italic>O</italic>-acetylation is essential for survival of these cells and suggests that Neu5Ac de-<italic>O</italic>-acetylation could be used as therapy to eradicate drug-resistant ALL cells.</p>

            <p>Pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) develops through malignant transformation of precursor B lineage cells in the BM. ALLs are stratified into different risk categories based on characteristics such as age and the presence of chromosomal abnormalities. For example, overall cure rates of pediatric patients currently exceed 80% to &gt;90–95% for some patient subsets, whereas those of older patients is only 40% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pui et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Salzer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gaynon et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Moorman, 2012</xref>). However, ALLs in all age groups that are characterized by the presence of the Philadelphia (Ph)-chromosome have a worse prognosis, with a rapid development of resistance to drug treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schrappe et al., 2012</xref>). The Ph-chromosome arises as one product of a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22. At the breakpoint, on the Ph-chromosome, a chimeric <italic>BCR/ABL</italic> oncogene is generated encoding a fusion protein with deregulated tyrosine kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Groffen and Heisterkamp, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pasternak et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ren, 2005</xref>). We generated a transgenic <italic>BCR/ABL</italic> mouse model for this type of ALL and are investigating mechanisms through which such leukemias are able to become drug tolerant and resistant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kaur et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fei et al., 2010a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Parameswaran et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Duy et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Park et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Feldhahn et al., 2012</xref>). However, it is currently unknown whether pre-B ALL cells that develop drug resistance have modified cell surface glycosylation.</p>
            <p>Sialic acids (Sia, e.g., <italic>N</italic>-acetylneuraminic acid [Neu5Ac]) are a family of 9-carbon acidic carbohydrates that are widely distributed in animal tissues, mostly found as α-ketosidically linked capping structures on the glycans associated with glycoconjugates such as glycoproteins and gangliosides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yu and Ledeen, 1969</xref>). The Neu5Ac-associated hydroxyl groups may be further modified with various functional groups including acetyl, lactyl, methyl, sulfate, or phosphate groups. Sialylation, the addition of sialic acid moieties, is an important type of glycosylation that may alter the physical properties of molecules in the plasma membrane and may regulate immune cell function, as well as serve as specific ligands for certain toxins and lectins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Varki and Varki, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schauer, 2009</xref>).</p>
            <p>Lectins are proteins that can detect specific carbohydrate structures and are widely used as species-independent detection tools. Interestingly, Achatinin H, a lectin which has a preferential specificity toward terminal 9-<italic>O</italic>-acetylated sialic acids α2-6-linked to <italic>N</italic>-acetylgalactosamine, has been proposed to be a useful diagnostic marker for childhood ALL and detect minimal residual disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chowdhury and Mandal, 2009</xref>). Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mukherjee et al. (2008)</xref>, using thin-layer chromatography on total cell lysates from childhood ALL peripheral blood (PB) mononuclear cells, found that a percentage of the disialoganglioside GD3 is modified by acetylation on the C9 position of the terminal Neu5Ac residue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ren et al., 1992</xref>). Their experiments with a T cell leukemia cell line further suggested a link between 9-<italic>O</italic>-acetylation of GD3 and T lymphocyte apoptosis because chemical removal of the 9-<italic>O</italic>-acetyl group by treatment with salicylic acid caused cell death.</p>
            <p>In the current study, we have investigated whether <italic>O</italic>-acetylation of Neu5Ac in glycoproteins/lipids, and in the ganglioside GD3 in particular, plays a role in the development of drug resistance and survival of adult pre-B ALL cells. We also used a lectin, isolated from the Californian crab <italic>Cancer antennarius</italic>, that binds specifically to Neu5Ac-containing glycoproteins and gangliosides that have been further modified by 4-<italic>O</italic> or 9-<italic>O</italic>-acetylation (9-<italic>O</italic>-Ac; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ravindranath et al., 1985</xref>) as a detection tool. Herein we report that induction of 9-<italic>O</italic>-acetylation on Neu5Ac is associated with drug resistance in ALL cells and also represents an unexpected Achilles heel for such leukemia cells because its removal is incompatible with ALL cell survival, regardless of whether these cells are co-cultured with stromal cells or are located in the very protective BM environment.</p>

                <title>Malignant pre-B cells express 9-<italic>O</italic>-acetylated GD3 (9-<italic>O</italic>-Ac–GD3)</title>
                <p>The human pre-B ALL cells used in this study were primary samples from patients that were passaged in NSG mice and then grown ex vivo on OP9 stromal cells. We have used this co-culturing technique to model the environment of leukemic cells in the BM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fei et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Parameswaran et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Duy et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Park et al., 2011</xref>). We included both Ph-positive and -negative ALLs in this and subsequent analysis because these distinct subclasses of ALL have a different prognosis and first-line therapy. We first investigated whether these cells express disialoganglioside GD3 and whether it is modified by 9-<italic>O</italic>-acetylation, using antibodies that specifically detect the CDw60 (also known as CD60b) epitope, representing 9-<italic>O</italic>-Ac–GD3. Because GD3 is synthesized in the Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen and Varki, 2002</xref>) and subsequently transported to the plasma membrane, we analyzed both intracellular and surface expression of 9-<italic>O</italic>-Ac–GD3. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>, 9-<italic>O</italic>-Ac–GD3 was clearly expressed on the surface of P2 ALL cells. The right shift in CDw60 detection after permeabilization indicated the presence of 9-<italic>O</italic>-Ac–GD3 inside the ALL cells as well. We also confirmed CDw60 and GD3 expression in several other human ALL samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>; and three additional samples not depicted). We used T cells from human PB gated on CD4 as a positive control for CDw60 detection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Because these ALL cells have been passaged in mice and cultured in vitro, we also analyzed CDw60 expression in gated CD19<sup>+</sup>, CD10<sup>+</sup> pre-B cells directly from BM and PB of several ALL patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>) to exclude the possibility that CDw60 induction has occurred during the cell culture process. CDw60 expression levels were also compared with those of pre-B cells in normal human BM. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>, there was little, if any CDw60 in normal CD19<sup>+</sup>, CD10<sup>+</sup> IgM<sup>−</sup> pre-B cells but clear expression in leukemic pre-B cells from primary human BM samples. This showed that 9-<italic>O</italic>-acetylation of GD3 is specific for transformed malignant pre-B cells.</p>

                <title>Absence of GD3 protects leukemia cells from drug-induced apoptosis</title>
                <p>To study the function of GD3 and 9-<italic>O</italic>-Ac–GD3 expression in pre-B leukemia cells, we generated <italic>BCR/ABL</italic>-transduced pre-B ALL cells from mice that lack GD3 synthase (St8sia1), the enzyme critical for GD3 synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen and Varki, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fukuda et al., 2005</xref>). Equal expression of Bcr/Abl was confirmed by Western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). We next compared the sensitivity of these cells to nilotinib. This is one of the targeted drugs that is used to treat Ph-positive leukemias and inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of Bcr/Abl. The IC50<sup>nilotinib</sup> values of pre-B ALL cells lacking GD3 and of WT were 36 nM and 20 nM, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>). Interestingly, loss of GD3 also significantly affected the ability of the pre-B ALL cells to recover from long-term nilotinib treatment compared with WT pre-B ALL cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>, whereas WT pre-B ALL cell cultures were eradicated by treatment with 24 nM nilotinib over a 12-d period, lack of GD3 synthase delayed the effect of this drug on ALL cell viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>, left) and viable cell counts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>, right) and allowed pre-B ALL cells to persist and resume proliferation. As a negative control, we also transduced pre-B cells with a <italic>BCR/ABL</italic> construct that carries the T3151. This mutation in the ATP-binding site of the Abl kinase makes the cells resistant to nilotinib. As expected, pre-B cells transduced with the T315I <italic>BCR/ABL</italic> mutant did not respond to nilotinib. These data demonstrate that the expression of GD3 in pre-B ALL cells in fact impairs the development of drug resistance.</p>

                <title>Increasing GD3 levels causes apoptosis in ALL cells</title>
                <p>In HEK-293, T cell, melanoma, and glioblastoma cell lines, the 9-<italic>O</italic>-Ac modification of GD3 was shown to be protective in nature, by neutralizing the proapoptotic effect of GD3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Birklé et al., 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Malisan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kniep et al., 2006</xref>). Thus 9-<italic>O</italic>-acetylation of GD3 as found in the ALL cells could be a defense mechanism to escape from apoptosis. If the balance of GD3 with its acetylated form determines cell survival, the disturbance of that balance, by increasing GD3 levels or by de-<italic>O</italic>-acetylating existing 9-<italic>O</italic>-Ac–GD3, should lead to cell death. To test this, we incubated the ALLs without OP9 stroma in the presence of exogenously added GD3. The human patient–derived pre-B ALL cells used in this study lost viability in the absence of stromal support, but, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref> (left), cultures treated with GD3 were more severely affected. The effect on diagnosis (US7 and TXL2) and relapsed (BLQ-1, BLQ-11, and US7R) patient samples were similar (not depicted). We then added GD3 to Ph-positive and -negative ALL cells co-cultured with stroma to investigate whether stroma has a protective effect against GD3-mediated ALL cell apoptosis. Although stromal support improved survival of untreated cells, GD3 treatment still caused significant loss of viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>, right), which correlated with increased Annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) staining of these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>). Exogenous addition of GD3 had no effect on cell cycle, as observed after 12 and 24 h of incubation of ALL cells with 50 µM GD3 (not depicted). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rippo et al. (2000)</xref> reported that enforced expression of Bcl-2 prevents GD3-induced mitochondrial changes, suggesting that targets of GD3-mediated death are controlled by Bcl-2. In concordance with this, we found that the decrease in viability caused by GD3 exposure correlated with a marked decrease in prosurvival Bcl-2 protein levels as determined by FACS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>).</p>

                <p>It was reported that in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) and skin fibroblast cell lines, newly synthesized or exogenously added GD3 is converted to 9-<italic>O</italic>-Ac–GD3 inside the cell and thus protects from GD3-mediated apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2006</xref>). We therefore investigated whether pre-B ALL cells can incorporate exogenous GD3 and modify it to the 9-<italic>O</italic>-acetylated form. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 D</xref>, there was a clear increase in GD3 detected by FACS on the cells treated with GD3, compared with untreated cells. Unexpectedly, levels of 9-<italic>O</italic>-Ac–modified GD3 were not increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 D</xref>, right).</p>
                <p>We next examined whether exogenously added 9-<italic>O</italic>-Ac–GD3 can reverse the proapoptotic effect induced by GD3. Interestingly, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 E</xref>, addition of 9-<italic>O</italic>-Ac–GD3 significantly increased both viability and viable cell counts of GD3-treated cells. <italic>St8sia1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> pre-B ALL cells proliferated more rapidly and showed less sensitivity toward nilotinib or GD3 monotreatment than pre-B <italic>st8sia1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> ALL cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 F</xref>). The combination treatment using nilotinib and GD3 further decreased viability and cell numbers of both <italic>st8sia1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and <italic>st8sia1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> pre-B ALL cells. These data show that GD3 is cytotoxic to ALL cells and indicate that the balance between GD3 and 9-<italic>O</italic>-acetylated GD3 determines ALL survival.</p>

We used the lectin from <italic>C. antennarius</italic> (CCA), which is able to detect <italic>O</italic>-acetylated Neu5Ac in a wider range of structures including glycoproteins and lipids, to examine this in the ALL cells. Compared with unstained controls, there was a clear presence of <italic>O</italic>-acetylated Neu5Ac–bearing structures on the surface of different human ALLs. Moreover, <italic>O</italic>-Ac Neu5Ac was also detected intracellularly in all ALL cells tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>, compare surface with total). We also confirmed the presence of <italic>O</italic>-acetylated Neu5Ac-bearing structures on the surface of CD19<sup>+</sup> CD10<sup>+</sup> pre-B BM and PB cells from different ALL patient samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>).

                <p>A similar increase in CCA lectin–reactive Neu5Ac structures on the cell surface was measured (MFI ratio US7 day 22 vincristine/US7 control = 5.4) in an experiment using US7 ALL cells and 5 nM vincristine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 A</xref>). We then assessed CCA lectin binding on mouse Bcr/Abl-expressing pre-B ALL cells and used different drugs to exclude the possibility that this increase is cell, drug, or species specific. <italic>BCR/ABL</italic> transgenic 8093 ALL cells that developed resistance to nilotinib similarly exhibited a marked increase in CCA lectin cell surface reactivity (MFI ratio 8093 day 8/8093 control = 4.81; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 B</xref>). We extended these observations by drug treatment of the pre-B ALL cells generated by retroviral transduction of normal mouse pre-B cells with the Bcr/Abl tyrosine kinase. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 (C and D)</xref> illustrates that both emerging tolerance to nilotinib and to the Akt inhibitor triciribine, drugs with very different mechanisms of action, correlated with increased CCA lectin–reacting cell surface expression. In contrast, resistance to dexamethasone did not develop under these conditions, and no increased CCA lectin signal was measured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 E</xref>). We further confirmed this by treating relapse human Ph-positive ALL cells, which express a T315I-mutated Bcr/Abl, with 24 nM nilotinib. These cells neither responded to the drug nor showed any increase in CCA signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 F</xref>).

                <p>This result indicates that 9-<italic>O</italic>-acetylated Neu5Ac–containing glycoconjugates different from GD3 also affect survival of ALL cells. To further investigate the contribution of this modification to ALL drug resistance, we flow-sorted mouse <italic>BCR/ABL</italic> transgenic ALL cells that had developed tolerance to 20 nM nilotinib (from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 B</xref>) into a CCA<sup>hi</sup> and a CCA<sup>lo</sup> fraction and observed their proliferation over a period of 7 d. Their viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 B</xref>) and growth (not depicted) were comparable. However, the CCA<sup>hi</sup> population developed tolerance to renewed exposure to nilotinib at a rate more rapid than that of the CCA<sup>lo</sup> population and was more sensitive to esterase monotreatment compared with CCA<sup>lo</sup> cells. Also, combined treatment with nilotinib and the esterase to remove 9-<italic>O</italic>-acetylated Neu5Ac affected CCA<sup>hi</sup> and CCA<sup>lo</sup> populations more than nilotinib monotreatment, indicating that the 9-<italic>O</italic>-Ac–Neu5Ac provided continued protection to the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 B</xref>). We also flow-sorted human US7 ALL cells that developed vincristine resistance around day 22 (from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 A</xref>) into CCA<sup>hi</sup> and CCA<sup>lo</sup> subpopulations. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 C</xref>, the CCA<sup>hi</sup> cells lost less viability when treated with vincristine and the esterase than the CCA<sup>lo</sup> subpopulation.</p>
                <p>The increased detection of CCA lectin–reacting molecules during drug resistance development could be either the result of selective outgrowth of an already existing CCA<sup>hi</sup> population or the result of increased expression. To analyze this, we monitored CCA reactivity on the CCA<sup>lo</sup> population as they were treated with vincristine and observed that CCA<sup>lo</sup> cells become CCA<sup>hi</sup> during the process of drug resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 D</xref>). This supports the concept that these cells gain CCA-detected structures as they adapt to the stress of the presence of vincristine. We also generated nilotinib-resistant WT pre-B ALL cells by culture for extended periods with nilotinib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 E</xref>). Next, these nilotinib-resistant cells with high CCA detection were treated with a second drug, vincristine. Surprisingly, the nilotinib-resistant cells attained resistance to vincristine significantly faster than the control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 F</xref>), and also the CCA lectin detection was further increased in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 G</xref>).</p>

                <p>Treatment with 5 mM sodium salicylate was reported to result in de-<italic>O</italic>-acetylation on T cell lines MOLT-4 and Jurkat and was proposed to occur through a chemical reaction involving the nucleophilic activity of salicylate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kniep et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mukherjee et al., 2008</xref>). The treatment resulted in a block in proliferation and increased death of the ALL cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 B</xref>). We verified that sodium salicylate treatment of ALL cells decreases Neu5Ac <italic>O</italic>-acetylation, as indicated by decreased binding of CCA lectin using FACS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 B</xref>, right, compare red line representing no treatment with blue line representing sodium salicylate–treated cells). However, coincubation of 9-<italic>O</italic>-Ac–GD3 with salicylate did not result in chemical 9-<italic>O</italic>-deacetylation of 9-<italic>O</italic>-Ac–GD3 in vitro, suggesting that the deacetylation observed in cells does not involve a chemical reaction on the <italic>O</italic>-acetyl moieties associated with Neu5Ac (not depicted).</p>
                <p>These methods remove cell surface <italic>O</italic>-acetyl moieties on Neu5Ac. To also remove 9-<italic>O</italic>-acetyl moieties from intracellular Neu5Ac-bearing structures, we expressed the <italic>O</italic>-acetylesterase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Malisan et al., 2002</xref>) in a lentiviral vector. As a control, we also generated a lentivirus encoding an enzymatically inactive S57A mutant <italic>O</italic>-acetylesterase. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 C</xref> shows that expression of the WT esterase in ALL cells had a very pronounced effect on their viability as well as on cell division. Based on BrdU staining, proliferation of these cells was severely inhibited (not depicted).</p>
                <p>The effect of <italic>O</italic>-acetylesterase activity on the ALL cells was so marked that it was not feasible to perform long-term experiments with the cells because the cultures died out after lentiviral transduction with the WT <italic>O</italic>-acetylesterase. For this reason, we generated a lentiviral construct with the <italic>O</italic>-acetylesterase linked to a 12-kD degradation domain from FKBP, resulting in continuous degradation of the enzyme. Stable production of the esterase protein can be induced by addition of a synthetic ligand for FKBP12, called “Shield-1” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Banaszynski et al., 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 D</xref> shows that the leakiness of the system in transduced human US7 ALL cells was small, with cultures of non–Shield-1–induced cells showing only minor decreases in viability and growth. In contrast, induction of the <italic>O</italic>-acetylesterase protein had a dramatic effect on the cells, with loss of viability measurable as early as day 3 and with total lack of cell proliferation. Similar experiments were performed, and results obtained, using the human Ph-positive ALL TXL2 (not depicted).</p>
                <p>Because expression of the esterase had dramatic negative effects on the survival of ALL cells, we tested the impact of esterase treatment on other malignant as well as normal cells, including bladder carcinoma, lymphoma, lung carcinoma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9 A</xref>), primary human PB, and BM cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9 B</xref>), MEFs, and human endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9 C</xref>). Esterase treatment had no effect on any of these cells tested, with the exception of the two lymphomas in which it caused a small decrease in viability.</p>

                <title>Removal of 9-<italic>O</italic>-acetyl moieties from Neu5Ac in vivo causes ALL cell death despite BM microenvironment protection</title>
                <p>These experiments clearly showed that removal of <italic>O</italic>-acetyl moieties from Neu5Ac has a drastic lethal effect on ALL cells, even when these cells are protected by direct contact with stroma. The optimal environment for ALL cells with maximal protection is the BM microenvironment, and BM recurrence after first-line therapy signals poor outcome in childhood ALL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rivera et al., 2005</xref>). Moreover, additional protective mechanisms beyond those provided by ex vivo stromal co-culture are available in vivo to promote ALL cell survival. To investigate whether ALL cells would survive de-<italic>O</italic>-acetylation when they are growing in the most protective location, we transplanted NSG mice with US7 cells transduced with the Shield-1–inducible esterase and allowed the cells to home to the BM and proliferate in that location for 6 d. PB samples taken from the animals at day 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10 A</xref>, arrow) showed, as expected, that human CD19<sup>+</sup>, CD10<sup>+</sup> ALL cells were already detectable in the circulation (not depicted). Animals were examined for the presence of ALL cells in BM and blood 3 d after the last induction of the esterase with Shield-1. BMs of the control animals, as expected, contained a high percentage of CD19<sup>+</sup>, CD10<sup>+</sup> human ALL cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10, B and C</xref>). Remarkably, we could detect no human ALL cells in the PB or BMs of the animals in which the <italic>O</italic>-acetylesterase had been induced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10 B</xref>, induced). This was a stunning result and led us to repeat the experiment with TXL2, which belongs to the subclass of Ph-positive ALL with poor prognosis. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10 C</xref> (right two panels), we observed significantly reduced ALL cells in BM and PB of esterase-induced mice as well. To examine the effect of de-<italic>O</italic>-acetylation of Neu5Ac on survival of ALL-bearing mice, we induced esterase expression by five repeated Shield-1 injections in mice transplanted with esterase-inducible US7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10 D</xref>). Control mice died around 36 d after transplant, whereas mice with induction of the esterase in the ALL cells survived twice as long as the controls.</p>

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>In the current study, we have shown that increased <italic>O</italic>-acetylation of Neu5Ac-bearing glycoconjugates is a hallmark of oncogenic transformation in pre-B ALL. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chowdhury et al. (2008)</xref> have used a different lectin commonly referred to as Achatinin H, which detects terminal 9-<italic>O</italic>-acetylated Neu5Ac that is α2,6-linked to <italic>N</italic>-acetylgalactosamine, to examine BMs and PB of 109 children with ALL for cell surface expression of 9-<italic>O</italic>-acetylated Neu5Ac using FACS. They further confirmed the specificity of detection by treatment of childhood ALL lymphoblasts with influenza C virus <italic>O</italic>-acetylesterase, which reduced Achatinin H reactivity from 90 to 12%. They concluded that this could be used as a marker for childhood ALL at presentation and after treatment to detect minimal residual disease. The <italic>C. antennarius</italic> lectin used in our experiments is not sensitive to the Neu5Ac linkage and identifies 9-<italic>O</italic>-acetylated gangliosides such as GD3 which contain α2,8-linked disialic acids as well as <italic>O</italic>-Ac Neu5Ac linked to glycoproteins in human melanoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ravindranaths et al., 1988</xref>). Using this broader-specificity lectin, we show for the first time that <italic>O</italic>-Ac Neu5Ac is a universal hallmark for ALL of both mouse and human origin: we detected it on human adult ALL cells including both Ph-negative and -positive subgroups, on presentation and relapsed samples, and on Ph-positive ALLs with and without the Bcr/Abl T315I mutation. Moreover, because Neu5Ac <italic>O</italic>-acetylation as detected by the <italic>C. antennarius</italic> lectin was induced by <italic>BCR/ABL</italic> oncogenic transformation of normal mouse pre-B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>), we showed that this is truly a cancer-specific marker. Although we could demonstrate, using the CDw60 antibody, that ALL cells were positive for 9-<italic>O</italic>-acetylated GD3, our results using pre-B ALL cells lacking GD3 synthase and thus deficient of GD3 clearly show that there are one or more other structures in ALL modified by <italic>O</italic>-Ac Neu5Ac.</p>
              <p>Importantly, our results also show that the <italic>O</italic>-acetylated Neu5Ac modification is not merely a tumor-specific marker. Because GD3 and its modification by 9-<italic>O</italic>-acetylation have been studied in other cell types, we first examined the contribution of GD3 to ALL cell survival. Our results are in agreement with those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Malisan et al. (2002)</xref> who have shown that HEK-293 cells were protected against the proapoptotic effects of GD3 by its 9-<italic>O</italic>-acetylation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mukherjee et al. (2008)</xref> also have shown that exogenous addition of GD3 induces apoptosis in childhood ALL lymphoblasts. In contrast to our study, this was performed in the absence of stroma and with a higher concentration of GD3. We have shown that even in the presence of stroma, which has the capacity to protect ALL cells against many drugs, GD3 can lead to apoptosis, and its effects were in fact reminiscent of those of chemotherapeutic drugs.</p>
              <p>Interestingly, our experiments showed that the ALL cells fail to 9-<italic>O</italic>-acetylate exogenously added GD3. In CHO cells, exposure to exogenous GD3 was shown to result in increased levels of 9-<italic>O</italic>-Ac GD3, and the authors concluded that in these cells, GD3 induces sialyl <italic>O</italic>-acetyltransferase (SOAT) production or activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Satake et al., 2003</xref>). Because ALL cells contain endogenous 9-<italic>O</italic>-Ac–GD3, it is reasonable to assume that the SOAT enzyme, which is directly or indirectly responsible for 9-<italic>O</italic>-Ac–GD synthesis, must be expressed in pre-B ALL cells. We can offer two explanations for the failure of ALL cells to react similarly to CHO cells. One is that the exogenously added GD3 is inaccessible to the SOAT, for example as the result of rapid internalization and transport to the mitochondria. Alternatively, if 9-<italic>O</italic>-Ac–GD3 is not synthesized from GD3 by a SOAT but by St8sia1 using GM3 and 9-<italic>O</italic>-Ac–Sia, exogenous GD3 will not be converted to 9-<italic>O</italic>-Ac–GD3 in these ALL cells.</p>
              <p>Our experiments with <italic>st8sia1</italic>-null mutant pre-B ALL cells clearly show that GD3 is not required for ALL survival because the <italic>BCR/ABL</italic>-transduced GD3 synthase KO cells survive and in fact proliferate much faster than WT cells. Interestingly, it has been hypothesized that GD3 may function to restrict neural progenitor cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lanctot et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yanagisawa and Yu, 2007</xref>). Thus, the reason that loss of GD3 increases ALL cell proliferation is of interest but is outside the focus of the current study and will require further investigation. Additionally, we found that the absence of GD3 also makes these cells less sensitive to drug treatment. We therefore considered the possibility that low levels of GD3 would correlate with increased ability to withstand drug treatment in human ALL cells, but we did not observe a correlation between the amount of cell surface GD3 expression and degree of nilotinib sensitivity in five Ph-positive ALLs that lack the Bcr/Abl T315I mutation (unpublished data).</p>
              <p>Unexpectedly, we found that increased expression of 9-<italic>O</italic>-Ac–GD3, and that of <italic>O</italic>-acetylated Neu5Ac in general, was induced on the surface of pre-B ALL cells by drugs that have very different modes of action, in both human and mouse pre-B ALL cells. This correlated with the emergence of tolerance to drug treatment in the absence of changes in total cellular levels of <italic>O</italic>-acetylated Neu5Ac. This implies that enzymatic activity of the SOAT is not responsible for these increases, but rather that increased cell surface transport of existing structures, reduced endocytosis, or the balance between these two causes these net increases. Our analysis of flow-sorted CCA<sup>hi</sup> and CCA<sup>lo</sup> ALL cells further does not support the idea that the measured increase is caused by the selective proliferation of a preexisting clone of ALL cells with a higher level of 9-<italic>O</italic>-acetylated Neu5Ac expression.</p>
              <p>9-<italic>O</italic>-acetylation of Neu5Ac, and in particular that of GD3 which has been most elaborately studied, is not restricted to cancer cells. 9-<italic>O</italic>-acetylated Neu5Ac–containing glycoconjugates and GD3 are expressed on CD4 T cells, on TPA-activated PB B cells, and activated tonsillar B lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Krishna and Varki, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vater et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wipfler et al., 2011</xref>). GD3 and oxidized GD3 were shown to be proapoptotic for ALL cells, and <italic>O</italic>-acetylation of Neu5Ac is thought to delay oxidation and degradation of the underlying Neu5Ac, as well as create new or mask existing ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schauer et al., 2011</xref>). Based on this, we speculate that the extracellular increase in 9-<italic>O</italic>-acetylated Neu5Ac seen upon transformation of pre-B cells and upon drug treatment of pre-B ALL cells are protective extracellular manifestations of the intracellular stress such cells experience as they successfully adapt to a radically changed cellular physiology.</p>
              <p>We are the first to demonstrate the high potential of de-<italic>O</italic>-acetylation to treatment of ALL. First, our data indicate that <italic>O</italic>-acetylation, presently considered a largely obscure modification of glycolipids and glycoproteins, correlates with the development of drug resistance in ALL cells. Importantly, our data show that 9-<italic>O</italic>-acetylated Neu5Ac not only signifies, but also actually supports drug resistance development. Finally, using different classes of ALL with different relapse risk, including Ph-positive and -negative ALL cells, in vitro and in vivo in mice, we show that removal of <italic>O</italic>-acetyl moieties from Neu5Ac kills ALL cells.</p>
              <p>In a survival experiment, mice transplanted with ALL cells containing the inducible esterase, which was induced five times over a period of 12 d, did relapse, but only after significantly prolonged survival compared with controls. We believe that relapse may have been caused by failure of the Shield-1 compound to adequately reach residual ALL cells in the BM, a typical site of relapse of human ALL patients treated with different drugs. Indeed, we were able to kill the ALL cells from these relapsed mice by in vitro treatment with fresh Shield-1 (unpublished data). This indicates that the cells that gave rise to relapse contained the inducible esterase and moreover were still sensitive to esterase activity, which supports the possibility that drug delivery, as opposed to esterase insensitivity, caused the relapse in these mice.</p>
              <p>We further found that esterase treatment had little effect on other cells tested here, including normal endothelial cells and fibroblasts. This suggests that toxicity of esterase treatment may be limited to specific cell types, an important consideration for a possible future therapeutic application. However, de-<italic>O</italic>-acetylation will require further exploration before it can be used as a workable therapy for the treatment of pre-B ALL. Other opportunities for novel drug therapies for ALL based on our findings include inhibition of the Neu5Ac 9-<italic>O</italic>-acetyltransferase that is responsible for the 9-<italic>O</italic>-acetylation of Neu5Ac and which remains largely elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arming et al., 2011</xref>). Alternatively, activation of the endogenous 9-<italic>O</italic>-acetylesterase SIAE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cariappa et al., 2009</xref>) specifically in ALL cells would similarly be expected to kill ALL cells.</p>
              <p>As mentioned above, the postglycosylation modification of GD3 by 9-<italic>O</italic>-acetylation has been previously reported for melanoma and glioblastoma cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Malisan et al., 2002</xref>). Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Birks et al. (2011)</xref> treated glioblastoma cell lines with SF9-produced recombinant esterase. Interestingly, they reported that increased GD3 and decreased 9-<italic>O</italic>-Ac–GD3 levels resulted in increased cell death in the glioblastoma cells, with little effect on normal astrocytes. As our data show that increased postglycosylation <italic>O</italic>-acetylation of Neu5Ac correlates with malignant transformation, the results described in the current study may have relevance to a more extended spectrum of malignancies such as breast cancer and melanomas, as well as their resistance to therapeutic drugs.</p>

HL-60, HEL, Wehi-3, and MOLT4 cells as well as 293 cells producing the CHE-Fc esterase, the bladder carcinoma (Scaber), lung carcinoma (SK-MES), and lymphomas (U937 and MC116) were obtained from the ATCC. MEFs were isolated from embryonic day (E) 14.5 embryos using standard procedures. Primary human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) were obtained from A. Epstein (Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA). Viably frozen BM from a normal donor and a patient with ALL were purchased from the National Disease Research Interchange. BM and PB cells from ALL patients and normal donors were obtained after approval of the committee on Clinical Investigations of Children’s Hospital Los Angeles.</p>

                  <p>Shield-1 was obtained from Cheminpharma LLC. The inducible ProteoTuner vector system was from Takara Bio Inc. FITC–<italic>C. antennarius</italic> (CCA) lectin was obtained from EY Laboratories. BD was the source of CD19, CD10, and IgM antibodies, the PI/Annexin V kit, and the cell fixation/permeabilization kit. Antibodies against CDw60 (M-T6004) and GD3 (R24) were obtained from Abcam. Anti–human CD4 antibodies were obtained from P. Ramakrishnan (California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA) and BioLegend, anti-GAPDH antibodies from EMD Millipore, and anti-BCR antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Purified GD3 and sodium salicylate were obtained from Matreya LLC and Sigma-Aldrich. Flow sorting was performed on a FACSort (BD). For detection of binding to CCA lectin, cells were incubated with CCA-FITC for 30 min at room temperature and washed two times with PBS<sup>−/−</sup> before analysis on an Accuri flow cytometer. For human leukemia cell detection, after RBC lysis, PB and BM cells were incubated with anti–human CD19 and CD10 antibodies for 30 min at room temperature.</p>
                  <p>For FACS analysis of viably frozen human BM and PB samples, the mononuclear cell fraction was separated using Ficoll. Separation of CD19-positive B cells was performed using CD19 magnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotec). For CCA lectin binding and CDw60 total staining, cells were fixed and permeabilized using a fixation and permeabilization kit (BD). 9-<italic>O</italic>-Ac–GD3 was synthesized from GD3 in-house according to our previous published acetylation methodology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kiefel et al., 1996</xref>).</p>

                  <p>Treatment with 5 mM sodium salicylate to remove acetyl groups was performed according to a published protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kniep et al., 2006</xref>). Isolation of the CHE-Fc chimeric protein from 293 cells stably expressing the construct (ATCC) was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Klein et al., 1994</xref>). A hemagglutination assay was performed to confirm the functionality of the purified CHE-Fc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Klein et al., 1994</xref>). In brief, twofold serial dilutions of CHE-Fc were combined with defined numbers of RBCs. RBCs that are not bound by the CHE-Fc form a button at the bottom of the well, whereas RBCs cross-linked by CHE-Fc form a lattice that coats the well.</p>

                  <title>Retroviral and lentiviral transduction.</title>
                  <p>Esterase WT and mutant constructs were obtained from F. Malisan (University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Malisan et al., 2002</xref>). The 2.6-kb esterase gene was subcloned into a lentiviral vector pCL-6-eGFP, digested with KpnI and XhoI. HEK 293-FT cells were cotransfected with pCL6-esterase-GFP, pCDNLBH packaging and VSVG envelope vectors. 48 h after transfection, conditioned medium containing the virus was collected, filtered, and concentrated by centrifugation. Concentrated virus was then added to the ALL cells. After 48 h of incubation, GFP-positive transduced cells were sorted on a FACSort. For the inducible expression of the esterase, the WT esterase gene was also subcloned into the pTuner Puro vector (Takara Bio Inc.). The pTuner GFP esterase lentiviral construct was made by deleting the Puromycin gene and adding GFP to the parent vector system. In these plasmids, a mutant of the FKBP protein (the destabilization domain, or DD) is expressed as a tag on the esterase gene. In the presence of the small, membrane-permeant, stabilizing ligand Shield-1, the DD-tagged esterase is stabilized (protected from proteasomal degradation) and accumulates inside the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Banaszynski et al., 2008</xref>). For retroviral transduction of pre-B cells, BM was pooled from three GD3 KO mice as well as from age-matched, sex-matched WT mice. HEK 293FT cells were cotransfected with plasmids <italic>BCR/ABL</italic> (P190)-IRES-neo or <italic>BCR/ABL</italic> T315I (a gift from N. Shah, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA) together with pHIT60 and pHIT123 (ecotropic envelope; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Soneoka et al., 1995</xref>) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After 24 h, the viral supernatant was collected and transferred to a 6-well plate coated with retronectin (Takara Bio Inc.). After centrifugation of the viral supernatant at 2,000 <italic>g</italic> for 90 min, pre-B cells were added onto the plates and again centrifuged at 600 <italic>g</italic> for 30 min. To select for pre-B cells, BM cells were cultured in the presence of 10 ng/ml recombinant mouse IL-7 for 2 wk. After 48 h of infection, cells were washed with medium and cultured further in the absence of IL-7. Cells were grown in IMDM with GlutaMAX (Invitrogen) supplemented with 20% FBS and β-mercaptoethanol. The sensitivity of <italic>BCR/ABL</italic>-transduced WT and KO cells to nilotinib was determined using a Cell Counting kit-8 (Dojindo Laboratories), according to the specifications of the manufacturer. In brief, 100 µl of a cell suspension (5,000 cells/well) was added to a 96-well plate. Plates were preincubated for 24 h in a humidified incubator. 10 µl of various concentrations of nilotinib were then added and incubation continued for 48 h. 10 µl of a CCK-8 solution was added to each well. After 1–4 h, absorbance was measured at 450 nm using a GENios multifunction microplate reader (Tecan).</p>

                  <p>All animal experiments were performed in concordance with Children’s Hospital Los Angeles Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and National Institutes of Health guidelines. We used NOD.Cg-Prkdc<sup>scid</sup>Il2rg<sup>tm1Wjll</sup>/SzJ mice (NSG; The Jackson Laboratory) for transplants of 3 × 10<sup>6</sup> US7 cells or TXL2 cells transduced with the inducible lentiviral <italic>O</italic>-acetylesterase construct. On day 6, PB samples were taken to assess the development of leukemia, and mice were then randomly assigned to a treatment or a control group (<italic>n</italic> = 4 or 5 per group). Treatment consisted of an i.p. injection with 10 mg/kg Shield-1 in 50% DMA, 45% PEG-40, and 5% Tween-80. For US7, injections were performed on days 7, 10, and 13, with analysis on day 16. For TXL2, injections were on days 6, 8, and 10 with analysis on day 12 for the presence of ALL cells in the BM and PB by FACS using human anti-CD19 and CD10 antibodies. The treatment schedule of US7-transplanted mice to measure survival is indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10 D</xref>.</p>

BCR/ABL-transduced pre-B cells were cultured in the absence of stroma. All cells were treated either with nilotinib (AMN107) or 2.5 nM vincristine for several days as indicated in the respective graphs. Every alternate day, medium was refreshed (fresh media with drug), and viable cell counts were performed using Trypan blue. In experiments using a combination treatment of GD3 with 9-<italic>O</italic>-Ac–GD3, both reagents were added every alternate day to US7 cell cultured in the presence of stroma. For Annexin V/PI staining, an FITC Annexin V Apoptosis Detection kit from BD was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions.</p>
