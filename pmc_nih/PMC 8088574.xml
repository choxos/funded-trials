                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Together, We Inspire Smart Eating (WISE) is an intervention for the early care and education setting to support childrenâs exposure to and intake of fruits and vegetables. WISE emphasizes 4 evidence-based practices (EBPs): (1) use of a mascot; (2) educatorsâ role modeling; (3) positive feeding practices; and (4) hands-on exposures. The current study reports on a small-scale implementation trial aimed at improving the use of WISE EBPs by teachers.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">A Hybrid Type III Cluster Randomized Design compared a Basic and Enhanced implementation strategy. The Basic Strategy included training and reminders only; the Enhanced strategy was a multi-faceted package of stakeholder-selected strategies including a leadership commitment, an implementation blueprint, a local champion, an environmental reminder of the EBPs, facilitation, and tailored educational resources and incentives. All study sites were Head Starts. Sites were randomized using a balancing technique that considered site characteristics; 4 sites (20 classrooms, 39 educators, 305 children) received Enhanced support; 5 sites (18 classrooms, 36 educators, 316 children) received Basic support. RE-AIM guided the evaluation, and implementation fidelity was the primary outcome. Strategies were assessed using examination of data distributions and unadjusted comparisons (<italic>t</italic> tests) as well as general linear and mixed effects models controlling for covariates.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">For the primary outcome of fidelity, the Enhanced group had significantly higher means for 3 of 4 EBPs. Multivariate models explained a significant portion of variance for both mascot use and hands-on exposure with a significant positive effect observed for treatment condition. The Enhanced group also had higher rates of Appropriateness and Organizational Readiness for Implementing Change (as indicators of implementation and adoption, respectively). There was no significant difference between groups for indicators of Reach, Effectiveness or Maintenance. Formative interviews indicated key targets for iteration and potential mechanisms. Key events were catalogued to provide context for interpretation (e.g., 61% of classrooms with turnover).</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p id="Par4">Findings were mixed but suggested promise for the Enhanced strategy, especially considering key events of the study. Implementation fidelity improvements occurred mainly in the last 3 months of the school year; additional time may be needed to translate to improvements in child outcomes.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par23">The rate of overweight and obesity in children between the ages of 2 and 5 years is 16% with significant increases in obesity and severe obesity in recent years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Given that early life obesity predicts weight trajectory and health outcomes in later life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], children need effective prevention and intervention efforts to reduce excess weight. One potential target of prevention efforts is childrenâs dietary habits. Diet quality is associated with weight status among children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], even after adjusting for physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Thus, poor quality diet is a key preventable predictor of excess weight.</p>
              <p id="Par24">The American Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics outlines research-based benchmarks for the early care and education setting (ECE, i.e., childcare) to meet childrenâs dietary needs and provide an environment for healthy growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. These include providing healthy foods, respecting child hunger and satiety, encouraging role modeling by educators, providing nutrition education, and providing training for educators. Implementation of these best practices in the early care and education environment has the potential for significant positive impact. For example, a 2016 systematic review by Sisson and colleagues found that interventions in the ECE setting frequently have desired effects on obesity (48%) and obesity-related outcomes (physical activity, 73%; diet, 87%; screen time, 63%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. A more recent umbrella review of 12 systematic reviews on the effects of ECE-based interventions found significant influences on childrenâs dietary habits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The strongest interventions on Obesity-related outcomes were those that addressed multiple components (e.g., child behavior, educator behavior, center policy) and engaged parents. These findings supportÂ that the ECE setting is an important context for implementation of evidence-based practices and programs to improve childrenâs diets and reduce risk for obesity.</p>
              <p id="Par25">Together, We Inspire Smart Eating (WISE) is an intervention designed for delivery in the ECE setting to support childrenâs exposure to and intake of fruits and vegetables and to promote the development of self-regulation for food intake. Prior research on WISE has documented positive impacts on educator knowledge and childrenâs intake of target foods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, the prior research also provides evidence of barriers that educators experience in attempts to implement the evidence-based practices that comprise WISE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Challenges in implementing WISE are not unique. For example, a review of 18 studies in ECE settings found that educators often do not follow evidence-based practices that include identifying hunger cues, avoiding the use of foods for celebration/reward, and allowing children to decide how much to eat without pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Active efforts are needed to close these implementation gaps.</p>
              <p id="Par26">A few studies have focused on promoting nutrition and preventing obesity in early childhood settings through the application of Implementation Science. To date, these studies, primarily in Australia, have deployed rigorous randomized designs to compare strategy packages to implementation as usual (i.e., no implementation strategies) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Strategy packages in these studies have included 5â9 discrete strategies including various combinations of supporting leadership, training staff, providing implementation staff, academic detailing, audit and feedback, resource materials, communication/marketing plans, and incentives/recognition. By and large, the results have supported the effectiveness of multi-faceted approaches for successful implementation of policies and environmental changes that support healthy eating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Singular implementation strategies (i.e., education, serial audit and feedback), however, have not outperformed control conditions at increasing implementation outcomes in early childhood settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Primarily, these studies have focused on supporting uptake of policy or guidelines and its implementation by center-level leadership (e.g., written physical activity/nutrition policies (PA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], restriction of screen time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], provision of only water/reduced fat milk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], provision of adult-guided movement/motor skill development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], monitoring of parent-packed lunches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], healthy school meal policies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], provision of fruit and vegetable breaks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], provision of staff training in nutrition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], provision of nutrition programs/resources for parents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], provision of healthy foods to children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], provision of learning about healthy foods, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]). Less research has targeted implementation strategies aimed at improving educatorâs use of evidence-based practices. Although educator behaviors such as role modeling healthy eating/PA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and encouragement of healthy eating/PA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] were targeted in one study, these outcomes were combined with center-level policy uptake when examining effectiveness of the implementation strategies.</p>
              <p id="Par27">Systematic reviews of implementation trials to improve policies and practices related to obesity prevention and nutrition and physical activity promotion have identified a focus on educational strategies in both ECE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and school settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Further, educational strategies have had inconsistent effects on targeted implementation outcomes. Researchers have less frequently studied more comprehensive strategy packages that address multiple levels of implementation. The systematic review of ECE studies identified no studies examining costs of implementation strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Examination of multi-level, multi-faceted strategies and documentation of their costs could have potential to advance the field.</p>
              <p id="Par28">The current study seeks to report on a small-scale implementation trial aimed at improving the use of the evidence-based practices of the WISE curriculum by early care and education teachers in the southern United States [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Specifically, after a rigorous process of partnership with stakeholders to select and tailor strategies, this study compared a âBasicâ implementation approach (i.e., training and reminders only) to an âEnhancedâ implementation approach including 8 discrete implementation strategies, tailored to individual contexts and educators (e.g., individualized incentives and resources, targeted facilitation). Throughout the study, we collected formative data from interviews with educators about their experiences in implementation and perceptions of implementation strategies. These data were used in collaboration with stakeholders to inform adjustments to the strategies both during and after the study. The study took the form of a small-scale randomized implementation trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] with the primary goal of examining preliminary effects on implementation outcomes.</p>

                <p id="Par29">This study used a small-scale Hybrid Type III Cluster Randomized Design with the goal of comparing a Basic and Enhanced multi-faceted implementation strategy (NCT03075085, see Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Hybrid Type III trials focus primarily on assessing the value of an implementation strategy or package of strategies for achieving improved implementation of evidence-based practices with a secondary focus on assessing effects on targeted health outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Our study is a small-scale implementation trial, defined in this way given the inclusion of only one ECE agency with 9 sites in a single county in one southern state as well as ongoing improvements to the implementation strategy based on formative evaluation. In ECE, a childcare site is a physical location serving multiple classrooms, typically with 2 educators per classroom and a director providing leadership to the site. In our study, all sites were under the administration of one centralized agency. A childcare site was deemed as a cluster for randomization, and all 9 sites of the participating agency were randomized to receive either Basic or Enhanced support. In total, 4 sites, 20 classrooms, 39 educators, and 305 children received Enhanced support; 5 sites, 18 classrooms, 36 educators, and 316 children received Basic support. Our full protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and developmental evaluation are described in detail elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In addition to monitoring implementation and child health outcomes, we collected formative and summative evaluation data to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and fidelity of the Enhanced WISE strategies during real-time implementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] and to guide revisions of the implementation strategies <italic>during the study</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Specifically, formative interviews with teachers were collected at the end of the fall and winter quarters of the school year (2018â2019).

Head Start provides services and education to children in families experiencing poverty. For example, a family of 4 qualifies for Head Start services in this state in 2020 if the household income is less than $26,200. The project informed all parents of the purpose of the study, and parents indicated if their children could participate in assessments and review of records for relevant information.

                <title>Intervention</title>
                <p id="Par31">WISE is a nutrition promotion and obesity prevention program designed to increase self-regulation and consumption of fruits and vegetables [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. WISE is designed specifically to be used in early care and education centers. It utilizes 3 components for its structure: (a) aÂ curriculum for the classroom, (b) aÂ trainingÂ for educators to implement the curriculum, and (c) a system to educate parents on WISE concepts. Lessons from the WISE program are taught on a weekly basis in classrooms and focus on introducing eight designated fruits and vegetables to the children. WISE emphasizes 4 key, evidence-based practices: (1) use of a mascot (Windy Wise, an owl) to give children a friendly character to associate with healthy eating; (2) educatorsâ role modeling positive food interactions for children to observe; (3) educatorsâ positive feeding practices to encourage childrenâs individual self-regulation and autonomy in eating; and (4) implementing hands-on, sensory experiences with target fruits and vegetables (called âfood experiencesâ) to increase awareness and acceptance of healthy foods. Previous research of WISE has shown positive impacts on childrenâs consumption of target fruits and vegetables [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Additional detail can be found elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p>

                <title>Implementation strategy selection and tailoring</title>
                <p id="Par32">We developed a multi-faceted implementation strategy by partnering with stakeholders through application of Evidence-Based Quality Improvement Panels (EBQI) that was delivered subsequently to the Enhanced condition. EBQI is a flexible process conducted across a series of meetings with topic-driven agendas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The EBQI panel consisted of Head Start educators (<italic>N</italic> = 7), directors (<italic>N</italic> = 2), and a cook (<italic>N</italic> = 1), along with parents of children (<italic>N</italic> = 2) in the Head Start program. To recruit stakeholders, the research team shared information on the study with sites and invited volunteers. Directors and educators volunteered based on these invitations. Directors nominated parents for the panel, suggesting parents they believed would be active and engaged participants. Directors collected consent to contact from parents, and the research team contacted the parents to discuss participation. Two meetings were dedicated to each WISE practice. First, we used structured activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] (e.g., card sort) to help guide stakeholders in prioritizing barriers and facilitators gathered in our prior qualitative work for each practice. Then, the research team mapped prioritized barriers and facilitators to implementation strategy options from the Expert Recommendations for Implementing Change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. In a second session, to reach a consensus on the multi-faceted implementation strategy package, we used techniques from concept mapping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] whereby stakeholders voted on the potential importance and feasibility of each potential strategy. We mapped rates of importance and feasibility onto âGoZoneâ plots to facilitate easy visualization of the ratings and subsequent discussion of educator preferences and prompt operationalization of their choices. The research team developed draft plans and materials based on these choices. Finally, the research team presented the draft strategies/tools, collected feedback for revisions, and received final approval to test them. Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> presents the specification of the resulting strategies consistent with recommendations from Proctor et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] in implementation strategy reporting. The strategies selected included obtaining a formal leadership commitment, developing an implementation blueprint, identifying and preparing a local champion, providing a reminder of the evidence-based practices on a cutting board for WISE lessons, delivering facilitation to support the context and educators in implementation, and distributing both educational resources and incentives based on educatorsâ implementation behaviors.

                <title>Facilitation</title>
                <p id="Par33">External facilitation by WISE staff was the implementation strategy selected by the EBQI as critical to the foundation of our approach. For this project, 3 individuals knowledgeable of the ECE context and WISE intervention acted as facilitators. All facilitators were employees of the research university; one was the study principal investigator (PI), and 2 were research assistants (RA). The PI had experience as an early educator and professional training in child development, psychology, and implementation science. One RA had over 20 years in the field as an educator and professional training in education; the second RA had over 5 years working with the WISE intervention and experience in community development. The study PI and the second RA completed the Veteranâs Affairs Quality Enhancement Research Initiative (VA QUERI) Implementation Facilitation Training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. This training informed the strategy and activities of the facilitators; all facilitators reviewed this manual together prior to facilitation and built consensus around operationalizing facilitation practice in the childcare setting. Key aspects of facilitation (e.g., framing to educators, interface with champion, desired frequency) were discussed and refined with the EBQI panel. Fidelity data collection, formative interviews, and EBQI feedback guided the facilitation strategy. Facilitators prioritized working with classrooms with the lowest fidelity to address barriers, assess support needs, and build relationships with those experiencing implementation challenges. Facilitators did not participate in data collection.</p>

                <p id="Par34">The biostatistician, who was blinded to sites, randomized sites to conditions using tools from the randomizeR package in R software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. First, the software generated all possible assignments of the 9 sites to the 2 conditions. Second, this set of combinations was narrowed to those with a similar number of sites in each condition (i.e., n<sub>Basic</sub> = 5 and n<sub>Enhanced</sub> = 4). Third, key characteristics of the sites were considered including site-level average scores on the Organizational Readiness for Change Assessment (ORCA), number of classrooms, presence of a stakeholder from the EBQI panel, use of family style meals (yes/no), location of lunch meal (classroom/lunchroom), and site-level average scores on existing educator mealtime practices (both supportive and unsupportive). These characteristics were collected through a pre-implementation educator survey and considered for balancing randomization given the variability among sites in characteristics relative to this specific intervention (e.g., existing nutrition practices) and to implementation more generally (e.g., implementation climate). Fourth, MANOVA was used to compare treatment groups for all possible group assignments in step 2. Random assignments that produced groups similar on the vector of covariates (i.e., MANOVA <italic>F</italic> statistic &lt;â3) with a difference of five or fewer in the number of classrooms in each condition were retained. This yielded 130 possible random assignments. Finally, the biostatistician used the random sample tool to select one combination from the 130 remaining combinations.</p>

The trained observers (<italic>N</italic> = 11) consisted of undergraduate students in the fields of sociology and child development, graduate students in the fields of nutrition and psychology, and working professionals trained in education and public health. A 4-h, in-person observer training focused on (a) each itemâs purpose, supported by examples; (b) examining fidelity ratings; and (c) subtle integration and observation within the classroom. Videos were used for observers to practice coding the forms, initially with the aid of a gold-standard observer and then independently. Prior to field observation, observers attained an inter-rater reliability of at least 85% on two occasions. Upon reaching reliability with video, observers were required to demonstrate reliability in a project classroom with a gold-standard observer. Observations occurred in every classroom once per quarter (i.e., SeptâNov, DecâFeb, MarchâMay).</p>

REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) is a secure, web-based software platform designed to support data capture for research studies. The log captured date, facilitator name, site, start and end time, estimated travel time, event type, mode of communication, personnel contact, primary and secondary activities, follow-up needed, as well as any resource delivery. Facilitators indicated the event type as one of six options: in-person, prep time, one-on-one meeting, site visit, meal, or WISE lesson observation. Mode of communication captured whether the contact was in-person, by phone, or email. Facilitators marked all personnel they had contact with while at each site. The list included Directors, Site Champions, Lead and Assistant Educators, Family Service Coordinators, Admin personnel, Clerical Support, and Site Cooks. Facilitation activities, drawn from the VA QUERI manual and redefined for our study, included Assessment, Program Adaptation, Problem Identification/Problem Solving, Program Marketing, Stakeholder Engagement, Audit and Feedback, Network Development, and Education. The facilitator would also select the primary activity for each visit. If follow-up was needed, notes were added for the follow-up. These logs informed estimation of costs.</p>

Specifically, educator and classroom level outcomes were examined using <italic>t</italic> tests. To explore adjusted group differences and inform future studies, we also examined group differences using general linear and mixed effects models controlling for covariates, which are reported in Supplementary File <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> due to the under-powered nature of these analyses. The sample size and related power for child level outcomes also allowed mixed effects general linear models to account for nesting of children within classrooms. Approximately 2% of youth at both RRS data collection time point yielded values &lt;â3000 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>], and these values were treated as missing due to the unreliability of estimates in this range. Only youth with pre- and post-data for Effectiveness outcomes (RRS and BMI) were retained in respective analyses. Youth with less than 5 months between anthropometric assessments were not included (<italic>n</italic> = 34) to limit variability between measurement occasions. All available cases were used in the remainder of analyses.</p>
                <p id="Par50">Qualitative analyses of interviews were pragmatic and deductive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>], reflecting a directed content analysis approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Specifically, the research team focused on identifying barriers and facilitators for the i-PARIHS constructs of innovation and context as well strengths and weakness of each implementation strategy. Three coders (the TS, JM, and MD) completed analysis of interviews. First, all 3 coders coded one interview together as a group and came to consensus on coding. Then, the coders coded an additional two interviews individually before coming together to compare codes, refine the start list into a codebook with examples and define decision rules (e.g., quotes may be coded with multiple codes). Next, JM and MD coded 3 interviews and compared their coding to ensure shared understanding of the codebook; the TS resolved disagreements when consensus was not present and helped to specify the codebook further when needed. Finally, MD coded the remaining 8 interviews, consulting JM and the PI on codes that were not clear (Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>).

                  <p id="Par52">Of the 20 classrooms who received Enhanced support, 18 completed a full school year, and 2 were added mid-year. All directors at the Enhanced sites took part in a pre-implementation meeting with a WISE facilitator in which the formal commitment was discussed and signed and the implementation blueprint reviewed. Each Enhanced site designated a Champion who received a 2-h training in navigating challenges, educating their peers, and advocating for WISE at their center.</p>
                  <p id="Par53">Delivery of facilitation was consistent with planned levels. On average, each site was visited 19 times across the school year with an average of 4 visits per classroom. Each visit lasted, on average, 30 min. The top activities were Stakeholder Engagement and Education. Educational resources were delivered systematically at the end of the Fall and Winter quarters and on an as needed basis in between. In total, 46 educational handouts were distributed across classrooms at Enhanced sites. On average, each classroom received 2.6 handouts (Min = 0, Max = 7). Brief educational videos to reinforce the WISE components (<italic>N</italic> = 37) were distributed across classrooms at Enhanced sites, an average of two video resources per classroom (Min = 1, Max = 5).

                  <p id="Par54">Costs of both the Basic and Enhanced multi-faceted strategy were estimated. The Basic strategy costs totaled $640, which included the cost of WISE training ($400), and 10 h of an RAâs time to create the WISE Newsletters ($23.88/h salary and benefits). This cost corresponds to $35 per classroom in the Basic condition. The Enhanced multi-faceted strategy estimated costs totaled $5218, which included salary and fringe benefits for 3 facilitators, allowable mileage reimbursements at a rate of $0.42/mile for travel expenses, and the actual cost of incentives and resources. The facilitator salaries included that of the PI and two RA facilitators. In total, this corresponds to $261 per classroom in the Enhanced condition. In-person facilitation accounted for 25% of our Enhanced costs; travel accounted for 23%; and incentives and resources accounted for 21%.

Conversely, Enhanced classrooms began with 20% of classrooms achieving fidelity to hands-on exposure at the fall assessment and increased to 33% by the spring assessment. This resulted in a 27% difference in classrooms achieving fidelity between conditions at the spring assessment. Dispersion of fidelity scores for the 3 fidelity practices with univariate differences were explored while considering turnover in the classroom (See Supplementary File <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>, Figures 3â5). For role modeling, the Enhanced group showed a higher mean as well as lower dispersion around the mean with several classrooms with turnover performing well at the final data collection. For mascot use, the Enhanced group showed a higher mean with a grouping of classrooms at the top-end of the scale; classrooms with turnover seem to perform better on role modeling in the Enhanced condition versus classrooms with turnover in the Basic condition. For hands-on exposure, the Enhanced group showed a higher mean; however, the classrooms with turnover did not have an advantage in the Enhanced condition.

And gave everybody a copy. And we did have our training on this.</td></tr><tr><td>Cutting Board</td><td>âWell, to be honest, I seen that thing, but I didnât know what it was for. And we had brought our own cutting board to use. Yea. We got it. But we didnât know it was a cutting board. But we didnât know it was a cutting board until about two weeks ago.â</td><td>âI love it. I use it for cutting the food, preparing the food on that. Itâs so easy because you can just take it to the kitchen and get hot water and just you know wash it and wipe it off and re-use it again. Itâs just niceâ¦.They said that it is Windyâs cutting board and you canât touch it.â</td></tr><tr><td>Champion</td><td>None identified.</td><td>âOn Wednesday, when we have our staff meetings, sheâllâ¦She asks us howâs it going. She gives us some tips, âcause she gave us some good tips on, cause she said, the last thing she gave us was tips with what to do with our food experience. And she was talking about the small group time too, having them in small group. Which is help out, it does help out though with smaller groupâ¦ Sheâll come in here and ask me, you know, different tips on the WISE experience, what did we do, and what kind of activities did I do with the kids.â</td></tr><tr><td>Handouts (resources)</td><td><p>âI think the lady that delivered them came on a bad day. The day that she did it, we didnât accept them very well.

Well, I mean, they were helpful looking at different things telling us how different classrooms or other people did things, and it was just informative. Like especially the one this morning I looked at. And I was like, you know, I put my food on the plate, you know, âcause we have to eat the same things with them. And it was just on the plate, and Iâm talking to them and stuff, but every once in a while, they say, â___, are you gonnaâ¦ you donât like it?â you know. So really go ahead and eating, tasting, you know, âcause we want them to taste it, we gotta taste it. They were very appealing. Thereâs nothing I would change. Theyâre short enough, you know, enough time you can look at it and go on and grab the information. I think there was a part where I read and then the video came through.â</td></tr><tr><td>Incentives</td><td>âI donât know who she gave it (bad report) to because she came back and she gave the other classroom a gift, an award, and a certificate, and didnât give ______ nothing. Well you all didnât do what you were supposed to do. We were like what were we supposed to do? The kids were engaged, we talked to them, and we encouraged them. They at the taste test, we did math with the apples, we did this and you still gave us a bad report. Oh no something is wrong with this picture...and the teachers donât even know how they got them (incentives) because they said âWe didnât do nothingâ.â</td><td>âI love it. Keep bringing it in, we need more stuff. [Unintelligible] we got so excited. And ____ got the stamp, the Windy Wise stamp, and when I took it over there to her, I was like âlook what you got for using Windy!â She was like, âwow! You know itâs real, likeâ¦I donât think the people expected they were going to get incentives or whatever. But I think theyâre real nice, just keep them comingâ¦ So Iâm pretty sure the other teachers are kind of grateful. I would just say grateful, but theyâre probably glad that they are receiving something, because then theyâre showing their efforts are being appreciated.â</td></tr><tr><td>Facilitation</td><td>âYou have to get WISE in and you have to get this in. And then people coming in to observe you. Itâs like the magnifying glass is on you. You knowâ¦and then they are going to find something wrong. You not doing this the right way. Then um you likeâ¦when the lady came in to us we were doing apples right? And I donât know if we didnât do it the right way, or we did something wrong, or whatever. She gave us a bad report. I feel like we did good because the kids were engaging and they were doing everything. They did the taste test and they cut, and they counted, and they did all of that and she gave us a bad report. So I donât know if it was because we didnât do the activity that she had planned on seeing from us I donât know who she gave it to because she came back and she gave the other classroom a gift, an award, and a certificate, and didnât give ____nothing. Well you all didnât do what you were supposed to do. We were like what were we supposed to do? The kids were engaged, we talked to them, and we encouraged them. They ate the taste test, we did math with the apples, we did this and you still gave us a bad report. Oh no something is wrong with this picture.â</td><td><p>âThey were pretty communicative. Yeah, they pretty much communicated with me about everything. If I asked for something, I think I asked for something one time, they brought it back over.â</p><p>âWell, they give us good support. I canât say that they donât give us good support because they do. And when they come if we have any questions or anything, they are right here to answer it for us so thatâs great. They are great resources and support for us.â</p></td></tr><tr><td>WISE innovation</td><td><p>âIt says as a small group, I kind of like it better as a large group because I guess it's better for me. But like I'm going to try with the smaller group.â</p><p>âOoh, the hardest part, if itâs something that I donât likeâ¦ most times I put it towards my mouth, and [?] you know, chewing, like Iâm really eating it and stuff like that. But most times, the stuff that we have, most times I try it.â</p></td><td><p>âBeing able to taste the...well giving the children that experience, the tasting of fresh fruits and vegetables.â</p><p>âThe best thing so far is that we have to have cooking experience, we donât have to come up with anything, weâre getting the supplies that we need for the cooking experience, and theyâre healthy.â</p><p>âAnd I think that once the children get used to having Windy to bring vegetables and fruits and if you all stop, then I think that besides at school they might not get it. So, I would say just keep on doing it because that may would encourage children to eat healthier and less obesity.â</p><p>âWell the best thing that I figure with WISE is that the children get to experiment or participate in different types of fruit and vegetables that they may not eat at home. So thatâs a good thing and introducing it to them. Some of them donât even know what it is soâ¦we introduce that fruit and vegetable to them and they get to taste it, feel it, and touch it. The parents donât cook it or use it at home or make it.â</p></td></tr><tr><td>Context</td><td><p>âThe worst thing is not getting the supplies on time. We do it on Tuesdayâs. Mm-hmm. Or sometimes it comes after the time that we are supposed to have itâ¦ We just fill the time with something else, or we will go ahead and talk about that vegetable or fruit or whatever it is and we will just talk about it, but we wonâtâ¦ we will do something small, but not the activity that is actually planned for that dayâ¦We donât go back.â</p><p>âThe hardest thing for me was just getting started, being the only person, the only teacher in here. But thatâs about it. Itâs not really too hard this far. Like we have all the supplies, we have Windy Wise, and I like talking with the puppet with them. So, not too hard. Just having another person in here. When I did the experience, maybe someone else be in here with me. Sometimes I did have another TA like me, but just explaining and all that, it still kind of fell on me to do the whole thing.â</p><p>âThereâs no input from my site manager. Thereâs no input or like, coming to see if we, you know, just sitting in on the class to see what weâre doing or something, soâ¦ No thatâs just it, being involved in the whole thing when weâre doing it, just to see how weâre doing and how the kids are enjoying it.â</p><p>âWe donât really [talk about WISE]â¦well when it first got started we would talk about it. I think a lot of us were complaining about it, but we would just do it you knowâ¦kind of getting used to it now so.â</p></td><td><p>âShe [director] will come in sometime. Well I don't know what she did in the rooms. But she will come in and she would actually sit down and join us for the experience or you know, and sometimes she would help because it was hard to do in small groups and she would kind of help micro manage stuff.â</p><p>âWe have teachersâ meetings on every Tuesday, and we talk about WISE. All of them like it. They are really fascinated over it.â</p><p>âWe [teachers] do it [talk about WISE] almost every day. Cause we, you know, we wanna, that way we know what weâre supposed to do for that day. And it helps us, it helps us, you know, along, cause that way she might be doing something different activity with her kids, and helping, you know, with my kids. You know, I may be doing something different I may help her with, but itâs not like every day.â</p><p>âAnd she [director] reminds us and if we don't have the supplies we need, she do make sure we get them.â</p></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p>

Table <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref> presents a catalogue of these events consistent with the key events template from Woodward et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. These key events provided important context for interpretation of study findings and for understanding changes to the study protocol. Because of these challenges, our partnering site lifted the requirement for end-of-year family assessments. These end-of-year assessments would have supplied the food frequency questionnaire data to provide an additional indicator of Effectiveness and were not included in the study as planned. In addition, the study team planned to use the ORCA instrument as our key indicator of Adoption. However, we gathered feedback on our instruments from stakeholders who felt ORCA items were cumbersome and difficult to answer. Stakeholders preferred items from the Organizational Readiness for Implementing Change (ORIC) instrument [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>], primarily for reasons of clarity. We retained ORCA as a baseline assessment, which was completed anonymously by staff at a professional development day near the end of the prior school year and averaged across staff at the same site to obtain a site-level organizational assessment. We used ORCA to inform randomization and ORIC as an indicator of adoption. Additions to the published protocol included collection of the baseline survey to inform randomization, process evaluation of the delivery of the multi-faceted implementation strategy package, and estimation of costs for its delivery.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par67">The stakeholder-selected strategies in this study demonstrated significant improvements on indicators of Adoption and Implementation. Specifically, the Enhanced group had significantly higher fidelity to 3 WISE EBPs, Organizational Readiness for Implementing Change, and perceived Appropriateness. Despite these indicators of promise, the multi-faceted strategy package did not translate to improved effectiveness outcomes for children within the school year timeline. In 2019, experts in implementation science recommended an agenda for advancing research on implementation strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. Our study design aligns with suggested priorities. First, our study combined approaches (concept mapping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], evidence-based quality improvement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], liberating structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]) to âenhance the design and tailoring of implementation strategiesâ that were tested in the Enhanced condition of our study. Our process is the first stakeholder-partnered initiative to build and test implementation strategies in early care and education. Second, we collected data on the costs of delivering the multi-faceted implementation strategy package. A focus on cost was added to provide information on the potential scalability of the multi-faceted strategy. This was possible because we deployed an app-based approach to âtracking and reporting of implementation strategiesâ that allowed us to provide detailed information on the dosage and content of the implementation strategies. That is, we adapted a system by Ritchie and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>] for tracking facilitation activities for field work to track delivery of all implementation strategies. Thus, our study illustrates best practices and advancements in implementation science studies, especially as applied in a community setting.</p>
              <p id="Par68">The improvements observed in the proportion of classrooms achieving fidelity ranged from 5 to 31% for our Enhanced group (for the 3 improved EBPs, see Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Prior reviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>] have reported on the median effectiveness of some of the discrete strategies that were included in our enhanced multi-faceted strategy package. For example, in healthcare settings, printed educational materials have accounted for a median of 4% improvement in healthcare professionalsâ practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>], the relative same proportion of practices improved by audit and feedback [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. A review of educational outreach identified 5.6% median improvement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>], while local opinion leaders (akin to Champions in our study) have been linked with 11% improvement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. Further, a 2016 review of 10 implementation studies in childcare for healthy eating, physical activity, and obesity prevention practices, policies, and programs found between 0 and 9.5% implementation of targeted innovations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. These observations provide context for the interpretation of the improvements we observed (i.e., our fidelity increases exceeded those observed in these studies), which are unique from prior implementation work in the target of early care and education teachers as the implementers of interest for nutrition practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par69">Consistent with prior work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>], our study demonstrated positive effects of the WISE intervention on child intake of carotenoid rich foods. However, like the majority of other studies aimed at implementing practices and policies to improve child weight in the early education setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>], no effect on BMI was observed. We believe the findings on child outcomes should be considered in tandem with findings on implementation fidelity. Specifically, educators in the Enhanced group increased in their fidelity to the intervention across the school year while educators in the Basic group remained the same or decreased in their fidelity resulting in the significant treatment difference. Thus, children in Enhanced classrooms were receiving a higher quality intervention experience near the end of the study (and time of outcome assessments), but their aggregate experience with the intervention across the school year was lower and nearer to the Basic group (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). BMI is a difficult metric to shift in community-based interventions given the complexity of settings in which families live, eat, and interact and the variety of factors that affect weight (e.g., diet, activity, stress, sleep) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. Therefore, it is not surprising that children in the Enhanced group, where educator improvement was largely in the last quarter of the year, did not differ from the Basic condition. Longer follow-up assessment periods may be required to see if improvements in fidelity translate to improvements in child outcomes.</p>
              <p id="Par70">This study includes both limitations and strengths. Foremost, there were a number of unforeseen and unusual circumstances for our partnering sites beyond the normal challenges of ECE that may limit the generalizability of our findings. Achieving these outcomes in light of key events of the study suggests promise for testing the multi-faceted strategy beyond the challenging circumstances of this sole agency and single school year. For example, the turnover documented in this study (43% of teacher positions overall, up to 72% per site) is notably higher than national estimates for Head Start turnover (17â20%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. Further, the uncertainty of the programâs funding and the news of coming layoffs and site/classroom moves near the end of the trial were disruptive. The research team adapted to these changes in delivery of implementation strategies (e.g., protocols to introduce WISE and facilitation to new educators), data collection (e.g., reducing planned maintenance analyses), and data interpretation (i.e., focus on univariate analyses and visual examination of data). The <italic>t</italic> test comparisons used as a result of these adaptations do not account for nesting in the data structure (i.e., teachers in sites), potentially leading to deflated standard errors and an increased chance of type I errors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. Finally, the Basic implementation group included only delivery of educational strategies (training and newsletters only), which may be seen as a less valuable comparison with a more active implementation strategy package. However, the content of the Basic implementation strategy was consistent with a recent review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] documenting educational implementation strategies as those most commonly used in childcare-based implementation studies.</p>
              <p id="Par71">These limitations are offset by a number of strengths. This implementation effort was guided by an implementation framework (i-PARIHS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>] that directed identification of key barriers and facilitators to use of the EBPs as well as collection of stakeholder feedback for the selection and tailoring of strategies, illustrating methods for theory-driven, community-engaged dissemination and implementation research. Further, we deployed a rigorous process evaluation, which will inform further iteration to the multi-faceted implementation strategy package. Formative interviews indicated key targets for improvement (e.g., improve explanation of site champion role to other teachers) as well as suggestions for exploration of the mechanisms of influence for these strategies (e.g., relationship with site champion). The PI was involved at each stage in the qualitative data collection and analyses, allowing for interpretation of findings to be evaluated alongside experience in the interviews. We also collected information on the costs of delivery of the strategy package, a gap in implementation studies of healthy eating, physical activity, and obesity studies in ECE to date [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par72">Findings of this study suggest several areas for future research. First, the component of WISE fidelity, that was not improved by the implementation strategy, was feeding practices. Evidence-based feeding practices of WISE were in conflict with other behaviors and attitudes that were prevalent among educators (e.g., pressuring to eat more, comparing childrenâs eating). These contrasting behaviors can compete for use at WISE lessons and mealtimes suggesting the need for a focused effort on de-implementation of inappropriate practices to determine if this supports both a reduction in use of such practices and creates space for implementation of supportive feeding practices. Second, the multi-faceted strategy tested in this study may be too resource-intensive and/or unnecessary for all sites in large-scale delivery. An adaptive implementation approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>] which includes critical decision points and tailoring variables to inform optimized delivery in the real world may be beneficial. Finally, this study illustrates some of the organizational challenges faced by the ECE setting. Specifically, general capacity (as an element of organizational readiness) includes an organizationâs receptivity to change, the culture and climate of the organization, resource allocation, leadership support, day-to-day processes, and staff skills and expertise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. Greater focus on organizational factors, and general capacity in particular, may be needed to advance implementation efforts in ECE. That is, efforts to stabilize the workforce, support a positive work environment, and prepare leadership to balance competing priorities to lead change may be needed as a foundational strategy.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p id="Par73">Overall, the study achieved many objectives that will be relevant to the field. First, we established and refined the mobile approach for auditing fidelity to our implementation strategy. We have posted the link to our log for public access; this can serve as an example to future intervention studies for leveraging a common resource (REDCap) for documenting delivery of implementation strategies. Second, we applied a rigorous mixed methods approach to document the challenges faced by participating sites and our personnel, and our adaptations to meet these challenges can be standardized and replicated in future implementation efforts. This has the potential to improve ongoing dissemination of the WISE intervention as well as future implementation studies in the ECE environment. For example, our qualitative data suggest incentives be used with caution in this context. Finally, although this study was powered for examining nested, multivariate models for child outcomes, other models were under-powered to account for nesting at the site level. Future implementation studies of WISE should include a greater number of sites for improved power and may need to consider a longer follow up time for assessing child effects given that teacher improvement occurred late in the school year. In addition to providing support for our multi-faceted strategy on indicators of Adoption and Implementation, the comprehensive nature of our evaluation provides a model for other studies assessing implementation strategies in ECE settings.</p>
