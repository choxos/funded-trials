                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>There is some evidence that social media interventions can promote smoking cessation. This randomized controlled pilot study is the first to evaluate the feasibility and potential efficacy of a Facebook smoking cessation intervention among Alaska Native (AN) adults.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="s2">
                  <title>Aims and Methods</title>
                  <p>Recruitment and data collection occurred from December 2019 to March 2021. Participants were recruited statewide in Alaska using Facebook advertisements with a targeted sample of 60 enrolled. Participants were stratified by gender, age, and rural or urban residence and randomly assigned to receive referral resources on evidence-based cessation treatments (EBCTs) (control, <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 30) or these resources plus a 3-month, closed (private), culturally tailored, Facebook group (intervention, <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 31) that connected participants to EBCT resources and was moderated by two Alaska Native Trained Tobacco Specialists. Assessments were conducted online post-randomization at 1, 3, and 6 months. Outcomes were feasibility (recruitment, retention, and intervention engagement), self-reported use of EBCTs, and biochemically confirmed seven-day point-prevalence smoking abstinence.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="s3">
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Of intervention participants, 90% engaged (eg posted, commented) more than once. Study retention was 57% at 6 months (no group differences). The proportion utilizing EBCTs was about double for intervention compared with the control group participants at 3 and 6 months. Smoking abstinence was higher for intervention than control participants at 3 months (6.5% vs. 0%, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = .16) but comparable at 6 months (6.4% vs. 6.7%, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = .97).</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="s4">
                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>While additional research is needed to promote long-term cessation, this pilot trial supports recruitment feasibility during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, consumer uptake, and a signal for intervention efficacy on the uptake of cessation treatment and short-term smoking abstinence.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="s5">
                  <title>Implications</title>
                  <p>This study is the first evaluation of a social media intervention for smoking cessation among Indigenous people. We learned that statewide Facebook recruitment of AN adults who smoke was feasible and there was a signal for the efficacy of a Facebook intervention on the uptake of EBCT and short-term (3 months) biochemically verified smoking abstinence. Clinically, social media platforms may complement current care models by connecting AN individuals and others living in hard-to-reach communities to cessation treatment resources.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>In Alaska, cigarette smoking prevalence among Alaska Native (AN) adults is 37% compared with 17% among non-Native adults.<sup><xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Alaska is the largest U.S. state and qualifies in its entirety for a federal designation of rural and frontier.<sup><xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Out of about 225 AN communities, 178 (80%) do not connect to a road system and are separated from regional hospitals by vast stretches of tundra, water, glaciers, and mountains.<sup><xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Weather and travel costs further impede smoking cessation treatment access and reach. The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic accentuated the need for digital platforms connecting people to evidence-based cessation treatment (EBCT) resources.<sup><xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Social media tools are widely adopted globally,<sup><xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> including by AN people,<sup><xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> and are a potentially effective way to reach and engage individuals in smoking cessation efforts.</p>
              <p>Thrul and colleagues<sup><xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> reviewed 12 studies (2015–2018) examining the efficacy of social media interventions for smoking cessation. Nine studies utilized Facebook, and only three of the 12 studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs).<sup><xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9–11</xref></sup> The authors concluded that social media interventions hold promise to help individuals quit, but additional RCTs are needed. A recent RCT compared two active Facebook interventions for smoking cessation<sup><xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> and other trials are in progress.<sup><xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> No studies globally have evaluated a social media intervention among Indigenous persons who smoke. In contrast to individual-based treatments, social media-formed networks for quitting smoking are consistent with the AN cultural value of interdependence, defined as relationship-oriented and collaborative.<sup><xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup></p>
              <p>The CAN Quit study incorporated four phases to develop and then evaluate a moderated Facebook group intervention.<sup><xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> The current pilot RCT evaluated its feasibility and efficacy for smoking cessation. We hypothesized the intervention would be feasible and demonstrate a signal for efficacy on the biochemically verified smoking abstinence rate at 3 and 6 months compared with the control condition.</p>

              <title>Methods</title>
              <p>The study received approval from the Alaska Area and Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Boards. The Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium (ANTHC) Board of Directors provided Tribal approval. The trial was registered with clinicaltrials.gov (NCT 03645941). Data collection took place from December 2019 to March 2021.</p>
              <p>The CAN Quit study incorporated a community-based participatory approach into all facets of the research process as recommended by Lee and colleagues.<sup><xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> We codeveloped the research questions and project with AN community members, and our research team included Indigenous persons. The ANTHC Research Consultation Committee, an existing advisory committee constituted of AN and American Indian individuals, provided feedback and advice on the implementation of all CAN Quit study phases. Study results were shared with participants via a mailed newsletter.</p>
              <sec id="s8">
                <title>Participants</title>
                <p>Based on recommendations for Stage I addictions behavioral treatment development,<sup><xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> the targeted sample size of 60 participants was deemed sufficient for assessing feasibility. Although unable to detect statistically significant study group differences on smoking abstinence, the study can assess if there is a signal for efficacy and obtain estimates of the intervention effect toward planning a definitive Stage II efficacy trial.</p>
                <p>We recruited AN adults who smoked statewide through paid Facebook advertisements geographically targeted to Alaska. Advertisements included an image of AN people with the text “CAN Quit. Research to Connect Alaska Native People to Quit Smoking. Looking for Alaska Native people who smoke to join a research study. Receive up to $175 for participating.” Participants were directed to call the toll-free number provided or to click on an embedded Web site link for more information. We screened candidates by phone to assess the study eligibility criteria. Inclusion criteria included: self-reported AN race or ethnicity, current Alaska residence, age ≥19 years old, smoked at least one cigarette per day during the past 7 days, cigarettes were the main nicotine or tobacco product used, considering or willing to make a quit attempt, had access to broadband (high speed) Internet, and either an existing Facebook account or would create one (for inclusiveness of new users recruited via word of mouth by someone on Facebook viewing the advertisement). Participants were excluded if they were enrolled in a cessation program or used cessation pharmacotherapy within the past 30 days. We offered smoking cessation resource information to ineligible individuals or those who are not interested in participating. We enrolled eligible participants who provided written informed consent by mail.</p>

                <title>Procedures</title>
                <p>The trial used a two-arm, parallel groups, randomized controlled design. Before the trial, the study statistician generated the random allocation sequence. Participants were randomized with 1:1 allocation to the intervention or control group, stratified by gender (men and women), age group (19–29, 30–49, and ≥50 years), and region (urban and rural); all considered potential variables related to outcomes.<sup><xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18–20</xref></sup> Rural residence included participants who lived outside of the municipality of Anchorage. Allocation to treatment conditions was unknown to study staff or investigators before assignment, and participants completed baseline measures before being informed of their study assignment. We administered survey measures for both study groups on the Web using the Qualtrics platform at baseline and 1, 3, and 6 months after randomization. Participants received a link by email to complete the online survey and were mailed a $25 cash gift card for each completed. At 1, 3, and 6 months, all participants were mailed a saliva specimen kit. We mailed participants an additional $25 cash gift card for each sample they returned by mail, for possible total remuneration of $175.</p>

                  <title>Control Condition</title>
                  <p>Participants received EBCT referral information by postal mail (printed materials) and e-mail. Information was provided about Alaska’s Tobacco Quitline including the availability of free coaching calls and nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). The study team developed a URL where participants could access contact information for their regional Tribal tobacco cessation treatment program, including a description of services offered (eg phone counseling and pharmacotherapy). Participants also received information on the National Cancer Institute’s free, population-level, smokefree.gov Web site resources. The Web site, tailored to all levels of readiness to quit smoking, includes a quitting guide, texting program, smartphone applications, online live chat, and URL and toll-free number (1-800-QUIT-NOW) for state quitlines. The control condition providing digital access to EBCT is consistent with that used in prior RCTs evaluating social media interventions for smoking cessation.<sup><xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p>

                <sec id="s12">
                  <title>Intervention Condition</title>
                  <p>Participants received the same EBCT referral information described above. Additionally, the novel intervention consisted of a moderated, secret (entirely private and non-searchable) Facebook group. The intervention duration was 3 months, consistent with other Facebook interventions for smoking cessation.<sup><xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> The group began when there were 10 participants enrolled, the minimum number for optimal Facebook intervention engagement in prior work<sup><xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> and ended when the last participant enrolled had access to the group for 3 months. Thus, as implemented, the number of months participants had access to the group ranged from 3 to 6 months (an average of 5 months). Moderators posted conversation starters, questions, polls on specific topics, and motivational messages with culturally specific images and videos from the content library and prompted participant comments and discussions every 2 to 3 days.</p>
                  <p>As described in detail elsewhere,<sup><xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22–24</xref></sup> our content development followed the approach used in the effective CDC Tips from Former Smokers educational mass-media campaign,<sup><xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> including digital storytelling and connecting individuals to EBCT resources. EBCTs can double or triple a person’s chances of cessation compared to quitting without treatment<sup><xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> but these are greatly underutilized.<sup><xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> Tips features factual, graphic, emotional, and true stories told by former smokers to increase awareness of the harms of smoking and to encourage quitting. It recommends specific calls to action to use state quitlines and smokefree.gov Web site resources. Prior studies<sup><xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> have noted that storytelling is culturally congruent to AN people, which made the Tips personal story format ideal for social media content development. We used the cultural variance and surface and deep structure frameworks<sup><xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> to tailor intervention content for cultural relevance and perceived effectiveness. Selected Tips stories were included along with existing ANTHC videos featuring AN people, activities, and or values such as family and community.</p>
                  <sec id="s13">
                    <title>Content Library.</title>
                    <p>We developed a content library (digital and written) similar to a conventional treatment manual for use by the moderators.<sup><xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> It included: (1) welcome posts, group description and purpose, participant guidelines (ie informing participants about the policies for posting content), (2) options for Facebook group page cover photos, (3) 70 moderator posts: images, text, polls, and or videos that included a tagline to call the State Quitline and URL links for Tribal cessation program resources, (4) guidelines for handling inappropriate or misinformation (eg deleting unrelated or false posts), and (5) closing posts offering additional places to connect after the group ended.</p>
                    <p>We organized the moderator postings by topic and each included sample text the moderators could add to initiate discussion or modify according to current group conversations. Postings covered cessation topics including coping with stress, nicotine withdrawal, and cravings; personal health; AN culture and activities for quitting smoking (eg beadwork); quitting motivations (eg family) and preventing relapse; as well as COVID-19 prevention practices. The order of postings was not specified; moderators could choose posts based on the group conversations. Moderators posted for the entire group and responded to individual posts or queries.</p>

The moderators actively participated in developing the training and intervention content, providing their expertise and background as AN certified Tobacco Treatment Specialists (TTS) working with AN persons.

                  <p>Our assessments did not distinguish commercial tobacco smoking from ceremonial or traditional use. Unlike other Indigenous populations,<sup><xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> nicotine or tobacco products are not used in ceremonies by AN people in Alaska.<sup><xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> Our cessation outcomes follow recent recommendations from the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco workgroup that updated definitions and measurements of abstinence in clinical trials.<sup><xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> Our focus concerning abstinence was on combustible cigarette smoking. At each follow-up assessment, we assessed self-reported abstinence from cigarette smoking for the last 7 days. We mailed a saliva kit with a collection tube and postage-paid return envelope to all participants regardless of self-reported abstinence. As part of the informed consent process, participants were told that the sample would be “analyzed for cotinine, a measure of the nicotine in your saliva.” We did not ensure that participants provided their own saliva samples. Participants mailed the specimen to research staff at Mayo Clinic where it was processed by their laboratory. We analyzed the test results only for individuals self-reporting smoking abstinence. As recommended, biochemically confirmed abstinence from smoking at each follow-up assessment was defined as self-reported abstinence during the past 7 days (not even a puff), with salivary cotinine level &lt;15 ng/ml.<sup><xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup></p>

                <p>To assess the adequacy of the randomization, we compared baseline characteristics between study groups using the two-sample rank-sum test for continuous and chi-square (exact) test for categorical variables. We used the chi-square test to compare retention rates between study groups. We used descriptive statistics (mean, median, and range) to summarize the level of intervention engagement overall and by select demographics (gender, age, and residence), as well as Social Media Usability scores. We identified common themes of response in the moderator and participant comments and participant-generated posts using content analysis.<sup><xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> Two study team members (PS and CH) conducted the content analysis. We employed logistic regression to compare the proportion of participants with abstinence from smoking and any use of EBCT at each follow-up assessment. We analyzed data based on: (1) intent-to-treat analysis of all randomized participants, with participants missing data classified as smoking/no use of EBCT, and (2) complete case analysis of only participants completing the respective assessment. If participants self-reported smoking abstinence and use of NRT or other nicotine or tobacco product use with elevated cotinine concentration, they were classified as abstinent from smoking.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>This pilot trial found that statewide Facebook recruitment of AN persons who smoke was feasible and there was a signal for the efficacy of the Facebook intervention on the uptake of cessation treatment and short-term (3 months) biochemically verified smoking abstinence. However, group differences on cessation did not persist at 6 months. This research expands the evidence base of social media interventions for smoking cessation.<sup><xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Only four RCTs were previously reported, and our study is the first among Indigenous people in the United States or worldwide. We evaluated a new approach to reach AN people statewide using social media communication tools that are culturally relevant and already adopted. Prior interventions had limited reach to specific geographic locations in Alaska or AN populations.<sup><xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> The research validates the use of social media advertising to recruit AN people statewide into research studies. The intervention was well specified in a content library that was developed using a rigorous, iterative process. Also, the trial was conducted using remote methods, enhancing inclusion (an AN cultural value), and generalizability.</p>
              <p>We began recruitment for this study in December 2019, which unexpectedly coincided with the first known case of COVID-19 being identified globally. Despite commencing study recruitment during the initial spread of COVID-19, we exceeded our sample size goal using Facebook advertisements. Our recruitment efforts were successful in enrolling rural dwelling participants (64% of our sample), accentuating the potential reach of the intervention and extending support to those living in small, isolated Alaska communities. The study was well represented by participants of different ages (range 22 to 76 years). In the United States, Facebook use is consistent across age groups except for lower use among individuals <italic toggle="yes">≥</italic>65 years.<sup><xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Only 38% of our participants were men, consistent with research indicating that women are more likely than men to use Facebook<sup><xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> and participate in online communities to quit smoking.<sup><xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> Unfortunately, Facebook usage data are not reported by AN or other Indigenous race or ethnicities,<sup><xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> but prior surveys indicate high adoption of social media tools among AN<sup><xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> and other Indigenous populations.<sup><xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup></p>
              <p>We found high reported satisfaction with the Facebook intervention, and an adequate level of participation as defined by other social media intervention studies reporting the proportion of participants commenting at least once or more than once.<sup><xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9–11</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> We additionally summarized the proportion who created and reacted to posts as essential forms of intervention participation.<sup><xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> Interestingly, women and participants 40 years of age or older engaged at a higher level than men and younger participants. Prior work found no gender or demographic differences with Facebook intervention participation.<sup><xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup> Future studies should confirm our findings with larger samples.</p>
              <p>We examined only the inception phase of our online community for which, typically, moderator posts outnumber participant posts.<sup><xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup> Participant engagement level was higher when postings were made by participants compared with moderators, indicating the group was moving toward the establishment phase. Qualitative analysis of themes of participant-initiated posts and comments focused on the importance of social support and their quitting experience.</p>
              <p>Promoting treatment utilization is an important issue for the nicotine research field,<sup><xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> and we present novel preliminary data on the uptake of EBCTs associated with a social media intervention. We found the most common resources accessed were Alaska’s Tobacco Quitline, Tribal cessation programs, and health care providers. Those who used EBCT engaged with the Facebook intervention at a higher level than those who did not; this exploratory finding warrants examination in future trials.</p>
              <p>We observed a signal for efficacy of the intervention on the biochemically verified smoking abstinence at 3 months (6.5% vs. 0% control condition) but not at 6 months (6.4% vs. 6.7%). The smoking abstinence outcomes and lack of longer-term efficacy are similar to those reported in prior RCTs.<sup><xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> An RCT enrolling 500 young adults<sup><xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> compared a Facebook intervention compared with a control group receiving smokefree.gov cessation resources and demonstrated significant differences at 3 months on the biochemically verified cessation rates (5.6% vs. 2.4%) but not at 6 (4.0% vs. 4.4%) or 12 months (4.4% vs. 6.8%). We observed no clear pattern of the level of intervention engagement among those reporting smoking abstinence at 6 months. Findings from prior research on this topic are mixed.<sup><xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10–12</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> We evaluated a standalone intervention to enhance its scale and dissemination and did not include live counselor contact, online cessation counseling, or provide NRT, as in prior studies.<sup><xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10–12</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Our study has several limitations. Survey completion was only 57% at 6 months. In contrast, prior RCTs of social media interventions reported retention rates of 64%–73% at 6 months post-randomization<sup><xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> However, data collection for these trials occurred before the COVID-19 pandemic. Although not evaluated, the pandemic may have presented health, social, and or other concerns limiting our participants’ time and ability to complete assessments as well as smoking cessation. Providing a greater incentive amount for assessment completion may have increased retention.<sup><xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> As in other pilot trials, the study findings are limited by the small sample size. However, the magnitude of the difference in the use of EBCTs between study groups is encouraging and warrants examination in a definitive trial. Participants were AN people living in Alaska and recruited through Facebook advertisements. Therefore, findings may not apply to other geographic regions or Indigenous communities, and those who are not using Facebook. There were some delays in receiving saliva samples by mail likely exacerbated by the COVID pandemic, with an average of about 4 weeks (range 1–8) from distribution to receipt of the sample. The use of cotinine testing only to verify abstinence from cigarette smoking is limited when other nicotine or tobacco products or NRT are used.<sup><xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> Expired-air carbon monoxide (CO) testing is thus recommended because CO is a combustion product and is not confounded by detection of their use. Thus, combining breath CO and cotinine measures is optimal. Overall, however, we found a low number of participants reporting other nicotine or tobacco product use, and no use among participants self-reporting smoking abstinence. We relied on the self-reported use of EBCTs and did not assess the duration or completion of treatments utilized. Facebook as an intervention platform has inherent limitations of the privacy of data obtained by Facebook such as when existing users click on, interact with (ie like or comment), or share recruitment advertisements with others.</p>
              <p>Despite these limitations, our study demonstrates several strengths. A Facebook intervention has promise as a scalable intervention strategy to promote engagement in cessation treatment among AN people, especially those living in rural, remote, off-road communities, and this study points to new directions for research into how peer support through social media can promote long-term cessation in this population. Based on suggestions by our participants and supported in the literature,<sup><xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup> we plan to hold Facebook live events with Native Elder speakers, Tribal cessation program counselors, Alaska’s Tobacco Quitline coaches, and or health care providers to motivate and guide cessation. That more than 70% of our participants indicated an interest in moderating a Facebook cessation group was unexpected. Engaging AN persons as peer moderators to regularly post and support members could bolster intragroup support for quitting, and ultimately, enhance the sustainability of the intervention.<sup><xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup> Women engaged in the intervention at a higher level compared with men, suggesting that a women-only Facebook group may be advantageous.<sup><xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Our sample was comprised of existing Facebook users but other types of advertisements (eg radio) could be utilized to recruit new users to participate. Other social media platforms such as Instagram might appeal to younger participants.<sup><xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> With larger samples, social network analyses could be conducted to better understand intragroup dynamics of social support as a mechanism of treatment efficacy. We intend to use remote and rapid biochemical testing methods (eg mouth swab test for cotinine and mobile phone-based CO collection) conducted proximal to obtaining self-reported data and documenting the sample collection and results by phone or video call or pictures sent by email.<sup><xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> We also plan to obtain objective data on cessation treatment and apply the findings of this study in future research.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, while the intervention did not promote increased quitting at 6 months, this pilot trial supports recruitment feasibility and a signal for intervention efficacy on the uptake of cessation treatment and short-term smoking abstinence. Clinically, results may be useful to providers, State Tobacco Quitlines, and Tribal cessation programs. Social media platforms may complement current care models by connecting AN individuals and others living in hard-to-reach communities to cessation treatment resources. Our community-based participatory approach to the development and evaluation of our social media intervention can serve as a framework for other Indigenous communities aiming to focus on commercial tobacco cessation.</p>
