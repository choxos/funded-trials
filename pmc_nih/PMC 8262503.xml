                  <title>BACKGROUND</title>
                  <p>Whether airspace biomarkers add value to plasma biomarkers in studying acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is not well understood. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are an investigational therapy for ARDS, and airspace biomarkers may provide mechanistic evidence for MSCs’ impact in patients with ARDS.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>METHODS</title>
                  <p>We carried out a nested cohort study within a phase 2a safety trial of treatment with allogeneic MSCs for moderate-to-severe ARDS. Nonbronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage and plasma samples were collected 48 hours after study drug infusion. Airspace and plasma biomarker concentrations were compared between the MSC (<italic>n =</italic> 17) and placebo (<italic>n =</italic> 10) treatment arms, and correlation between the two compartments was tested. Airspace biomarkers were also tested for associations with clinical and radiographic outcomes.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>RESULTS</title>
                  <p>Compared with placebo, MSC treatment significantly reduced airspace total protein, angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2), IL-6, and soluble TNF receptor-1 concentrations. Plasma biomarkers did not differ between groups. Each 10-fold increase in airspace Ang-2 was independently associated with 6.7 fewer days alive and free of mechanical ventilation (95% CI, –12.3 to –1.0, <italic>P =</italic> 0.023), and each 10-fold increase in airspace receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) was independently associated with a 6.6-point increase in day 3 radiographic assessment of lung edema score (95% CI, 2.4 to 10.8, <italic>P =</italic> 0.004).</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>CONCLUSION</title>
                  <p>MSCs reduced biological evidence of lung injury in patients with ARDS. Biomarkers from the airspaces provide additional value for studying pathogenesis, treatment effects, and outcomes in ARDS.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Studies of plasma biomarkers in the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have improved understanding of the syndrome’s biologic heterogeneity (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>) and differential treatment responses (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Plasma biomarkers have also been used as biological endpoints in clinical trials of potential ARDS therapies (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>–<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Airspace biomarkers are studied less frequently than plasma biomarkers, though they have been used as secondary endpoints in some clinical trials (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Few studies have investigated simultaneous plasma and airspace biomarker measurements or the relationship between plasma and airspace biomarkers (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>–<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). To our knowledge, there has not been a systematic investigation of the relationship between plasma and airspace biomarkers or whether sampling the airspaces offers additional value in understanding ARDS pathogenesis, therapeutic interventions, and outcomes.</p>
              <p>Airspace biomarkers could enhance the study of ARDS treatments by reflecting responses and possible therapeutic mechanisms in the lung better than circulating biomarkers. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have been investigated as a novel therapeutic for ARDS because of their potential to act on many of the key pathways implicated in the pathogenesis of lung injury (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). MSCs promote a proresolving macrophage phenotype (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), enhance alveolar fluid clearance (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), restore epithelial and endothelial barrier integrity (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), and reduce lung injury severity in preclinical models (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). The trial of treatment with allogeneic MSCs for moderate-to-severe ARDS (START trial, ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02097641) demonstrated the safety of MSCs in ARDS (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), but their efficacy in a clinical population has not definitively been proven. Because the primary therapeutic target in ARDS and one of the key determinants of the therapeutic potential of MSCs is the lung microenvironment (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>–<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), airspace samples could provide better evidence of biologic effect than samples collected from the peripheral circulation.</p>
              <p>In this study, we analyzed plasma and airspace biologic samples from patients enrolled in the START trial (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). The first aim was to determine whether prespecified airspace biomarkers of endothelial injury (angiopoietin-2 [Ang-2]), inflammation (IL-6, IL-8, and soluble TNF receptor-1 [sTNFR-1]), and lung epithelial injury (receptor for advanced glycation end-products [RAGE]) collected 48 hours after therapeutic intervention differed between patients who received MSCs and those who received placebo. Total airspace protein concentration was also compared between patients in the MSC and placebo groups, as the concentration of total protein in the airspaces is a well-established biomarker of lung endothelial and epithelial protein permeability in experimental models of MSC therapy for ARDS (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) and in ARDS clinical studies (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>–<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). The second aim was to study the relationship between 48-hour airspace and plasma biomarkers. The third aim was to determine whether airspace biomarkers are associated with prespecified clinical and radiographic outcomes.</p>

                <p>A 48-hour airspace sample was available for 27 of the 60 (45%) patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Patient demographics, ARDS risk factors, respiratory parameters on the day of nonbronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage (mini-BAL), and MSC viability did not significantly differ between patients who had a mini-BAL sample collected and those who did not (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd">Supplemental Table 1</xref>; supplemental material available online with this article; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.148983DS1">https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.148983DS1</ext-link>). Of the 27 patients who had a mini-BAL sample, there were no significant differences in baseline characteristics or respiratory variables at 48 hours between patients in the MSC group (<italic>n =</italic> 17) and those in the placebo group (<italic>n =</italic> 10; <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>

                <title>Airspace biomarkers differed between MSC and placebo groups.</title>
                <p>At 48 hours after treatment, all airspace biomarkers were numerically lower in the MSC arm relative to those in the placebo arm and most differences were statistically significant. Airspace total protein was significantly lower in the MSC group than in the placebo group (1025 μg/mL [IQR, 796–1770 μg/mL] vs. 2803 μg/mL [IQR, 1966–3761 μg/mL], <italic>P =</italic> 0.045), suggesting that MSC therapy reduced pulmonary vascular and epithelial permeability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Airspace total protein did not differ by primary ARDS risk factor (<italic>P =</italic> 0.16). Significantly lower airspace Ang-2 levels in MSC-treated patients compared with patients in the placebo group (169 pg/mL [IQR, 20–318 pg/mL] vs. 469 pg/mL [IQR, 217–7039 pg/mL], <italic>P =</italic> 0.0076) are consistent with less pulmonary endothelial injury in the MSC group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Two airspace biomarkers of inflammation, IL-6 and sTNFR-1, were significantly lower in the MSC group relative to the placebo group (435 pg/mL [IQR, 135–1743 pg/mL] vs. 3600 pg/mL [IQR, 652–7270 pg/mL], <italic>P =</italic> 0.018 and 1090 pg/mL [IQR, 470–1943 pg/mL] vs. 2740 pg/mL [IQR, 1745–3224 pg/mL], <italic>P =</italic> 0.031, respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). There was a trend toward lower airspace IL-8 in the MSC group relative to the placebo group (5745 pg/mL [IQR, 771–10,435 pg/mL] vs. 12,624 pg/mL [IQR, 4114–23,879 pg/mL], <italic>P =</italic> 0.098). Airspace RAGE was numerically lower in the MSC group compared with that in the placebo group (1515 pg/mL [IQR, 565–5005 pg/mL] vs. 4006 pg/mL [IQR, 1191–11,866 pg/mL], but this difference did not reach significance (<italic>P =</italic> 0.19). There was no significant correlation between 48-hour airspace biomarker concentrations and MSC viability, which ranged from 46%–85% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd">Supplemental Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd">Supplemental Table 2</xref>). In contrast to airspace biomarkers, none of the 48-hour plasma biomarkers differed between the 2 treatment groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd">Supplemental Table 3</xref>).</p>
                <p>One of the limitations of lavage procedures is variable return of instilled fluid, which could theoretically impact between-group differences in biomarker concentrations. Total sample volume was recorded for all but 1 sample (<italic>n =</italic> 26). Median mini-BAL sample volume was 4 ml (IQR, 2–4 ml) in the placebo group vs. 2 ml (IQR, 1.5–4 ml) in the MSC group (<italic>P =</italic> 0.41). Total volume ranged from 0.5 to 8 ml in the placebo group and 0.4 to 8 ml in the MSC group. We tested whether airspace biomarker concentrations correlated with total sample volume and found no significant correlations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd">Supplemental Table 4</xref>). In addition, total protein concentration was not associated with mini-BAL sample volume (ρ = –0.17, <italic>P =</italic> 0.40).</p>

                <p>One of the samples in the MSC group was noted to have a considerably lower airspace total protein concentration than the other samples. Although there was no a priori reason to exclude this subject from our primary analysis, we performed a sensitivity analysis excluding this subject. A substantially lower airspace total protein concentration remained in the MSC group compared with placebo group, although the difference was no longer statistically significant (1107 μg/ml [IQR, 862–1914 μg/ml] vs. 2802 μg/ml [IQR, 1966–3761 μg/ml], <italic>P =</italic> 0.065). Other between-group differences remained statistically significant when this sample was excluded. Median airspace Ang-2 in the MSC arm was 212 pg/ml (IQR, 16–330 pg/ml) vs. 469 pg/ml (IQR, 217–7039 pg/ml), <italic>P =</italic> 0.012. Airspace IL-6 (506 pg/ml [IQR, 136–1871 pg/ml] vs. 3601 [IQR, 652–7270 pg/ml], <italic>P =</italic> 0.028) and sTNFR-1 (1104 pg/ml [IQR, 481–2186 pg/ml] vs. 2740 pg/ml [IQR, 1745–3224 pg/ml], <italic>P =</italic> 0.045) also remained statistically significantly lower in the MSC arm as compared with the placebo arm.</p>
                <p>Since airspace levels of both total protein and Ang-2 were lower in MSC-treated patients compared with placebo controls, we tested the hypothesis that there would be a positive association between airspace Ang-2 and total protein. A statistically significant positive correlation between airspace Ang-2 and total protein was observed (ρ = 0.62, <italic>P =</italic> 0.0005; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). Alveolar permeability to protein is a result of both endothelial and epithelial barrier disruption. Although there was not a statistically significant difference in airspace RAGE levels between treatment groups, we tested the correlation between airspace total protein and RAGE given the biological plausibility of an association. There was a significant correlation between airspace RAGE and total protein (ρ = 0.42, <italic>P =</italic> 0.028).</p>

There were no other significant associations between biomarkers, including airspace total protein, and the prespecified ARDS outcomes. Higher airspace Ang-2 concentration was associated with fewer VFDs (ρ = –0.55, <italic>P =</italic> 0.019), while higher airspace RAGE concentration was associated with more radiographic pulmonary edema, specifically a higher day 3 RALE score (ρ = 0.64, <italic>P =</italic> 0.003).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>There are two primary findings from this study. First, airspace biomarkers in patients in the START trial provide evidence of the biologic benefit of MSCs for reducing the severity of acute lung injury in patients with ARDS and bolster the rationale for continued testing of MSCs as therapy for ARDS. Second, the results support the value of sampling the distal airspaces in ARDS for investigating therapeutic interventions.</p>
              <p>There were significantly lower values of airspace total protein, Ang-2, IL-6, and sTNFR1 in patients who received MSCs compared with those who received placebo. Airspace total protein and biomarker concentrations were not associated with total sample volume. These potentially novel findings recapitulate in a clinical population evidence of the therapeutic properties of MSCs that have been demonstrated in preclinical models (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). In vitro, MSCs decrease alveolar type II (ATII) paracellular permeability to protein after injury with a mix of proinflammatory cytokines (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) and increase alveolar fluid clearance in an endotoxin-induced lung injury model in the ex vivo perfused human lung (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Preclinical experiments have also demonstrated that MSCs secrete paracrine factors with antiinflammatory effects and contribute to restoring endothelial and epithelial function (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>–<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>).</p>
              <p>We studied airspace total protein concentration as a key measure of alveolar endothelial and epithelial protein permeability. Airspace total protein has been investigated not only in preclinical models but also in clinical studies of patients with ARDS (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Previous studies of patients with ARDS have demonstrated a correlation between airspace IgM, a large protein that is not abundant in the alveolar space in the absence of permeability pulmonary edema (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), and total protein (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Additionally, airspace IgM and total protein provide similar prognostic information in patients with ARDS (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). We found no statistically significant difference in airspace total protein levels by clinical category of ARDS, suggesting that total protein concentration is a reasonable measure of alveolar permeability to protein even in the likely presence of neutrophil and bacterial infiltrates or other potential exogenous protein sources. In this study, the relationship between airspace Ang-2 and protein levels indicates that more severe lung endothelial injury is associated with higher alveolar protein permeability at 48 hours. The lower concentrations of both airspace Ang-2 and total protein in MSC-treated patients compared with patients who received placebo indicate that acute lung injury was attenuated by MSC therapy at the 48-hour time point. In contrast, there were no differences in plasma biomarkers between treatment groups. Therefore, airspace biomarkers may be more representative of pulmonary-specific therapeutic effects.</p>
              <p>Preclinical studies support an initial localization of MSCs to the lung, offering further support for their putative therapeutic effect at the level of the pulmonary endothelium. Conceivably, the systemic administration of MSC therapy for nonpulmonary organ damage may be limited by first-pass trapping in the lung (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). The mechanism of sequestration in the lung likely involves both molecular size and receptor-mediated interactions between MSCs and the endothelium via VCAM-1 (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). In the case of pulmonary injury, the tendency of MSCs to initially home to the pulmonary circulation could be advantageous. Although a biologic effect does not necessarily translate into clinical benefit, the results of this study provide a possible mechanistic rationale for further investigation of MSCs in clinical trials.</p>
              <p>Different levels of biomarkers in the airspaces compared with the plasma underscore the importance of sampling the distal airspaces in the investigation of ARDS biology. For some biomarkers, there was no correlation between the pulmonary and systemic compartments. Thus, biomarkers detected in the airspaces versus the plasma likely reflect distinct biological processes. For example, IL-8 was markedly higher in mini-BAL fluid than in plasma, with no correlation between the two compartments. This suggests that IL-8 in the lungs and the blood may be derived from different cellular sources. Plasma IL-8 is a key biomarker in classifying and predicting outcomes from ARDS (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>), but circulating levels of IL-8 do not specifically capture the lung inflammatory environment. Similarly, there was no correlation between airspace and plasma Ang-2 concentrations. The major source of Ang-2 is the endothelial Weibel-Palade body (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Plasma Ang-2 concentration is higher in patients with indirect ARDS (e.g., nonpulmonary sepsis) than in those with direct ARDS (e.g., aspiration), likely because plasma Ang-2 reflects endothelial injury, not only at the level of the pulmonary microcirculation, but also the microcirculation of other organs (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Thus, although plasma Ang-2 is important in sepsis-related ARDS (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>), airspace Ang-2 concentrations may provide more direct insight into pulmonary endothelial injury. The results of this study indicate that sampling the blood is likely insufficient for reliably capturing airspace biology. Whether the pattern of airspace biomarkers differs by ARDS etiology, as is true for plasma biomarkers (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>), and whether the relationship between airspace and plasma biomarkers is affected by the etiology of ARDS is an important avenue for future studies.</p>
              <p>Plasma biomarkers, including RAGE, Ang-2, IL-8, and sTNFR-1, can predict the development of ARDS (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>) and ARDS outcomes (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>) and classify ARDS phenotypes that are durable over time (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). The utility of airspace biomarkers in prognostic models has not previously been studied. We found that airspace Ang-2 not only reflects the biological response to MSC treatment, but also is associated with the important clinical outcome of VFDs. In contrast, plasma levels of Ang-2 drawn on the same day were not associated with VFDs. In addition, airspace RAGE was associated with the day 3 RALE score, a radiographic estimate of the severity of lung edema (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>), while plasma RAGE from the same time point was not. Though airspace RAGE did not differ by treatment arm in this study, it may be a useful predictor of clinical outcomes in future research. Our results support further investigation of the prognostic value of airspace biomarkers alone or in combination with plasma biomarkers.</p>
              <p>There are limitations to this study. First, the results are from a modest sample of patients from a clinical trial population that may not reflect larger unselected populations of patients with ARDS. Even though the sample was limited to 27 of the 60 enrolled patients, a substantial treatment effect was still observed. Aside from a higher proportion of abnormal coagulation tests in the MSC arm, reasons for exclusion between the 2 treatment groups were similar, including a similar proportion of patients excluded because of clinical instability. In addition, there were no significant differences between the patients who underwent the mini-BAL procedure and those who were excluded (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd">Supplemental Table 1</xref>). Second, the mini-BAL procedure introduces an unknown dilution factor; however, the same saline volume of 40 ml was used in all mini-BAL procedures, and we found no significant correlation between any of the airspace biomarkers tested or airspace total protein and the lavage sample volume. Undiluted pulmonary edema fluid can only be obtained early in the course of ARDS, and all BAL experimental and clinical procedures require dilution from instilled saline. Even so, some biomarker concentrations were markedly higher in the airspaces than in the plasma (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Regardless of dilution, airspace samples are more specific to lung pathophysiology, since plasma biomarker concentrations also reflect contributions from other organs. Plasma biomarker levels may also be influenced by intravenous fluid administration, which is not standardized across patients (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). Regarding assessment of the MSC treatment effect, differences between treatment groups should not be confounded by the dilution factor. Third, cell counts were not obtained in lavage samples prior to processing, meaning that the effect of MSCs on inflammatory cell count could not be analyzed. In future studies, it would be valuable to test whether MSCs reduce airspace inflammatory cell infiltration. A reduction in airspace inflammatory biomarkers is not necessarily indicative of a reduction in immune cells or a reduction in immune cell function per se. However, these biomarkers reflect the overall proinflammatory environment of the lung in ARDS, which is complex and driven not only by infiltrating immune cells but also by soluble factors derived from the pulmonary epithelium and endothelium. Finally, airspace samples in our study were only collected at a single time point (48 hours after therapeutic intervention), because the study protocol required 2 hours of stable oxygenation and hemodynamics, which might have been disturbed by bronchoalveolar lavage during the baseline period. Therefore, we are unable to definitively conclude that MSC treatment lowered the airspace biomarkers from the time of enrollment, because a baseline mini-BAL fluid sample before MSC infusion could not be obtained. However, baseline characteristics, respiratory variables on the day of sample collection, and outcomes between the treatment arms were similar, and we would not expect a systematic difference in airspace biomarkers between patients who received MSCs and those who received placebo by chance alone. Additionally, samples were not collected beyond 48 hours, and therefore, we do not have evidence of the biologic effect of MSCs beyond 48 hours. In future studies, serial airspace samples, including baseline values, may provide valuable information.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, the results of this study provide the first evidence to our knowledge that intravenous delivery of MSCs in patients with ARDS is associated with a reduction in alveolar permeability to protein, which may be mediated by a reduction in pulmonary endothelial and epithelial injury. Because samples were obtained 48 hours after MSC or placebo infusion, MSC therapy has a durable biological effect within this time frame. In addition, the study of airspace biomarkers provides substantial additional value to plasma biomarkers in understanding ARDS pathobiology, investigating novel treatments, and predicting outcomes. Inclusion of airspace sampling in future clinical trials may provide further insight into the biology and therapeutic targets of this complex critical illness syndrome.</p>
