                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>The in-utero transfer of malaria specific IgG to the fetus in <italic toggle="yes">Plasmodium falciparum</italic> infected pregnant women potentially plays a role in provision of immune protection against malaria in the first birth year. However, the effect of Intermittent Prophylactic Treatment in Pregnancy (IPTp) and placental malaria on the extent of in-utero antibody transfer in malaria endemic regions like Uganda remain unknown. The aim of this study was thus to establish the effect of IPTp on in-utero transfer of malaria specific IgG to the fetus and the associated immune protection against malaria in the first birth year of children born to mothers who had <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">falciparum</italic> infection during pregnancy in Uganda.</p>

                  <p>We screened a total of 637 cord blood samples from a double blinded randomized clinical trial on Sulfadoxine-Pyrimethamine (SP) and Dihydroartemisinin-Piperaquine (DP) IPTp in a Ugandan birth cohort; study conducted from Busia, Eastern Uganda. Luminex assay was used to measure the cord levels of IgG sub-types (IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4) against 15 different <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">falciparum</italic> specific antigens, with tetanus toxoid (t.t) as a control antigen. Man-Whitney U test (non-parametric) in STATA (ver15) was used in statistical analysis of the samples. In addition, Multivariate cox regression analysis was used to determine the effect of maternal transfer of IgG on the incidence of malaria in the first birth year of children under study.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Pregnancy greatly changes the physiology of a woman and increases vulnerability to diseases such as malaria by lowering the immune system [<xref rid="pone.0277789.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Infection of the placenta can lead to severe adverse birth out comes such as low birth weight, still birth, miscarriage and premature birth [<xref rid="pone.0277789.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0277789.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In Uganda where malaria is endemic, there is very low prevalence of the disease in children below six months much as they are considered to be vulnerable population to malaria [<xref rid="pone.0277789.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. It is recommended for pregnant women to take at least a dose of IPT per trimester of gestation. Among factors hypothesized for low malaria prevalence in the pediatric population are; fetal hemoglobin that has high affinity for oxygen thus consumes most of the essential gas making it unavailable for parasite metabolism; lactoferritin in breast milk that tightly binds iron making it unavailable for parasite biofilm formation and growth, and IgG transferred from placenta to cord blood which helps clear parasites [<xref rid="pone.0277789.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0277789.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] using different mechanisms.</p>
              <p>Mothers from malaria endemic areas pass on immune IgG to their children [<xref rid="pone.0277789.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. IgG1 and IgG3 have higher serum concentration compared to IgG2 and IgG4 [<xref rid="pone.0277789.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. IgG1 and IgG3 are cytophilic, perform opsonization, activate complement and antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), making them critical in development of immunity against malaria [<xref rid="pone.0277789.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. IgG2 and IgG4 are non-cytophilic; expression of more IgG2 has been associated with increased risk of malaria infection [<xref rid="pone.0277789.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0277789.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] while IgG4 does immune modulation and limits malaria disease severity. High expression of IgG4 has been associated with repeated exposure to specific <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">falciparum</italic> antigens. As a result, individuals in malaria-endemic areas express higher levels of IgG4 [<xref rid="pone.0277789.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Cord blood of children born to mothers in malaria endemic regions has high levels of anti-MSP antibodies [<xref rid="pone.0277789.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. A study in Maputo province of Mozambique showed that placental infection was associated with an increase in maternal levels of total IgG and IgM against a broad range of <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>.<italic toggle="yes">falciparum</italic> specific antigens [<xref rid="pone.0277789.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0277789.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p>
              <p>A study in Papua New Guinea randomized mothers into two groups of Sulfadoxine- Pyrimethamine-Azithromycin and SP-chloroquine as malaria prophylaxes and found no difference in cord antibody levels (total IgG) between the two groups [<xref rid="pone.0277789.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. No easily available study directly compared effects of Sulfadoxine-Pyrimethamine and Dihydroartesimin-Piperaquine on levels of IgG sub-types in cord blood. In a case controlled study of pregnant women on anti-malaria prophylaxis in Nigeria, cord blood of mothers on prophylaxis had lower levels of IgG antibodies compared to the negative controls [<xref rid="pone.0277789.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p>
              <p>In this study, we determined if use of either DP or SP prophylaxis has any effects on cord levels of IgG. We further examined if placental malaria has any effect on expression of IgG in cord blood. Using cox regression, we modelled if cord blood levels of total IgG against Rh4.2, PfSEA, Etramp5Ag1, AMA1, EBA175 and GLURP181 adjusted for maternal wealth category index, gestational malaria prevalence, gravidity and birth weight have any effects on the risk of malaria infections in the first birth year.</p>

                <p>Only IgG specific to one antigen at a time was used in building the Cox regression model while adjusting for non-IgG covariates at each time.

The effects of different levels of the IgG (25<sup>th</sup>, 50<sup>th</sup> and 75<sup>th</sup> percentiles) on the incidence of malaria among study participants were assessed. The levels of the IgG at the 75<sup>th</sup> percentile was found to consistently have higher Hazard ratios and significant confidence intervals. Therefore, the levels of the IgG at the 75<sup>th</sup> percentile were used in building the Cox regression model. The P-values of the IgG variables in the Cox regression models were adjusted for Multiple testing using the Benjamin-Hoceberg correction of multiple testing in excel. The non-IgG covariates included were birth weight (&lt;2500 grams, &gt;2500grams), maternal malaria incidence (No malaria detected, and malaria detected), Maternal wealth index (poorest, middle, and least poor), gravidity category (1–3 and 4+). Cofounding was assessed in the Cox regression model and any variable that had the percentage difference of more than 10% between the crude and adjusted Hazard ratios was considered a cofounder. In the model building, the covariates that had p-value of ≤ 0.2 in the bivariate analysis were included in the model.</p>

                <p>Increased levels (75<sup>th</sup> percentile) of cord blood total IgG against Rh4.2 antigen and maternal poverty combined significantly increases risk of malaria infections in the first birth year of a child (AHR: Rh4.2 = 1.092, poorest = 0.000) (<xref rid="pone.0277789.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4A</xref>). Increased expression of cord blood total IgG against PfSEA, gestational malaria infections and poverty combined increased risk of malaria infections in the early months of a child’s existence (AHRs: PfSEA = 132, malaria was detected = 1.29 and maternal wealth index as poorest = 1.78) (<xref rid="pone.0277789.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4B</xref>). When combined, high levels of cord blood total IgG against Etramp5Ag1 and maternal poverty significantly increases risk of malaria infections in the first birth year (AHRs: Etramp5Ag1 = 1.21, mother’s wealth index categorized as poorest = 1.78) (<xref rid="pone.0277789.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4C</xref>). Similar findings were reported at increased expression of total levels against AMA1 adjusted for poverty. Risk of malaria infections significantly increased with increase in poverty and increase in IgG levels against AMA1 (AHRs: AMA1 = 1.25, mother’s wealth index categorized as poorest = 1.87) (<xref rid="pone.0277789.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4D</xref>). At increased level, serum cord total IgG levels against EBA175 combined with high maternal poverty and maternal malaria infections during pregnancy significantly increases risk of malaria infections during early days of a newborn existence (AHRs: EBA175 = 1.35, mothers’ wealth index categorized as poorest = 1.86, mothers with malaria episodes during pregnancy = 1.30) (<xref rid="pone.0277789.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4E</xref>). At increased levels, serum total IgG against GLURP combined with maternal poverty and effects of malaria infections during pregnancy significantly increases risk of clinical malaria disease in the first birth year of a child (AHRs: total IgG against GLURP = 1.83, malaria infection during pregnancy = 1.30, mothers’ wealth index categorized as poorest = 1.79) (<xref rid="pone.0277789.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4F</xref>)</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>We found no significant differences in cord IgG sub-type levels in children whose mothers were on SP versus those on DP for most antigens. Significant differences were only noted for tetanus toxoid in IgG1 levels against all the erythrocyte binding antigens (EBA140, EBA175, EBA181) and IgG4 against merozoite surface proteins (MSPCH150, MSP2Dd2). In all cases where significant differences were observed, mean cord levels for SP group are higher than the DP group. While most of the previous studies haven’t directly compared effects of DP and SP on cord expression of IgG subtypes against <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">falciparum</italic> specific antigens, one study did compare total IgG cord levels for expectant mothers on prophylaxis and those who never used. They found a significant difference in the mean total IgG levels between the two groups with expectant mothers on prophylaxis expressing less total IgG against selected antigens compared to those mothers who were enrolled on none [<xref rid="pone.0277789.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. There are no documented effects of either anti-malaria prophylaxis on the biochemical properties such as affinity, avidity and titers of the antibodies, so either of them can be used to prevent acquisition of malaria during pregnancy with little or minimal effect on malaria specific antibody titer [<xref rid="pone.0277789.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. A study by Ariera in Kenya did not also indicate any direct effects of either SP or DP on either transfer or expression of total IgG and subclasses from placenta to cord blood [<xref rid="pone.0277789.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. This is probably due to the fact that neither of the two drugs compete for the same binding site on the FcRn of the syncytiotrophoblast that IgG and its sub-classes usually bind to [<xref rid="pone.0277789.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The Ugandan Ministry of Health and other malaria endemic regions can benchmark on these findings to allow other anti-malaria prophylaxes to be utilized in the clinical setting as opposed to the current monopoly of SP. Currently in Uganda, the only recommended and approved anti-malaria prophylaxis is SP (common brand is called Fansidar). Further studies are needed to explore if the difference between SP and DP for IgG4 against signature <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">falciparum</italic> antigens can significantly affect child’s progression to severe disease.</p>
              <p>We found no association between placental malaria and the cord levels of IgG sub-class levels in malaria holoendemic area of Busia, Eastern Uganda. Even where differences exist, it was never skewed to either mothers who were negative for placental malaria or those positive but varied from one antigen to another. Studies done in other parts of Africa had different findings; some found strong association between placental malaria and reduced transfer/expression of maternal IgG from placental to cord blood. One study of interest concluded there was no significant difference in the expressed levels of antibodies against signature <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">falciparum</italic> specific antigens between children born to mothers with placental malaria and those born to mothers without [<xref rid="pone.0277789.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In other studies, the transfer and expression of total IgG, from placenta to cord blood was found to be increased in mothers who had placental malaria [<xref rid="pone.0277789.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Most studies searched compared effects of at least two co-morbidities such as HIV and placental malaria; this made it difficult to attribute observed decrease in transfer or expression to placental malaria [<xref rid="pone.0277789.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0277789.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0277789.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. A previous study did not also find any association between placental malaria and cord antibody levels [<xref rid="pone.0277789.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Repeated episodes of malaria, placental malaria infection is proven to dampen the immune system leading to immunological tolerance [<xref rid="pone.0277789.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. This can partly explain lack of association between placental malaria and cord levels of IgG sub-classes against <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">falciparum</italic> specific antigens [<xref rid="pone.0277789.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0277789.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p>
              <p>The multivariate cox regression analysis showed children with increased levels of cord blood total IgG against PfSEA, Rh 4.2, AMA1, EBA175, Etramp5Ag1and GLURP antigens have increased risk of malaria infection in the first birth year. The Schizont Egress 1 antigen facilitates merozoites egress; the protein has also been associated with kinetochore function during schizont development [<xref rid="pone.0277789.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. All rhoptry proteins (including Rh4.2) have been shown to be the dominant proteins transferred to the surface of normal erythrocytes during delayed or aborted re-invasion. Antibodies to this protein are known to mediate protection in immunized monkeys and to inhibit parasite growth <italic toggle="yes">invitro</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0277789.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. AMA1 is abundantly expressed in sporozoites and has been associated with parasite invasion of the liver cells (hepatocytes) [<xref rid="pone.0277789.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. <italic toggle="yes">Etramps</italic> (including Etramp5Ag1) are important mediators of plasmodium- host cell interactions while playing significant roles in parasite pathogenesis [<xref rid="pone.0277789.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Expression of antibodies against these key <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">falciparum</italic> antigens without protective could potentially increase the risk of malaria infections, with high likelihood of progression to severe disease. High incidence of gestational malaria also increases risk of malaria infection in a child during first months of existence. This could be because of exposure to similar source of infections like the mother. Early in life, the lifestyle of the baby is tied to that of mother and have similar exposures to malaria prevention strategies for example, sleeping under the same ITNs, sleeping in the same IRS house among others. Findings by this study agrees with those of other scholars and researchers [<xref rid="pone.0277789.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0277789.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p>
              <p>This study found that children born to poor mothers had highest risk of malaria infections during the first birth year. Mothers with inadequate income cannot afford quality food and nutrition supplement required for a baby’s growth, cannot promptly diagnose and treat infections such as malaria, parasitic and bacterial infections and others that can affect a baby’s health [<xref rid="pone.0277789.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Such mothers cannot afford other mosquito vector control measures such as repellants and sprays. Some studies found fever (a proxy measure of malaria) to affects children from very poor and least poor families in near equal proportion [<xref rid="pone.0277789.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. One prospective cohort study in rural areas of Tanzania found mortality from malaria among children born to very poor families were higher than those among children born to least poor families [<xref rid="pone.0277789.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p>

                <title>Limitation of the study</title>
                <p>Most children were breast feeding, so we could not account for IgG taken through breast milk. The roles of other cofounding such as IgGA in breast milk, lactoferritin in breast milk, and fetal Hemoglobin in clearing parasitemia were not adjusted for during this study. We had a challenge with deciding on the appropriate concentration of secondary antibody to be used in the Luminex assay because the original dilution factor in both the protocol and manufacturer’s instruction were not yielding very good results.</p>

Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses all the points raised below during the review process.<!-- </div> --><!-- <div> --></p>
              <p>Please submit your revised manuscript by Mar 13 2022 11:59PM. If you will need more time than this to complete your revisions, please reply to this message or contact the journal office at <email>plosone@plos.org</email>. When you're ready to submit your revision, log on to <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/</ext-link> and select the 'Submissions Needing Revision' folder to locate your manuscript file.</p>
              <p>Please include the following items when submitting your revised manuscript:<!-- </div> --><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>A rebuttal letter that responds to each point raised by the academic editor and reviewer(s). You should upload this letter as a separate file labeled 'Response to Reviewers'.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A marked-up copy of your manuscript that highlights changes made to the original version. You should upload this as a separate file labeled 'Revised Manuscript with Track Changes'.</p></list-item><list-item><p>An unmarked version of your revised paper without tracked changes.

              <p>If you would like to make changes to your financial disclosure, please include your updated statement in your cover letter. Guidelines for resubmitting your figure files are available below the reviewer comments at the end of this letter.</p>
              <p>If applicable, we recommend that you deposit your laboratory protocols in protocols.io to enhance the reproducibility of your results. Protocols.io assigns your protocol its own identifier (DOI) so that it can be cited independently in the future. For instructions see: <ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-laboratory-protocols" ext-link-type="uri">https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-laboratory-protocols</ext-link>. Additionally, PLOS ONE offers an option for publishing peer-reviewed Lab Protocol articles, which describe protocols hosted on protocols.io. Read more information on sharing protocols at <ext-link xlink:href="https://plos.org/protocols?utm_medium=editorial-email&amp;utm_source=authorletters&amp;utm_campaign=protocols" ext-link-type="uri">https://plos.org/protocols?utm_medium=editorial-email&amp;utm_source=authorletters&amp;utm_campaign=protocols</ext-link>.</p>
              <p>We look forward to receiving your revised manuscript.</p>
              <p>Kind regards,</p>

              <p>2. We note that the grant information you provided in the ‘Funding Information’ and ‘Financial Disclosure’ sections do not match. </p>
              <p>When you resubmit, please ensure that you provide the correct grant numbers for the awards you received for your study in the ‘Funding Information’ section.</p>
              <p>3. We note that you have stated that you will provide repository information for your data at acceptance. Should your manuscript be accepted for publication, we will hold it until you provide the relevant accession numbers or DOIs necessary to access your data. If you wish to make changes to your Data Availability statement, please describe these changes in your cover letter and we will update your Data Availability statement to reflect the information you provide.</p>
              <p>4. PLOS requires an ORCID iD for the corresponding author in Editorial Manager on papers submitted after December 6th, 2016.

              <p>Reviewer #1: This study evaluated effects of Intermittent Prophylactic Treatment in Pregnancy and placental malaria status on malaria specific IgG levels in the fetus and the association between IgG levels and occurrence of malaria in the first year of the infants. This is an interesting and important research topic. I have some questions about the data analysis.</p>
              <p>The authors mentioned that “Increasing antibody titer against P.falciparum may be more of a</p>
              <p>marker of exposure to previous malaria infections”. What does “previous malaria” mean here? Mothers got malaria during pregnancy? Doesn’t placenta malaria capture that information?</p>
              <p>For the survival analysis what if the placenta malaria status was used as the grouping variable instead of IgG levels?</p>
              <p>Does “ANOVA in Box plot” means the data are plotted in box plot and comparisons were done using ANOVA? ANOVA compares means instead of medians. Because there are only two groups in the comparison, ANOVA is the same as t-test. Also many of the log-IgG level seem to have a skewed distribution, a non-parametric test may be needed. Due to the relatively large number of comparisons (4 IgG subtypes and 15 antigens) P-values need to be adjusted for multiple testing.</p>
              <p>IgG levels may be affected by many factors, e.g., SP vs DP, placenta malaria status, clinical characteristics of the mothers. A multivariable regression model will be helpful to identify factors that may influence IgG levels.</p>
              <p>In the result section about survival curves, hazard ratio (HR) were given at the end of the paragraph but which IgG was this? Does the star in Figure 3 means p&lt;0.05 between the two groups? If so, stars were seen in most of the subplots but only a few HRs were mentioned in the text. In addition, it will be interesting to fit a Cox regression model to assess the association while adjusting other covariates in the model. The low concentration group had a lower risk comparing to the higher concentration group. Shouldn’t the HR be &lt;1 rather than &gt;1. Please double check the text/numbers.</p>
              <p>Are data on the mother’s social economic status (SES) available? If so, it would be interesting to include the SES variables in the regression models that predicting IgG levels and the Cox model to see if they play a role.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: The manuscript is very well written, and the results are very interesting. However, the authors could make some corrections.</p>
              <p>Manuscript Title:</p>
              <p>Authors can revise the title and mention the effect of treatment with SP and DP, instead of talking only about P. falciparum infection</p>
              <p>Abstract</p>

              <p>- Why does the representation of the graphs differ? Please harmonize</p>
              <p>- Specify the number of participants per group (n = ….)</p>
              <p>- Association of placental malaria and malaria specific IgG antibodies:</p>
              <p>Is there not an effect of both treatment (IPTp) / placental infection with P.f on the level of IgG?</p>
              <p>Did all women receive IPTp treatment?</p>
              <p>The authors can compare the level of IgG in children from mothers on SP (P.f neg vs P.f pos), and in children from</p>
              <p>mothers on PD (P.f neg vs P.f pos).</p>
              <p>- Association of malaria specific IgG sub-types and incidence of malaria in the study population</p>
              <p>Authors can change “probability of survival” to “probability of fewer occurrence of malaria”</p>
              <p>Discussion :</p>
              <p>The authors can provide explanations for the differences observed only with a few antigens. Do these antigens have any particularities? The results obtained must be well discussed.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: Erick and colleagues presents a report investigating levels of IgG in pregnant women cord blood receiving IPTp (or not) and in their infants after birth. They further attempt to investigate if IgG levels in cord blood has a protective effect against malaria. Similar studies have been performed previously, but this study includes a broad panel of 15 different Pf IgG targets and does well to look at IgG subclasses.</p>
              <p>Major comments</p>
              <p>There are numerous grammatical errors throughout the text, figures, and tables. The authors need to have their manuscript reviewed by someone with English as their first language in order to provide a clearer presentation of their findings.</p>
              <p>Minor comments</p>
              <p>Abstract and throughout: make sure to specify that you are assaying only for IgG antibodies. For example, the phrase in the Abstract: "Cord concentrations of the erythrocyte binding antigens (EBA140, EBA175 and EBA181) were significantly different.." makes it sound like you are detection the actual Pf EBAs, and not the Ig against EBAs.</p>
              <p>Throughout: the assay signal for IgG is never translated to a concentration (ug/mL for example), so the authors should not refer to "concentrations" of antibodies in their study. Could replace with a word like "levels"</p>
              <p>Introduction:</p>
              <p>- "Mandatory" for Ugandan women to be enrolled in IPTp?</p>
              <p>- Can delete "and consumes most of this essential gas"</p>
              <p>- Please modify "most importantly the role of IgG from plasma.." as Ig transfer is one of many protective factors and shouldn't be assigned as the most important</p>
              <p>- Can delete "(total and sub-classes)" since this is redundant</p>
              <p>- "These anti-malarial immunoglobulins have varied..."</p>
              <p>- "Antibodies against merozoite surface proteins are the most expressed in cord blood". You can just say cord blood has high levels of anti-MSP antibodies.</p>
              <p>- DP and SP need to be written out at first use.</p>
              <p>Materials and Methods:</p>
              <p>- Need to explain specifically how the blood samples were collected, stored short-term (what type of containers, coagulant, fractionated?), and temperature stored at long-term until the IgG assay. It appears plasma was the sample stored long-term.</p>
              <p>- Provide company information for all lab chemicals and assay reagents</p>
              <p>- Need to provide references for the antigens use in the panel, and more detail on coupling conditions.</p>
              <p>- Need to provide software that was used for analysis, and how the Kaplan-Meir curves were created in the software</p>
              <p>Results:</p>
              <p>- Figure 1: why are all 4 panels not boxplots?</p>
              <p>- Figure 1: Missing AMA1 for panel A</p>
              <p>- Figure 1: is panel B for IgG2 or IgG3?</p>
              <p>- Figure 3: need all x and y axes to be the same among panels and plots. Some x axes appear to be days, and some months. Y axis isn't "Probability of Survival" but "Probability of no malaria infection"</p>
              <p>- Figure 3 legend: panel A is IgG1 correct?</p>
              <p>Discussion:</p>
              <p>- "so either of them can be used safely to prevent acquisition of malaria..." the safety of these drugs has nothing to do with IgG antibody levels in women taking them. Please revise.</p>
              <p>- "We found no overall association between placental..."</p>
              <p>- Please remove the sentence referencing hemozoin as it is incorrect and not relevant here.</p>
              <p>- "cofounders such as IgGA"?</p>

              <p>Response: Thanks for the comments; this has been effected in the revised manuscript. </p>
              <p>Reviewer’s comments</p>
              <p>Reviewer One:</p>
              <p>Comment#1: Reviewer 1: The authors mentioned that “Increasing antibody titer against P.falciparum may be more of a</p>
              <p>marker of exposure to previous malaria infections”. What does “previous malaria” mean here? Mothers got malaria during pregnancy. Doesn’t placenta malaria capture that information?</p>
              <p>Response: Thank you for the comment, we acknowledged the lack of clarity in usage of the term “Previous malaria infections”; however, we intended to mean that the antibody titre levels observed amongst study participants were due to an exposure to Plasmodium falciparum parasites rather than being an indicator of protective immune response. The term “previous malaria” has been replaced by exposure to Plasmodium falciparum parasites. </p>
              <p>Comment#2; Reviewer 1: For the survival analysis what if the placenta malaria status was used as the grouping variable instead of IgG levels?</p>
              <p>Response: In our study, we sought to assess how malaria infections in pregnancy affects malaria episodes in children born to these mothers. Therefore, measurements of IgG level was done as a marker of malaria infection in children. The IgG levels is thus the most appropriate grouping variable. If we use placental malaria as a grouping variable, it would be difficult to test our hypothesis that malaria specific IgG levels protects against both infection and severe disease in the first few months of life. </p>
              <p>Comment#3; Reviewer 1: Does “ANOVA in Box plot” means the data are plotted in box plot and comparisons were done using ANOVA? ANOVA compares means instead of medians. Because there are only two groups in the comparison, ANOVA is the same as t-test. Also, many of the log-IgG level seem to have a skewed distribution, a non-parametric test may be needed. Due to the relatively large number of comparisons (4 IgG subtypes and 15 antigens) P-values need to be adjusted for multiple testing.</p>
              <p>Response: </p>
              <p>Thanks for the comment, we have now analyzed the data using, Man-Whitney u test (a non-parametric test) has been used to compare means of IgG sub-type levels across DP and SP in the revised manuscript. Independent variable was treatment arm while dependent variable was IgG sub-type levels against different P. falciparum antigens. </p>
              <p>Comment #4; Reviewer 1: In the result section about survival curves, hazard ratio (HR) was given at the end of the paragraph, but which IgG was this? Does the star in Figure 3 means p&lt;0.05 between the two groups? If so, stars were seen in most of the subplots but only a few HRs were mentioned in the text. In addition, it will be interesting to fit a Cox regression model to assess the association while adjusting other covariates in the model. The low concentration group had a lower risk comparing to the higher concentration group. Shouldn’t the HR be &lt;1 rather than &gt;1. Please double check the text/numbers.</p>
              <p>Response: Noted; it is true that hazard ratio stated is only for IgG1 because it is the IgG sub class that plays the most vital role in malaria immunology; reciprocal Hazard ratio is what has been presented explaining why values are more than one.</p>
              <p>Comment #5; Reviewer 1: Are data on the mother’s social economic status (SES) available? If so, it would be interesting to include the SES variables in the regression models that predicting IgG levels and the Cox model to see if they play a role.</p>
              <p>Response: Yes, Social Economic status has been captured; these includes wealth index category (poor, very poor, average, well off), Education status type of house construction, and use of long-lasting insecticide treated mosquito net. Previous studies that attempted to look at effects of social economic status of mothers on cord expression of IgG levels in newborn did not have significant findings or association between SES and cord IgG sub-class expression</p>
              <p>Reviewer 2:</p>
              <p>Comment #1; Reviewer 2: Authors can revise the title and mention the effect of treatment with SP and DP, instead of talking only about P. falciparum infection</p>
              <p>Response: Thanks for the comment, our revised tittle now reads; “Effects of anti-malarial prophylaxes on maternal transfer of Immunoglobulin-G (IgG) and association to Immunity against Plasmodium falciparum infections among Children in a Ugandan birth Cohort”</p>
              <p>Comment #2 Abstract; Reviewer 2: Choose between antibody and anti-body</p>
              <p>Response: Authors have chosen to use “antibody” not “anti-body”; this has been corrected all throughout the revised manuscript</p>
              <p>Comment #3 Abstract, Reviewer 2: Results: Specify the difference (high or low) in IgG4 between children from mothers on SP vs DP, same thing for EBA</p>
              <p>Comment #4 Abstract,Reviewer 2: Conclusion: " increasing antibody titer against P.falciparum " in whom? Please specify</p>
              <p>Response: Thanks for the comment. This has been corrected in the revised manuscript, ‘increasing antibody titer against P. falciparum in children’ </p>
              <p>Comment #5, Introduction; Reviewer 2: </p>
              <p>- Antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) - not antigen dependent cellular cytotoxicity</p>
              <p>- Put space before the references or not. Please harmonize</p>
              <p>- High expression of IgG4 has been associated with repeated exposure to specific…of IgG4: Please put reference</p>
              <p>Response: Statement has been changed from antigen dependent cellular cytotoxicity to antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity as guided by the reviewer. </p>
              <p>Comment #6: Reviewer 2: Materials and methods</p>
              <p>- Participants and data collection: Give enough details</p>
              <p>- Describe preparation of buffer A, then B</p>
              <p>- MagPix multiplex bead array assay: If available, please provide the IgG positivity threshold and specify how this threshold was determined</p>
              <p>- The sample collection times for carrying out the survival tests were not detailed.</p>
              <p>Response: Demographic and clinical details of study participants is captured in a previous study which was published <ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736</ext-link>(18)32224-4; it has been cited as well .Description of Preparation of buffer A was made first, that of buffer B then followed as guided by the reviewer. MagPix multiplexbead array assay: The plates were read on a Magpix platform (Luminex, USA), acquiring at least 50 beads/region/well. The results were expressed as median fluorescence intensity (MFI). The blank well MFI (background effects) was deducted from each well to determine the net MFI (IgG positive result). Sample collection for Kaplan Meir survival curve analysis</p>
              <p>Primary study where samples for this study were retrieved from was collected during delivery (cord blood). Collection was done by the midwife, medical officer or obstetrician who conducted delivery or cesarian section. Average of 4mls of accompanying mother’s venous blood was collected as well in an EDTA tube (mother baby pair). Both cord and maternal blood were centrifuged to obtain serum, archived at appropriate temperature, and retrieved for this study. Archival was done in mother-baby pair arrangement, a random-access number generated by the computer was used to track samples in the biobank. Venous blood samples were collected from infants at different time points during first year of life as and when malaria related signs and symptoms such as fever, vomiting or chills appear. Blood samples obtained was prepared and examined for presence of P.falciparum parasites; balance archived and used for future study like this one. Obtaining samples at different time points allowed for estimation of antibody decay rates.</p>
              <p>Preparation of buffer A</p>
              <p>Buffer A was prepared as discussed previously, but briefly, 1L of phosphate buffer solution was measured and put in a conical flask after which 500µl of tween was dispensed into the PBS to form PBS-tween solution.5g of PVP powder was weighed using a weighing balance in aluminum foil and added to the above solution after which equal amount of PVA powder was weighed and added to the mixture; proper agitation and mixing was done using a vortexer. 5mls of BSA was pipetted and added to the solution; finally, 0.2g of Sodium azide was weighed under a biosafety hood in an aluminum foil, added to the solution, properly vortexed and mixed. The final solution labelled with day of preparation and names of those who prepared.</p>
              <p>Preparation of buffer B</p>
              <p>A method by (18) was used in the preparation of buffer B. Briefly, 1000mls of phosphate buffer solution (PBS) was transferred to a sterile glass tube. To this was added, 500ul of tween solution (from thermos scientific), 5g of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), 5mls of bovine serum albumin solution (BSA), 0.2g sodium azide and 3mls of lyophilized E.coli solution. The mixture was incubated overnight at 4oC. </p>
              <p> IgG positivity rate was determined by subtracting combined sum of background effects and antibody MFI of pooled samples of six Caucasians from UK with no history of exposure to malaria from antibody MFI of blood samples of children born to mothers in Malaria endemic areas.</p>
              <p>Comment #7 : Reviewer 2: Results</p>
              <p>- Figure 1: Review the figure, with good resolution.</p>
              <p>- Why does the representation of the graphs differ? Please harmonize</p>
              <p>- Specify the number of participants per group (n = ….)</p>
              <p>- Association of placental malaria and malaria specific IgG antibodies:</p>
              <p>Is there not an effect of both treatment (IPTp) / placental infection with P.f on the level of IgG?</p>
              <p>Did all women receive IPTp treatment?</p>
              <p>The authors can compare the level of IgG in children from mothers on SP (P.f neg vs P.f pos), and in children from</p>
              <p>mothers on PD (P.f neg vs P.f pos).</p>
              <p>- Association of malaria specific IgG sub-types and incidence of malaria in the study population</p>
              <p>Authors can change “probability of survival” to “probability of fewer occurrence of malaria”</p>
              <p>Response: Figure was reviewed as guided the corrections are found in our revised submission </p>
              <p>- Figure one in the revised manuscript new have better resolutions and more clear graphical representation</p>
              <p>-All plots in figure 1 have all been standardized.</p>
              <p>-A total of 622 samples from infants were included in this study. Of these, 271 IgG1 results were merged with clinical data base, 305 IgG2 results were merged with clinical data base, 260 IgG3 results were merged with clinical data base and 269 IgG IgG4 results were merged as well.</p>
              <p>-All women received IPTq because it is a policy in Uganda for all pregnant. The approved IPTq by the Ugandan Ministry of Health is three doses of SP (common brand is Fansidar) divided across the three trimesters of pregnancy. </p>
              <p>-studying effects of both treatment (IPTq) and placental infection with P.f on levels of IgG would be informative but was not the focus of our current study, this can be considered for future studies.</p>
              <p>-Yes, all women received IPTq treatment; design of the original study randomized expectant mothers into the two arms of the prophylaxes; DP and SP. DP is the trial drug for IPTq while SP is the approved drug for routine use.</p>
              <p>-suggestion of comparing IgG level in children from mothers on SP versus DP according to malaria status is a good one, however this was not done in the current study. </p>
              <p>- </p>
              <p>Comment #8; Reviewer 2 Discussion :</p>
              <p>The authors can provide explanations for the differences observed only with a few antigens. Do these antigens have any particularities? The results obtained must be well discussed.</p>
              <p>Response: The study was unique because of the large range of antigen parameter; dropping others means diluting the study. Discussion section has been expounded to capture reviewer’s guidance.</p>
              <p>Particularities available include stage of infection where the parasite produced it, purification methods and class in which it belongs.</p>
              <p>Reviewer 3:</p>
              <p>Comment 1: Reviewer 3: Major comments</p>
              <p>There are numerous grammatical errors throughout the text, figures, and tables. The authors need to have their manuscript reviewed by someone with English as their first language in order to provide a clearer presentation of their findings.</p>
              <p>Response: This is noted in good faith, keen attention has been put in the revised manuscript to try and minimize grammatical and typing errors. Presentations in terms of tables, graphs will be clearer submitted this time</p>
              <p>Comment 2: Reviewer 3 Minor comments</p>
              <p>Abstract and throughout: make sure to specify that you are assaying only for IgG antibodies. For example, the phrase in the Abstract: "Cord concentrations of the erythrocyte binding antigens (EBA140, EBA175 and EBA181) were significantly different." makes it sound like you are detection the actual Pf EBAs, and not the Ig against EBAs.</p>
              <p>Response: Comment noted; and revised to include reviewer’s guidance; malaria specific</p>
              <p>Comment 3: Reviewer 3: Throughout: the assay signal for IgG is never translated to a concentration (ug/mL for example), so the authors should not refer to "concentrations" of antibodies in their study. Could replace with a word like "levels"</p>
              <p>Response: This is noted, every sentence that has “concentration” has been changed to “level” in the revised manuscript.</p>
              <p>Comment 4: Reviewer 3: Introduction:</p>
              <p>- "Mandatory" for Ugandan women to be enrolled in IPTp?</p>
              <p>- Can delete "and consumes most of this essential gas"</p>
              <p>- Please modify "most importantly the role of IgG from plasma.." as Ig transfer is one of many protective factors and shouldn't be assigned as the most important</p>
              <p>- Can delete "(total and sub-classes)" since this is redundant</p>
              <p>- "These anti-malarial immunoglobulins have varied..."</p>
              <p>- "Antibodies against merozoite surface proteins are the most expressed in cord blood". You can just say cord blood has high levels of anti-MSP antibodies.</p>
              <p>- DP and SP need to be written out at first use.</p>
              <p> Response: Yes, it a policy that every pregnant mother be given some IPTp at least in every trimester</p>
              <p>-“most important” has been deleted as advised by the reviewer.</p>
              <p>-“total and sub-classes” deleted as advised</p>
              <p>-both reviewer’s input in the last two bullets have been captured in the revised manuscript submitted.</p>
              <p>-DP and SP has been quoted right from the beginning of introduction as guided by the reviewer</p>
              <p>Comments 5: Reviewer 3: Materials and Methods:</p>
              <p>- Need to explain specifically how the blood samples were collected, stored short-term (what type of containers, coagulant, fractionated?), and temperature stored at long-term until the IgG assay. It appears plasma was the sample stored long-term.</p>
              <p>- Provide company information for all lab chemicals and assay reagents</p>
              <p>Response.</p>
              <p>Primary study where samples for this study were retrieved from was collected during delivery (cord blood) (reference). Collection was done by the midwife, medical officer or obstetrician who conducted delivery or cesarian section. Average of 4mls of accompanying mother’s venous blood was collected as well in an EDTA tube (mother baby pair). Both cord and maternal blood were centrifuged to obtain serum, archived at appropriate temperature, and retrieved for this study. Archival was done in mother-baby pair arrangement, a random-access number generated by the computer was used to track samples in the biobank. Venous blood samples were collected from infants at different time points during first year of life as and when malaria related signs and symptoms such as fever, vomiting or chills appear. Blood samples obtained was prepared and examined for presence of P.falciparum parasites; balance archived and used for future study like this one. Obtaining samples at different time points allowed for estimation of antibody decay rates.</p>
              <p>-All Luminex reagents were made by Luminex Corp, Austin Texas USA. </p>
              <p>Comment 7: Reviewer 3: Need to provide references for the antigens use in the panel, and more detail on coupling conditions.</p>
              <p>- Need to provide software that was used for analysis, and how the Kaplan-Meir curves were created in the software</p>
              <p>Response: </p>
              <p>Graph pad prism was used to draw Kaplan -Meir curves, while box plots were created in STATA (ver 15). To create curve, immunological data (IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4) were first merged with clinical data separately. Data was sorted in decreasing levels per IgG sub-type. Data was arranged into 25th percentile (portion containing least values) and 75th percentile (containing largest values) per IgG sub-class. The two groups of infants with varied antibody concentration were compared for occurrence of malaria in the first birth year. Malaria episodes was captured in the clinical data base.</p>
              <p>IgG sub-types 1- 4 against 15 P. falciparum blood specific antigens and Tetanus Toxoid (TT) was measured in plasma diluted in buffer B. 50µl of bead suspension was added to each well (1,000 beads/region/well) of the 96 plate (Bio-plex pro-flat bottom). The plate was washed, placed on a magnetic block for 2 minutes and the supernatant was then poured off. The beads were washed twice with PBS tween buffer, laid on the magnetic separator for 2 minutes and supernatant poured off.</p>
              <p>Reference for the antigens</p>
              <p>Comment 8: reviewer 3: Results:</p>
              <p>- Figure 1: why are all 4 panels not boxplots?</p>
              <p>- Figure 1: Missing AMA1 for panel A</p>
              <p>- Figure 1: is panel B for IgG2 or IgG3?</p>
              <p>- Figure 3: need all x and y axes to be the same among panels and plots. Some x axes appear to be days, and some months. Y axis isn't "Probability of Survival" but "Probability of no malaria infection"</p>
              <p>- Figure 3 legend: panel A is IgG1 correct?</p>
              <p>Response.</p>
              <p>All 4 panels in figure one has been revised to box plot</p>
              <p>Figure 1 now has AMA1, question of whether panel B is for IgG2 or IgG3 has now been addressed in the revised manuscript.</p>
              <p>Yes, panel A in Fig 3 is IgG1.</p>
              <p>Mix up of scale in fig 3 has been corrected in the revised manuscript</p>
              <p>Comment 9: reviewer 3: Discussion:</p>
              <p>- "so either of them can be used safely to prevent acquisition of malaria..." the safety of these drugs has nothing to do with IgG antibody levels in women taking them. Please revise.</p>
              <p>- "We found no overall association between placental..."</p>
              <p>- Please remove the sentence referencing hemozoin as it is incorrect and not relevant here.</p>
              <p>- "cofounders such as IgGA"?</p>
              <p>Response: Statement containing safety of the two drugs has been removed from paragraph 1 of the discussion. </p>
              <p>This has been replaced by the statement “We found no overall association between placental” </p>
              <p>Statement referring to hemozoin has been deleted as guided by the reviewer</p>

              <p>Reviewer #1: Some of my previous questions/comments were not addressed in this revision which I will restate below. Due to the many factors that can influence malaria risk I still think a multivariate Cox regression is useful to understand the association.</p>
              <p>A total of 16 Ig-G subtypes were used in the comparison and p-values need to be adjusted for multiple testing. I am not familiar with this particular research area, but would it be meaningful to combine all Ig-G subtypes into one variable in the analysis? This way multiple testing is not a concern and the main message will be easier to see. Right now there are too many comparisons which makes the result hard to interpret.</p>
              <p>The conclusion from the survival model is that “antibody titer against P.falciparum may be more of a marker of exposure to previous malaria infections among infants from malaria endemic areas as opposed to their protective roles” which is interesting and that is why I recommended using placental malaria status as the grouping variable. If your conclusion is true I would expect to see higher malaria rates among those positive for placental malaria. The Cox model may also help to tease apart the effects of placental malaria and Ig-G levels.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: The authors have taken into account the various comments and have done an excellent job in improving the manuscript.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: The authors provide an improved version of the manuscript which is much easier to read and comprehend. A few minor issues need to be addressed:</p>
              <p>- In Methods, the authors need to add company information for all of their chemicals, reagents, and other labware</p>
              <p>- Concentrations of reagents such as secondary antibody and PE-conjugate used for the assays need to be included in Methods</p>
              <p>- For Figures 1 and 2, include labels for the y axis on each panel. Perhaps on the x axis, can state "Placental Malaria", "No Placental Malaria", rather than "No", "Yes"</p>

              <p>Response:</p>
              <p>Thank you for the observation; We properly reviewed all citations and noted there was non which was incomplete or retracted from the journal. We noted that only citation number 23 and 25 were repeated and repeats were deleted</p>
              <p>Reviewers’ comments</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1, comment#1</p>
              <p>Some of my previous questions/comments were not addressed in this revision which I will restate below. Due to the many factors that can influence malaria risk I still think a multivariate Cox regression is useful to understand the association.</p>
              <p>Response: As guided by the reviewer, A multivariate cox regression using Breslow method for ties of the survival data was used to do this analysis. Failure variable was fever in a child in the first birth year, failure values were 3,4,5 which were episodes of fever while time to event was measured in days. The covariates included in the analysis are mother’s prophylactic arm (SP or DP), Insecticide treated mosquito use (used or not), placental malaria by histology (negative or positive) and total IgG levels against 16 malaria specific antigens</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1, comment#2</p>
              <p>A total of 16 Ig-G subtypes were used in the comparison and p-values need to be adjusted for multiple testing. I am not familiar with this research area, but would it be meaningful to combine all Ig-G subtypes into one variable in the analysis? This way multiple testing is not a concern, and the main message will be easier to see. Right now, there are too many comparisons which makes the result hard to interpret.</p>
              <p>Response: Thank you for your keen observation; to add meaning to p-value during multivariate cox regression analysis, hazard ratio and z values were added to bring more meaning into the results.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1, comment#3</p>
              <p>The conclusion from the survival model is that “antibody titer against P.falciparum may be more of a marker of exposure to previous malaria infections among infants from malaria endemic areas as opposed to their protective roles” which is interesting and that is why I recommended using placental malaria status as the grouping variable. If your conclusion is true, I would expect to see higher malaria rates among those positive for placental malaria. The Cox model may also help to tease apart the effects of placental malaria and Ig-G levels.</p>
              <p>Response: we take note of this recommendation; In the cox regression analysis, Prescence of placental malaria by histology during delivery did not increase risk of developing fever in a child’s first birth year as there was no difference in number of fever episodes in children born to mothers with either placental malaria status (HR1. 1.3394,p=0.264 (table 3). We went further examined if difference in income levels affects birth weight of a child, time to first malaria incidence and number of malaria episodes. All three outcomes were aligned to mother’s economic status in a grouped column of graph pad prism. Two-way Analysis of Variance was used to compare difference in the mean values of the three groups across the three outcomes</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: The authors provide an improved version of the manuscript which is much easier to read and comprehend. A few minor issues need to be addressed:</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3,comment #1</p>
              <p>In Methods, the authors need to add company information for all their chemicals, reagents, and other labware</p>
              <p>Response: We take note of your guidance; company names for almost reagents and chemicals used has been included in the revised manuscript</p>
              <p> Reviewer #3,comment #2</p>
              <p>Concentrations of reagents such as secondary antibody and PE-conjugate used for the assays need to be included in Methods</p>
              <p>Response: This has been factored in the revised manuscript in this statement “50µl of a secondary antibody specific for an IgG sub-type (IgG1, IgG2, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4) with concentration of 1in1000 for IgG1,IgG2 and IgG4 while secondary antibody against IgG4 was diluted at 1in 2000 in dilution buffer, Using a multichannel pipette, 50µl of 1in 200 R-Phycoerythrin-conjugate AffinPure F (ab’) goat anti-human IgG</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3,comment #2</p>
              <p>For Figures 1 and 2, include labels for the y axis on each panel. Perhaps on the x axis, can state "Placental Malaria", "No Placental Malaria", rather than "No", "Yes"</p>
              <p>Response: y axes have been labelled for all graphs as “log transformed IgG levels”; X-axis labelling has been adjusted in the revised manuscript.</p>

              <p>Reviewer #1: Cox model: why were only subjects with &gt;=3 episodes of fevers considered as a failure instead of occurrence of malaria as in Figure 4? How were subjects with 1 and 2 episodes handled in the model? Family socioeconomic status and placental malaria status need to be adjusted for in the cox model. There are too many IgG variables in the model. Are different IgG levels correlated? If not, maybe better to fit each IgG in the model in turn and adjust the p-values for multiple testing. Table 3 needs to show variable description instead of variables names used in the coding. What is the overall P value? Is it likelihood ratio test of all the variables in the model? The likelihood ratio test should test for all the IgG related variables only.</p>
              <p>It is not clear what is Figure 3A showing. Do the three tick marks on the x-axis in each subplot denote different outcome? What is the y-axis? Birth weight cannot be close to 0. Also it is not clear how the 2-way ANOVA was set up? If birth weight of a child, time to first malaria incidence and number of malaria episodes are the outcomes and mother’s economic status is a factor what is the other factor?</p>
              <p>Result section on Kaplan-Meir survival curve, why was it called “reciprocal hazard ratio”? Higher level was associated with higher risk. Shouldn’t the value presented just be the hazard ratio for higher levels of IgG?</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: (No Response)</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: The authors still need to arrange some elements for easier interpretation. Table 3 should have defined rows and columns (like Tables 1 and 2) and the first 5 rows ("Time variable...." to "Overall P...") need to be deleted. In Figure 3, the two plots need clear labeling on the x and y-axes. For A, I assume the y-axis is birthweight, but what are the three categories on the x-axis? For B, I assume the x-axis is time to first malaria episode?</p>

              <p>Reviewer #1: Cox model: why were only subjects with &gt;=3 episodes of fevers considered as a failure instead of occurrence of malaria as in Figure 4? How were subjects with 1 and 2 episodes handled in the model?</p>
              <p>Response: Thank you for the observation; we have dropped the number of fever episodes as a failure event and replaced it with malaria occurrence in a child throughout the observation period, failure event is now occurrence of malaria. This is adjusted for in the copy with tracked changes and the revised version. Failure values are 1,2,3,4,5 </p>
              <p> Family socioeconomic status and placental malaria status need to be adjusted for in the cox model. There are too many IgG variables in the model. Are different IgG levels correlated? If not, maybe better to fit each IgG in the model in turn and adjust the p-values for multiple testing. </p>
              <p>Response: Your comment is noted and addressed; all covariates (parasite prevalence by microscopy during pregnancy, malaria episodes during pregnancy, choice of IPT, placental malaria and total IgG response against malaria specific antigens) had their P-values adjusted for using Benjamin-Hoceberg correction for multiple testing in excel (Table 3)</p>
              <p>Table 3 needs to show variable description instead of variables names used in the coding. What is the overall P value? Is it likelihood ratio test of all the variables in the model? The likelihood ratio test should test for all the IgG related variables only.</p>
              <p>Response: Full names of variables have been captured below the table under the key. Variables full names are too long to fit in the variable column; readers will be referred to the key below table 3. The first 5 columns of table 3; including overall P value has been deleted as advised by reviewer 3; this adresses your concerns as well.</p>
              <p>It is not clear what is Figure 3A showing. Do the three tick marks on the x-axis in each subplot denote different outcome? What is the y-axis? Birth weight cannot be close to 0. Also, it is not clear how the 2-way ANOVA was set up? If birth weight of a child, time to first malaria incidence and number of malaria episodes are the outcomes and mother’s economic status is a factor what is the other factor?</p>
              <p>Response: Comments well noted; time to 1st malaria incidence and number of malaria incidence have been dropped off the variable list for the analysis; only birth weight has been maintained. Two way ANOVA in a grouped column graph was also dropped off as the analysis method; only mean data plot for birth weight versus economic status was maintained in the analysis (fig 3).</p>
              <p>Result section on Kaplan-Meir survival curve, why was it called “reciprocal hazard ratio”? Higher level was associated with higher risk. Shouldn’t the value presented just be the hazard ratio for higher levels of IgG?</p>
              <p>Thank you for the keen observation and guidance; It was indeed in error to refer to it as reciprocal Hazard ratio; it has been corrected to read Hazard ratio as it is the right statistical language.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: (No Response)</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: The authors still need to arrange some elements for easier interpretation. Table 3 should have defined rows and columns (like Tables 1 and 2) and the first 5 rows ("Time variable...." to "Overall P...") need to be deleted. In Figure 3, the two plots need clear labeling on the x and y-axes. For A, I assume the y-axis is birthweight, but what are the three categories on the x-axis? For B, I assume the x-axis is time to first malaria episode?</p>
              <p>Table 3 titled “multivariate cox regression of malaria occurrence in the first birth year of children associated with selected maternal characteristics/exposure variables” has clearly and well-defined titles within each column. For titles of rows, short forms, and acronyms of the full names have been used. Full names are captured under the key below the table. First five rows of table 3 deleted as guided. Figure 3A was removed as guided by the 1st reviewer, For Figure 3B, the two variables of time to first malaria and number of malaria episodes were dropped in the data mean set analysis; only birth weight was sustained as variable of comparison with income status. Figure 3 is now clearer and straight forward</p>

              </p>
              <p>Reviewer #1, Qn 1: “Placental malaria prevalence”- is this a binary (presence/absence) variable or a continuous variable?</p>
              <p>Yes, placental malaria is a binary variable and was measured as a Yes or No. This has been clearly indicated in the revised Manuscript.</p>
              <p>Reviewer # 1, Qn 2: Cox regression: “total IgG”- is the sum of IgG across IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4? There are many IgG variables in the model and there may be collinearity. My suggestion is to include only IgG specific to one antigen at a time as a predictor in the cox regression while adjusting for other non-IgG covariates. The p-values of the IgG variables from all the different cox models should be adjusted for multiple testing.</p>
              <p>Response: Yes, we agree to the reviewer’s suggestion, and we included only IgG specific to one antigen at a time in building the Cox regression model while adjusting for non-IgG covariates at each time. The Cox regression model was built using back ward elimination method. For each IgG, the levels were grouped into percentiles, that is 25th, 50th and 75th . The effects of different levels of the IgG (25th,50th and 75th percentiles) on the incidence of malaria among study participants were assessed. The levels of the IgG at the 75th percentile was found to consistently have higher Hazard ratios and significant confidence intervals. Therefore, the levels of the IgG at the 75th percentile were used in building the Cox regression model. The P-values of the IgG variables in the Cox regression models were adjusted for Multiple testing. The non-IgG covariates included birth weight (&lt;2500 grams, &gt;2500grams), maternal malaria incidence (No malaria detected, and malaria detected), Maternal wealth index (poorest, middle, and least poor), gravidity category (1-3 and 4+). Cofounding was assessed in the Cox regression model and any variable that had the percentage difference of more than 10% between the crude and adjusted Hazard ratios was considered a cofounder. In the model building, the covariates that had p value of ≤ 0.2 in the bivariate analysis were included in the model. </p>
              <p>Reviewer #1,Qn 3:Why wasn’t mother’s economic status included as a covariate in the model?</p>
              <p>Response: Yes, we agree with the reviewer’s suggestion, in the revised manuscript, we have included Mother’s wealth index (Poorest, middle and least poor)</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1, Qn4, Cox regressions adjusting for potential confounders are more informative than Kaplan-Meir survival analysis. The section “Probability of survival to “probability of fewer occurrence of malaria”” seems to be superfluous.</p>
              <p>Response: Yes, we agree with the reviewer’s suggestion and in the revised manuscript, we developed a Cox regression model and adjusted for multiple testing in the IgG covariates and for cofounding in all other variables including the mother’s characteristics. . </p>
              <p>Reviewer #1, Qn5: The section “Effects of Economic status on birth outcomes and risk of malaria incidence”- the only association shown is with birth weight, which is not relevant to the main topic of this paper. If there is no association with malaria incidence or IgG levels, the entire section can go. Please go through the paper carefully and remove any language related to this analysis.</p>
              <p>Response: Guidance well noted; section on “Effects of Economic status on birth outcomes” has been removed as advised in the revised manuscript. We included Mother’s wealth category in the Cox regression model and assessed if it cofounds the estimation of malaria incidence amongst study participants</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: The authors have done an excellent job. I read with great interest the responses to the various comments from reviewers.</p>
              <p>A minor error found in the “laboratory procedures”: 50μl of a secondary antibody specific for an IgG subtype (IgG1, IgG2, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4)...IgG2 is repeated twice.</p>
              <p>Response: Thank you so much for your keen observation; IgG2 was indeed repeated. This has been corrected in the revised manuscript.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: Authors should attempt to further clean up their figures and will need to submit publication-quality for the final version.</p>
              <p>Response: Yes, we agree with the reviewer’s comments, and we have improved the quality of the figures in the revised manuscript.</p>
