                <p id="Par1">While BRAF inhibitor combinations with EGFR and/or MEK inhibitors have improved clinical efficacy in BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> colorectal cancer (CRC), response rates remain low and lack durability. Preclinical data suggest that BRAF/MAPK pathway inhibition may augment the tumor immune response. We performed a proof-of-concept single-arm phase 2 clinical trial of combined PD-1, BRAF and MEK inhibition with sparatlizumab (PDR001), dabrafenib and trametinib in 37 patients with BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> CRC. The primary end point was overall response rate, and the secondary end points were progression-free survival, disease control rate, duration of response and overall survival. The study met its primary end point with a confirmed response rate (24.3% in all patients; 25% in microsatellite stable patients) and durability that were favorable relative to historical controls of BRAF-targeted combinations alone. Single-cell RNA sequencing of 23 paired pretreatment and day 15 on-treatment tumor biopsies revealed greater induction of tumor cell-intrinsic immune programs and more complete MAPK inhibition in patients with better clinical outcome. Immune program induction in matched patient-derived organoids correlated with the degree of MAPK inhibition. These data suggest a potential tumor cell-intrinsic mechanism of cooperativity between MAPK inhibition and immune response, warranting further clinical evaluation of optimized targeted and immune combinations in CRC.

              <p id="Par3">BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> mutations occur in ~10% of colorectal cancer (CRC), driving constitutive activation of MAPK signaling. Patients with BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> CRC have unfavorable prognosis and respond poorly to standard therapies, with a median overall survival (OS) half that of BRAF wild-type CRC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. While BRAF inhibitors (BRAFis), including vemurafenib and dabrafenib, are highly effective in BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> melanoma (~60–80% response rate)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, the response rate of BRAFi monotherapy in BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> CRC is only 0–5%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Previous work by our group and others identified robust adaptive feedback networks in CRC leading to rapid reactivation of MAPK signaling following BRAF inhibition, including EGFR, which acts as the dominant driver in many cases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. These data led to clinical trials of BRAFi-based therapeutic combinations designed to mitigate MAPK feedback reactivation and produce sustained MAPK suppression, yielding increased response rates in BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> CRC. Specifically, combinations of BRAFi and EGFR inhibitor (EGFRi), BRAFi and MEK inhibitor (MEKi), and BRAFi, EGFRi and MEKi have been explored clinically<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Recently, the Food and Drug Administration approved the combination of the BRAFi encorafenib plus the anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab in BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> CRC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. However, confirmed objective response rates (cORRs) to this regimen are only 20% and clinical benefit is not durable, with a median progression-free survival (PFS) of only 4.3 months. Thus, new effective therapies for this disease are critically needed.</p>
              <p id="Par4">Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), particularly agents that block the programmed death (PD)-1 pathway, has revolutionized the treatment of many cancers with the potential for long-term durable responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. CRC has generally responded poorly to ICB, with the exception of the ~4% of metastatic CRC with microsatellite instability (MSI)/mismatch repair deficiency, in which response rates are ~40%, likely due to increased neoantigen load<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Conversely, response rates in metastatic microsatellite stable (MSS) CRC are near 0%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Thus, approaches to increase the immune responsiveness of MSS CRC represent a key unmet clinical need.</p>
              <p id="Par5">Interestingly, ~15–20% of BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> metastatic CRC harbors MSI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, and these patients also showed better and more durable responses to BRAF/MAPK pathway inhibition than patients who are MSS in prior clinical trials of BRAF/MEK/EGFR inhibition, despite receiving targeted BRAF-directed therapy only. Indeed, approximately one third of patients with BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> MSI exhibited durable response and/or disease control lasting &gt;1 year in our previous clinical trial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Conversely, no patients who are MSS remained on study &gt;1 year. Moreover, the lone patient achieving complete response (CR) in our initial study evaluating combined BRAF/MEK inhibition with dabrafenib and trametinib (DT)—which produced a cORR of 7% (12% unconfirmed ORR)—also had MSI and remained in an ongoing durable CR for &gt;5 years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Given that durable responses were restricted to patients with MSI, these data suggest the possibility that BRAF pathway inhibition may enhance immune response in BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> CRC.</p>

Several potential mechanisms of cooperativity have been proposed, including possible immune priming of the tumor microenvironment by a direct effect of BRAFi and/or MEKi on nontumor cells, such as antigen-specific and activated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and expanded memory T cells and T cell clonotypes. The potential for tumor-intrinsic effects by MAPK inhibition contributing to the immune response has also been proposed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. However, a definitive mechanism for this potential cooperativity has not been established.

                <p id="Par8">Our previous clinical trials with BRAF-targeted therapy combinations in BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> CRC suggested potential links between BRAF pathway inhibition and the immune response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, including durable benefit lasting &gt;1 year in roughly one third of patients with BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> CRC also harboring MSI. To investigate this potential cooperativity, we analyzed bulk RNAseq data from 71 patients from our earlier clinical study of combined BRAF/EGFRi ± MEKi in patients with BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> CRC, including 45 paired patient biopsies (pretreatment and day 15 on treatment) and 26 separate biopsies from baseline<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Notably, RNAseq of baseline tumor biopsies revealed significantly higher T cell signatures (indicative of increased T cell levels) in responders versus nonresponders (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). Baseline levels of T cell and cytotoxic T cell signatures also correlated with the best percentage change in target lesion size from baseline (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). Furthermore, across all patients, increases in T cell, cytotoxic T cell and other immune signatures were noted after 15 days of treatment relative to the paired baseline biopsy, suggesting increased T cell and immune infiltration in tumors following BRAF pathway inhibition (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>).

                <p id="Par9">To model this potential cooperativity, we generated a syngeneic BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> CRC mouse tumor model from C57BL/6 colon organoids with knockout of Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), TP53 and SMAD4 and expressing BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> (APC, BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>, TP53, SMAD4 (ABPS) cells). Inhibition of MAPK signaling and sensitivity to combined BRAF/MEK inhibition with DT in ABPS cells were confirmed in vitro (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">1b,c</xref>). To assess immune effects of BRAF/MEK inhibition and the potential cooperativity with ICB, we implanted ABPS tumor cells subcutaneously into immune-competent C57BL/6 mice and treated them with vehicle, DT, anti-PD-1 antibody, or the combination. Interestingly, while BRAF/MEKi or anti-PD-1 antibody alone had minimal effect on tumor volume compared with vehicle, combined BRAF/MEK/PD-1 inhibition produced a more substantial and sustained reduction in tumor growth (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref> and Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). Moreover, in tumors harvested after 10 days of treatment, we detected a significant increase in the percentage of CD3<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in tumors treated with BRAF/MEKi compared with vehicle control (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d,e</xref>), suggesting that BRAF pathway inhibition alone can lead to increased T cell infiltration, similar to our observations in patient biopsies (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>).

Patients with BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> CRC were treated with the BRAFi dabrafenib, the MEKi trametinib, and the anti-PD-1 antibody spartalizumab (PDR001).

Five patients had previous therapy with either BRAFis and/or immune checkpoint inhibitors (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Median age was 63 (range 35–87), 20 (54.1%) were women (Extended Data Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), and median follow-up was 995 days (range 245–1,324). Overall, the regimen was well tolerated, with rash, fever and diarrhea as the most common adverse events (AEs) (Extended Data Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The primary end point was ORR, and secondary end points were PFS, disease control rate (DCR), duration of response and OS. Among all 37 patients, 9 achieved a confirmed response (cORR of 24.3%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 11.9–41.2%), with 1 additional patient achieving an unconfirmed response, and the DCR was 70.3% (95% CI 53–84.1%) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref> and Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>), which compares favorably with the historical 7% cORR (95% CI 1.5–19.1%) of dabrafenib plus trametinib alone in BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> CRC.

DEGs in patients with PFS &gt; 6 months that mapped to antigen processing and presentation, response to IFN-γ, response to type I IFN, and chemokine activity programs were used to create a score of epithelial interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">4</xref>).

Accordingly, we evaluated the effects of BRAF/MAPK pathway inhibition alone in patients with BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> CRC treated on previous studies with BRAF targeted therapy only. We analyzed RNAseq data from 45 paired pretreatment and on-treatment (day 15) biopsies from patients with BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> CRC from a previous clinical trial of BRAF/MEK/EGFR inhibition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.

                <p id="Par18">To evaluate the potential relationship between MAPK inhibition and immune program induction specifically within tumor cells, we utilized patient-derived organoid models successfully generated from baseline tumor biopsies from 10 patients, including 5 with PFS &gt; 6 months and 5 with PFS &lt; 6 months. Organoids were treated with DT and gene expression was measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Organoids derived from patients with PFS &gt; 6 months showed greater increases in the expression of genes involved in IFN response (<italic>IFIT1</italic>, <italic>IFIT2</italic>, <italic>IFIT3</italic> and <italic>IRF1</italic>) and chemokine activity (<italic>CXCL9</italic>, <italic>CXCL10</italic> and <italic>CXCL11</italic>) compared with organoids derived from patients with PFS &lt; 6 months (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>, left). Importantly, organoids from patients with PFS &lt; 6 months also showed a lesser degree of MAPK pathway inhibition (calculated by the average <italic>DUSP6</italic>, <italic>ETV4</italic>, <italic>ETV5</italic> and <italic>SPRY4</italic> log<sub>2</sub>FC) after treatment with DT (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>, left). The degree of ISG induction was significantly correlated with the degree of MAPK inhibition (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">7a</xref>), suggesting that insufficient MAPK pathway inhibition could potentially explain the differences in ISG upregulation. Notably, the varying degree of ISG induction and MAPK inhibition by DT in both groups of organoids (PFS &gt; 6 months or PFS &lt; 6 months) mirrored the differences observed from scRNAseq analysis of the tumor epithelial compartments in patients from the same groups. Similarly, global transcriptomic profiling of organoids treated with DT by RNAseq showed significant induction of more immune gene sets in organoids derived from patients with PFS &gt; 6 months compared with organoids from patients with PFS &lt; 6 months (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). Likewise, treatment of organoid models with dabrafenib and the anti-EGFR antibody panitumumab also led to a similar induction of ISGs (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">7b</xref>). Importantly, these data confirm that MAPK pathway inhibition can drive induction of immune gene expression in a tumor cell-intrinsic manner that does not depend on stimuli from the tumor immune microenvironment since organoid cultures contain tumor cells only and do not contain immune or stromal cells from the tumor microenvironment. These data also provide further correlative evidence that the degree of MAPK suppression may be directly related to the degree of immune gene induction.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><title>Enhanced tumor cell-intrinsic immune program induction is driven by optimized MAPK inhibition.</title><p><bold>a</bold>, The log<sub>2</sub>FC of gene expression (measured by qPCR) of indicated ISGs and the average of log<sub>2</sub>FC of MAPK-regulated transcripts in patient-derived organoids treated with DT or DE for 72 h.

                <p id="Par19">To test whether more optimal and complete inhibition of the BRAF/MAPK pathway might enhance the degree of immune gene induction across all tumor models, including those from patients with PFS &lt; 6 months, we utilized a combination of BRAFi and ERKi. Our earlier work showed that ERK inhibitors are able to achieve more complete MAPK pathway inhibition in combination with BRAFis compared with MEK inhibitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Thus, we treated the same collection of organoids with dabrafenib and the ERK inhibitor ERAS007 (DE). The concentrations of DT and DE chosen were based on inhibitory concentration (IC)90 values demonstrating equivalent efficacy to ensure an appropriate comparison (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">7c,d</xref>). Interestingly, when treated with DE, all organoids showed robust MAPK inhibition, regardless of the clinical outcome of the patient from whom the organoid was derived (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>, right). BRAF/ERK inhibition also strikingly induced the expression of immune response genes to a comparable extent in all organoids (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>, right), suggesting that higher ISG induction could be achieved by more complete MAPK inhibition, especially in organoids with lesser response to BRAF/MEKi. Notably, even with a higher concentration of DT, we still did not observe stronger induction of immune programs in organoids, including in representative models from PFS &lt; 6 months (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">7e</xref>). Additionally, BRAF/ERK inhibitor (ERKi) treatment universally induced strong enrichment of immune-related Gene Onotology (GO) terms in organoids derived from patients with PFS &gt; 6 months and PFS &lt; 6 months (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>), in contrast to observations with BRAF/MEKi.</p>
                <p id="Par20">Overall, BRAF/ERKi induced a significantly greater degree of ISGs upregulation and MAPK inhibition than BRAF/MEKi in all organoids, as reflected by a greater ISG score and MAPK score change with treatment versus control (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>). Furthermore, whereas BRAF/MEKi led to a significantly greater ISG score increase in organoids derived from patients with PFS &gt; 6 months versus patients with PFS &lt; 6 months, BRAF/ERKi led to a comparable degree of ISG score induction in both groups of organoids that was not significantly different. Notably, the levels of ISG score induction in both groups following BRAF/ERKi were equal to or greater than the degree of induction seen with BRAF/MEKi in patients with PFS &gt; 6 months (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>). ISG score delta was strongly and significantly anticorrelated with MAPK score delta (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref>). Together, these data demonstrate that (1) effective MAPK inhibition alone can induce tumor cell-intrinsic immune gene expression and that (2) improving the degree of MAPK inhibition achieved can increase the degree of tumor-intrinsic immune gene expression in all tumor models to the same levels observed in patients with PFS &gt; 6 months with BRAF/MEKi.</p>
                <p id="Par21">Overall, these data provide evidence for a tumor cell-intrinsic role of BRAF/MAPK pathway inhibition in promoting tumor immune response. Given the relationship between the degree of MAPK inhibition and induction of immune program gene expression in tumor cells, these findings also raise the possibility that improved MAPK inhibition through a more optimal BRAF-targeted combination could drive greater immune cooperativity and greater clinical efficacy in combination with ICB.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par22">We present preclinical, clinical and translational evidence of cooperativity between BRAF/MAPK pathway inhibition and the immune response in BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> CRC. Importantly, even in patients with MSS BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> CRC, in whom a negligible response rate to ICB is expected, the combination of PD-1, BRAF and MEK inhibition yielded more than a threefold increase in cORR (25%, 95% CI 10.7–44.9%) relative to historical controls of combined BRAF/MEK alone (7%, 95% CI 1.5–19.1%) in patients without prior BRAFi. This also compares favorably with the 20% cORR of encorafenib plus cetuximab, the current Food and Drug Administration-approved standard for BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> CRC. We also observed evidence of increased durability with a median PFS of 5 months (versus 3.5 months with BRAF/MEK alone), with 57% of patients remaining on treatment for &gt;6 months and 18% for &gt;1 year.</p>
              <p id="Par23">The primary focus of the study was efficacy in the MSS BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> CRC population since these patients have a near-zero response to ICB and thus, the greatest clinical need. However, eight slots were reserved for patients with MSI BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> in an effort to assess whether combined BRAF pathway targeting might enhance the basal responsiveness of MSI tumors to ICB. While durable responses were observed in two of five patients with MSI enrolled, this 40% ORR does not suggest clear evidence of enhanced clinical benefit, and enrollment to remaining MSI slots is ongoing.</p>
              <p id="Par24">In what we believe is one of the first clinical trials to incorporate systematic scRNAseq analysis of paired pre- and on-treatment tumor biopsies from all patients, we identified a potential mechanism underlying the cooperativity observed between BRAF/MAPK inhibition and immune response. We find evidence of tumor cell-intrinsic induction of key immune programs (types I and II IFN response, antigen presenting genes and T cell recruiting chemokines) triggered by MAPK pathway inhibition. These gene expression changes are similar to a gene expression program recently discovered in malignant cells from immunologically active MSI CRC and associated with activated and chronically stimulated T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Interestingly, induction of T cell recruiting chemokines, such as CXCL9/10/11 and certain ISGs, has also been observed in preclinical CRC mouse models following KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> inhibition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, suggesting that this tumor cell-intrinsic transcriptional response may be a key mechanism more broadly linked to inhibition of the RAS–MAPK pathway. Our scRNAseq data revealed that upregulation of immune programs in tumor cells was significantly greater in patients with prolonged PFS, suggesting that this effect may be a critical mechanism mediating therapeutic benefit.</p>
              <p id="Par25">By performing parallel studies with matched patient-derived organoids generated from the same patients, we confirmed that induction of immune genes by BRAF/MAPK inhibition is tumor cell intrinsic and does not depend on cells in the tumor microenvironment. Indeed, induction of these immune programs was observed even in organoid cultures, which consist of pure tumor cell populations. These data provide important mechanistic insight, as the potential cooperativity of MAPK pathway inhibition and the immune response has previously been hypothesized to involve a direct effect of MAPK inhibition on cells in the tumor microenvironment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. One potential limitation of the current study is that it focused on the tumor cell compartment. It is still possible that MAPK inhibition within the tumor microenvironment may affect the tumor immune response, and a detailed assessment of changes in the abundance and gene expression profiles of other cell types will be undertaken through analysis of our scRNAseq data, coupled with parallel methods, in a future study. However, our data provide evidence for a robust tumor cell-intrinsic mechanism and support that BRAF/MAPK pathway activation promotes immune suppressive signals within tumor cells that can be reversed with targeted pathway inhibition. More detailed mechanistic experiments in future studies may further delineate the importance and relative contribution of this tumor cell-intrinsic mechanism to the tumor immune response.</p>
              <p id="Par26">Notably, organoids derived from patients with PFS &gt; 6 months also retained the pattern of increased induction of immune programs upon BRAF/MEK treatment relative to organoids from patients with PFS &lt; 6 months, as observed in our scRNAseq dataset. This observation allowed us to use these matched organoids as representative models to probe the mechanisms underlying tumor cell-intrinsic immune program induction. Interestingly, our scRNAseq data suggested that patients with PFS &lt; 6 months failed to achieve robust MAPK inhibition in tumor cells with DT compared with patients with PFS &gt; 6 months. This same pattern was observed in matched patient-derived organoid models, allowing us to test the hypothesis that failure to induce immune programs was a direct consequence of inadequate BRAF/MAPK inhibition and that more optimal MAPK inhibition may lead to improved induction of key immune genes, even in tumor cells from patients who did not benefit from therapy. As noted above, a limitation of the study was the use of a BRAF/MEK inhibitor combination for this proof-of-concept study, which was based on the availability of established dosing and safety data for this regimen from patients with melanoma at the time that this study was initiated; this preceded the results of the BEACON study that demonstrated the efficacy of encorafenib and cetuximab in this population. Notably, the BEACON study also showed that while the addition of an MEK inhibitor increased the overall response rate relative to the BRAF/EGFR doublet (27% versus 20%), it did not improve survival. Thus, BRAF/MEK is likely not the optimal BRAF-targeting core in this population, and these data suggest that more effective BRAF-targeting combinations could further augment the cooperativity with ICB. Remarkably, using a combination of BRAF and ERK inhibitors that led to more robust BRAF/MAPK inhibition across all organoids, we found that immune program induction could be achieved in all models, regardless of PFS. This finding has important and immediate clinical implications, suggesting that combining ICB with a more effective BRAF/MAPK-targeting core, such as BRAF/EGFR or BRAF/ERK, may further enhance the immune cooperativity and clinical benefit observed and that such strategies warrant further exploration in future clinical trials. This potential for enhanced clinical activity from targeting the BRAF pathway in combination with ICB is further supported by early data from an ongoing clinical trial adding the anti-PD-1 antibody nivolumab to the current standard of care of encorafenib plus cetuximab, yielding a 50% ORR in the first 21 patients compared with an expected 20% ORR for encorafenib plus cetuximab alone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par27">Finally, it will be important to determine whether this potential mechanism of immune cooperativity is limited to BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> CRC or whether it would apply to other tumor types and to other agents targeting the MAPK pathway. For example, combinations of ICB (PD-1 or programmed death-ligand (PD-L)1) with BRAFi/MEKi in BRAF<sup>V600</sup> melanoma have also suggested improved benefit, although each component of this combination exhibits greater activity alone in melanoma than in CRC. Notably, a large phase III study of the MEK inhibitor cobimetinib and the anti-PD-L1 antibody atezolizumab in CRC failed to achieve its primary end point, which has cast doubt on whether MAPK pathway inhibition in general has the potential to enhance the immune response. However, this trial was performed in all CRC genotypes (including CRC without MAPK-activating mutations), and data suggest that MEK inhibitors alone fail to maintain MAPK inhibition in CRC due to adaptive feedback<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Preclinical data support that induction of similar immune gene programs as observed in our study can be found in mouse models of KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> CRC with KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> inhibitor treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Therefore, it is possible that the mechanism of immune cooperativity we propose in our study may be more broadly applicable to other effective RAS/BRAF/MAPK pathway inhibitors, and further studies to evaluate this possibility will be important.</p>

Antitumor efficacy was assessed by CT or MRI at baseline and then, every 8 weeks until progression or death. Response determination was based on RECIST v.1.1 by the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center Tumor Metrics Core. For the subset of patients who showed a confirmed CR or PR, duration of response was defined as the time in weeks from the first documented evidence of CR or PR (the first response prior to confirmation) until the time of documented disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever was first. PFS was defined as the time in weeks between the first dose and the date of disease progression or death due to any cause. Finally, OS was defined as the time in weeks from the first dose of study drug until death due to any cause. PFS and time on treatment were summarized with Kaplan–Meier methodology using medians and 95% CIs (estimated using the Brookmeyer–Crowley method). Time on treatment was defined as the time until final treatment discontinuation. Fresh tumor biopsies were collected before dose (day 1) for scRNAseq analysis and patient-derived organoids generation as well as after dose (day 15) for scRNAseq analysis. The same tumor lesion was biopsied at baseline and at day 15. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) and flash-frozen tumor samples were collected at day 1 for genomic and molecular analyses.</p>

A strand-specific transcriptome library was constructed and sequenced at BGI Genomics using the DNBSEQ platform. Paired-end 100-base pair RNAseq, 20 million reads per sample, were mapped to the reference genome (GCF_000001405.38_GRCh38.p12) using HISAT. Bowtie2 was used to align the clean reads to the reference genes. GO enrichment analysis was performed using the GO enrichment analysis web-based platform (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://geneontology.org/docs/go-enrichment-analysis/">http://geneontology.org/docs/go-enrichment-analysis/</ext-link>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Genes with significant differential expression (log<sub>2</sub>(fold change) (FC) &gt; 1; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) were used for the enrichment test. The gene signature score was calculated as the mean of the log<sub>2</sub> normalized expression of all genes in each gene signature. The same genes in the epithelial ISG program and the MAPK signature from scRNAseq analysis were used to calculate the ISG score and MAPK score here. Gene signature score delta was calculated as the score in treated samples subtracted by the score in untreated samples.</p>

                <p id="Par44">Core needle biopsies were obtained from interventional radiology at Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women’s Hospital and transported in ice-cold hypothermosol before processing. Per patient and time point, the first two to three cores from the operative procedure were allocated for scRNAseq and cut into small pieces with scissors in a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube containing 1 ml of enzymatic digestion mix (Miltenyi; Human Tumor Dissociation kit). The Eppendorf tubes were then transferred to a rotation shaker set to 37 °C and 550 r.p.m. and shaken for 15 min. The digestion mix was subsequently filtered through a 50-μm Celltrics strainer sitting on a 15-ml falcon tube on ice and mechanically dissociated once more with the plunger of a 1-ml syringe against the screen. The filter and enzymatic mixture were washed with RPMI containing 0.5% bovine serum. The cell suspension was spun at 1,500 r.p.m. (524<italic>g</italic>) for 4 min at 4 °C in a precooled centrifuge to pellet the cells. The pellet was lysed in 300 μl ammonium–chloride–potassium buffer for 2 min on ice, transferred into an 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube and then stopped with 1.1 ml RPMI containing 0.5% bovine serum. The cell suspension was then centrifuged at 1,500 r.p.m. (524<italic>g</italic>) for 4 min at 4 °C.

Cells were counted and loaded as 8,000 cells per channel using the 10× Genomics Single Cell 5’ Reagent Kit v.2. If cell counts permitted, up to three channels were loaded per patient and time point; 10× libraries were constructed according to the manufacturer’s instructions and sequenced at the Broad Institute Genomics Platform.</p>
