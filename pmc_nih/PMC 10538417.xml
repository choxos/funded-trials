                  <title>Objectives:</title>
                  <p>Chemokine receptor CCR5 is the principal co-receptor for entry of M-tropic HIV virus into immune cells. It is expressed in the central nervous system and may contribute to neuro-inflammation. The CCR5 antagonist maraviroc (MVC) has been suggested to improve HIV-associated neurocognitive impairment (NCI).</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Design:</title>
                  <p>A double-blind, placebo-controlled, 48-week, randomized study of MVC vs. placebo in people with HIV (PWH) on stable antiretroviral therapy (ART) for more than one year in Hawaii and Puerto Rico with plasma HIV RNA less than 50 copies/ml and at least mild NCI defined as an overall or domain-specific neuropsychological <italic toggle="yes">z</italic> (NPZ) score less than −0.5.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec sec-type="methods">
                  <title>Methods:</title>
                  <p>Study participants were randomized 2 : 1 to intensification of ART with MVC vs. placebo. The primary endpoint was change in global and domain-specific NPZ modeled from study entry to week 48. Covariate adjusted treatment comparisons of average changes in cognitive outcome were performed using winsorized NPZ data. Monocyte subset frequencies and chemokine expression as well as plasma biomarker levels were assessed.</p>

                <sec sec-type="results">
                  <title>Results:</title>
                  <p>Forty-nine participants were enrolled with 32 individuals randomized to MVC intensification and 17 to placebo. At baseline, worse NPZ scores were seen in the MVC arm. Comparison of 48-week NPZ change by arm revealed no differences except for a modest improvement in the Learning and Memory domain in the MVC arm, which did not survive multiplicity correction. No significant changes between arms were seen in immunologic parameters.</p>

                  <title>Conclusion:</title>
                  <p>This randomized controlled study found no definitive evidence in favor of MVC intensification among PWH with mild cognitive difficulties.</p>

              <p>HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND), albeit in milder form, continue to be a significant public health issue in HIV-infected individuals. The C-C motif chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) is the principal co-receptor for entry of M-tropic HIV virus into immune cells. CCR5 is expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) and may contribute to neuro-inflammation [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Therefore, use of the CCR5 antagonist maraviroc (MVC) may improve HIV-associated neurocognitive disease. We have previously reported in a single-arm study that 24 weeks of MVC added to existing antiretroviral therapy (ART) in virally suppressed individuals with mild-to-moderate cognitive impairment led to significant improvement in neuropsychological performance compared with baseline performance on entry [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The primary objective of this follow-up study was to confirm the impact of MVC intensification on neuropsychological performance in a placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial over a longer 48-week period, hypothesizing that we could demonstrate the beneficial effect of MVC intensification on neuropsychological performance. As secondary objectives, the study also assessed changes in monocyte surface receptor characteristics and in inflammatory soluble plasma biomarkers.</p>

                <title>Clinical study design and neuropsychological assessment</title>
                <p>This clinical trial was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 48-week, randomized study of MVC vs. placebo in individuals chronically infected with HIV who were receiving ART and had mild neurocognitive impairment (ClinicalTrials.gov # NCT02159027). The primary endpoint of the study was change in global and domain-specific performance on neuropsychological tests using demographically adjusted neuropsychological <italic toggle="yes">z</italic> (NPZ) scores from study entry to week 48. The study was conducted at the University of Hawaii and at the University of Puerto Rico following Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval at each site.</p>
                <p>Entry inclusion criteria required participants to be 18–70 years of age, have documented HIV-1 infection by any US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved test at any time prior to study entry, to be on suppressive ART with screening plasma HIV RNA less than 50 copies/ml within 3 months of entry, and to have evidence of at least mild impairment on neuropsychological testing.</p>
                <p>Study entry exclusions included the following: currently receiving or history of CCR5 antagonist use as part of an ART regimen within 6 months of study entry; documented plasma HIV RNA greater than 100 copies/ml within 6 months of study entry; history of HIV-2 infection; diagnosis of liver cirrhosis because of any cause; active untreated hepatitis C; active or inadequately treated tuberculosis (TB) infection; uncontrolled seizure disorder; current malignancy or history of past malignancies excluding basal cell carcinoma and Kaposi's sarcoma restricted to the skin; any immunomodulator, HIV vaccine, any other vaccine, or investigational therapy within 30 days of study entry; other chronic illnesses except for stable controlled diabetes or cardiovascular disease; known hypersensitivity to MVC or its excipients; anticipated need for prescription medications known to be contraindicated in combination with MVC; unwillingness to refrain from eating grapefruit or using St. John's Wort; and the following laboratory parameters at screening – hemoglobin less than 9.0 g/dl, absolute neutrophil count less than 500/μl, platelet count less than 40 000/μl, AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) greater than 5× upper limit of normal (ULN), lipase greater than 2.0× ULN, estimated creatinine clearance 30 ml/min or less, serum B12 or folate less than lower limit of normal (LLN), abnormal TSH except when free T4 was within normal limits (WNL), positive rapid plasma reagin (RPR), and abnormal EKG unless determined by the investigator to not be clinically significant. Exclusion criteria also included the presence of any medical condition that in the opinion of the investigator would constitute a relative contraindication to study entry; current illicit substance or alcohol use which, in the judgment of the investigator, would interfere with the patient's ability to comply with protocol requirements (recreational use was allowed); pregnancy or breast-feeding; intent to become pregnant during the course of the study; any CNS pathology which, in the judgment of the investigator, will interfere with the ability to assess study changes including learning disability, history of head injury with prolonged loss of consciousness or cognitive sequelae, history of opportunistic infection of the brain or other non-HIV causes that, in the judgment of the investigator, could explain the participant's cognitive difficulties on testing.</p>
                <p>Cognitive impairment was determined based on neuropsychological testing assessed at preentry, and defined as a Global NPZ score of less than −0.5 or <italic toggle="yes">z</italic> score less than −0.5 in at least one cognitive domain known to be typically affected by HIV (Executive Function, Psychomotor Speed and Attention, Learning and Memory). The neuropsychological battery was identical between the two sites, except for site-specific modifications necessary based on cultural relevance and availability of local norms (Table <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Neuropsychological testing was performed by trained psychometrists at each site. Finally, the Beck Depression Inventory-II [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] was administered together with the neuropsychological testing at preentry, week 24, and week 48 in order to characterize mood among the study participants.</p>

                <p>Following informed consent and confirmation of eligibility, study participants were randomized 2 : 1 to receive either their own current ART regimen plus MVC (Selzentry), or their own current ART regimen plus placebo. Target enrollment called for 28 participants on ART plus MVC and 14 participants on ART plus placebo. To achieve balance across treatment arms, a computer-generated, permuted-block randomization was used with a 2 : 1 active : placebo allocation and a block size of six. After consent and participant eligibility was confirmed, randomization was performed by the site pharmacist using a prespecified printed allocation table containing treatment assignments and subject identification numbers. Randomization was decentralized, and separate allocation tables were generated for each site. MVC dosages were adjusted per manufacturer (ViiV)'s recommendations based on each participant's concomitant medications and ranged from 150 mg twice daily to 600 mg twice daily.</p>

Data was acquired on a Luminex 200<sup>TM</sup> analyzer (Luminex, Austin, Texas, USA) and analyzed using MILLIPLEX Analyst software (Millipore, Burlington, Massachusetts, USA). Neopterin was measured via ELISA (Neopterin competitive enzyme immunoassay, ALPCO, Salem, New Hampshire, USA).

                <title>Statistical analyses</title>
                <p>Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS (IBM, Version 25; IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, USA) and R (Version 4.0.4; R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) with significance level defined as <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> value 0.05 or less (two sided) and <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> value of 0.06–0.10 considered possible trends. Demographic, clinical, and immunologic data were summarized by median (interquartile range) values for continuous variables and frequency (percentage) for categorical variables. Wilcoxon rank sum test and Fisher's exact test were used for group comparisons of demographic continuous and categorical variables, respectively.</p>
                <p>Substantial variability and swings in NPZ test scores were encountered, with concerns that such swings were related to participant-dependent factors unrelated to the impact of study medications. Therefore, the top and bottom 5% for scores with outliers greater than +/−3.5 were winsorized to minimize the effect of outliers. Although analyses were also performed on the nonwinsorized data set, the final analyses were performed on winsorized data.</p>
                <p>Primary baseline comparison of winsorized NPZ scores in the MVC treatment and placebo arms was performed using the two-sample <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-test. Analyses of treatment comparison on changes in baseline to 48 weeks between MVC and placebo groups on the NPZ scores were performed using the Tsiatis <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] method, which accounts for possible covariate imbalance for the comparison of treatments in randomized clinical trials. In this study, baseline NPZ scores were observed to be unbalanced between the two groups with more cognitive impairment seen in the MVC compared with the placebo arm, which may have introduced a bias when comparing mean treatment outcomes directly using conventional concepts. The Tsiatis <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> method allows one to estimate the effect of treatment relative to control averaging across the patient population, which requires a specification of regression structure that relates response and baseline covariates under each arm. Least squares linear models were estimated for NPZ responses and baseline covariates (study site and baseline NPZ score values) and the estimated models were applied together with subsequent treatment effect estimation and inference steps for the treatment comparison as suggested by Tsiatis <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic></p>
                <p>Due to the missingness of endpoints in some cases, the primary outcome analyses were conducted using both intent-to-treat analysis and per-protocol analysis approach. The intent-to-treat approach was applied using multiple imputation techniques with 10 imputations [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The pool parameter estimation step was done using Rubin's rule for multiple imputations [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The per-protocol analyses were done by limiting the data analysis only to complete cases. Bonferroni correction was applied to calculated <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> values to avoid type-1 error inflation because of the multiplicity of tests corresponding to the primary outcome analysis (indicated by ‘Adjusted <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> value’).</p>

                <p>As shown in the Study Flow Diagram (Fig. <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), a total of 49 participants were enrolled and randomized, 27 participants in Hawaii and 22 participants in Puerto Rico. Thirty-two participants were randomized to MVC and 17 participants to placebo. Ten participants were either lost to follow-up or prematurely discontinued. The high rate of lost-to-follow-up and discontinuation was partially because of the substantial property and economic devastation caused by Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico in September 2017. A total of 39 evaluable participants (Hawaii 24; Puerto Rico 15) completed the final week 48 visit. Of the participants with neuropsychological data and blood specimens available from baseline and week 48, 25 participants were in the MVC arm and 14 participants were in the placebo arm.</p>

The MVC and placebo arms were well balanced for age, sex. ethnicity, education, and HIV-associated clinical parameters, with participants consisting primarily of individuals with a prolonged history of HIV and ART. However, substantial differences in baseline NPZ scores by arm were seen as shown in Table <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">3</xref>. Specifically, compared with the placebo arm, participants in the MVC arm exhibited lower (worse) performances on tests in the Motor and Psychomotor domains with a trend towards more impairment in the Learning and Memory and Visuospatial domains at baseline. This resulted in a significant difference in Global NPZ at baseline favoring more overall impairment in the MVC arm.</p>

                  <p>Study medications were well tolerated over the 48-week study duration. Four serious adverse events (SAE) were noted, one in the MVC arm (autonomic neuropathy) and three in the placebo arm (sub-arachnoid hemorrhage, cerebral infarct, and excessive skin reaction to topical medication for actinic keratosis). None were viewed to be related to study medications. For nonserious adverse events, six grade 2 events were reported, two in the MVC arm and four in the placebo arm, with the most commonly reported events being anxiety, depression, and bronchial asthma. No grade 3 or 4 adverse events other than those related to the SAE as mentioned above were recorded.</p>

Little change in Global NPZ scores over 48 weeks was seen in either arm and there was no difference in Global NPZ change between the two arms. When domain-specific NPZ changes were assessed, a statistically significant improvement in Learning and Memory was seen in the MVC arm compared with the placebo arm; however, this did not survive the adjustment for multiple comparisons. A significant difference in NPZ change was also seen between the two arms in the Visuospatial domain; however, it was noted that the change was primarily due to an improvement in the placebo arm. These comparisons between the two arms of 48-week NPZ change were analyzed in multiple ways including intent-to-treat and analyses using nonwinsorized data, and using two-sample <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-tests. All analyses gave similar results.</p>

                <title>Changes in monocyte phenotypes and plasma biomarker levels on study</title>
                <p>Monocyte immunophenotyping was performed on a subset of 15 study participants on fresh specimens immediately available from participants enrolled at the Hawaii site, while biomarker analyses was conducted on all banked plasma specimens in combined study participants from the Hawaii and Puerto Rico sites. Total and subset monocyte frequencies (%) were similar between the MRV and placebo arm at baseline (Supplemental Table 1). At week 24, participants in the MRV arm had similar percent of total monocytes but with significantly lower percent of classical monocytes and increased percent of intermediate and nonclassical monocytes compared with the placebo arm. At week 48, however, there were no differences between the control and MRV arm in percent total monocytes or in frequencies of any monocyte subsets. No differences between the MRV and placebo groups were seen in GM fluorescence of CCR2, CCR5, CX3CR1, or SLAN at baseline, week 24, or week 48 or in median change from baseline to week 48.</p>
                <p>No significant differences between arms were noted in CD14, TNFα, IL-6, CCL2, CD163 and neopterin plasma biomarkers at baseline, week 24, or week 48 (Supplemental Table 2). No differences were noted in median change from baseline to week 48 except for a significant <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> value (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.004) in change over 48 weeks for neopterin favoring the placebo arm over the MVC arm. When adjusted, however, for baseline values and for site, the <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> value became nonsignificant (MRV vs. placebo, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.137).</p>

                <title>Correlations at baseline between neuropsychological <italic toggle="yes">z</italic> scores and immunologic parameters</title>
                <p>Because associations between cognitive and immunologic functions may provide clues to the pathophysiologic mechanisms involved in HAND, correlations at baseline between NPZ scores and immunologic parameters were analyzed and are included as Supplemental Table 3. No correlations were seen between any NPZ scores and any monocyte frequency levels. However, some interesting correlations were seen between NPZ scores and cell surface expression of various receptors on monocytes. Most pertinent to this clinical trial, which utilizes a CCR5 antagonist, significant positive correlations were seen between executive NPZ scores at baseline and CCR5 GM levels in total monocytes as well as in all three monocyte subsets (rho 0.54–0.74; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.002–0.04) A positive correlation was also noted between Psychomotor NPZ (rho 0.625, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.015) as well as with Global NPZ (rho 0.61, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.02) and CD195 GM level on classical monocytes. Some correlations were also seen between other NPZ domain values and CCR2, CX3CR, and SLAN levels. No significant correlations were seen between baseline NPZ scores and any plasma biomarkers.</p>

              <p>This randomized placebo-controlled study found no definitive evidence in favor of MVC intensification for mild HIV-associated neurocognitive impairment. A statistically significant improvement was seen in the Learning and Memory NPZ domain; however, the result did not survive adjustment for multiple comparisons. As monocytes and macrophages play key roles in the pathogenesis of HAND, we assessed for potential changes on study in levels of various surface receptors on monocytes including CCR5 and in plasma biomarkers. Although some interesting correlations were seen at baseline between the NPZ Executive Domain and CCR5 cell surface expression on monocytes, no changes in CCR5 expression or any other monocyte receptor expression or in plasma biomarker levels were seen over the 48 weeks of study.</p>
              <p>HIV-associated cognitive dysfunction is one of the most prevalent comorbidities in the era of ART with a prevalence of about 40% in PWH [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Over the past decade, numerous studies indicate that the prevalence of HAND, most of which is mild in nature, remains stable in individuals with HIV maintained on suppressive ART [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Whereas difficulties on tests of gross motor and psychomotor speed were the most common manifestations of HAND before potent combination ART, deficits in learning and/or memory and executive function have become increasingly more common [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. HAND remains an important issue for PWH as it affects not only survival and quality of life but also everyday functioning [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p>
              <p>Compelling evidence suggests that inflammation mediated by HIV has an important role in neurocognitive difficulties, although other risk factors such as atherosclerosis, substance abuse, traumatic brain injury, and psychiatric disorders also play important roles [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Particular interest has focused on activated circulating monocytes in this inflammatory process, as these cells can introduce HIV into the brain, infect microglia and astrocytes, and play a critical role in immune activation and pro-inflammatory processes in the CNS [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p>
              <p>CCR5 is expressed on a variety of immune cells including T cells and macrophages, and is highly expressed in microglia and to a lesser extent in astrocytes and neurons [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. It is a coreceptor used by HIV for entry into the host cell following binding of the viral envelope glycoprotein gp120 to the CD4 receptor. MVC is a noncompetitive CCR5 antagonist with relatively high CNS penetration approved for use with other antiretroviral medications for the treatment of CCR5-tropic HIV. MVC has a good safety record in treatment-experienced patients [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. It has been hypothesized that MVC could block infection of new target cells within the CNS, dampen immune activation of resident CNS effector cells and decrease recruitment of leukocytes into the CNS, thus leading to improvement in HIV-associated neurocognitive impairment [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Supportive data on the potential beneficial effects of MVC on HAND include data that genetic ablation of CCR5 prevents microglial activation and neuronal damage in a transgenic model of HIV-associated brain injury [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and that MVC monotherapy in SIV-infected macaques reduced viral replication in the CNS and lowered monocyte and macrophage activation [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p>
              <p>Based on these favorable animal studies, a handful of small clinical trials have examined the ability of MVC to improve HIV immunovirologic parameters and/or cognition in PWH [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>–<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Among these studies, two trials specifically examined MVC intensification in ART-suppressed HIV-infected individuals with cognitive impairment. One was our preliminary single-arm open-label trial in 15 ART-suppressed individuals in which MVC intensification over 24 weeks showed favorable changes in monocyte activation and HIV DNA burden [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Furthermore, among the six individuals with mild cognitive impairment with global NPZ score of −1.0, MVC intensification was associated with improvement in Global, Learning and Memory, and Executive function NPZ scores. The second study was a 12-month open-label trial in 17 ART-suppressed individuals with cognitive impairment of at least 1 SD below the mean in at least two cognitive domains who were randomized to remain on their existing ART regimen or to receive MVC intensification [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. This study showed improvement in global neurocognitive performance with MVC intensification with median-to-large effect sizes, despite no improvement on single voxel magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Additionally, a third more recently conducted InMIND Trial (ACTG A5324) assessed the impact of MVC in combination with dolutegravir (DTG) in a placebo-controlled study in virologically suppressed individuals with cognitive impairment. This study concluded that ART intensification using both DTG+MVC as medications with good CNS penetration did not alter neuropshycological performance in PWH with cognitive impairment [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p>
              <p>Our study found no significant change in overall cognitive performance over 48 weeks of MVC intensification. Change in domain-specific NPZ scores showed a potential significant improvement in Learning and Memory but this did not survive adjustment for multiple comparisons. It may be worth noting that the Learning and Memory domain was one of the domains in our original single-arm study that demonstrated improvement over 24 weeks [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p>
              <p>Our ability to demonstrate that the addition of MVC improves cognition may have been limited by the relatively mild disease in our study participants. The widespread use of potent ART has been associated with increasingly milder cognitive impairment in PWH [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], and we encountered difficulty in finding individuals with substantial cognitive impairment. Additionally, we attempted to eliminate individuals with inactive/legacy effect, allowing entry only to those with evidence of more recent history of worsening in mental function possibly attributable to HIV and otherwise unexplained’. Furthermore, there is evidence that the risk of cognitive impairment in the current era may be less related to the direct effects of HIV-mediated viral persistence or inflammation but rather to the indirect effects stemming from comorbidities such as cardiometabolic disease commonly found in PWH [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. To add complexity to this issue, such comorbidities may also be the consequence of chronic viral persistence and inflammation. Perhaps future research in HAND should try to address the role that these comorbidities play in HIV-associated cognitive impairment in the current era.</p>
              <p>In a limited number of our participants, we assessed various monocyte receptor frequencies and plasma biomarkers at baseline and serially at weeks 24 and 48. As MVC selectively binds to CCR5 to block the entry of HIV into human cells, we noted with some interest that there appeared to be a positive correlation at baseline between the Executive domain NPZ values and the CCR5 GM levels. The significance of this association is, however, not clear, and the use of MVC did not result in changes in CCR5 or any other monocyte receptor GM fluorescence. Pro-inflammatory biomarkers including neopterin, sCD163, CD14, TNFα, IL6, and CCL2 have been shown in other studies to correlate with the severity of cognitive decline [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>–<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Our study found no convincing evidence that MVC administration led to any decrease in levels of these biomarkers.</p>
              <p>Methodological limitations merit discussion. Recruitment into the study was negatively impacted by the low prevalence of cognitive impairment among PWH residing in Hawaii and Puerto Rico who had sustained viral suppression. Despite study randomization, the severity of cognitive symptoms at baseline differed between individuals in the MVC arm compared with the placebo arm. Furthermore, attrition was common, particularly among individuals recruited in Puerto Rico where Hurricane Maria in 2017 resulted in substantial disruption to community services, including HIV clinical care and enrollment into research studies.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, this randomized controlled study found no definitive evidence in favor of MCV intensification for mild neurocognitive impairment among PWH. We did identify possible evidence of improvement for participants randomized to the MVC arm in the Learning and Memory NPZ domain. The relatively mild degree of cognitive impairment at baseline, possibly because of improvement in HIV medications and the early administration of ART, may have limited the degree to which MVC could improve cognitive performance in this study.</p>
