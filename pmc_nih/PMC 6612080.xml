                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">The PI3K/AKT pathway is activated through PIK3CA or AKT1 mutations and PTEN loss in breast cancer. We conducted a phase II trial with an allosteric AKT inhibitor MK-2206 in patients with advanced breast cancer who had tumors with PIK3CA/AKT1 mutations and/or PTEN loss/mutation.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR). Secondary endpoints were 6-month progression-free survival (6 m PFS), predictive and pharmacodynamic markers, safety, and tolerability. Patients had pre-treatment and on-treatment biopsies as well as collection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and platelet-rich plasma (PRP). Next-generation sequencing, immunohistochemistry, and reverse phase protein arrays (RPPA) were performed.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">Twenty-seven patients received MK-2206. Eighteen patients were enrolled into the <italic>PIK3CA/AKT1</italic> mutation arm (cohort A): 13 had <italic>PIK3CA</italic> mutations, four had <italic>AKT1</italic> mutations, and one had a <italic>PIK3CA</italic> mutation as well as PTEN loss. ORR and 6 m PFS were both 5.6% (1/18), with one patient with HR+ breast cancer and a <italic>PIK3CA</italic> E542K mutation experiencing a partial response (on treatment for 36 weeks). Nine patients were enrolled on the PTEN loss/mutation arm (cohort B). ORR was 0% and 6 m PFS was 11% (1/9), observed in a patient with triple-negative breast cancer and PTEN loss. The study was stopped early due to futility. The most common adverse events were fatigue (48%) and rash (44%). On pre-treatment biopsy, <italic>PIK3CA</italic> and <italic>AKT1</italic> mutation status was concordant with archival tissue testing. However, two patients with PTEN loss based on archival testing had PTEN expression on the pre-treatment biopsy. MK-2206 treatment was associated with a significant decline in pAKT S473 and pAKT T308 and PI3K activation score in PBMC and PRPs, but not in tumor biopsies. By IHC, there was no significant decrease in median pAKT S473 or Ki-67 staining, but a drop was observed in both responders.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p id="Par4">MK-2206 monotherapy had limited clinical activity in advanced breast cancer patients selected for PIK3CA/AKT1 or PTEN mutations or PTEN loss. This may, in part, be due to inadequate target inhibition at tolerable doses in heavily pre-treated patients with pathway activation, as well as tumor heterogeneity and evolution in markers such as PTEN conferring challenges in patient selection.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par22">PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling plays a key role in cell growth, protein translation, autophagy, metabolism, and cell survival. Activation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling contributes to the pathogenesis of many cancer types including breast cancer. Activated PI3K/AKT signaling is also associated with Cowden’s syndrome that is caused by germline phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) mutations. PTEN expression is also decreased in many sporadic breast cancers. Breast cancers with increased levels of AKT phosphorylation/activation and cancers exhibiting a gene expression signature of PTEN loss show poor disease outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Loss of PTEN activity and activation of PI3K signaling are associated with resistance to endocrine therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and trastuzumab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Most PTEN-low tumors and many of the phosphoinositide-3-kinase, catalytic, alpha polypeptide (<italic>PIK3CA</italic>) mutant tumors activate AKT for oncogenic signaling. Thus, the PI3K/AKT pathway is a promising target for breast cancer therapy.</p>
              <p id="Par23">MK-2206 is a selective allosteric inhibitor of AKT. In vitro studies of MK-2206 demonstrated that many breast cancer cell lines were highly sensitive to the agent. Preclinical studies also demonstrated that most <italic>PIK3CA</italic>-mutant cell lines and cell lines with PTEN loss are sensitive to MK-2206. In phase I trials, MK-2206 has been shown to inhibit AKT phosphorylation in platelets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Further, serum levels of MK-2206 achieved in these trials were comparable to concentrations that achieved a growth-inhibitory effect in preclinical models. Therefore, MK-2206 was felt to hold promise as a novel AKT inhibitor.</p>
              <p id="Par24">We present here the results of a biomarker-selected phase II breast cancer trial of MK-2206. Further, we present results of correlative studies including assessment of pathway inhibition in circulating biomarkers and pre-treatment and on-treatment biopsies, as well as in-depth characterization of a patient with response to MK-2206.</p>

                <title>Patient accrual</title>
                <p id="Par25">“Phase II Trial of AKT Inhibitor MK-2206 in patients with advanced breast cancer who have tumors with a <italic>PIK3CA</italic> mutation, or an <italic>AKT</italic> mutation, and/or PTEN loss/<italic>PTEN</italic> mutation” (NCT01277757) was a phase II trial sponsored by The Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program and conducted by the American Academy of Cancer Research Stand Up to Cancer PI3K Dream Team. This multicenter trial accrued in five centers: MD Anderson Cancer Center (lead organization), Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Columbia University Medical Center, and Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center.</p>
                <p id="Par26">Patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed breast cancer and with metastatic/advanced disease were eligible for enrollment for screening for <italic>PIK3CA</italic>, <italic>AKT</italic>, and PTEN status after informed consent. Patients with <italic>PIK3CA</italic>/<italic>AKT</italic>/<italic>PTEN</italic> alterations were eligible to consent on the treatment protocol on one of two cohorts: (1) activating <italic>PIK3CA</italic> or <italic>AKT1</italic> mutations or (2) <italic>PTEN</italic> mutation or PTEN loss (by IHC). Although central testing was offered, patients whose tumors have already been tested in a CLIA laboratory environment and found to have a <italic>PIK3CA</italic> or <italic>AKT</italic> mutation or PTEN loss or mutation were also eligible.</p>
                <p id="Par27">From June 2011 to October 2013, 30 patients were enrolled on the trial and 27 patients received study medications. Three patients who did not initiate treatment were excluded from analysis: one withdrew consent before treatment, and two were deemed ineligible—one was found to have diffuse liver disease on ultrasound performed for pretreatment biopsy (the eligibility criteria limits liver burden to 50%), and one patient was found to have elevated liver function tests on repeat laboratory studies prior to initiating therapy.</p>

                <title>Study objectives</title>
                <p id="Par28">The primary objective was to determine whether MK-2206 was associated with objective tumor responses (complete response [CR], partial response [PR]) in advanced breast cancer patients with <italic>PIK3CA</italic> or <italic>AKT</italic> mutation and/or PTEN loss or mutation.</p>
                <p id="Par29">Secondary objectives included (1) determining the 6-month progression-free survival (PFS), (2) determining baseline molecular markers that may predict clinical outcome, (3) establishing pharmacodynamic markers in blood and tumor tissue that may predict outcome, and (4) determining safety and tolerability of MK-2206 in previously treated patients with advanced breast cancer.</p>

              <sec id="Sec5">
                <title>Treatment and evaluation plan</title>
                <p id="Par30">The patient completed any systemic therapy regimens and therapeutic radiation a minimum of 21 days prior to initiation of study therapy. Patients received MK-2206 200 mg orally once a week, until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Duration of each treatment cycle was 4 weeks. Dose modifications occurred per protocol according to interim toxicities. Patients underwent a pre-treatment biopsy and on-treatment biopsy on day 16 of cycle 1.</p>
                <p id="Par31">Anti-tumor efficacy was assessed using RECIST 1.1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Safety assessments were conducted at baseline, with an exam on day 15 and laboratory studies weekly during the first cycle, then day 1 of every cycle thereafter, or earlier if toxicity occurred. Toxicity was graded according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0.</p>
              </sec>
              <sec id="Sec6">
                <title>Immunohistochemistry (IHC)</title>
                <p id="Par32">Tumor biopsies (core biopsies and fine needle aspirates) were obtained pretreatment and on day 16 (1 day after third weekly treatment). IHC was performed on core biopsies. PTEN IHC was performed in the MD Anderson CLIA clinical laboratory. PTEN IHC was performed using monoclonal mouse anti-Human PTEN antibody Clone 6H2.1 from Dako at 1:100 dilution. In previous studies, we had already demonstrated that PTEN loss by IHC is associated with PI3K pathway activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. PTEN staining was evaluated by assessing both intensity and percent positivity of staining. Both nuclear and cytoplasmic staining were evaluated. Staining of normal cells such as benign breast epithelium, stromal cells and/or endothelial cells was evaluated as an internal control. Any tumor nuclear or cytoplasmic staining showing similar intensity with internal control cells was considered positive staining (no PTEN loss). Complete lack of staining or faint staining (cytoplasmic or nuclear) in up to 50% of tumor cells was considered as PTEN loss. If there was no staining in internal control cells, the staining was considered to be inconclusive.</p>
                <p id="Par33">Pre-treatment and on-treatment core biopsies were also assessed for pAKT Ser473 (1:50), pS6 Ser235/236 (1:50), and pS6 Ser240/244 (1:200; all from Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA) as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The Refine Polymer Detection kit was used for immunostaining, with 3,3-diaminobenzidine serving as chromagen. Slides were counterstained with Mayer’s hematoxylin. Antibodies were evaluated with known positive and negative tissue controls.</p>

              <sec id="Sec7">
                <title>Reverse phase protein arrays</title>
                <p id="Par34">Samples were evaluated by reverse phase protein arrays (RPPA) to assess PI3K activation status as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy samples were obtained at pre- and post-treatment from patients and were frozen immediately. Among 24 patients who had biopsies, one patient was excluded because there was no tumor in samples for H&amp;E analysis of core biopsies. Fifteen patients had paired pre- and post-treatment samples available, while eight patients had pre-treatment samples only. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and platelet enriched plasma (PRP) were evaluated by RPPA at the following time points: at screening, C1-D1 (pretreatment), C1-D1 (post-treatment), and C1-D2.</p>
                <p id="Par35">The RPPA raw data were normalized by loading control by the RPPA core and log2 transformed. A linear mixed effects (LME) model was used to assess the differences in protein expression between time points on a protein-by-protein basis. The LME model includes the fixed effect of time point (two pre-treatment: early, C1D1: pre-treatment; two post-treatment: C1D1: post-treatment, C1D2) and random effect of the patient. To account for multiple testing, we estimated the false discovery rates (FDR) of the overall test of the model using the Benjamini-Hochberg method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The modified <italic>Z</italic>-scores of 9 important PI3K pathway biomarkers were calculated and used to compute the composite PI3K pathway activity score. The modified <italic>Z</italic>-score proposed by Iglewicz and Hoaglin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] was calculated based on the median of expression and absolute deviation about the median. We defined the patient’s composite PI3K pathway activity score as the sum of the modified <italic>Z</italic>-scores of phospho-protein of pAKT, 4E-BP1, S6K, and S6 (i.e., PI3K score = pS6 S240/244 + pS6 S235/236 + pS6K T389 + p4E-BP1 S65 + p4E-BP1 T37/46 + p-mTOR S2448 + pPRAS40 T246 + pAKT S473 + pAKT T308). The LME model described above was used to compare the PI3K activity scores between pre- and post-treatment.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par54">There is wide recognition that PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling plays a critical role in many cancer types including breast cancer. We therefore conducted this Phase II trial with the AKT Inhibitor MK-2206 in patients with advanced breast cancer who had tumors with a <italic>PIK3CA</italic> mutation or an <italic>AKT</italic> mutation and/or PTEN loss/<italic>PTEN</italic> mutation. We observed that MK-2206 monotherapy had the expected toxicity profile, with a substantial incidence of grade 3 rash, but had limited clinical and pharmacodynamic activity as monotherapy.</p>
              <p id="Par55">In our preclinical work with MK-2206, we had demonstrated that <italic>PIK3CA</italic>-mutant cell lines and cell lines with PTEN loss were more sensitive to MK-2206 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In this study, however, in patients selected with these genomic alterations, we saw limited clinical activity. Our patients were heavily pretreated and this may have affected the efficacy signal. However, it is notable that although we saw a pharmacodynamic effect in PRP, we did not see significant pathway inhibition in our tumor samples. In our preclinical work, we had shown that MK-2206 led to a dose-dependent decrease in AKT signaling in vitro and a dose-dependent decrease in tumor growth in vivo, with regression observed at higher doses that were associated with decreases in AKT signaling. These results are in line with a recent report from Kalinsky et al. where they assessed MK-2206 pharmacodynamics effect in a presurgical window-of-opportunity trial in breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Two doses of MK-2206 were administered, 9 and 2 days before surgery. In spite of dose reductions, the trial was discontinued after 12 patients were enrolled due to toxicity being greater than expected (adverse events of rash and mucositis). While there was a trend of reduction in pAkt with treatment, this did not reach statistical significance and did not represent a significant change from controls. There were no significant changes in Ki-67 or pS6. Taken together, the data suggests that unlike the xenograft experiments, in patients, toxicities and other patient and tumor-related factors limit the dose delivery, leading to insufficient target inhibition in the tumor, and thus limiting antitumor activity. Notably, although rash was a common adverse event, the trial did not decrease the starting dose due to concerns that decreasing dose might decrease efficacy. Both patients that had clinical benefit from MK-2206 were able to tolerate 200 mg weekly dosing of MK-2206 with limited rash and had evidence of pathway inhibition in the tumor.</p>
              <p id="Par56">Recently, several clinical trials with MK-2206 have been reported. There has been limited efficacy associated with MK-2206 monotherapy in renal cell carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and modest activity in lymphoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. There has been some signal of activity with combination therapies such as MK-2206 with trastuzumab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and MK-2206 with ridaforolimus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In a randomized phase II trial of a combination of MK-2206 with selumetinib, the combination was associated with higher adverse event rate and lower efficacy compared to modified FOLFOX in metastatic pancreatic cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par57">The combination of MK-2206 (150 mg weekly) and anastrozole was assessed by Ma et al. in a neoadjuvant trial in 16 patients with <italic>PIK3CA</italic> mutant HR+ breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Three patients were taken off-study due to on-treatment Ki67 &gt; 10% (<italic>n</italic> = 2) and toxicity (<italic>n</italic> = 1). Thirteen patients completed neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgery; none had a pathologic complete response. Addition of MK-2206 decreased pAKT S473 but did not decrease pPRAS40 T246 and did not further decrease Ki-67. The two patients that went off study due to inadequate Ki67 suppression also did not have adequate pAKT S473 suppression. Thus, overall MK-2206 did not appear to adequately suppress downstream signaling or proliferation, and thus unlikely to add to the efficacy of anastrozole alone.</p>
              <p id="Par58">MK-2206 has also been explored in combination with paclitaxel. In a Phase I trial, twenty-two patients were treated with combination therapy, 9 in dose escalation (multiple tumor types) and 13 in dose expansion in breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. There were five objective responses, and nine patients had stable disease. None of the patients with responses had <italic>PIK3CA, AKT</italic> or <italic>PTEN</italic> mutations. MK-2206 (135 mg po daily) was also tested in combination with paclitaxel in the I-SPY trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. MK-2206 improved predicted pCR rates compared to standard chemotherapy in several breast cancer signatures, defined mostly by HR− and HER2+ patients, with predicted pCR rates with and without MK-2206 being 64.1% and 35.7% in HR−/HER2+ and 46.7% and 26.1% in HR−/HER2− patients respectively.</p>
              <p id="Par59">There are several ongoing clinical trials with other novel AKT inhibitors including allosteric inhibitors ARQ092, BAY1125976, TAS-117, catalytic inhibitors AZD5363, ipatasertib, GSK2141795, and the dual AKT/S6K inhibitor MSC2363318A. Recently, Hyman et al. reported AZD5363 monotherapy data in patients with AKT alterations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In this study of 52 <italic>AKT1</italic> E17K–mutant patients treated with AZD5363, confirmed partial responses were observed among patients with HR+ breast and endometrial cancers (<italic>n</italic> = 4 and <italic>n</italic> = 2, respectively), as well as cervical cancer, triple-negative breast cancer, and lung adenocarcinoma (<italic>n</italic> = 1 each), with four additional unconfirmed partial responses. Additionally, the PAKT trial reported that the addition of AZD5363 to first-line paclitaxel therapy for TNBC resulted in significantly longer PFS (5.9 months vs. 4.2 months) and overall survival (19.1 months vs. 12.6 months) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The LOTUS trial investigated the addition of ipatasertib to paclitaxel as first-line therapy for triple-negative breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Median progression-free survival in the intention-to-treat population was 6.2 months (95% CI 3.8–9.0) with ipatasertib versus 4.9 months (3.6–5.4) with placebo (stratified hazard ratio [HR] 0.60, 95% CI 0.37–0.98; <italic>p</italic> = 0.037). Pre-specified analyses in the subgroup of 42 patients with <italic>PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN</italic>-altered tumors, after PFS events in 12 (46%) of 26 patients in the ipatasertib group and 13 (81%) of 16 patients in the placebo group, showed median PFS of 9.0 months with ipatasertib versus 4.9 months with placebo (non-stratified HR 0.44, 95% CI 0.20–0.99, log-rank <italic>p</italic> = 0.041). In patients with <italic>PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN-</italic>non-altered tumors, the PFS was not significantly different. Therefore, there is emerging data that AKT is indeed an effective target for cancer therapy in breast cancer. Further studies are needed to demonstrate whether newer generation agents such as ipatasertib or AZD5363 achieve greater target inhibition, either due to their mechanism of action (catalytic vs allosteric inhibitors) or due to better tolerability.</p>
              <p id="Par60">Our study had several limitations. We studied weekly dosing of MK-2206 as we expected that weekly dosing would be more tolerable than daily dosing; thus, we cannot exclude that more frequent dosing and thus more continuous inhibition would not have been more effective. We also did not obtain pharmacokinetic data; however, we used a dose where pharmacokinetics have previously been studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. We included tumors of different breast cancer subtypes and heavily pre-treated patients, and this may have dampened efficacy signals. We did not collect information on white blood cell count or other immune variables. Additionally, we initiated the trial at a time when genomic testing was less frequently offered in clinical practice, which created problems with timely accrual of patients to the study. Of note, as the frequency and availability of genomic testing increased, during the course if the trial, patients were enrolled based upon local testing on many different platforms, even within the same institutions. Finally, we enrolled patients based on archival testing results but the discordances between the PTEN status on archival tissue and that from pre-treatment biopsies highlights the drawback of enrollment based on archival testing, an approach used in most biomarker-selected trials. Although we were successful in getting pre-treatment and on-treatment biopsies, the sample size and the limited number of patients with clinical benefit limits our ability to make significant correlations with the outcome.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p id="Par61">In conclusion, MK-2206 monotherapy had limited clinical activity in advanced breast cancer patients selected for <italic>PIK3CA/AKT1</italic> or <italic>PTEN</italic> mutations or PTEN loss. This may, in part, be due to inadequate target inhibition at tolerable doses in heavily pre-treated patients with pathway activation, as well as tumor heterogeneity and evolution in markers such as PTEN conferring challenges in patient selection. The lack of statistically significant pathway inhibition in the tumors was an interesting finding that needs further study, and raises awareness that circulating biomarkers may not adequately reflect target inhibition in tumor tissue. The fact that one of the patients with a PR had an activating <italic>KRAS</italic> mutation, also confirmed on pre-treatment biopsy, is unexpected, and suggests that the simplistic view that MAPK co-mutations would confer resistance to AKT inhibitors may not be sufficient for precision oncology, and better modeling of driver mutations, pathway activation, and adaptive responses is needed.</p>
