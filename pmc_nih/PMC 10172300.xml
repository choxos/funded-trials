                <p id="Par1">Sitravatinib is an immunomodulatory tyrosine kinase inhibitor that can augment responses when combined with programmed death-1 inhibitors such as nivolumab. We report a single-arm, interventional, phase 2 study of neoadjuvant sitravatinib in combination with nivolumab in patients with locally advanced clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) prior to curative nephrectomy (NCT03680521). The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) prior to surgery with a null hypothesis ORR = 5% and the alternative hypothesis set at ORR = 30%. Secondary endpoints were safety; pharmacokinetics (PK) of sitravatinib; immune effects, including changes in programmed cell death–ligand 1 expression; time-to-surgery; and disease-free survival (DFS). Twenty patients were evaluable for safety and 17 for efficacy. The ORR was 11.8%, and 24-month DFS probability was 88·0% (95% CI 61.0 to 97.0). There were no grade 4/5 treatment-related adverse events. Sitravatinib PK did not change following the addition of nivolumab. Correlative blood and tissue analyses showed changes in the tumour microenvironment resulting in an immunologically active tumour by the time of surgery (median time-to-surgery: 50 days). The primary endpoint of this study was not met as short-term neoadjuvant sitravatinib and nivolumab did not substantially increase ORR.</p>

              <p id="Par3">Sitravatinib, an orally available tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), targets key receptors involved in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) biology including the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) family, c-MET, and the TAM (TYRO3, AXL, and MER) family. This not only inhibits angiogenesis but may mitigate immunosuppressive effects in the tumour microenvironment (TME) by reducing levels of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and T regulatory (Treg) cells, and increasing the ratio of M1:M2-polarised macrophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Sitravatinib may therefore improve the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors by producing a less immunosuppressive TME. Single-agent sitravatinib has shown activity in advanced ccRCC in a Phase 1/1b study in which patients had received a median of three prior treatment regimens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Clinical activity and safety of sitravatinib plus nivolumab has also been demonstrated in patients with advanced ccRCC whose disease had progressed on prior anti-angiogenic therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par4">Radical or partial nephrectomy is the current standard-of-care for locally advanced ccRCC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. However, while survival following nephrectomy is favourable, 20–40% of patients will develop metastases post-surgery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Adjuvant immune checkpoint therapy can improve outcomes in patients with ccRCC compared with placebo indicating the potential value of immunotherapy approaches in the perioperative setting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Although not currently approved for ccRCC, neoadjuvant therapy has been shown to downsize/downstage tumours ahead of surgery, and the safety and feasibility of this approach has been confirmed for several therapeutic agents, including TKIs such as sunitinib, sorafenib, pazopanib, and axitinib<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, and nivolumab immunotherapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. While several combinations of immunotherapy with TKIs are available for metastatic RCC, there is currently a lack of data for the neoadjuvant setting. One Phase 2 study is ongoing (lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab [NCT04393350]), and a second (axitinib plus avelumab [NCT03341845]) recently reported partial responses in 30% of primary tumours following 12 weeks of treatment, confirming the validity of a neoadjuvant combination treatment approach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par5">We hypothesised that the combination of neoadjuvant sitravatinib with nivolumab would yield beneficial immunomodulatory responses in patients with ccRCC. This Phase 2 pilot study evaluated the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant sitravatinib monotherapy lead-in, followed by the addition of nivolumab in patients undergoing nephrectomy for locally advanced ccRCC. The initial lead-in course of sitravatinib monotherapy facilitated exploratory correlative biomarker analyses to enhance our understanding of the mechanisms of action of sitravatinib and nivolumab.</p>

                <p id="Par6">From September 2018 to February 2020, 25 patients were enrolled. Of these, 20 patients received sitravatinib and were evaluable for safety (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The first patient was enrolled on October 9th, 2018 and the last patient was enrolled on February 10th, 2020. All 25 patients enrolled in the study underwent baseline biopsy. Of these, five discontinued the study (three had ineligible histology data, one was excluded for using concomitant treatment, which was not permitted by the study protocol, and one patient was found to be non-compliant with the study procedures and requirements). At mid-study, the 20 patients comprising the safety analysis population, all of whom had received sitravatinib treatment, were re-biopsied. All 17 of the patients in the efficacy-evaluable population underwent surgery, including one patient with bilateral disease who had two resections.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Trial design and conduct.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Study schema. <bold>b</bold> CONSORT diagram. <sup>*</sup>Retroperitoneal lymph nodes ≤1 cm in size each considered N0. <sup>#</sup>Nivolumab 240 mg Q2W (Day 15, Day 29, and potentially Day 43); patients received nivolumab on Day 43 only if their surgery was expected to occur more than a week from that date; last dose of any drug was administered ≥72 h prior to surgery. ccRCC clear cell renal cell carcinoma, Q2W every 2 weeks, QD once daily, RCC renal cell carcinoma.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41467_2023_38342_Fig1_HTML" id="d32e524"/></fig></p>
                <p id="Par7">There was only one eligibility related protocol deviation in that an enrolled patient had systolic blood pressure greater than 150 mm Hg at screening. After four of the seven patients initially receiving sitravatinib 120 mg QD developed grade 3 hypertension, the starting dose was decreased to 80 mg QD for all remaining patients per the dose de-escalation mTPI plan; no further starting dose de-escalation was required.</p>
                <p id="Par8">Three patients in the safety analysis population were excluded from the efficacy analysis based on the retrospective determination of metastatic disease at baseline (for two patients) and study discontinuation after AE of Grade 3 lipase increased which was attributed to sitravatinib and occurred prior to first dose of nivolumab (for one patient). All 3 patients were enrolled per protocol based on information at screening and were therefore not considered protocol violations, but were also not included in the clinical activity evaluable population based on the protocol’s prespecified statistical analysis plan. Thus, efficacy was evaluated in 17 eligible patients.</p>
                <p id="Par9">In the safety-evaluable population, the median age was 61.5 years (range, 37–80 years); most patients had baseline hypertension (65%) and clinical T3 or higher-stage primary tumours (95%) (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

The only TRAE leading to sitravatinib discontinuation for more than one patient was pancreatitis (grade 2 in one patient and grade 1 in one patient; both were asymptomatic and detected on laboratory investigation), both patients continued treatment with nivolumab.</p>

The secondary endpoint of median time from first dose of sitravatinib to surgery was 50 days (95% CI, 47–55). There were no complications during surgery. One patient experienced a Grade 3 complication using the Clavien-Dindo classification (temporary abdominal drain placement by interventional radiology for chyle leak 20 days after surgery)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.</p>
                <p id="Par16">The 3 patients who were treated on protocol and included in the safety analysis population but not in the efficacy-evaluable population were not protocol violations. Per protocol’s prespecified statistical analysis plan, the clinical activity evaluable population included patients who (1) have measurable disease (per RECIST 1.1) at baseline, (2) receive at least one dose of both sitravatinib and nivolumab, (3) have their on-study disease assessment prior to surgery, and (4) undergo surgery and are deemed disease-free (i.e. non-metastatic) after surgery. Patients who discontinued treatment due to AEs or withdrawal of consent prior to their on-study disease assessment were not included in the clinical activity evaluable population. The presence of baseline metastatic disease for two of the patients was determined retrospectively after enrolling and initiating study treatment—the patients satisfied eligibility criteria per protocol based on information at time of screening. One patient had an adrenal mass thought to be an adrenal adenoma at baseline, but was subsequently determined to be a metastasis after surgery was done and pathology confirmed an adrenal metastasis and not an adrenal adenoma as initially thought at baseline, leading to study discontinuation. A second patient had lung metastases that were subtly apparent at baseline on retrospective review, leading to study discontinuation with no surgical resection. A third patient was not included in the efficacy analysis because of a Grade 3 lipase increased, considered to be related to sitravatinib (Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>); the patient discontinued treatment before receiving nivolumab as per protocol, and did eventually have surgery but was not evaluable for clinical response due to the lack of a restaging scan prior to their operation. The guidance outlined in the protocol for Grade 3 or 4 sitravatinib-related non-hematological toxicities was to discontinue sitravatinib, and patients who developed toxicities after receiving sitravatinib but prior to first nivolumab administration were considered for permanent discontinuation from study.</p>

                <p id="Par19">Amongst other secondary endpoints, multiplex IF analysis showed that sitravatinib monotherapy may be associated with an influx of CD3+ tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in some patients (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>; Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). Flow cytometry staining showed an influx of total immune cells (CD45+) into the tumour in some patients following sitravatinib monotherapy that was further increased following combination treatment (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). The CD4/CD8 ratio significantly increased following sitravatinib monotherapy compared with baseline (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b–d</xref>). There was a significant decrease in natural killer (NK; CD45 + CD3-CD56dim) cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5e</xref>). Increased T-cell proliferation (Ki67) was observed in CD8+ TILs at the time of surgery in some patients (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5f</xref>). Baseline expression of checkpoint receptors, PD1, Tim3 and LAG3 on CD8+ and CD4 + TIL subsets showed that PD1 expression was highest in both TIL subsets (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2A</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2B</xref>). Expression of Tim3 on either TIL subset was not impacted by therapy but both flow cytometry and multiplex IF showed that an increase in LAG3 + CD3+, LAG3 + CD8+, and LAG3 + CD4+ TILs was seen with sitravatinib plus nivolumab (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2C–E</xref>).

Overall, upregulation of activation and inhibitory co-receptors as well as proliferation was found to be limited to the TIL population and was not observed in circulating peripheral blood T cells, suggesting that T-cell activation was restricted to the tumour (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>). The TILs were subgated into CD4+ and CD8+ subsets and the CD4/CD8 ratio was generally &lt;1 indicating a dominant CD8+ TIL population.

              <p id="Par23">In this study, 17 patients with locally advanced ccRCC received neoadjuvant treatment with sitravatinib plus nivolumab, and proceeded to nephrectomy with curative intent. Although the ORR of 11.8% did not meet the prespecified target of 30%, likely due to the short duration of neoadjuvant treatment, median DFS was not reached at data cut-off and the 24-month DFS probability was 88% (95% CI, 61–97). This result is comparable to the 24-month DFS probability of 77.3% (95% CI 72.8–81.1) observed in the KEYNOTE-564 phase 3 trial following a 12-month course of adjuvant pembrolizumab in patients with ccRCC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Our study showed that patients with locally advanced ccRCC can safely proceed to surgery after a short period of combined neoadjuvant therapy and allowed investigation of the immunomodulatory effects of sitravatinib and nivolumab in the TME. Although limited by the small patient numbers, sample sizes, and its single-arm nature, the lead-in design of our study coupled with the detailed correlative biomarker analyses on single-agent and combination-treated tumour samples generated an informative data set.</p>
              <p id="Par24">In Phase 2 trials in both locally advanced and metastatic ccRCC, neoadjuvant therapy has been associated with reduced primary tumour burden prior to surgery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Twelve weeks’ neoadjuvant axitinib (VEGFR TKI) was clinically active and reasonably well-tolerated in patients with locally advanced ccRCC (median 28% reduction in primary renal tumour diameter; PR 46%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Similarly, 8 weeks’ neoadjuvant sunitinib (VEGFR and platelet-derived growth factor receptor [PDGFR] TKI) was safe and feasible in patients with locally advanced or metastatic ccRCC (median 21% reduction in primary renal tumour diameter; PR 29%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. In patients with metastatic ccRCC, 12–14 weeks’ neoadjuvant pazopanib (VEGFR and PDGFR TKI) provided clinical benefit to 84% of patients, with a median 14% reduction in primary tumour size<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Perioperative nivolumab showed preliminary feasibility and safety with no surgical delays or complications in a Phase 2 study in non-metastatic high-risk ccRCC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>; a Phase 3 randomised study comparing perioperative nivolumab to observation in patients with localised RCC undergoing nephrectomy is underway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. In the only other study of combination treatment reported to date, 12 weeks of neoadjuvant axitinib plus avelumab (anti-PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor) in high-risk non-metastatic ccRCC produced partial responses in the primary tumours of 30% of patients, which correlated with longer-term outcomes (92% of responding patients were disease-free after a median follow-up of 23.5 months)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Together with our own data, these results confirm that combination neoadjuvant therapy offers potential clinical benefit to patients scheduled for surgery.</p>
              <p id="Par25">Results from correlative assessments support modulation of the tumour microenvironment by sitravatinib via hypoxia and immunomodulation pathways; this modulation was further enriched with the combination of sitravatinib and nivolumab. Gene expression analyses showed that the angiogenesis biomarkers <italic>KDR</italic> (<italic>VEGFR2</italic>) and <italic>FLT1</italic> (<italic>VEGFR1</italic>) were two of the top genes downregulated following sitravatinib monotherapy, indicating potent inhibition of angiogenesis, and confirming a key mechanism of action of sitravatinib. The GSEA analysis showed significant upregulation of the hypoxia gene signature with sitravatinib and further enrichment with the combination of sitravatinib and nivolumab. In addition, several immune-related GSEA pathway signatures were increased, providing compelling evidence that sitravatinib stimulates the immune system. The decrease in <italic>TGF-β</italic>, <italic>E2F</italic> targets, and <italic>G2M</italic> checkpoint signatures following sitravatinib treatment further demonstrates reversal of the immune suppressive TME and blockade of cell proliferation by sitravatinib.</p>
              <p id="Par26">Increased CD8+ T cell infiltration and correspondingly low CD4/CD8 T cell ratio are associated with poor prognosis in ccRCC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. In our multiplex IF analysis, sitravatinib monotherapy increased the CD4/CD8 ratio in the ccRCC tumors. Sitravatinib also appeared to increase macrophage density in the tumor, but not increase the M1:M2 macrophage ratio. This finding contrasted with previous nonclinical and clinical studies (e.g. resectable oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma) demonstrating sitravatinib increasing M1:M2 macrophage ratio possibly due to TAM receptor inhibition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, supporting modulation or removal of key immunosuppressive cell types (M2 macrophages) in the TME by sitravatinib. Increased PD-L1 expression on macrophages is likely an effect of nivolumab. Most tumours (16/17) were PD-L1 negative at baseline, which is lower than expected since other studies have reported PD-L1-positive rates (i.e., expression &gt;0%) of around 30%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. However, we did observe some tumour responses in this largely PD-L1-negative population, consistent with literature showing that patients whose disease is PD-L1 negative by IHC can still achieve clinical benefit with anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 therapies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par27">GSEA analysis showed that the <italic>IFN-γ</italic> response pathway was increased with sitravatinib monotherapy and further increased with sitravatinib plus nivolumab. The increased IFN-γ response gene signature noted in our study following treatment with sitravatinib plus nivolumab may sensitize tumors to anti-CTLA-4 immune checkpoint inhibition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. We have accordingly activated a phase 1 trial (NCT04518046 at clinicaltrials.gov) to determine the safety and efficacy of adding the CTLA-4 inhibitor ipilimumab to sitravatinib plus nivolumab in patients with advanced ccRCC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Furthermore, changes in the TME were concordant between multiplex IF and flow cytometry analyses showing an increase in LAG3-expressing TILs over time in more responsive patients. This finding suggests the presence of suppressive pathways that can be induced by the immune activation observed in this study and which may be actionable targets for future combination treatments. In addition, multiplex IF demonstrated an increased infiltration of LAG3 + CD3+ TILs during treatment compared with baseline, suggesting that combination therapy induced specific TME changes resulting in an immunologically active state before surgery. In primary ccRCC, LAG-3 expression is associated with shorter survival, may be an indicator of poor prognosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, and could be one reason for lack of response in some of our patients.</p>
              <p id="Par28">In conclusion, this Phase 2 study demonstrated that short-term neoadjuvant sitravatinib plus nivolumab does not substantially increase ORR but may modulate the immune microenvironment and yield high DFS probabilities in locally advanced ccRCC. Despite the presence of qualifying toxicities leading to dose de-escalation after the first 7 patients enrolled, all patients regardless of starting dose of sitravatinib were able to safely proceed to surgery. Biomarker findings were consistent with the mechanism of action of sitravatinib, demonstrating that angiogenesis inhibition and anti-tumoural immunomodulation were the key pathways that were upregulated with sitravatinib and further augmented with combination treatment. These data demonstrate an immune response with sitravatinib that is supportive of its action in favourably modulating the TME.</p>

In the first segment, sitravatinib monotherapy was administered for 2 weeks; in the second segment, combination sitravatinib plus nivolumab treatment was administered for ≥4 weeks (maximum 6 weeks, allowing surgical scheduling flexibility). After completing neoadjuvant therapy, patients underwent a pre-surgical restaging scan, followed by planned resection, either partial or radical nephrectomy. Patients were subject to a 48-h preoperative hold of all study drugs prior to surgery. No study drug was administered post-surgery.</p>
                <p id="Par32">Sitravatinib was administered orally once daily (QD) at the starting dose of 120 mg.

                <p id="Par33">The primary study objective was to evaluate clinical activity of the combination regimen; the primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) defined as the percentage of patients achieving a radiographic complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), per RECIST v1.1, prior to surgery. With currently available treatments, the percentage of patients with a point in time ORR prior to surgery was assumed to be 5% (null hypothesis) and this rate was thus considered uninteresting. The target percentage of patients with a point in time objective response prior to surgery using sitravatinib and nivolumab was assumed to be 30% (alternative hypothesis). Secondary endpoints were safety; pharmacokinetics (PK) of sitravatinib; immune effects, including changes in programmed cell death–ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression; time-to-surgery; and disease-free survival (DFS). Exploratory endpoints included biomarker analyses of the effect of sitravatinib alone and in combination with nivolumab.</p>
                <p id="Par34">Imaging was used for disease assessments, with an allowable window of 4 weeks prior to first study treatment for screening/baseline evaluation and within 1 week of planned surgery for on-study disease assessment. Per protocol, patients would be followed for survival every 6 months from the last study visit for at least 3 years or until death, disease recurrence, or loss to follow-up; disease recurrence was based on off-study imaging assessments performed per standard-of-care for post-nephrectomy patients.

                <p id="Par35">Baseline disease assessments were performed using computed tomography (CT), X-ray (radiography), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Subsequent, on-study disease assessment included imaging of all known and suspected sites of disease identified in the preoperative setting (ie, CT or X-ray of the chest, CT, or MRI of the abdomen, and, if clinically indicated, whole body bone scan and CT with contrast or MRI of the brain and evaluation of any superficial lesions). The allowable window for imaging was 4 weeks prior to first study treatment for screening/baseline evaluation and within 1 week of planned surgery for on-study disease assessment. Imaging results were evaluated by the investigator to assess disease response per RECIST v1.1. Blood samples for PK evaluation were collected at specified timepoints prior to and following study treatment dosing. Safety assessments were conducted at the initiation of study treatment and at each clinic visit. Per protocol, patients would be followed for survival every 6 months from the last study visit for up to 3 years or more until death, disease recurrence, or loss to follow-up; disease recurrence will be based on imaging assessments performed off study per standard of care for patients post-nephrectomy.</p>
                <p id="Par36">Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were assessed to guide adjustment of the starting dose of sitravatinib after 3 weeks for the first six treated patients or earlier if ≥2 patients were suspected of experiencing DLTs. The dose of sitravatinib was to be decreased if &gt;2 of the first six patients experienced DLTs. DLTs were defined as non-haematological grade 4 AEs; non-haematological grade 3 AEs except (a) manageable nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea persisting &lt;2 h, (b) uncomplicated electrolyte abnormalities resolved within 72 h, (c) fatigue persisting &lt;8 days, and d) amylase or lipase elevation not associated with pancreatitis; any toxicity that delayed surgery by &gt;2 weeks.</p>
                <p id="Par37">Biomarker expression analyses were conducted on core needle biopsies taken at baseline (timepoint 1), during sitravatinib monotherapy at day 14 (timepoint 2), and on resected specimens at the time of surgery during sitravatinib plus nivolumab (timepoint 3). Blood samples for correlative studies were collected at screening, day 1, day 15, day 29, and day 43/surgery. Biomarker analyses included immunohistochemistry (IHC) for PD-L1 expression (using clone 28-8; cat# ab205921 [Abcam, Cambridge, UK] as used in the Agilent PharmDx system), multiplex immunofluorescence (IF) profiling, gene expression profiling using NanoString nCounter and HTG EdgeSeq technologies, and tissue and blood flow cytometry.</p>

                  <p id="Par61">The HTG EdgeSeq gene expression platform is a high throughput next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based assay that utilises low sample input and a unique nuclease protection chemistry to simultaneously assess gene expression levels in multiple genes. We used the 1392 gene HTG EdgeSeq Precision ImmunoOncology panel (PIP) to assess tumour immune response from a total of 37 patient samples.</p>
                  <p id="Par62">Three batches of samples were run using the PIP; batch 1 samples comprised 16 formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) samples with two 5 μm core needle biopsy sections, while batches 2 and 3 comprised 23 samples with three 5 μm core needle biopsy sections. Of the 37 samples, only two samples had a total surface area &lt;6 mm<sup>2</sup> (minimum required input into assay) and thus failed the sample input criterion.</p>
                  <p id="Par63">All samples meeting the minimum input area were processed according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, the tissue was removed from the slides with a scalpel, lysed using proteinase K and HTG’s denaturation oil, and underwent target protection and clean up on the HTG EdgeSeq processor. Following this process, sequencing adaptors and barcodes were added and the library amplified. Amplified libraries were quantified with the Kapa library quantification kit, pooled, and sequenced on Illumina’s Miseq platform. The data were analysed using HTG parser and HTG EdgeSeq Reveal software, to generate raw and normalised counts. All samples passed QC2 metrics, and three samples failed QC1 (having &lt;1.5 million reads post-sequencing).</p>
                  <p id="Par64">HTG EdgeSeq read count data for 50 samples was collected and analysed for differential expression and gene set enrichment using a custom bioinformatics pipeline. Raw sample read counts were normalised to account for library size differences across samples and log2CPM expression gene values were calculated for each sample. Housekeeping (HK) gene expression was used to define a scale factor for each sample for further normalisation. This was achieved by dividing the mean expression of the housekeeping genes across samples by the mean of the house keeping genes within each sample.</p>
                  <p id="Par65">Principal component analysis (PCA) analysis was performed on the normalised data to identify any possible outliers.

Briefly, 4 μm-thick FFPE samples from consecutive sections were stained using 20 biomarkers divided into multiplex IF panels against: Panel 4, CK, CD3, LAG3, TIM3, ICOS, VISTA, and OX40; and Panel 5, CK, CD68, Arg-1, CD11b, CD33, CD14 and CD66b. The multiplex IF panels were applied in 52 samples (different time points) per panel, three samples per panel were considered not eligible for image analysis. All the markers were stained in sequence according to each multiplex IF panel using their respective fluorophore contained in the Opal 7 kit (catalogue #NEL797001KT; Akoya Biosciences) and the individual tyramide signal amplification fluorophores Opal Polaris 480. The slides were scanned using the Vectra/Polaris 3·0·3 (Akoya Biosciences) at low magnification, 10x (1.0 µm/pixel) through the full emission spectrum and using positive tonsil controls to calibrate the spectral image scanner protocol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. A pathologist selected a median of five regions of interest (ROIs) for scanning in high magnification using the Phenochart Software image viewer 1.0.12 (660 × 500 µm size at resolution 20×) in order to capture various elements of tissue heterogeneity. Each ROI was analysed by a pathologist using InForm 2.4.8 image analysis software (Akoya Biosciences). Marker co-localisation was used to identify specific cell phenotypes in each multiplex IF panel.

Staining was performed using a single 4 μM FFPE slide. Within each staining round, two cyanine dye-labelled (Cy3, Cy5) antibodies were paired and recognized two markers. The staining signal was then imaged and followed by novel dye inactivation, enabling repeated rounds of staining. Proprietary deep learning-based algorithms were applied to identify and classify individual cells associated with each marker. Both tumour segmentation IF markers and pathologist-defined tumour areas based on haematoxylin and eosin slides were used to define areas of analysis for cell classification within tumours.
