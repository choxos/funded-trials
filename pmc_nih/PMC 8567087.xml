The aim of this study was to report a post hoc analysis of diet diary data from the phase 2 UX007-CL201 study (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01886378">NCT01886378</ext-link>).</p>

                  <p id="P2">In the single-arm, open-label, phase 2 UX007-CL201 study, the safety and efficacy of 78 weeks of treatment with triheptanoin, an odd-carbon, medium-chain triglyceride consisting of three 7-carbon fatty acids on a glycerol backbone, was investigated in subjects with LC-FAOD versus a retrospective 78-week period when subjects were optimally managed under published dietary guidelines. Subject dietary reports were collected to analyze the relationship between diet, triheptanoin treatment, and MCEs. Referring metabolic physicians completed a survey on patient management and clinical outcomes before and after initiation of triheptanoin. Before initiating triheptanoin, subjects received a mean daily caloric intake (DCI) of 17.4% from medium-chain triglycerides (MCT). During the study, subjects received a mean of 27.5% DCI from triheptanoin. Protein (13.7% vs 14.5% DCI), long-chain fat (13.1% vs 10.5% DCI), and carbohydrate (55.3% vs 47.1% DCI) intake were consistent between the pre-triheptanoin and triheptanoin treatment periods, respectively.</p>

A weak association existed between improvement in annualized MCE rate and change in percent DCI from MCT (Spearman rank correlation: <italic>r</italic> = −0.38; 95% CI: −0.675, 0.016). However, there was large variability in the association and no specific pattern of change for larger or smaller changes in dose. Seventy-two percent of physicians reported that triheptanoin had a clinically meaningful benefit on medical management of their patients.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="P6">Long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorders (LC-FAODs) are rare, serious, and life-threatening autosomal recessive disorders caused by defects in the metabolic pathway that converts fatty acids into energy. These defects can lead to depleted energy sources in patients, resulting in severe acute metabolic crises, such as rhabdomyolysis, hypoglycemia, and cardiomyopathy, which may lead to hospitalizations or early death [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. LC-FAODs include inherited defects in one of six different genes coding for carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1a (CPT-Ia; <italic>CPT1A</italic>), carnitine palmitoyl transferase 2 (CPT-II; <italic>CPT2</italic>), carnitine/acylcarnitine translocase (CACT; <italic>SLC25A25</italic>), very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD; <italic>ACADVL</italic>), long-chain 3 hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCHAD; <italic>HADHA</italic>), and mitochondrial trifunctional protein (TFP; a heterodimer encoded by <italic>HADHA</italic> and <italic>HADHB</italic>).</p>
              <p id="P7">Published disease management involves strict avoidance of fasting and a low-fat/high-carbohydrate diet, with medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) and carnitine supplementation [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. These treatments have not been formally studied in controlled clinical trials and represent approaches developed by physicians using case experience. Diet modification and fasting avoidance can benefit some patients with LC-FAOD; however, hypoglycemic events, exercise intolerance, muscle weakness, rhabdomyolysis, and cardiomyopathy still commonly occur [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. These events remain associated with a high mortality rate, highlighting a serious unmet medical need [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p>
              <p id="P8">Triheptanoin (Dojolvi) is an odd-carbon, medium-chain triglyceride consisting of three 7-carbon fatty acids on a glycerol backbone, intended as an energy substrate replacement therapy for the treatment of LC-FAOD. Triheptanoin is approved in the United States for the treatment of pediatric and adult patients with molecularly confirmed LC-FAOD. Triheptanoin is metabolized to seven-carbon fatty acids that can diffuse across the mitochondrial membrane and are further metabolized into propionyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA by mediumand short-chain fatty acid oxidation enzymes, bypassing the enzymes that are deficient in LC-FAOD. The production of propionyl-CoA is responsible for the anaplerotic characteristics of triheptanoin [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], which are believed to be critical for the tricarboxylic acid cycle, gluconeogenesis, and restoring the energy deficiency in LC-FAOD.</p>
              <p id="P9">The single-arm phase 2 UX007-CL201 study (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01886378">NCT01886378</ext-link>) was conducted in 29 pediatric and adult subjects with LC-FAOD to prospectively evaluate the safety and efficacy of 78 weeks of triheptanoin treatment compared with a retrospective 78-week pretriheptanoin period [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Compared with the pre-triheptanoin period, 78 weeks of triheptanoin treatment reduced the rate of major clinical events (MCEs; e.g., hypoglycemia, rhabdomyolysis, cardiomyopathy), maintained improvements in walking exercise tolerance, and increased health-related quality of life [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Here, we present additional analysis from this phase 2 study of dietary data during the 4-week run-in period, baseline, and triheptanoin treatment periods, as well as analysis of referring physician questionnaires.</p>

                <title>Study description</title>
                <p id="P10">This study enrolled 29 subjects aged ≥6 months with symptomatic LC-FAOD. The subjects had confirmed diagnoses of CPT-II, VLCAD, LCHAD, or TFP deficiency (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). The study was conducted in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki, relevant institutional review board practices, and the International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice guidelines. Informed consent was obtained for experimentation with human subjects. Further details of this study have previously been published [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p>
                <p id="P11">Study guidelines were developed based on input from expert metabolic physicians and dietitian consultants to support a safe transition from MCT to triheptanoin and minimize variability in macronutrient breakdown. As a part of this transition, subjects increased their daily caloric intake (DCI) from medium-chain fat (i.e., triheptanoin) compared with prestudy MCT or no MCT. The study drug administration guidelines recommended that subjects follow a diet consisting of 25–35% DCI from triheptanoin, ~15% DCI from protein, an appropriate percentage of DCI from long-chain fatty acids to meet essential fatty acid requirements, and the balance of energy in the form of carbohydrates.</p>

                <title>Outcome measures</title>
                <p id="P12">The key study endpoints in the present analysis include macronutrient breakdown before and after triheptanoin initiation, frequency and duration (expressed as event-days) of MCEs, exercise tolerance, health-related quality of life, and safety.</p>
                <p id="P13">The macronutrient breakdown (protein, carbohydrate, total fat, medium chain fat, and long chain fat) was measured as the percentage of total DCI before and during triheptanoin initiation. Pretriheptanoin levels were calculated from the 3-day diet diary data obtained during the run-in period and baseline visit. During-triheptanoin levels were calculated from data obtained during the triheptanoin treatment period at scheduled study visits (weeks 12, 24, 48, and 78).</p>
                <p id="P14">Reductions in rates and study-days of MCEs, and changes in exercise tolerance and quality of life measures were collected from surveys on patient management and clinical outcomes completed by referring metabolic physicians both before and after initiation of triheptanoin.</p>

                <title>Dietary assessments</title>
                <p id="P15">Three-day diet records were collected during three study periods: 1) during a 4-week run-in period in which subjects maintained current therapy (including medium even-chain triglycerides); 2) at baseline before subjects initiated triheptanoin; and 3) during the triheptanoin treatment period at scheduled study visits (weeks 12, 24, 48, and 78). The diet diaries were analyzed using metabolic software (MetabolicPro [United States] and Microdiet [United Kingdom]) to calculate the subject’s total calories and macronutrient distribution. Each subject’s metabolic needs were calculated by a metabolic dietitian, who took into account the patient’s individual dietary restrictions, age, weight, and clinical condition. During the study, each subject’s diet remained relatively isocaloric, allowing for consistency in percentage of fat, protein, and carbohydrates. This method of dietary analysis is routinely used in clinical practice [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and was adopted to minimize the impact of introducing triheptanoin as a source of medium-chain fat during the study that may have confounded treatment effects. Formal dietary assessments were not recorded in these diaries during the entire 78-week retrospective period, as this was not required per protocol. Regular dietary management per guidelines was performed during this retrospective period as part of routine medical care for LC-FAOD.</p>

                <p id="P16">Referring metabolic physicians who managed subjects prior to study enrollment were invited to complete a survey on the medical management of their subjects prior to initiation of triheptanoin in this phase 2 study (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Appendix</xref>). The focus of this questionnaire was to obtain information related to the subject’s LCFAOD, the number of clinic visits, MCT use, dietary compliance, and dietary optimization prior to enrollment in this phase 2 study. Additionally, physicians who continued overseeing subjects enrolled in the study were asked their opinion on the effect of triheptanoin on overall patient management and clinical condition.</p>

                <p id="P19">A key objective of this study was to compare triheptanoin at 25–35% DCI with previously established dietary management. Patients with LC-FAOD conditions are managed by dietitians with expertise in inborn errors of metabolism. Energy needs and macronutrient distribution for each patient are estimated based on the individual’s gender, age, weight, activity level, and clinical status. After estimating adequate calories (kcals), appropriate levels of protein are calculated; for infants and children, growth and development must be considered. The amount of protein prescribed typically provides ~15% DCI, although a higher percentage has been reported to be beneficial in LC-FAOD [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The amount of total, medium-chain, and long-chain fats are then planned in accordance with published guidelines (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>

                <title>Dietary analysis: macronutrient breakdown and DCI</title>
                <p id="P20">As required by the study protocol, subjects increased DCI from medium-chain fat (i.e., triheptanoin) compared with prestudy MCT intake or no MCT (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The 3-day diet diary data captured during the run-in period and baseline visit reflect subjects’ calorie intake and macronutrient distribution prior to study enrollment and were consistent with published dietary guidelines (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>; <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Tables 1</xref> and <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).</p>
                <p id="P21">The percentage of DCI for protein (13.7% vs. 14.5%) and longchain fat (13.1% vs. 10.5%) was similar between the pre-triheptanoin and triheptanoin treatment periods (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). On average, subjects had an ~10% increase in DCI from medium-chain fat (17.4% vs. 27.5%), and an ~8% decrease in DCI from carbohydrates (55.3% vs. 47.1%). Total DCI increased from ~62 to 72 kcal/kg, driven by energy requirements for growth and activity.</p>

                <title>Impact of dietary change on MCEs</title>
                <p id="P22">Subjects who crossed over to triheptanoin at a target therapeutic dose range of 25–35% DCI experienced a clinically meaningful improvement in mean annualized MCE rate from 1.69 to 0.88 events/year (48.1% reduction; p 0.0208) and mean annualized MCE event-day rate from 5.96 to 2.96 days/year (50.3% reduction; p 0.0284; <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 2</xref>) [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. A weak association was observed between changes in percent DCI from MCT to triheptanoin and MCE improvement that did not reach statistical significance (Spearman rank correlation: <italic>r =</italic>−0.38; 95% CI: −0.675, 0.016; <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). The increase in DCI from even-chain MCT to triheptanoin reflects the protocol-specified regimen. Furthermore, when evaluating subjects who had a reduction in events while taking triheptanoin, the change in dose ranged widely from a few percentage points to a 25% increase in medium-chain fat.</p>

                <title>Analysis of physician questionnaires</title>
                <p id="P23">Responses to the questionnaire regarding the 78-week retrospective period were received from 17 physicians at 16 different metabolic centers for 25 (86%) of 29 subjects enrolled in this study. Questionnaire responses for four subjects were not obtained because two of the referring physicians had retired at the time of the request and two referring physicians did not respond.</p>
                <p id="P24">Based on completed physician surveys (n 25), almost all subjects were managed by a metabolic physician (96%) and all were managed by a metabolic dietitian (100%) during the retrospective 78-week pretreatment period (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Clinical assessments occurred frequently during this time, with most subjects (76%) assessed at four or more separate clinic visits. One subject did not have any oversight in the 78 weeks prior to enrollment because the subject chose not to be under physician care and was not on MCT prior to the study. Most subjects (92%) were on MCT during the retrospective 78 weeks, and the overall pretreatment average MCT dose ranged from 0 to 37% DCI.</p>
                <p id="P25">In the view of the referring physicians, 84% of subjects were compliant with dietary management prior to study initiation, and 80% thought treatment was medically optimized in the 78 weeks prior to initiation of triheptanoin (<xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Five subjects were identified as not being medically optimized via diet, including two subjects who were not taking MCT due to subject choice and three subjects who continued to have clinical events despite dietary management. Repeated hospitalizations were often cited as a measure of nonoptimization, but lack of dietary compliance or management oversight were not provided as explanations for any subject not being medically optimized.</p>
                <p id="P26">The referring physicians also provided perspective on several clinical outcomes during the 78-week triheptanoin treatment period, including the reduction in the rate and event-days of MCEs, exercise tolerance, and quality of life. Specifically, they were asked whether the benefit observed with triheptanoin at its target dose of 25−35% DCI compared with prior management was clinically meaningful. The majority of physicians (18/25; 72%) responded that the effect of triheptanoin was clinically meaningful, had an impact on medical management, and demonstrated an improvement in subjects (<xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). For the remaining 28% (7/25) of subjects, the physician did not respond (2/25; 8%), did not see improvement while on study (2/25; 8%), indicated that they both did and did not see improvement while on study (1/25; 4%), or was not the treating physician for the patient following study enrollment (2/25; 8%).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="P27">Triheptanoin decreased the rate of MCEs in patients with LCFAOD compared with established pretreatment management in the phase 2 study [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Although the subjects had an ~10% increase in DCI from medium-chain fat after transitioning to triheptanoin, this increase was expected as triheptanoin was dosed, per protocol, at a higher percentage than clinical guidelines recommend for MCT [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Macronutrient breakdown was consistent during the combined 4-week run-in and baseline periods and remained stable during the triheptanoin treatment period. The dietary analysis supports that the change in treatment regimen from previously established pretreatment management to triheptanoin at a dose range of 25–35% DCI resulted in a significant improvement in the rate and event-days of MCEs. Reductions in MCEs were observed across the spectrum of change in medium-chain fat intake, indicating that this may not be the primary cause of improvement following the transition to triheptanoin.</p>
              <p id="P28">The metabolic physicians and dietitians who managed subjects during the retrospective 78-week period before study enrollment indicated that most subjects were medically optimized via diet and demonstrated good compliance with their individualized management. The referring metabolic physicians who continued to manage their patients during the study believed that triheptanoin dosed at 25–35% DCI demonstrated a clinically meaningful improvement and positive effect on their patients’ outcomes compared with their prior dietary treatment regimens.</p>
              <p id="P29">The results presented in the current report suggest that the improvement in outcomes was unlikely caused by concurrent changes in diet or clinical care, but rather caused by the unique properties of triheptanoin benefitting subjects with LC-FAOD.</p>
