                  <title>Question</title>
                  <p>Are reductions in cardiovascular disease risk produced by financial incentives placed on patients, physicians, or both to control low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels worth the costs needed to achieve these health benefits?</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="ab-zoi180113-2">
                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>In this model-based economic evaluation, incentives shared between patients and physicians had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $60 000/quality-adjusted life-year.

                  <p>The model population (n = 1 000 000 [30.7% women]) had similar mean (SD) age (61.5 [11.9] years) and LDL-C level (153.9 mg/dL) as the observed trial population (n = 1503 [42.7% women]; age, 62.0 [8.7] years; and LDL-C level, 160.6 mg/dL). Using base-case assumptions (including a 10-year waning period of LDL-C level reductions), the usual-care strategy was dominated (higher costs and lower QALYs) by all other strategies. Strategies for physician- or patient-only incentives were dominated by the shared-incentives strategy, which had an ICER of $60 000/QALY compared with the trial control strategy. In a sensitivity analysis regarding the duration of LDL-C level reductions, the shared-incentives strategy remained cost-effective (ICERs &lt;$100 000/QALY and &lt;$150 000/QALY) for scenarios with LDL-C level reductions lasting, with linear waning, at least 7 and 5 years, respectively. In the 1-way sensitivity analysis for the time horizon of the analysis, the ICER of the shared-incentives strategy exceeded $100 000/QALY at 11 years and $150 000/QALY at 8 years. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the shared-incentives intervention was cost-effective in 69% to 77% of iterations using cost-effectiveness thresholds of $100 000 to $150 000/QALY. Cost-effectiveness results were also sensitive to the duration of intervention costs.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>High cholesterol level is a leading risk factor for mortality and morbidity.<sup><xref rid="zoi180113r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Statins are effective and cost-effective medications for improving cholesterol levels and cardiovascular disease outcomes, but many patients for whom statins are indicated do not receive prescriptions for them, and the long-term adherence rate for patients who have received prescriptions is below 50%.<sup><xref rid="zoi180113r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="zoi180113r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="zoi180113r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="zoi180113r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Reducing population cardiovascular disease risk is within reach, but improving cholesterol levels will require behavior changes from physicians, patients, or both.</p>
              <p>Financial incentives, such as pay-for-performance policies, have shown mixed results in changing physician or patient behaviors and improving health outcomes.<sup><xref rid="zoi180113r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="zoi180113r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="zoi180113r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Asch et al<sup><xref rid="zoi180113r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> conducted a 4-arm randomized clinical trial and found that financial incentives shared between physicians and patients were superior at reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels compared with no financial incentives, and superior to financial incentives delivered to physicians or patients alone. The trial made innovative use of principles of behavioral economics and electronic pill bottle technology to enhance the effect of financial incentives,<sup><xref rid="zoi180113r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> but left unanswered whether the LDL-C level reductions represented good value given the added costs of the financial incentives, electronic pill bottles, and increased use of statins.</p>
              <p>Health care payers should consider long-term health and cost outcomes when evaluating the value of quality improvement interventions. Therefore, our objective was to use a previously developed and validated cardiovascular disease microsimulation model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of financial incentives to physicians, patients, or both on LDL-C level reductions based on the findings from the Asch et al<sup><xref rid="zoi180113r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> trial. The control group in the trial also received electronic pill bottles and increased monitoring (4 annual lipid level measurements per trial protocol compared with 1 per year per current lipid guidelines) and experienced sustained LDL-C level reductions in the 15-month follow-up period. Because the control group in the trial did not correspond to usual care, we also included a virtual usual-care group in our cost-effectiveness analysis that did not include these elements.</p>

                <title>Overview</title>
                <p>We used the previously developed Cardiovascular Disease Policy Model for Risk, Events, Detection, Interventions, Costs, and Trends (CVD PREDICT) Model to simulate long-term discounted health and cost consequences (2017 US dollars) of financial incentives for cholesterol level control based on data from the Asch et al<sup><xref rid="zoi180113r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> randomized clinical trial and other published sources (<xref rid="zoi180113t1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).<sup><xref rid="zoi180113r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="zoi180113r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="zoi180113r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> We included a lifetime horizon in our base-case analysis and performed our analysis from a health care payer perspective; we varied the time horizon in a 1-way sensitivity analysis, recognizing that some payers could care about shorter time frames. Per cost-effectiveness analysis modeling recommendations, the model time horizon should be long enough to capture all relevant health and cost outcomes.<sup><xref rid="zoi180113r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Therefore, although we assumed varying durations of LDL-C level reductions given the 12-month intervention in the Asch et al<sup><xref rid="zoi180113r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> trial (with follow-up to 15 months), all relevant long-term health outcomes were captured using longer-term (including lifetime in the base-case analysis) model time horizons. For example, an individual in the model who has an averted fatal cardiovascular disease event in year 2 of the model (because of their lower LDL-C level in year 1 of the model) would have relevant incremental health effects in all model years until the individual died of cardiovascular disease or other causes.</p>

Each individual was simulated through 5 possible strategies: (1) usual care (ie, a virtual control group), (2) the trial control group (which included use of electronic pill bottles and increased monitoring), (3) patient incentives, (4) physician incentives, and (5) shared incentives to patients and physicians. We evaluated the trade-offs between health gains and increased health care spending among these strategies using cost-effectiveness analysis.</p>
                <p>The Asch et al<sup><xref rid="zoi180113r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> trial protocol was approved by the institutional review boards of the University of Pennsylvania and Geisinger Health System and the partners human research committee at Harvard Vanguard Medical Associates. The present cost-effectiveness analysis was part of the original trial protocol approved, including informed patient consent, by the University of Pennsylvania Institutional Review Board. Patient records were deidentified before our analysis for this article. This study followed the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/cheers/">CHEERS</ext-link>) reporting guideline. The study was conducted from April 15, 2016, to March 29, 2018.</p>

Incremental health effects across strategies were driven by strategy-specific levels of LDL-C level reductions, which affected the risk of cardiovascular disease events in the model and were ultimately associated with the differences in the quality-adjusted life expectancies across strategies. Incremental costs across strategies were primarily driven by strategy-specific incentive payments and cost differences from averted cardiovascular disease events.</p>

                <p>The full description and validation of the CVD PREDICT Model have been published elsewhere.<sup><xref rid="zoi180113r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> The CVD PREDICT model is an individual-level state-transition (ie, a microsimulation) model with the following general disease states: disease free, coronary heart disease (divided into myocardial infarction, angina, and cardiac arrest health states), and stroke. Individuals in the model in cardiovascular disease states experience higher mortality risks, lower quality of life, and higher costs relative to those in the disease-free health state. Individuals can experience multiple cardiovascular disease events in the model, which have added acute and chronic health and cost outcomes. The risk of experiencing cardiovascular disease events depends on traditional risk factors (age, sex, smoking status, diabetes history, blood pressure level, cholesterol level, and prior cardiovascular disease history) with further adjustments for treatment status.</p>
                <p>The model was populated by weighted sampling (with replacement) of individuals from the 2005-2006, 2007-2008, 2009-2010, and 2011-2012 NHANES surveys subset for the Asch et al<sup><xref rid="zoi180113r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> trial eligibility criteria: history of cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, angina, or stroke) with LDL-C level greater than 120 mg/dL (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0259) (high-risk participants), history of diabetes with LDL-C level greater than 120 mg/dL (also considered high-risk participants), 10-year coronary heart disease risk greater than 20%, or 10-year coronary heart disease risk greater than 10% with LDL-C level greater than 140 mg/dL (medium-risk participants). All individuals with a history of cancer were excluded.<sup><xref rid="zoi180113r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup></p>
                <p>The CVD PREDICT Model is an individual-level state transition model (ie, a microsimulation model) programmed in Visual C++ 2005 (Microsoft Corp) that uses yearly model cycles. The model updated cardiovascular risk factors (age, total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, systolic blood pressure, and diabetes status) using previously developed regressions based on NHANES data.<sup><xref rid="zoi180113r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> These risk factors were used to estimate the annual risks of cardiovascular disease events (coronary heart disease [cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction, angina] and stroke). These events had acute (ie, 1-year) and postacute (ie, all subsequent years) mortality, morbidity, and health care costs.</p>

In the Asch et al study, patients received electronic pill bottles and LDL-C levels were monitored quarterly for 12 months. Patients in the patient- or shared-incentives arm were eligible for daily lottery-based financial payments if they adhered to their statin medications as monitored by the electronic pill bottles ($1022 maximum annual payment). Physicians in the physician-incentives arm were eligible for financial payments ($1024 maximum annual payment) if their patients met LDL-C level targets (individual levels reduced by 10 mg/dL from previous quarter, LDL-C level &lt;100 mg/dL in high-risk patients, or LDL-C level &lt;130 mg/dL in medium-risk patients). The shared-incentives intervention included the physician and patient financial payments set at half the levels in the patient-only and physician-only arms.</p>
                <p>The trial control group did not include performance-based financial incentives but did include use of the electronic pill bottles and 4 annual lipid measurements, which is a higher level of monitoring than is standard (1 annual lipid measurement for patients receiving statins). Therefore, we included in our analysis a virtual control group in which individuals did not experience additional changes in cardiovascular risk outside of the usual annual risk factor updates that occur in the background of the CVD PREDICT Model (some of these individuals would also be taking statins, based on national averages and adherence). These risk factor updates were included for all strategies evaluated in the cost-effectiveness analysis.</p>

                <p>We translated trial-based LDL-C level reductions for each incentive strategy to a cardiovascular risk reduction in the CVD PREDICT Model.<sup><xref rid="zoi180113r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> The Asch et al<sup><xref rid="zoi180113r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> trial deployed incentive payments for 12 months and found sustained LDL-C level reductions at 15 months in all 4 arms 3 months after incentives stopped. We used the observed 15-month LDL-C level reductions to long-term cardiovascular disease risk reductions in our model, which we assumed to wane over time. Specifically, when varying the duration of LDL-C level reduction, we assumed a linear decline of LDL-C level reduction from the end of the first year of the model to a future year (2-30 years) with corresponding adjustments to relative risks for coronary heart disease and stroke. We used a 10-year waning period in our base-case analysis, based on the 10-year decline of treatment outcome for secondary end points (weight, waist circumference, and glycated hemoglobin levels) from the Look AHEAD trial.<sup><xref rid="zoi180113r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup></p>
                <p>We tested the association between this assumption and cost-effectiveness results in sensitivity analyses. LDL-C level reductions 15 months from baseline in the Asch et al<sup><xref rid="zoi180113r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> trial ranged from 25.4 mg/dL for the trial control group to 33.0 mg/dL in the shared-incentives group; these absolute LDL-C level reductions were approximately normally distributed among trial participants. In the model-based analyses, we drew individual-level LDL-C level reductions from these normal distributions and converted them to relative risks for coronary heart disease (0.77 per 38.7-mg/dL reduction) and stroke (0.83 per 38.7-mg/dL reduction) based on a large meta-analysis of statin trials.<sup><xref rid="zoi180113r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> These relative risks were used to update annual risks of coronary heart disease and stroke in the microsimulation model.</p>
                <p>In summary, our model assumes that patients in the virtual control strategy had status quo cardiovascular disease risk, calculated from the risk factors in the NHANES sample used to populate the model cohort, and all other strategies had lowered cardiovascular disease risk based on strategy-specific levels of LDL-C level reductions.</p>

We used nonparametric bootstrapping of the primary data from the Asch et al<sup><xref rid="zoi180113r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> trial to generate 1000 replicates of arm-specific LDL-C level reduction mean (SD) values for the probabilistic sensitivity analysis. The CVD PREDICT Model was programmed in Visual C++ 2005 (Microsoft Corp).</p>

The model population had similar mean (SD) age (61.5 [11.9] years), LDL-C level (153.9 mg/dL), and 10-year coronary heart disease risk (19.2%) as the observed trial population (n = 1503 [42.7% women]; 62.0 [8.7] years; 160.6 mg/dL; and 19.8%, respectively). Compared with the observed trial population, our model population was less likely to include women, African American individuals, or those with a history of coronary heart disease. Model population characteristics were similar using other subset criteria (2013 ACC-AHA cholesterol treatment guidelines or over-weighting individuals with history of coronary heart disease<sup><xref rid="zoi180113r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>).</p>

                <p>The virtual control group had fewer lifetime discounted QALYs and higher lifetime discounted costs compared with all other strategies evaluated in the base-case cost-effectiveness analysis (ie, the virtual control group was strongly dominated). Costs for the virtual control group were higher than other strategies because of lower cost offsets from fewer averted cardiovascular disease events (average lifetime cardiovascular disease incidence of 55.7%) compared with the other strategies (incidence range, 54.5%-54.9%). The patient- and physician-incentive strategies were strongly dominated (more QALYs and lower costs than the shared-incentives strategy) and weakly dominated (higher ICER than the shared-incentives strategy, which was more effective). Compared with the trial control group, the shared-incentives strategy resulted in 0.013 more per-person lifetime discounted QALYs and $807 higher costs, resulting in an ICER of $60 000/QALY. <xref rid="zoi180113t2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> reports all of the base-case cost-effectiveness analysis results.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>In our model-based incremental cost-effectiveness analysis, we found that financial incentives shared between physicians and patients for LDL-C level control produced intermediate value ($60 000/QALY) as defined by the ACC-AHA value framework (ICER $50 000-150 000/QALY) compared with strategies that included financial incentives to either patients or physicians alone and compared with clinical strategies that did not include financial incentives.<sup><xref rid="zoi180113r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="zoi180113r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> These base-case results were cost-effective given current US benchmarks for cost-effectiveness (threshold of $100 000/QALY or $150 000/QALY), but these results were sensitive to the duration of the LDL-C level reduction beyond the intervention.</p>
              <p>Our base-case analysis assumed a 10-year LDL-C level reduction with linear waning based largely on the Look AHEAD trial, which was the only related trial (for an incentives or lifestyle intervention) that had long-term follow-up (11.5 years) for a shorter-term intervention (6 months to 4 years).<sup><xref rid="zoi180113r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> A 2012 review by Jeffery<sup><xref rid="zoi180113r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> found that sustained weight loss after financial incentive interventions has been poor, although these studies have typically not been as long (12-month intervention) with their follow-up (3 months) as the Asch et al<sup><xref rid="zoi180113r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> trial. The long-run duration of LDL-C level reductions could affect the cost-effectiveness of the shared-incentives strategy. If LDL-C level reductions persisted, with linear waning, for 7 years, the ICER remained below $100 000/QALY and if they persisted for 5 years, the ICER remained below $150 000/QALY. The Asch et al trial followed up patients an additional 3 months after the 12-month intervention was stopped and found no change in the LDL-C level reductions. If these reductions do not wane over time, the shared-incentives strategy had a low ICER ($5900/QALY).</p>
              <p>Previous model-based studies have found that statin regimen initiation in eligible individuals (with 10-year cardiovascular disease risk &gt;7.5%, which is a lower-risk group than the population evaluated in this study) met conventional cost-effectiveness standards using generic statin prices.<sup><xref rid="zoi180113r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="zoi180113r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> Poor medication adherence remains a challenge, however, driven by patient-, physician-, and system-related factors.<sup><xref rid="zoi180113r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Our study shows that shared financial incentives could be a cost-effective intervention to improve cholesterol level control among high-risk patients. The use of more advanced technologies to guide statin initiation (eg, coronary artery calcium level scoring or genetic test information) or treat high cholesterol levels (eg, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors) have been found to exceed conventional cost-effectiveness thresholds (ICERs &gt;$150 000/QALY).<sup><xref rid="zoi180113r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="zoi180113r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="zoi180113r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> Because statins are effective, inexpensive at generic prices, and relatively safe, the most cost-effective interventions in cholesterol management will be strategies that improve medication adherence.<sup><xref rid="zoi180113r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup></p>
              <sec id="H2-11-ZOI180113">
                <title>Limitations and Strengths</title>
                <p>Our study has several limitations. First, the model extrapolates the observed findings from the Asch et al<sup><xref rid="zoi180113r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> trial into future years, in addition to background changes in cardiovascular disease risk factors. These assumptions are needed to generate lifetime estimates of QALYs and costs (the recommended time horizon for cost-effectiveness analyses) and are common for model-based cost-effectiveness analyses based on typical clinical trial follow-up (eg, 12 months).<sup><xref rid="zoi180113r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="zoi180113r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="zoi180113r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> We therefore focused our sensitivity analyses on assumptions, such as the duration of LDL-C level reductions, on which projections of trial results are dependent. Second, the findings from the Asch et al trial were from a selected population and might have been more optimistic than results that could be expected in practice owing to observer effects and other deviations from routine care. Those effects, however, likely also apply to the control group in the Asch et al trial and so the net effect is likely to be small and the direction of such bias is hard to estimate.</p>
                <p>Third, we performed our analysis from a health care payer perspective. From a societal perspective, incentives payments would be viewed as transfer costs (money changing hands without resource use), which would result in more favorable ICERs for the incentive strategies. Because payers will ultimately decide whether to implement pay-for-performance programs, we used a payer perspective in our study. Fourth, the per-person QALY differences were small, but so were the corresponding cost differences, thus requiring a cost-effectiveness analysis to weigh these trade-offs. On a population level, these differences would translate to important health and cost outcomes given the national prevalence of the targeted population. Fifth, financial incentive policies can lead to gaming and other distortive behaviors. We modeled these effects to the extent that they were captured in the Asch et al<sup><xref rid="zoi180113r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> trial, but we did not model any additional adjustments given the lack of data in the published literature to quantify these effects.</p>
                <p>This study also has strengths. Our model incorporated original data from a large prospective trial, it was based on credible assumptions about the effects drawn from a larger amount of literature and a comprehensive meta-analysis, it was executed through a validated cardiovascular disease simulation model, and its findings are largely sustained through extensive sensitivity analyses. Given both the promise of the intervention and the importance of duration of LDL-C level reductions on our model-based results, we believe a large-scale demonstration for the shared-incentives strategy with at least 5 years of follow-up is warranted by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services or private health care payers to test this strategy in a real-world setting.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>Our cost-effectiveness analysis answered an important residual question from the Asch et al<sup><xref rid="zoi180113r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> trial: were the LDL-C level reductions produced by financial incentives shared between physicians and patients worth the added incentive and utilization costs? Our model-based analyses showed that financial incentives shared between patients and physicians for LDL-C level control met conventional standards of cost-effectiveness. However, these results were sensitive to assumptions about the durations of LDL-C level reductions and years of intervention costs included, prompting the need for a larger, longer-term, real-world demonstration to assess the likelihood that a shared-incentives strategy could be adopted and shown to be effective on a widespread basis.</p>
