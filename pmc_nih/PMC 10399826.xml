                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Low-resourced settings often lack personnel and infrastructure for alcohol use disorder treatment. We culturally adapted a Brief Negotiational Interview (BNI) for Emergency Department injury patients, the “Punguza Pombe Kwa Afya Yako (PPKAY)” (“Reduce Alcohol For Your Health”) in Tanzania. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of a pragmatic randomized adaptive controlled trial of the PPKAY intervention.</p>

                  <title>Materials and methods</title>
                  <p>This feasibility trial piloted a single-blind, parallel, adaptive, and multi-stage, block-randomized controlled trial, which will subsequently be used to determine the most effective intervention, with or without text message booster, to reduce alcohol use among injury patients. We reported our feasibility pilot study using the <italic toggle="yes">Reach</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Effectiveness</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Adoption</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Implementation</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Maintenance</italic> (RE-AIM) framework, with recruitment and retention rates being our primary and secondary outcomes. We enrolled adult patients seeking care for an acute injury at the Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Center in Tanzania if they (1) exhibited an Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT) ≥8, (2) disclosed alcohol use prior to injury, or (3) had a breathalyzer ≥0.0 on arrival. <italic toggle="yes">Intervention</italic> arms were usual care (UC), PPKAY, PPKAY with standard text booster, or a PPKAY with a personalized text booster.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Overall, 181 patients were screened and 75 enrolled with 80% 6-week, 82.7% 3-month and 84% 6-month follow-up rates showing appropriate <italic toggle="yes">Reach</italic> and retention. <italic toggle="yes">Adoption</italic> measures showed an overwhelmingly positive patient acceptance with 100% of patients perceiving a positive impact on their behavior. The <italic toggle="yes">Implementation</italic> and trial processes were performed with high rates of PPKAY fidelity (76%) and SMS delivery (74%). Intervention nurses believed <italic toggle="yes">Maintenance</italic> and sustainability of this 30-minute, low-cost intervention and adaptive clinical trial were feasible.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>Our intervention and trial design are feasible and acceptable, have evidence of good fidelity, and did not show problematic deviations in protocol. Results suggest support for undertaking a full trial to evaluate the effectiveness of the PPKAY, a nurse-driven BNI in a low-income country.</p>

Alcohol consumption and the resulting disease burden is highest among low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) [<xref rid="pone.0288458.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], where the consequences of harmful and hazardous alcohol use contribute to inequity between and within countries [<xref rid="pone.0288458.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The WHO African Region has a 20% higher daily alcohol consumption among drinkers than the global average [<xref rid="pone.0288458.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Tanzania reports a higher annual alcohol consumption per capita at 9.4L compared to the WHO African Region annual average of 6.4L [<xref rid="pone.0288458.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Within Tanzania, studies have shown a high prevalence of hazardous alcohol use, particularly associated with lower socioeconomic status, unemployment, and male sex [<xref rid="pone.0288458.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0288458.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The prevalence of alcohol use is further higher in the Kilimanjaro region than that in other regions in Northern Tanzania, possibly due to differences in reporting behavior, socioeconomic status, or cultural and tribal practices [<xref rid="pone.0288458.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0288458.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p>
              <p>Treatment of alcohol use disorders in LMICs, where it exists, has been focused on long-term residential treatment centers with limited overall efficacy and no evidence for moderate alcohol users with harmful or hazardous drinking [<xref rid="pone.0288458.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0288458.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Benegal et al. suggest an overall step-wise implementation of alcohol interventions, starting with opportunistic screening and brief advice and progressing to other, more complex treatment options [<xref rid="pone.0288458.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Efficacious and cost-effective interventions are needed to reduce the alcohol-related burden in LMICs, and especially in low-income settings where these interventions are nearly absent [<xref rid="pone.0288458.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. A recent review found that 21 randomized, controlled trials have been conducted in 15 different LMICs between 1992 and 2018 with 86% of them employing motivational interviewing (MI) interventions, primarily in primary care settings [<xref rid="pone.0288458.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Only two of these studies enrolled participants from an emergency department, both of which used MI principles but vastly different interventions and did not compare MI to usual care. Segatto et al. compared a MI against an educational pamphlet control group [<xref rid="pone.0288458.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. While Sorsdahl and colleagues focused on a MI-Problem Solving combination treatment and thus was likely not powered to evaluate the MI only arm [<xref rid="pone.0288458.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Overall, more research is needed in low-income settings, especially in EDs where acute complications of alcohol can be leveraged to motivate behavior change.</p>
              <p>A recent Cochrane review demonstrated moderate evidence that brief interventions (BI) can reduce alcohol consumption in primary care or emergency care settings for harmful and hazardous drinkers with no adverse effects, while longer interventions had little additional effect [<xref rid="pone.0288458.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. A myriad of other high-income country (HIC) studies have shown that a BI administered specifically in an emergency department setting can reduce harmful alcohol use and its consequences up to 12 months post-injury [<xref rid="pone.0288458.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0288458.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and decrease the incidence of trauma recidivism [<xref rid="pone.0288458.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Brief negotiational interviews (BNIs) are a specific form of brief intervention that seek to help individuals who demonstrate risky alcohol use to identify and change their behavior by discussing personal motivations in a short interview [<xref rid="pone.0288458.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0288458.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. While not intended for those with severe substance dependence, BNIs serve as a useful tool for moderating risky behaviors and can be administered by non-addiction specialized personnel [<xref rid="pone.0288458.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0288458.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p>
              <p>BNIs could be incredibly useful treatments in low-resource settings, but the current optimal implementation strategy for the African injury population is unknown. BI studies in Africa have reported a range of effectiveness and are focused around specific subsets of the population [<xref rid="pone.0288458.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0288458.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. There is also controversy around the best implementation strategy for a BI, such as the usefulness of boosters that serve as scheduled reminders post-BNI [<xref rid="pone.0288458.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0288458.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and the integration of mobile health technology for LMICs [<xref rid="pone.0288458.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0288458.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Specifically, a Cochrane review found moderate evidence that digital interventions can reduce alcohol use by up to three standard units per week compared to control, which, given the low cost, can be quite beneficial in lower-resource settings [<xref rid="pone.0288458.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Some studies have even explored the use of a personalized booster, created from information obtained in the original BI, in increasing the success of the intervention with limited additional costs [<xref rid="pone.0288458.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0288458.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p>
              <p>“Punguza Pombe Kwa Afya Yako” (PPKAY)/ “Reduce Alcohol for Your Health” is a BNI created and piloted at the Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre in Moshi, Tanzania. PPKAY was based upon US-based BNI standards [<xref rid="pone.0288458.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and adapted to Swahili and the Tanzanian environment [<xref rid="pone.0288458.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0288458.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The effectiveness evaluation of this intervention will be with a future Pragmatic Randomized Adaptive Clinical Trial (PRACT) to determine if 1) BNI reduces alcohol-related harms at 3 months compared to usual care; 2) a standard SMS booster will improve the effectiveness of the PPKAY intervention; and 3) a personalized SMS booster is further effective than PPKAY with standard booster or PPKAY alone.</p>
              <p>This study aims to assess the feasibility of our future PRACT at Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre in Moshi, Tanzania. Feasibility outcomes include recruitment rates, retention rates and acceptability of the intervention. The RE-AIM framework was used to report recruitment and retention rates, adoption and acceptability, uptake by clinical staff, implementation processes, and sustainability of the intervention [<xref rid="pone.0288458.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p>

                <title>PRACT feasibility study design</title>
                <p>PRACT is a three-stage single-blind parallel adaptive randomized controlled trial. Stage 1 compares usual care (UC) to PPKAY or PPKAY with standard booster through a 1:1:1 allocation with a 12-block randomization. Stage 2 removes the usual care arm but continues enrollment in the other two arms at a 1:1 allocation with a 12-block randomization. Stage 3 continues the most effective arm from Stage 2 and allocates additional participants into the most effective arm and a new arm—PPKAY with a personalized booster. Additional participants are to be enrolled at a 1:4 allocation with 12-block randomization into the Stage 3 intervention arms. This adaptive method allows us to answer multiple successive questions with streamlined enrollment and processes; thus enrolling fewer patients in the fully powered trial than if we used three successive clinical trials. While for the future PRACT, all adaptations are planned to reach predetermined significance through interim analyses, the adaptations for this feasibility trial were triggered by enrollment numbers determined <italic toggle="yes">a priori</italic>
<bold>(<xref rid="pone.0288458.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>)</bold>. Our processes of proceeding to the next stage mirrored our planned processes for the future PRACT. Similarly, as this is a feasibility study, stopping guidelines were not created and power considerations were not taken into account.</p>

Located in Moshi, Tanzania, KCMC serves as the regional referral center for the Kilimanjaro Region, and the emergency department (ED) typically sees around 2,000 injury patients annually [<xref rid="pone.0288458.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Of the adult injury patients who seek care in the KCMC ED, about 30% have a positive alcohol status upon arrival [<xref rid="pone.0288458.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The KCMC ED reports a higher proportion of injury patients testing positive for alcohol compared to neighboring Mozambique (17%) [<xref rid="pone.0288458.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], with alcohol use being associated with a 6-times increased risk of road traffic injury [<xref rid="pone.0288458.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. While rates of alcohol use are high, few testing and treatment resources exist [<xref rid="pone.0288458.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In the KCMC community, mobile health technology is widely available, and a few other mobile health–based interventions have been successful focusing on vaccination [<xref rid="pone.0288458.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], medication adherence [<xref rid="pone.0288458.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0288458.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], and counseling for different health services [<xref rid="pone.0288458.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0288458.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p>

                <p>Our pre-screening process identified adult patients (≥18 years of age) who were seeking initial care at the KCMC ED for an acute (&lt;24 hours) injury regardless of gender. Of these patients, those who were not clinically intoxicated and who were capable of providing consent were offered informed consent. Patients who were intoxicated or too ill to provide consent were reassessed after 24 hours to determine capacity. Intoxication was determined clinically by the treating physician. During informed consent, three research nurses fully explained each study arm and the SMS text procedures to ensure that participants understood and were able to address any issues prior to providing consent. Written informed consent was obtained to test for alcohol consumption and for study participation. Patients were included in the study if they 1) disclosed alcohol use prior to injury, 2) scored ≥8 on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), or 3) tested positive (&gt;0.00 g/dL) by breathalyzer. Participants remained eligible for recruitment even if they were found to have an AUDIT score &gt;20, suggesting a severe alcohol use disorder (AUD). As there were no other treatment options, denying study participation to those with severe AUD was considered unethical. Participants were excluded if they did not speak Swahili, were too ill or otherwise unable to communicate, did not have an SMS-capable phone, or if they declined informed consent.</p>

During the enrollment process, at least two phone numbers were identified and tested for follow-up contact. Nurses maintained contact with patients during the follow-up period by making phone calls to schedule follow-up assessments in advance. When needed, interviewers traveled to patients, provided financial compensation for travel expenses, or conducted surveys by phone.</p>

                <title>Randomization</title>
                <p>Prior to study initiation, unblinded research personnel used computer software to randomize study identification numbers into 3 groups (UC, PPKAY, and PPKAY with Standard Booster) for Stage 1; 2 groups for Stage 2 (PPKAY or PPKAY with Standard Booster); and 2 groups for Stage 3 (the best performing arm in Stage 2 or PPKAY with Personalized Booster). We utilized block randomization for all three stages without any further restrictions. We chose a 12-block randomization to keep block size consistent through each stage, which allowed enrollment of even numbers of patients in each arm over the course of enrollment to reduce potential biases given the alcohol use differences per week, month, season or during holidays.</p>

                <title>Sample size</title>
                <p>This feasibility study was created to pilot our adaptive trial methods and our study protocol; a sample size was determined based on feasibility of these methods not as a power analysis for effectiveness testing. Sample size for our feasibility enrollment was to mimic our trial allocation on a smaller scale, and pilot the adaptation process between stages. We included at least 10 participants in each arm to test intervention/allocation protocols. Since this trial was aimed at assessing feasibility and was not powered to detect statistical differences in performance of each arm, we continued the PPKAY with the Standard Booster arm in Stage 3 according to hypothesized superiority.</p>

                <title>Allocation concealment and blinding</title>
                <p>Allocation was concealed in order to avoid selection bias. Enrollment packets were placed in sealed opaque envelopes of equal size and thickness and locked in a drawer at the study site. Each envelope contained one paper denoting the random group assignment for each participant. Paper enrollment packets and data collection sheets were maintained to ensure reproducibility.</p>
                <p>The future PRACT and this feasibility study are single-blind studies; our outcome assessors were blinded to participant allocation. We have established a protocol where one research team member performs initial and final outcome assessments while a nurse obtains the randomization packet and performs the corresponding intervention.</p>

                  <title>PPKAY</title>
                  <p>PPKAY is a nurse-administered, 5–30 minutes BNI based on “SBIRT Educational Toolkit”’ using the FRAMES motivational interviewing techniques [<xref rid="pone.0288458.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0288458.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. This is a four-step discussion: 1) raise the subject of alcohol, 2) provide feedback, 3) enhance motivation, 4) negotiate and advise. PPKAY was culturally adapted based on quantitative and qualitative data from the Swahili-speaking KCMC injury population [<xref rid="pone.0288458.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Prior to feasibility trial enrollment, PPKAY was iteratively improved and reassessed by Tanzanian nurse counselors who evaluated the cultural appropriateness and the adherence to the tenants of BNI and motivational interviewing.</p>
                  <p>The PI, or a delegate trained by the PI, reviewed PPKAY training protocol documents on the FRAMES motivational interviewing technique to train nurses. Mock interviews were completed after training to prepare the nurses to deliver this tool appropriately. Nurses conducted pre-intervention screening with our locally validated AUDIT tool, alcohol use questions, and breathalyzer testing [<xref rid="pone.0288458.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. They approached patients and asked permission to raise the subject of alcohol and discuss their current alcohol use compared with local and international safe use guidelines. Next, nurses assessed the patient’s readiness to change with a (0–10) readiness-to-change ruler, adapted to Swahili and the local context through iterative research based on nurse content evaluation and comprehension assessments. They then identified a patient’s specific reasons for changing behavior (social, family, financial, etc.) and compared it with their Readiness Ruler response, highlighting self-efficacy and personal capacity for behavior change. Finally, they negotiated a reduction in alcohol use, optimally lower than safe use guidelines. At the close of the PPKAY, the provider thanked the patient for their openness in discussing alcohol, promoting self-efficacy, and fostering a positive patient–provider relationship.</p>

                  <p>Patients allocated to PPKAY with Standard Booster underwent the same PPKAY process listed above. Patients provided a phone number where they could be reached, and, prior to patient discharge, this cell phone was tested by the study team to ensure it was working.

After completing the PPKAY, nurses used the PPKAY content, specifically the person’s unique reasons for change, to complete <italic toggle="yes">a priori</italic> established outlined texts. These texts were entered into our text message system by the researchers on the day of PPKAY and were kept for evaluation by the research team to review at the weekly quality control meetings.

                  <p>Our pragmatic goals included understanding the benefit of PPKAY compared to the current standard practice or usual care (UC). In the UC study arm, patients did not receive any discussion or instructions on alcohol or alcohol reduction, feedback on their AUDIT scores, or the PPKAY intervention. Patients only received normal discharge instructions pertaining to their injury and were not contacted by research staff, except for follow-up visits.</p>
                  <p>All patients in our feasibility trial are followed up on the same follow-up schedule at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months.

                  <title>Effectiveness</title>
                  <p>To demonstrate a potential positive effect (benefit) and limited negative effect (risk), we collected outcome measures corresponding to the future PRACT. The primary outcome measure was the number of binge drinking days with secondary outcomes being Drinker Inventory of Consequences (DrInC) score [<xref rid="pone.0288458.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0288458.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], quantity and frequency of alcohol use, and AUDIT score [<xref rid="pone.0288458.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0288458.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. All quantitative data were reported in standard drinks, where one standard drink is equal to roughly 14 grams of pure alcohol. The research team is extensively trained in the collection of alcohol use data, including the number and size of alcohol containers, and the types of alcohol to determine the approximate grams of absolute alcohol or ‘standard drink’ [<xref rid="pone.0288458.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. For ‘home brew’, alcohol content can be incredibly variable from 2% to 20% alcohol by volume and increases with shelf-life. As such, we estimated 5% alcohol by volume and container sizes that are typical for the region [<xref rid="pone.0288458.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. We were not able to pursue objective (e.g., assay testing) outcome verification given availability, cost, and feasibility limitations. Potential negative effects included increased alcohol use or potential loss of confidentiality associated with the intervention. However, it is important to note the aim of the current study was to assess the feasibility of the intervention and not the effectiveness with respect to clinical outcomes.</p>

During this discussion, after informed consent, nurses were asked about the complexity of the intervention, eagerness to administer PPKAY, and workload. The focus group sessions were audio recorded and transcribed. We used inductive coding to understand the nurses’ perceptions about the overall trial protocol, patient and nurse acceptability of the intervention, trial process feasibility and fidelity, and perceived impact of the intervention.</p>

Other pragmatic trials on alcohol harm reduction strategies, especially in Emergency Departments, have exhibited limited intervention fidelity [<xref rid="pone.0288458.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. As such, we incorporated an intervention fidelity evaluation and quality improvement (QI) process. In prior work, our team adapted and validated the BI Assessment Scale [<xref rid="pone.0288458.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] to the Tanzanian setting. It has good psychometric properties including inter- and intra-rater reliability with Kappa and ICC values above 0.80 and a strong ability to differentiate standard PPKAY sessions with poorly performed PPKAY sessions. During our study, we audio-recorded the interventions so that they could be evaluated weekly by bilingual researchers to determine adherence to the intervention plan using our validated scale. For QI, a Swahili-speaking researcher listened to recordings of each intervention, graded it on the BI Assessment Scale and provided nurses with feedback to improve future interventions. Regular debriefing meetings were held with the study team to discuss the process of intervention implementation. Similarly, our SMS booster intervention arms were evaluated to determine intervention fidelity; we evaluated whether text messages were sent and why some messages were unable to be delivered. We obtained some patient responses to our text boosters which were translated and a thematic analysis was performed.</p>

                <p>As seen in <bold><xref rid="pone.0288458.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref></bold>, there was a decrease in the DrInC and the AUDIT score across all groups from baseline to 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months. Although a pilot, at 6-month, participants in the intervention groups showed a higher decrease in average DRINC and AUDIT scores than the usual care group. We also assessed for any potential negative effects of the interventions, including whether increased drinking was observed in any participants or whether confidentiality was lost at any point in the study, and none were observed.</p>

                  <p>In total, 44 patients were supposed to receive 25 messages over 6 months, but due to a staff communication error, texts were only sent for 3 months or 12 messages or 528 total texts. We had 3 participants who left prior to their intervention and therefore were not enrolled in the SMS text system; therefore, we would expect 492 texts attempted. Our system demonstrated a total of 258 texts (52% of expected) were attempted by the end of the 3-month follow-up period. This difference highlighted the need for more close weekly monitoring of our SMS system. No further understanding of this process was found during the feasibility trial but informed our processes for the full trial. Seventy-four percent of attempted texts were registered as sent through the messaging system. This send rate was found to be equal across each intervention arm. Of the text messages that failed delivery, most were not delivered because the participant traveled outside of cellular coverage or had their phone off, prohibiting delivery. Our only protocol deviation was termination of SMS text messages at 3 months post-intervention rather than 6 months post-intervention due to limited communication.</p>

              <p>To our knowledge, this is the first feasibility study of an adaptive clinical trial evaluating a culturally adapted brief negotiational interview for injury patients in a low income setting. While BNI has been studied and shown to successfully reduce alcohol-related harms in numerous HIC studies [<xref rid="pone.0288458.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] and in LMIC [<xref rid="pone.0288458.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], this is the first study to examine the feasibility of conducting such a trial in a low-income country—Tanzania. We used the RE-AIM framework as a way to synthesize our results, which demonstrated successful trial feasibility, including good recruitment and retention, high intervention fidelity, and high rates of patient and provider acceptability. Overall, these findings indicate that a full PRACT trial could be successfully conducted in the future. Similarly, we found a positive trend of the PPKAY being effective at reducing alcohol-related harms.</p>

                  <title>Reach</title>
                  <p>Our study population primarily consisted of healthy men. This is because injuries and alcohol use are primarily observed among men in this setting. The study demographic is expected based on prior studies [<xref rid="pone.0288458.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0288458.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. While young healthy men seen in an ED are traditionally a difficult population for follow-up, our enrollment rates were relatively high (41%, 75 of 181 screened) compared to Sorsdahl’s ED-based brief intervention clinical trials (12%, 335 of 2736) in South Africa [<xref rid="pone.0288458.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Similarly, our 6-month follow-up rate at 84% is promising when compared to Sorsdahl’s South African trial, where 54% completed 3-month follow-up [<xref rid="pone.0288458.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], or Segatto’s 85.2% 3-month follow-up in Brazil [<xref rid="pone.0288458.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Activities described in the methods section may have contributed to high rates of follow-up. Additionally, SMS messages may have reminded assigned individuals of their ongoing participation in the trial, perhaps contributing to their willingness to continue participation.</p>

                  <title>Trial processes</title>
                  <p>A traditional approach to investigating an intervention implementation package would include multiple, successive randomized clinical trials, each with specific research questions requiring significant time and financial resources [<xref rid="pone.0288458.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Our project aims to use an adaptive trial to show effectiveness over usual care while ensuring that most patients can receive this potentially beneficial intervention. Similarly, our innovative PRACT highlights the strengths of an adaptive trial using an adaptive method during the preliminary phases where we expect a large effect size, but not during the final phase where we expect to find smaller effect sizes. While adaptive clinical trials are gaining popularity, they have rarely been used in behavioral science or global health. It is in these arenas where these methods would be most advantageous to expedite the process of discovery. Given our goal to use adaptive methods, conducting a feasibility trial to pilot our methods and processes was critical to the trial’s success. Our analyses found that improving communication for our multi-national team and organization and pre-planning for our blinding and randomization processes are paramount; but it also showed these processes are feasible in our setting, as we had only minimal protocol deviations.</p>

                  <p>Challenges to intervention feasibility identified in HIC settings have mainly included sustainability concepts. Concerns surround limited nursing staff time to conduct the intervention, especially in a busy ED, and perception of preparedness to discuss harm reduction strategies with participants [<xref rid="pone.0288458.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Interviews conducted with nursing staff in our feasibility trial indicated that BNI would not add excessive burden to their commitments. Our nurses also believed the training they received was sufficient, and that other counselors would be ready to conduct the intervention with the same training. The PPKAY intervention was highly accepted by both nurses and patients. Nurses reported that they were eager to administer the intervention and indicated that patients received the PPKAY positively. Patients reported benefits from both the standard booster and personalized booster. Both nurses and patients responded positively to PPKAY, potentially due to familiarity. After efficacy testing, widespread dissemination of this protocol should consider champions on the ground to foster strong familiarity and continue positivity.</p>

                  <title>Efficacy</title>
                  <p>This study found that the PPKAY had a self-reported positive impact on the behavior of all participants. While this trial was not powered to determine an effect size, we were able to see a signal of change among the intervention groups. Hence, we are optimistic of the impact of this intervention, especially given the overwhelmingly positive feedback we received about the patient acceptability of the intervention and preliminary findings. Given our preliminary efficacy findings, there is a strong potential in a longer-term intervention to reduce alcohol-related harms in the Tanzanian injury population.</p>
                  <p>Previously, studies examining the feasibility and efficacy of SMS message boosters in BIs for alcohol use have taken place in HICs [<xref rid="pone.0288458.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0288458.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>], but evidence is lacking on their use in LMICs, such as Tanzania. This study showed high intervention fidelity with the added ability of mobile health technology integration. With high rates of deliverable SMS messages, nurse acceptability, and successful quality improvement actions, a pragmatic trial using SMS messages appears feasible. Our only protocol deviation occurred with a communication error where SMS were sent for 3 months after enrollment rather than 6 months post-enrollment. Otherwise, each step of our pilot intervention occurred smoothly, without placing extra burdens on the research and nursing staff conducting the study. Our innovative and previously untested SMS booster functioned well, required low maintenance, and was implemented easily. Since we experienced so few difficulties implementing the BNI and SMS interventions, we believe a pragmatic trial will also be able to be performed successfully.</p>

                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p>This study serves as an initial feasibility trial, and thus carries limitations within the study design in terms of size, scope, and generalizability. Given that this was a preliminary study, the sample size was not powered to determine an effect size for outcomes. Thus, the clinical significance of results must be cautiously interpreted. In terms of generalizability, it is important to consider the demographic and patient profile of this study, and that the results are likely not relevant to higher-income country settings. It is possible that our participant population does not fully reach individuals in the lowest income categories since participants included in this study must have mobile phone access, and the financial resources and ability to reach ED. That said, this is a pragmatic trial at a regional trauma center where free referrals from other public clinics and free care can be provided, and is intended to serve as a proof of concept pragmatic effectiveness trial. We found exceptionally high rates of patient and provider acceptability of the PPKAY and SMS messages. It is important to note, however, that response bias is possible given that interviews were conducted by the study PI, the research nursing staff’s employer. In an attempt to address this potential bias, nursing staff were asked directly about the specific barriers they faced during enrollment, randomization, and follow-up stages.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>This feasibility trial demonstrated successful recruitment, enrollment, and follow-up in a pilot pragmatic randomized adaptive clinical trial (PRACT) of a nurse-led BNI aimed at reducing harmful alcohol use in a low-income country emergency department. Integration of SMS mobile health technology was also shown to be feasible and acceptable in this population. These promising results recommend a full-scale trial to determine the effectiveness of PPKAY BNI with SMS booster in reducing harmful alcohol use.</p>

              <p>Dear Dr. Staton,</p>
              <p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE, and for revising the manuscript in response to the reviews for the previous submission of this work. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE’s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.<!-- </div> --><!-- <div> --> <!-- </div> --><!-- <div> -->This submission has been evaluated by three reviewers whose comments are included below. Please address all of the reviewers' comments (except Reviewer 1, point 1) through revisions to your manuscript and in a Response to Reviewers document.<!-- </div> --><!-- <div> --> <!-- </div> --><!-- <div> -->Reviewer 1's first comment raised, "Authors have mentioned that the aim of the study is to assess the feasibility however the title of study mentions it as randomized controlled trial." As your title clearly identifies the study as a feasibility study, you can disregard this comment.<!-- </div> --><!-- <div> --> <!-- </div> --><!-- <div> -->You addressed a sample size calculation query in your Response to Reviewers section, and this issue was again raised for the current submission, by Reviewer 2. From your Response to Reviewers comments it is my understanding that you did not do a formal sample size calculation for this study. In the Sample Size section of the Methods, please clarify the approach taken in deciding upon the sample size (i.e. the rationale for the group sizes used), and transparently state whether a formal sample size calculation was not performed. Also, please discuss this issue in the Limitations section in the context of the references cited by Reviewer 2 for the prior submission and Reviewer 2 for the current submission.<!-- </div> --><!-- <div> --> <!-- </div> --><!-- <div> -->In the Response to Reviewers you explained that there were differences between the original approved study protocol, manuscript, and Clinical Trials registry for this study. Please add a section to the Methods section that discusses any changes from the original approved protocol; explains any discrepancies between the manuscript, original protocol, and registry; and notes if/when any changes were approved by the IRB. <!-- </div> --><!-- <div> --> <!-- </div> --><!-- <div> -->Please submit your revised manuscript by Nov 22 2022 11:59PM.

              <p>Reviewer #1: Dear Author,</p>
              <p>The manuscript has covered feasibility of important intervention in low resource setting. There are some major and minor comments which need to be addressed before it can be considered for the publication.</p>
              <p>1. Major comments: Authors have mentioned that the aim of the study is to assess the feasibility however the title of study mentions it as randomized controlled trial which is inherently supposed to measure effectiveness of the intervention vis a vis control group. So authors must do statistical analysis to see if there is any significant or non significant differences in outcome measures using non-parametric tests since the sample size may not be enough for parametric tests. Otherwise it would be wrong to refer the present manuscript as RCT. The paper can be best described as feasibility study and not RCT. So please update results sections to compare outcome measures accordingly. The findings should also be discussed later.</p>
              <p>2. Results section does not mention about findings of 15 questions in a post-</p>
              <p>treatment survey/interview and 5 questions about satisfaction</p>
              <p>3. The trial has higher retention rate, the reason for higher retention rate should be highlighted (e.g. home visits by investigators, financial incentives given to the project staff and number of times follow up calls were attempted. All these issues are important when intervention is used in the clinical setting</p>
              <p>4. The authors have not mentioned what treatment was offered for patients with alcohol use disorders, any psychiatrist consultation was sent ?, referred to outpatient department for management of the problem?</p>
              <p>5. The timing of intervention is ranged between 5 minutes to 30 minutes. It is important to mention average time of intervention. As this raises question about fidelity of intervention. It will be goo to mention number of nursing professionals who were involved in delivery of intervention, any family members involved as some patient may be brought by law enforcement agencies while some may brought by family members. Involvement of family members are likely to impact outcome measures.</p>
              <p>6. Discussion section need to be expanded to discuss the findings in reference to available literature from the region. Also clinical implications of the study if any.</p>
              <p>Regards,</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: The mansucript explores feasibility of a pragmatic randomized adaptive controlled trial of the PPKAY intervention among subjects recruited in Tanzania. The study objectives are clearly stated; the authors proposed a block-randomized controlled trial. In future, the effectiveness of the intervention will be assessed via a pragmatic randomized adaptive trial. My comments are as follows:</p>
              <p>1. I still think a sample size/power statement would make the approach more rigorous. Just stating that someone included 10 participants in each arm do not make a strong case. Samples sizes for pilot/feasibility studies are requested; see below:</p>

              </p>
              <p>Also, the 3-stage design as proposed is not so trivial.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: 1. The data appear to support the conclusions regarding the feasibility to conduct a large scale trial. What stood out for me was just how well received this feasibility study was to both patients and providers. When I saw in the limitations that the study PI was the providers boss then I think that may explain the positive views from the staff and is therefore quite a large limitation. I think this would seriously need consideration in the planning of a future trial as staff may be less receptive in other settings. Especially if it can take 30 minutes to deliver the intervention in some cases. I think the paper should include some discussion of challenges that may occur in a large scale trial that would take place across multiple settings as it does come across as overly positive</p>
              <p>2. The statistics appear sound, but as I am not a trial statistician I think another reviewer may be better placed to comment here.</p>
              <p>3. The author stated that the data can not be made fully available due to privacy concerns. Perhaps some further information could be provided here, is it not possible to anonymise the data?</p>
              <p>4. The article is well written and I like how it is organised around the RE_AIM framework. A couple of points:</p>
              <p>Page 38/68 (page 8 of manuscript) - Is there a reference for where you adapted the tools culturally using data? It would be good to include the reference here again if so</p>
              <p>Page39/68 (page 9) - How did they train nurses in the intervention delivery? I noticed that as part of fidelity checks nurses were evaluated on how they delivered the intervention according to protocol and that the discussion reports that they were satisfied with the training - but it would be good to see in the methods how you trained them. Although brief, this is a behavioural change intervention that would require a certain standard of training that ideally should be described in the paper for replication purposes and also evaluated in order to see if the nurses are capable of delivering the intervention to protocol.</p>
              <p>P9 - "Unusual care" heading - did you mean Usual care?!</p>
              <p>p10 - Is home brew common in this region? If it is then this may make it difficult to estimate consumption in a larger study</p>
              <p>p12 - Table 3 - I think there is a typo here and it should say Farmer instead of Famer</p>

              <p>Reviewer Comments: </p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: Dear Author,</p>
              <p>The manuscript has covered feasibility of important intervention in low resource setting. There are some major and minor comments which need to be addressed before it can be considered for the publication.</p>
              <p>1. Major comments: Authors have mentioned that the aim of the study is to assess the feasibility however the title of study mentions it as randomized controlled trial which is inherently supposed to measure effectiveness of the intervention vis a vis control group. So authors must do statistical analysis to see if there is any significant or non significant differences in outcome measures using non-parametric tests since the sample size may not be enough for parametric tests. Otherwise it would be wrong to refer the present manuscript as RCT. The paper can be best described as feasibility study and not RCT. So please update results sections to compare outcome measures accordingly. The findings should also be discussed later.</p>
              <p>Thank you for this feedback. This is a feasibility study and therefore are reporting the feasibility on how to conduct this trial. Our future trial will report sample size and statistical analysis for our efficacy testing analyses. </p>
              <p>2. Results section does not mention about findings of 15 questions in a post-</p>
              <p>treatment survey/interview and 5 questions about satisfaction</p>
              <p>Thank you for this feedback. Responses to these questions have been included in the results according to the topic of feasibility. </p>
              <p>3. The trial has higher retention rate, the reason for higher retention rate should be highlighted (e.g. home visits by investigators, financial incentives given to the project staff and number of times follow up calls were attempted). All these issues are important when intervention is used in the clinical setting.</p>
              <p>Thank you for this feedback. Yes, we have a high retention rate in our studies due to our very proactive process in following our patients. This is a locally relevant process which we have not specifically identified because it is very site dependent. We have addressed the activities supporting our high retention rate in the discussion section.</p>
              <p>4. The authors have not mentioned what treatment was offered for patients with alcohol use disorders, any psychiatrist consultation was sent ? referred to outpatient department for management of the problem?</p>
              <p>Thank you for this feedback. Our treatment was a standard SBIRT with screening, brief intervention with our adapted version of the BNI called the PPKAY: Punguza Pombe Kwa Afya Yako. Only method of treatment at the time was the screening, brief intervention. </p>
              <p>5. The timing of intervention is ranged between 5 minutes to 30 minutes. It is important to mention average time of intervention. As this raises question about fidelity of intervention. It will be good to mention number of nursing professionals who were involved in delivery of intervention, any family members involved as some patient may be brought by law enforcement agencies while some may brought by family members. Involvement of family members are likely to impact outcome measures. Reasons-- </p>
              <p>Thank you for this feedback. Fidelity of this intervention was measured by reviewing audio-recorded versions of the intervention and rating it on the BI assessment checklist to ensure nurses were completing desired components of the intervention. Feedback was then provided to the nurses for future interventions. Fidelity was not measured on time given 5-30 minute intervention was dependent on patient responses, not questions asked. </p>
              <p>An update was made in the paper to note three research nurses performed the intervention to ensure consistency. No family members were involved at this point of the feasibility trial due to stigma. Prisoners were unable to participate. </p>
              <p>6. Discussion section need to be expanded to discuss the findings in reference to available literature from the region. Also clinical implications of the study if any.</p>
              <p>Thank you for this feedback. A sentence was added to include a systematic review of brief interventions in LMIC to connect to literature from the region. No clinical implications since the study is is a feasibility pilot. The implication of this study is that the trial seems feasible and should be performed. </p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: </p>
              <p>The manuscript explores the feasibility of a pragmatic randomized adaptive controlled trial of the PPKAY intervention among subjects recruited in Tanzania.

              </p>
              <p>Also, the 3-stage design as proposed is not so trivial.</p>
              <p>Thank you for this feedback. We included 10 participants in each allocated arm to ensure at least 20 participants at each stage. The study included a total of 70 participants (table 2). We used this method to replicate the average potential enrollment per week. Ensured this was addressed in sample size section. </p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: </p>
              <p>1. The data appear to support the conclusions regarding the feasibility to conduct a large scale trial.

I think the paper should include some discussion of challenges that may occur in a large scale trial that would take place across multiple settings as it does come across as overly positive.</p>
              <p>Thank you for this feedback. A sentence was added to the paper to discuss the potential impact of familiarity on positivity and consider including champions to address widespread dissemination challenges and maintain positivity. </p>
              <p>2. The statistics appear sound, but as I am not a trial statistician I think another reviewer may be better placed to comment here.</p>
              <p>Thank you. </p>
              <p>3. The author stated that the data can not be made fully available due to privacy concerns. Perhaps some further information could be provided here, is it not possible to anonymize the datakjh</p>
              <p>Thank you for this comment. The data is available with appropriate ethical consideration. Data can be obtained through regulatory Tanzanian data transfer .</p>
              <p>4. The article is well written and I like how it is organized around the RE_AIM framework. A couple of points: Page 38/68 (page 8 of manuscript) - Is there a reference for where you adapted the tools culturally using data? It would be good to include the reference here again if so</p>
              <p>Thank you for this comment. The paper is currently under review in another journal, but a reference was added. </p>
              <p>Page39/68 (page 9) - How did they train nurses in the intervention delivery? I noticed that as part of fidelity checks, nurses were evaluated on how they delivered the intervention according to protocol and that the discussion reports that they were satisfied with the training - but it would be good to see in the methods how you trained them.

              <p>Thank you for this feedback. Information on how nurses were trained was added. </p>
              <p>P9 - "Unusual care" heading - did you mean Usual care?!</p>
              <p>Thank you for this feedback. The heading was changed to usual care. </p>
              <p>p10 - Is home brew common in this region? If it is then this may make it difficult to estimate consumption in a larger study.</p>
              <p>Thank you for this comment. Homebrew is common in this region, and we have researched to determine standard drink size in the region. We can estimate a culturally relevant amount at the same and different time frames. Ensured this was addressed in the paper. </p>
              <p>p12 - Table 3 - I think there is a typo here and it should say Farmer instead of Famer</p>
              <p>Thank you for this feedback. Famer was changed to Farmer.</p>

              <p>The <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.plosone.org/static/policies.action#sharing" ext-link-type="uri">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data—e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party—those must be specified.<!-- </font> --></p>
