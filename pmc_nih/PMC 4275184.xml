              <abstract>
                <p>Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is an alternative or adjunct therapy to treat chronic pain, a prevalent and clinically challenging condition. Although SCS has substantial clinical success, the therapy is still prone to failures, including lead breakage, lead migration, and poor pain relief. The goal of this study was to develop a computational model of SCS and use the model to compare activation of neural elements during intradural and extradural electrode placement. We constructed five patient-specific models of SCS. Stimulation thresholds predicted by the model were compared to stimulation thresholds measured intraoperatively, and we used these models to quantify the efficiency and selectivity of intradural and extradural SCS. Intradural placement dramatically increased stimulation efficiency and reduced the power required to stimulate the dorsal columns by more than 90%. Intradural placement also increased selectivity, allowing activation of a greater proportion of dorsal column fibers before spread of activation to dorsal root fibers, as well as more selective activation of individual dermatomes at different lateral deviations from the midline. Further, the results suggest that current electrode designs used for extradural SCS are not optimal for intradural SCS, and a novel azimuthal tripolar design increased stimulation selectivity, even beyond that achieved with an intradural paddle array. Increased stimulation efficiency is expected to increase the battery life of implantable pulse generators, increase the recharge interval of rechargeable implantable pulse generators, and potentially reduce stimulator volume. The greater selectivity of intradural stimulation may improve the success rate of SCS by mitigating the sensitivity of pain relief to malpositioning of the electrode. The outcome of this effort is a better quantitative understanding of how intradural electrode placement can potentially increase the selectivity and efficiency of SCS, which, in turn, provides predictions that can be tested in future clinical studies assessing the potential therapeutic benefits of intradural SCS.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Chronic pain is a prevalent and clinically challenging condition for which there are often not adequate treatments. For example, chronic low back pain has a lifetime prevalence between 11â84% <xref rid="pone.0114938-Walker1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, is the most common cause of lost time due to disability <xref rid="pone.0114938-Simpson1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, and imposes an annual economic burden of â¼$20â$120 billion <xref rid="pone.0114938-Dagenais1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Standard treatments for chronic pain, such as physical rehabilitation, pharmaceuticals (e.g., opioids), and surgery work for some individuals; but for others who do not receive satisfactory pain relief from standard treatments, alternative approaches are required.</p>
              <p>Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is an alternative or adjunct therapy for treating chronic pain <xref rid="pone.0114938-Bell1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, where an implanted pulse generator delivers electrical pulses to an electrode array placed in the epidural/extradural space. SCS is FDA approved for treating chronic low back and limb pain, including complex regional pains syndromes I and II and failed-back surgery syndrome <xref rid="pone.0114938-Taylor1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, and it is currently being investigated for other chronic pain conditions, including ischemic limb pain, angina, and pain from peripheral neuropathy <xref rid="pone.0114938-Cameron1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0114938-Kumar1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. SCS is based on the gate-control theory of pain <xref rid="pone.0114938-Melzack1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, which postulates that activation of cutaneous (AÎ²) nerve fiber collaterals in the posterior/dorsal column (DC) of the spinal cord synaptically inhibits projection neurons in the dorsal horn, which transmit pain-related information to the brain <xref rid="pone.0114938-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Although the gate-control theory is still an incomplete model of pain processing in the spinal cord <xref rid="pone.0114938-Prescott1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0114938-Zhang2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, it predicts well the analgesic effects of SCS <xref rid="pone.0114938-Barolat1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0114938-North1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Activation of AÎ² fibers elicits paresthesia in the corresponding dermatome, and it is generally accepted that SCS requires the evoked paresthesia to overlap the painful area <xref rid="pone.0114938-Al1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p>
              <p>Despite substantial clinical success <xref rid="pone.0114938-Taylor1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0114938-Cameron1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, SCS is still prone to failures: the three most common being lead breakage, lead migration, and the inability to activate the target DC fibers <xref rid="pone.0114938-Cameron1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0114938-Rosenow1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Currently, there are two electrode designs used in SCS: a percutaneous (PERC) design, consisting of 4â8 annular electrodes distributed along a flexible cylindrical shaft, which is inserted with a hypodermic needle; and a laminectomy/paddle design (LAM) implanted during a surgical laminectomy, consisting of a grid of 4â20 rectangular electrodes on a flexible planar substrate. PERC designs are less invasive but more prone to lead migration than LAM designs <xref rid="pone.0114938-Rosenow1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, while LAM designs, although more invasive and prone to fracture <xref rid="pone.0114938-Rosenow1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, are, in practice, more energy efficient and evoke fewer side effects than PERC designs <xref rid="pone.0114938-North2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0114938-Struijk1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.</p>
              <p>Activation of DC fibers in the dermatomes associated with pain is often limited by the onset of discomfort. Since discomfort is associated with activation of nearby AÎ² fibers in the dorsal roots (DR) <xref rid="pone.0114938-Holsheimer1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0114938-Struijk2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, successful SCS is thought to depend on activation of DC fibers without activation of DR fibers, which we term selectivity. Selectivity can be improved using longitudinal (rostral-caudal) and transverse (medial-lateral) bipolar and tripolar electrode configurations <xref rid="pone.0114938-Holsheimer2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0114938-Sankarasubramanian2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, mitigating the sensitivity to malposition or migration of the electrode array. However, there is a limit to selectivity with extradural placement due to the large distance between the electrodes and the neural elements, and the high conductivity of the intervening cerebrospinal fluid.</p>
              <p>The shunting effects of the CSF can be surmounted by placing the electrodes below the dura mater and adjacent to the dorsal aspect of the spinal cord <xref rid="pone.0114938-Howard1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0114938-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Directing less current through the CSF and more through the spinal cord results in a potential distribution with isopotential contours more closely spaced on the side of the electrode facing the spinal cord. As a result, there is a greater difference in the magnitude of the potentials between the DC and DR fiber populations. DR fibers, however, are more excitable than DC fibers of the same diameter because of their curved geometry and entry into the white matter from the CSF, where the tissue conductivity changes drastically <xref rid="pone.0114938-Struijk2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Therefore, if increasing the proximity of the electrode to the spinal cord does not substantially increase the excitability of DR fibers over DC fibers, subdural/intradural SCS may have substantially greater selectivity than extradural SCS.</p>
              <p>Intradural electrode placement was used when SCS devices were first implanted in humans. Because intradural electrodes are more prone to movement than extradural electrodes, and because the first electrodes had a limited number of contacts, adjustments following implantation were difficult <xref rid="pone.0114938-Long1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Moreover, multi-level laminectomies and large dural openings introduced additional risks, including exposure to general anesthesia, cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) leaks, and increased postoperative pain and tissue scarring <xref rid="pone.0114938-Babu1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. For these reasons, intradural SCS was abandoned. However, with the advent of new techniques <xref rid="pone.0114938-Renard1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> and electrode designs <xref rid="pone.0114938-Howard1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> for addressing movement of the spinal cord and electrode, the possibility of intradural SCS is being revisited.</p>
              <p>The goal of this study was to develop a computational model of SCS. We compared the stimulation thresholds predicted by the model to stimulation thresholds measured intra-operatively and used the model to compare the performances of extradural and intradural SCS. The outcome is a quantitative understanding of how intradural electrode placement can potentially increase the selectivity and efficiency of SCS, which, in turn, provides predictions that can be tested in future clinical studies assessing the potential therapeutic benefits of intradural SCS.</p>

Stimulation waveforms were current-regulated, asymmetric pulses with a short 300 Âµs positive phase followed by a long 700 Âµs negative phase delivered at 60 Hz.</p>
                <p>A staircase paradigm was used to determine sensory and discomfort thresholds. First, a reference for paresthesia was established: the stimulation amplitude (I<sub>A</sub>) was increased in 1 mA increments from 0 mA until the subject reported a sensation (i.e., S), and I<sub>A</sub> was decreased in decrements of 1 mA until S was no longer perceived. The subject was asked to describe orally the location of S. Second, I<sub>A</sub> was increased in 0.1 mA increments until S was reported, defined as I<sub>S1</sub>. Third, I<sub>A</sub> was decreased in 0.1 decrements until S went away, defined as I<sub>S2</sub>. Fourth, I<sub>A</sub> was increased in 0.1 mA increments until S was reported, defined as I<sub>S3</sub>. The sensory threshold was defined as the average of I<sub>S1</sub>, I<sub>S2</sub>, and I<sub>S3</sub>. Finally, I<sub>A</sub> was increased in increments of 0.1 mA until the subject reported discomfort and/or pain, which was defined as the discomfort threshold. As I<sub>A</sub> was increased, the subject was asked to describe orally any additional locations of S.</p>
                <p>After sensory and discomfort thresholds were measured in the extradural case, fluoroscopy was used to place the AD-TECH array within the dura in a fashion similar to insertion of a standard lumber drain catheter, and the array was connected to the external stimulator. As in the extradural case, current-regulation stimulation was delivered at 60 Hz between the two contacts most proximal to T8, and the staircase paradigm was used to determine sensory and discomfort thresholds.</p>

                <p>Patient-specific models were evaluated at nine different electrode locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114938-g002">Fig. 2b</xref>): three extradural locations 1 mm above the dura, three intradural locations 1 mm below the dura, and three intradural locations 1 mm above the spinal cord, where points one, two, and three in each set had lateral (clockwise) offsets of 0Â°, â10Â°, and â20Â° from the transverse midline, respectively.</p>
                <p>Clinical conditions were emulated by stimulating the model DC and DR fibers with a 300 Âµs monophasic rectangular pulse, consistent with typical pulse widths (175â600 Âµs) used in SCS <xref rid="pone.0114938-Kreis1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. The cathode was proximal to T8, and the distal anode was rostral to the cathode. Due to linearity of the solution, the potentials at a given stimulus amplitude were calculated by multiplying the base (monopolar, bipolar, or tripolar) solution by a scalar. The stimulation threshold voltage for each fiber was calculated using a bisection algorithm (relative error &lt;1%). The stimulation threshold current was calculated by dividing the threshold voltage by <italic>R<sub>a</sub></italic>, and input-output curves of the number of activated model nerve fibers as a function of the stimulation amplitude and stimulation power were constructed.</p>
                <p>The stimulation thresholds of the MRG and SW model fibers were compared to the clinically measured sensory thresholds, when the patient first reported a paresthesia, and the discomfort threshold, when the patient first reported pain or discomfort. We used the following procedure to determine the percentage and diameter of DC fibers that most closely matched the clinical findings. First, for each diameter, we calculated the percentage of DC fibers activated at the sensory and discomfort thresholds. Next, because two hundred model DC fibers were evenly split across 20 laminae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114938-g002">Fig. 2c</xref>), the clinical findings were translated into an expected percent activation by assuming that paresthesia in one dermatome on one side of the body corresponded to activation of 5% of the modeled DC fibers. The DC fiber population (of a given diameter) that best matched clinical findings was defined as the one whose percent activation at the clinical thresholds most closely matched the expected percent activation based on the number of dermatomes reported at the clinical thresholds.</p>
                <p>The model of SCS was used to quantify the efficiency and selectivity of stimulation. Stimulation efficiency was quantified by calculating the average electrical power (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0114938.e003">Equation 3</xref>) consumed during the stimulation pulse to activate the target DC fibers:<disp-formula id="pone.0114938.e003"><graphic xlink:href="pone.0114938.e003.jpg" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/><label>(3)</label></disp-formula>where <italic>V(t)</italic> is the applied voltage, and <italic>PW</italic> is the duration of the rectangular pulse.</p>
                <p>Selectivity was quantified using two different metrics: neural-element selectivity was analyzed by calculating the percent of DC fibers activated with no activation of DR fibers (DC<sub>0</sub>) or with activation of a certain percentage (X) of DR fibers (DC<sub>X</sub>), and dermatome selectivity was analyzed by determining if DC fibers in target dermatomes could be activated without activation of DC fibers in non-target dermatomes. Since the computational models were based on data from patients receiving SCS for the treatment of chronic low back pain, we chose the low back dermatomes, L2âL5, to assess dermatome selectivity.</p>

                <p>TTs are believed to have greater selectivity than LTs because their distal anodes hyperpolarize the DR fibers, termed anodal shielding <xref rid="pone.0114938-Struijk1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0114938-Sankarasubramanian1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0114938-Sankarasubramanian2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. However, we believed that the superior selectivity of TTs over LTs arose from their ability to steer current away from DR fibers so that the potentials decayed more rapidly with increasing distance from the cathode. To test this, we modeled a fifth tripolar design, a percutaneous azimuthal array in an angular tripolar (AT) configuration, which had a cathode adjacent to the dorsomedial aspect of the spinal cord and anodes that directed current away from the cord, toward the dorsal aspect of the dura (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114938-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). The performance of all five designs was assessed with the each electrode array placed along the transverse midline, extradurally 1 mm above the dura mater and intradurally 1 mm above spinal cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114938-g002">Fig. 2b</xref>).</p>

For all diameters except 3 Âµm (pâ=â0.03), the distributions of the percentage of DC fiber activated at the discomfort and sensory thresholds across patients were not significantly different, and for all fiber diameters, there was no significant difference between the distributions of the percentage of DC and DR fibers activated at the discomfort thresholds.</p>

In general, the stimulation thresholds predicted by the SW model were greater than the stimulation thresholds predicted by the MRG model, so compared to the MRG model, the SW model predicted that DC fibers with larger diameters were activated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114938-g006">Fig. 6</xref>).</p>

To account for this uncertainty in what constitutes discomfort, we constructed curves of the proportion of DR fibers activated versus proportions of the DC fibers activated (<italic>i.e.,</italic> DC<sub>X</sub>).

                <p>Since the AT had the greatest neural-element selectivity in the intradural case, we also assessed its ability to activate selectively DC fibers in the lateral dermatomes.

In SCS for the treatment of chronic low back pain, the target dermatomes are typically L2âL5, thus the AT had the greatest selectivity in targeting the low back dermatomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114938-g009">Fig. 9b</xref>).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>We developed a computational model of SCS and quantified the efficiency and selectivity of different electrode designs placed either extradurally or intradurally. Intradural placement dramatically increased stimulation efficiency and reduced the power required to stimulate the dorsal columns by more than 90%. Intradural placement also enabled activation of a greater proportion of dorsal column fibers before spread of activation to dorsal roots and produced more selective activation of individual dermatomes at different lateral positions. The results suggest that present electrode designs used for extradural SCS are not optimal for intradural SCS, and a novel azimuthal tripolar design increased stimulation selectivity, even beyond that achieved with an intradural paddle array in TT configurations. Increased stimulation power efficiency is expected to increase the battery lives of implantable pulse generators (IPGs), increase the recharge intervals of rechargeable IPGs, and potentially reduce IPG volume. The greater stimulation selectivity with intradural placement may improve the success rate of SCS by mitigating the sensitivity of pain relief to malpositioning of the electrode.</p>

However, across these five models, there was no clear distinction of either the diameter or proportion of AÎ² fiber activation that correlated best with the sensory and discomfort thresholds of the patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114938-g005">Fig. 5</xref>).</p>
                <p>Myelinated fibers in the gracilis fasciculus and cuneatus fasciculus at T3 have diameters ranging from 1â15 Âµm, with â¼60% between 1 and 3 Âµm <xref rid="pone.0114938-Hggqvist1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>; and myelinated fibers in the gracilis fasciculus at T5 have diameters ranging from 1â7 Âµm, with the majority between 2 and 3 Âµm <xref rid="pone.0114938-Ohnishi1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. Prior models of extradural SCS showed that DC fibers with diameters &gt;9.4 Âµm were activated between measured sensory and discomfort thresholds <xref rid="pone.0114938-Holsheimer1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, and activation of large DC fibers with a diameter of 12 Âµm, which constitute &lt;0.5% of all DC fibers <xref rid="pone.0114938-Feirabend1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, best matched measured sensory thresholds <xref rid="pone.0114938-Holsheimer1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0114938-Struijk2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. The results of our study corroborated these prior findings in some patients (e.g., Patient 1), depending on the choice of axon model, but in the other patients (e.g., Patient 5), the results suggest that DC fibers with diameters as small as 3 Âµm are also activated at the sensory threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114938-g005">Figs. 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114938-g006">6</xref>).</p>
                <p>The discrepancy between our results and previous findings may be explained by the choice of axon model. Prior models of extradural SCS used a simplified SW model of a mammalian nerve fiber with perfectly insulating myelin <xref rid="pone.0114938-Struijk1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0114938-Sankarasubramanian2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0114938-Struijk3" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0114938-Holsheimer3" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0114938-Struijk4" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, whereas we used a more detailed MRG axon model that better replicates the excitability of mammalian nerve fibers <xref rid="pone.0114938-McIntyre1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. The SW model overestimated stimulation thresholds compared to the MRG model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114938-g006">Fig. 6</xref>), possibly explaining why prior modeling studies concluded that DC fibers with diameters &gt;9 Âµm are the therapeutic targets of SCS.</p>
                <p>The present results provide an alternate interpretation of which DC fibers are the potential therapeutic targets of SCS. Although it is possible that activation of one (or a few) 12 Âµm DC fibers is sufficient to evoke paresthesia <xref rid="pone.0114938-Holsheimer1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, the results suggest that paresthesia induction requires activation of a larger proportion of DC fibers with diameters as small as 3 Âµm. Resolving these two possible interpretations will require more closely matching patient-specific models with the experimental conditions. For example, the presence of interstitial fluid and blood around the electrode and the distance and orientation of the stimulating array with respect to spinal cord will influence thresholds, and thereby influence the assessment of which AÎ² fiber diameters are activated at sensory and discomfort thresholds. In addition, patient-to-patient variability in sensorimotor and pain networks (<italic>i.e.,</italic> variability in the reporter) could influence threshold sensations.</p>
                <p>Additionally, the clinical results provide an alternate interpretation of which neural elements are responsible for discomfort. Due to the relatively low stimulation thresholds of fibers entering the DR <xref rid="pone.0114938-Struijk2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, discomfort is often associated with segmental motor reflexes <xref rid="pone.0114938-Dimitrijevic1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref> and/or uncomfortable sensations <xref rid="pone.0114938-Nashold1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref> that arise from stimulation of Ia and AÎ² fibers in the DR, respectively. In our study, only Patients 3 and 5 reported discomfort in T8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114938-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). Although the results cannot address where discomfort occurred or what were the qualities of discomfort, they provide evidence that discomfort can be associated with activation of AÎ² fibers in both target and non-target dermatomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114938-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). Further, a percent increase in activation of model DC fibers was not able to explain the onset of discomfort, so other mechanisms may be required to explain discomfort. For example, discomfort may arise from stimulation of other neural elements in the DC, such as ascending nociceptive fibers or descending fibers from the brain <xref rid="pone.0114938-Davidoff1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>, or supra-threshold depolarization of AÎ² fibers, which can result in a volley of action potentials per stimulation pulse, rather than a single action potential <xref rid="pone.0114938-Brumberg1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>.</p>

LAM designs are less prone to migration than PERC designs <xref rid="pone.0114938-Rosenow1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, and they compress the dural sac, reducing the distance between the electrodes and the spinal cord, which improves selectivity <xref rid="pone.0114938-Holsheimer3" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0114938-Holsheimer4" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>.</p>
                <p>Our results corroborate the predictions of previous extradural SCS studies.

However, the distributions of the extradural DC<sub>0</sub> of the six electrode designs across patients were not significantly different from each other, indicating that patient-to-patient variability in spinal anatomy can significantly impact the performance of the electrode. In the intradural case, the relationship between energy requirements and IES did not change, but each design had greater selectivity than the corresponding extradural case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114938-g008">Figs. 8a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114938-g010">10a</xref>). Therefore, not only is selectivity increased with increasing proximity to the dorsal aspect of the spinal cord, but selectivity with intradural placement is less sensitive to patient anatomical variations.</p>
                <p>The AT electrode design had the greatest selectivity in the intradural case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114938-g010">Fig. 10</xref>). To understand why the AT performed best, we examined the centered second difference of the extracellular potentials (Î<sup>2</sup>Î¦) across the model fibers for each electrode design, as Î<sup>2</sup>Î¦ is proportional to the source driving membrane polarization <xref rid="pone.0114938-Rattay1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>. Across all six designs, Î<sup>2</sup>Î¦ across DC fibers had the same stereotypical triphasic shape, including a primary positive (depolarizing) lobe flanked by two smaller negative (hyperpolarizing) lobes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114938-g011">Fig. 11a</xref>). All six designs also generated a triphasic Î<sup>2</sup>Î¦ across DR fibers, except at the boundary between the CSF and the white matter, where the discontinuity in conductivity created discontinuity in Î<sup>2</sup>Î¦ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114938-g011">Fig. 11a</xref>), which was expected <xref rid="pone.0114938-Holsheimer1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Since no marked differences in the shape of Î<sup>2</sup>Î¦ between the designs were observed, we conclude that the superior selectivity of the AT arose from its ability to steer current away from the spinal cord so that Î<sup>2</sup>Î¦ decayed more rapidly with distance than it did with the LB, LT, and TT configurations. In other words, the difference in Î<sup>2</sup>Î¦ between the DC and DR fibers was greatest with the AT electrode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114938-g011">Fig. 11b</xref>).</p>

                <p>In addition to efficiency and selectivity, additional factors, such as risk and cost, should also be considered when comparing the performance of PERC and LAM designs. PERC arrays are less invasive than LAM arrays: the former are inserted using a percutaneous needle, while the latter require multi-level laminectomies for placement. Further, compared to LAM arrays, PERC arrays are less prone to fracture <xref rid="pone.0114938-Rosenow1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> and may be less damaging <xref rid="pone.0114938-Babu1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, as the tissue response depends on electrode size <xref rid="pone.0114938-Szarowski1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>. In regards to practical limitations, PERC arrays are more prone to migration and movement than LAM arrays <xref rid="pone.0114938-Rosenow1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0114938-Villavicencio1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>. For example, rotating the AT byÂ±10Â°, Â±20Â°, andÂ±30Â° about its longitudinal axis reduced the DC<sub>0</sub> from 80% to 73%, 58%, and 47.5%, respectively. Reductions in pain relief that result from lead migration or movement are problematic because they may lead to greater reoperation rates to replace or reposition the lead <xref rid="pone.0114938-Babu1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Despite these differences, the long-term health-care costs were similar between the PERC and LAM arrays <xref rid="pone.0114938-Babu1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.</p>

                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p>Two important limitations of the models used in this study require consideration. First we ignored the branching collaterals of the AÎ² (DC) fibers. As the AÎ² fibers ascend the spinal cord to the gracile and cuneate nuclei in the brainstem, they project smaller diameter collaterals to neurons within the grey matter of the spinal cord <xref rid="pone.0114938-Cajal1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>. This branching can reduce stimulation thresholds by up to 50% in SW models of DC fibers <xref rid="pone.0114938-Struijk4" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, and the stimulation thresholds reported in the present study may therefore be overestimated.</p>
                <p>The second limitation was ignoring the presence and properties of the electrode-tissue interface (ETI). The filtering effects of the ETI have not been studied in SCS, but they have been studied in electrical stimulation of the brain <xref rid="pone.0114938-Butson1" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0114938-Wei1" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref>. The ETI, which is typically modeled as the parallel combination of a distributed resistor and a distributed capacitor, has a time constant on the order milliseconds. Because typical pulse widths for SCS range from 175â600 Âµs, the ETI is expected to charge by an appreciable amount during the stimulus pulse, increasing the dynamic load on the stimulator. The rate at which the dynamic load increases depends on the electrical properties of the ETI and tissue, which depend on electrode geometry. Thus, representation of the ETI is recommended for future studies comparing the efficiency of SCS electrode designs.</p>
                <p>In addition to model limitations, this study was also limited by experimental variability in the clinical study. Sources of uncertainty included variability in electrode placement and position and variability in the experimental conditions. For example, in Patient 1, intradural stimulation thresholds were assessed before extradural stimulation thresholds, while the order was reversed in Patients 2â5. Because the dura of Patient 1 was punctured before extradural assessment, leakage of CSF might explain why the extradural clinical thresholds of Patient 1 were smaller than those of Patients 2â5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114938-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). Experimental variability can be reduced in future studies by standardizing all aspects of the clinical procedure and using intraoperative fluoroscopy images to determine more accurately the position of the electrode during stimulation.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>The present study used a computational model of SCS to evaluate quantitatively the performance of intradural SCS for treating chronic pain. Intradural electrode placement markedly reduced energy consumption and improved selectivity of activation of DC fibers in both medial and lateral dermatomes without co-activation of DR fibers. Further, the results suggest that DC fibers with diameters as small as 3 Âµm are activated within the therapeutic range of SCS parameters, challenging the notion that only DC fibers with diameters &gt;9 Âµm are activated in SCS. More anatomical studies are needed to characterize better the distribution of fiber diameters within the DC so that subsequent modeling studies can more accurately quantify the population of AÎ² fibers that correspond to evoking paresthesia and discomfort; and long-term clinical studies are needed to test the predications of our model, understand better the percentage and diameter of neural elements that correspond to comfortable and uncomfortable sensations, and assess the potential therapeutic benefits of intradural SCS.</p>
