                <p id="Par1">The primary cannabinoid in cannabis, Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), causes intoxication and impaired function, with implications for traffic, workplace, and other situational safety risks. There are currently no evidence-based methods to detect cannabis-impaired driving, and current field sobriety tests with gold-standard, drug recognition evaluations are resource-intensive and may be prone to bias. This study evaluated the capability of a simple, portable imaging method to accurately detect individuals with THC impairment. In this double-blind, randomized, cross-over study, 169 cannabis users, aged 18–55 years, underwent functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) before and after receiving oral THC and placebo, at study visits one week apart. Impairment was defined by convergent classification by consensus clinical ratings and an algorithm based on post-dose tachycardia and self-rated “high.” Our primary outcome, prefrontal cortex (PFC) oxygenated hemoglobin concentration (HbO), was increased after THC only in participants operationalized as impaired, independent of THC dose. ML models using fNIRS time course features and connectivity matrices identified impairment with 76.4% accuracy, 69.8% positive predictive value (PPV), and 10% false-positive rate using convergent classification as ground truth, which exceeded Drug Recognition Evaluator-conducted expanded field sobriety examination (67.8% accuracy, 35.4% PPV, and 35.4% false-positive rate). These findings demonstrate that PFC response activation patterns and connectivity produce a neural signature of impairment, and that PFC signal, measured with fNIRS, can be used as a sole input to ML models to objectively determine impairment from THC intoxication at the individual level. Future work is warranted to determine the specificity of this classifier to acute THC impairment.</p>

              <p id="Par3">Intoxication with Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the psychoactive ingredient in cannabis, impairs cognitive and psychomotor performance, impairs driving, and at least doubles the risk of fatal motor vehicle crashes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. A pre-specified THC metabolite concentration in body fluids as a proxy for intoxication or impairment is still used in many parts of the US, analogous to blood alcohol concentration limits, but this is prone to false-positive results. THC metabolites can remain in the bloodstream for weeks after last use, long after the period of intoxication is over [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and does not correlate well with impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Accordingly, THC or THC metabolite concentrations in the breath or body fluids are unlikely to yield an accurate, reliable test of impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In the absence of an accurate biometric, impairment due to cannabis intoxication has been measured and defined legally in many places using an enhanced field sobriety test (eFST) during traffic stops [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, the eFST has been reported to be insensitive to oral THC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and prone to false positive bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The need for an objective, reliable method to detect impairment due to THC is well recognized in view of the absence of a reliable, objective, quantitative, biological test for impairment due to acute cannabis intoxication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The present study assesses a brain-based method for determining impairment as an alternative to eFSTs.</p>
              <p id="Par4">Neural states of impairment from intoxicating substances, including cannabis, are poorly understood. As cannabinoid 1 (CB<sub>1</sub>) receptors, the main target of Δ9-THC, the primary intoxicating cannabinoid in cannabis, are densely localized within the fronto-limbic circuit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], prefrontal brain regions are key locations to examine brain changes that characterize impaired clinical states associated with acute intoxication. THC increases dopamine release via activation of presynaptic CB1 receptors in the ventral tegmental area, via GABAergic and glutamatergic terminals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], resulting in less functional connectivity in the mesocorticolimbic circuit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and increased connectivity (via increased glutamatergic signaling) in the prefrontal cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Indeed, neuroimaging studies have shown that THC exposure activates fronto-striatal reward circuitry, including the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], and acute administration of THC increases perfusion (as assessed with arterial spin labeling) in prefrontal areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par5">Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), a noninvasive and inexpensive method for assessing oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO) response, can be easily used to query the PFC. We previously reported that activation-induced changes in cerebral HbO concentration were significantly altered by THC intoxication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Participants who reported intoxication after oral THC, compared with those reporting low or no intoxication after oral THC, had greater fNIRS-detected prefrontal cortical (PFC) oxygenated HbO response during an n-back working memory task [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], suggesting that a neural activity signature, detectable with portable brain imaging, may characterize THC intoxication. To date, neuroimaging studies of the effect of THC on brain function have focused on THC exposure rather than impairment associated with acute intoxication from THC. Further, neuroimaging studies have compared group-level differences in brain states (e.g. THC vs placebo), with no study to date examining individual brain scans to determine impairment.</p>
              <p id="Par6">Here, we aimed to better understand the brain state of impairment due to THC intoxication rather than the effect of THC exposure only and to use individual-level data and standard machine learning (ML) techniques to develop a diagnostic classification tool for THC impairment. To do so, we conducted a double-blind, cross-over study, randomized for order, of the effect of a single, individualized dose of synthetic THC designed to produce intoxication and identical placebo, approximately 1 week apart, in regular cannabis users, on PFC hemodynamics during the N-back working memory task using a 20-channel fNIRS probe (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>) with one fNIRS scan before and two fNIRS scans following study drug at each study visit. A temporal feature-based ML model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>) and a recurrent neural network (RNN) connectivity ML model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>) were developed and used both separately and combined to classify individual participants as impaired or not clearly impaired from THC. Ground truth impairment, for the purpose of identifying fNIRS scans to be used in building the ML models, was operationalized as post-dose scans conducted when participants were (1) rated as impaired by two clinical raters, using all but fNIRS data, and (2) identified by an algorithm using physiologic (heart rate) and psychologic (self-rating of intoxication) inputs to discriminate those impaired following THC from not impaired following THC and placebo with a low false positive rate (FPR).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Design of probe and machine learning models.</title><p><bold>A</bold> The continuous wave near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) machine was used to measure changes in oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO) and deoxygenated hemoglobin (deoxy-Hb). The NIRS probe comprised of eight sources (red) and seven detectors (yellow) placed over the prefrontal brain region (forehead) of each participant. The mid-column of the probe was placed over Fpz, with the lowest probes located along the F5-Fp1-Fpz-Fp2-F6 line, in accordance with the International 10–20 Placement System. The distance between pairs of source and detector probes ranged from 2.5 - 3 cm. The midpoint of the source-detector distance was defined as channel (Ch) location, labeled numerically (1–20) in the above schematic. The channels were grouped into regions of interest, as illustrated in the schematic. We defined five regions on interest (ROIs) based on channel location. These ROIs are middle prefrontal cortex (MPFC, channels 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14); right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (RDLPFC, channels 15, 17, 18); right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (RVLPFC, channels 16, 19, 20); left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (LDLPFC, channels 1, 2, 5); and left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (LVLPFC, channels 3, 4, 6). <bold>B</bold> We extracted 95 numerical values (19 from each of the 5 ROIs): mean HbO values for time segments 0–5, 5–10, 10–15, 15–20, 20–25, 25–30, 30–35, and 35–40 s, slope (5–15 s), skewness (0–15 s), kurtosis (0–15 s), area under the curve (0–15, 15–40 s), time to first and second extremum of HbO, magnitude of first and second extremum of HbO, and average and standard deviation of HbO after the first extremum. We used these 95 predictive features to train XGBoost to predict impairment. <bold>C</bold> We computed pairwise correlations between the HbO concentration change values of all possible channel pairs. We computed dynamic connectivity matrices with sliding windows of 300 time points, and a skip of 100 time points, so that each window corresponded to a small segment of the scan. We then trained an RNN model architecture with the sliding-window correlation matrix feature vector as the input. In this RNN, the core component consisted of fully connected layers that mapped the input to a latent representation, which in turn fed to a hidden state with recurrent connections. A probabilistic prediction was computed at every time point by applying a fully connected layer to the hidden state. We used tanh for all nonlinearities and implemented a fully connected neural network with 5 hidden layers and 128, 64, 32, and 16 nodes. The output of this model was a fully connected neural net with a single hidden layer of 64 dimensions and consisted of recurrent connections that captured temporal dynamics.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41386_2021_1259_Fig1_HTML" id="d32e560"/></fig></p>

                <p id="Par8">Adults, aged 18–55 years, who reported at least weekly cannabis use in the past 90 days were recruited through advertising in the community in the greater Boston area. Exclusion criteria included a negative urine THC (THC-COOH) screen (20 ng/mL cutoff; Medimpex United Inc., Bensalem, PA, USA), serious medical illness, lifetime history of schizophrenia spectrum or bipolar disorder, current regular use of benzodiazepines or barbiturates, antihistamines, atropine, scopolamine, or other anticholinergic agents, and known allergy to dronabinol or its constituents.</p>

Dronabinol dose was individualized with the goal of producing intoxication at a dose that was well tolerated by each participant up to a maximum of 80 mg, a dose that when given three times per day has been reported to be safe and generally well tolerated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Dose was determined by taking a history of participants’ usual use pattern and estimated dose when used recreationally, and the decision to allow up to 80 mg dose was chosen to accommodate doses reported by participants while safely producing intoxication. Participants provided a detailed history of cannabis use pattern, approximate dose, route of administration, level of intoxication and adverse effects with various doses. Study staff used this information together with factors including sex and BMI to dose dronabinol for the study with the aim of maximizing the likelihood for intoxication for each individual participant while minimizing adverse effects such as nausea, anxiety, and hemodynamic change (see <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">Supplementary Methods</xref>).</p>

Urine THCCOOH and creatinine concentrations were determined by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry, with the THCCOOH concentration normalized to the creatinine concentration (Dominion Diagnostics, Kingstown, RI, USA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Participants were asked to use no intoxicating substances the morning of the study visit. A qualitative urine drug screen was performed at screening and on each study day assessing for the presence of cannabinoids, opioids, cocaine, and amphetamines, in order to reschedule study visits for those with positive screens for opioids, cocaine, amphetamines. Participants were assessed at the beginning of each study visit. Those who arrived for a study visit with clinical signs of intoxication were rescheduled.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par30">This study replicates literature from fMRI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], PET [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], EEG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], and ASL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] studies showing increased activation of the PFC after THC exposure, and extends this literature by showing that such activation is specific to the state of acute THC impairment. Further, we demonstrate that standard ML methods, using PFC fNIRS measurements during a simple memory task, can distinguish individual participants who are impaired due to THC intoxication from those who are not clearly impaired or only mildly intoxicated, with high accuracy.</p>
              <p id="Par31">At the group level, increased PFC HbO response was observed in participants considered impaired from THC intoxication with concordant clinical consensus and algorithmic approaches and not in those rated not clearly impaired by this method following THC or placebo. PFC HbO response similarly distinguished participants who rated themselves as feeling quite intoxicated from those rating themselves less high following THC and following placebo. These findings suggest PFC activation is a marker for acute THC intoxication itself, rather than for recent exposure of a similar dose of THC that did not result in intoxication or of chronic THC exposure alone. This HbO response alone was used to build an impairment classifier that performed with higher accuracy, 76.4% vs 67.8%, and, importantly, significantly lower FPR, 10.0% vs 35.9%, for impairment than the DRE-administered eFST.</p>
              <p id="Par32">Increased HbO response, observed across all PFC regions in participants impaired following oral THC, may be caused by reduced brain efficiency during acute THC intoxication, such that greater effort is required to complete the simple 2-back working memory task. This pattern is reported in people with schizophrenia and their siblings during working memory tasks and interpreted to represent increased neural effort for normative performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. That we observed increased HbO across the PFC sub-regions, suggests this effect is driven by a global, task-based increase in HbO in the PFC.</p>
              <p id="Par33">fNIRS time series features have been used in ML classifiers of mild cognitive impairment that perform with reported 83% accuracy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], suggesting that an fNIRS imaging approach, using time-course features, may detect biomarkers for such clinical states such as dementia and intoxication. We further showed, using a recurrent neural net that explored dynamic connectivity during the n-back task, that an entirely different ML approach could also accurately classify those who were impaired from THC from those who were not clearly impaired following THC and placebo. Dynamic connectivity is a relatively new method of assessing temporally correlated activation states of discrete brain regions over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], assessing variability in the strength and spatial organization of functional connectivity across brain regions, here across regions of the PFC. Dynamic connectivity is associated with vigilance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], arousal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], and emotional state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Thus, it is not surprising that PFC dynamic connectivity was different in those who were impaired from those who were not clearly impaired following similar THC doses.</p>
              <p id="Par34">There are limitations to this study. Whereas most acute cannabis administration trials use fixed dosing and examine group effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], here we used individually tailored dosing to account for the wide variability in tolerance to cannabis, while aiming to achieve impairment due to intoxication in all participants while minimizing adverse experiences for participants. Future studies could develop pharmacokinetic models for individualized oral cannabis administration that would result in a target exposure, as has been done with alcohol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] or use vaped cannabis which would allow participants to self-titrate their dose to intoxication. Even with flexible dosing, only approximately half of participants achieved such significant intoxication that we were confident that performance in such activities as driving would be impaired. It is worth noting that participants who, even with individualized dosing, did not experience significant intoxication with active study drug were generally heavier users, as suggested by the difference in urine THCCOOH concentration between the impaired and not clearly impaired groups (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). This underscores the idea that for many heavier users who have developed marked tolerance to impairing effects of THC, a low legal cutoff for THC in saliva or blood may not capture impairment as intended.</p>
              <p id="Par35">Second, assessing impairment is challenging, as there is no accepted objective definition of impairment. In this trial, we tried to differentiate mild intoxication that <italic>may not</italic> impair performance (which was seen in nearly all participants) from impairment due to significant intoxication that would almost certainly result in compromised driving ability. We assessed impairment via physiologic signs (heart rate change), self-reported ‘high,’ clinical assessment by study staff, nurses, and physicians who interacted with the participants and the eFST by a trained evaluator. While the eFST classified 21.6% of participants as impaired following placebo dosing, chronic cannabis exposure has been associated with deficits in neurocognitive performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]; these may be mistaken for effects of acute intoxication on the eFST.</p>
              <p id="Par36">Third, since this trial began, effects of cannabis have been shown on with the Digit Symbol Substitution Task (DSST), Divided Attention Task (DAT), and Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task (PASAT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], as well as the DRUID Smartphone/Tablet Application [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Future trials could incorporate these validated tasks into assessments of impairment. The n-back task was chosen here because it is widely used in fNIRS as well as fMRI to reliably activate the PFC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. While those who were impaired from THC demonstrated expected decrements in n-back task performance, this task was not intended to be an objective measure of impairment.</p>
              <p id="Par37">Fourth, we did not collect biological samples before and after administration of study drug on study days for THC assay that would have allowed for objective comparison of THC exposure in addition to dronabinol dose. Although there is an extensive literature describing poor correlation between blood and saliva THC levels and impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], without such bioassays, this trial cannot independently replicate those findings or understand how the fNIRS method compares to per se concentration cutoffs being used in some places as the legal standard for driving. Further, we cannot verify that no participant had THC in their system prior to dosing, which would have been detected with blood or saliva THC concentrations pre-dosing.</p>
              <p id="Par38">Finally, we did not ascertain whether change in PFC activation ascertained with fNIRS with impairment is specific to THC impairment due to THC intoxication. Studies underway will assess the impact of alcohol, sleep deprivation, and other sources of impairment on this fNIRS signature.</p>
              <p id="Par39">Here we report feasibility of fNIRS as a potential method as assess impairment from cannabis. fNIRS has several characteristics that make it suitable for real-world utility, such as roadside application. There are now portable, lightweight, wireless, battery-powered fNIRS devices that allow data to either be stored on wearable recording units or transmitted wirelessly to a laptop [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. fNIRS can be performed without sedation, and while a participant is moving, making it suitable for use in real-world settings across the lifespan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Finally, set-up time for fNIRS is minimal compared to other portable imaging modalities such as EEG measurements, particularly when using optodes only on the forehead, obviating the need to adjust optodes to get a good signal in the presence of hair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Indeed, fNIRS experiments are increasingly performed outside the laboratory and in everyday life situations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par40">Challenges to fNIRS use in the field exist. Although fNIRS is quite tolerant to movement, specific movements like raising of eyebrows cause significant motion artifacts. In outdoor environments, optical detectors must be shielded from sunlight which can saturate detectors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Further, physiological confounding of fNIRS signals by cardiovascular and respiratory function may be a significant issue if used in a law enforcement environment where people may be anxious. Short-separation channels, created by placing a light source close to a detector to record data from extracerebral tissue, can identify physiological and hemodynamic signals. Such extracerebral signal components (e.g., superficial skin blood flow) can then be removed to isolate brain signal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. The most significant barrier to the use of fNIRS as a real-world tool for detecting impairment is not likely to be limitations of technology, but rather the complexity of physiology, whereby blood flow in the PFC may be influenced by factors such as other medications, neurological/ psychological comorbidities, or a combination of these factors. Thus, in the field, fNIRS measurements may be most useful in conjunction with saliva, breath, or urine bioassays showing presence of the drug, and fNIRS assessment showing probable impairment from the drug. Even so, this may present a significant advantage compared with either oral fluid THC tests, which only assess the presence of the cannabis, not impairment, or with DRE evaluations, which are resource-intensive, time-consuming, and have been reported to be subject to bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par41">In summary, impairment due to THC intoxication was associated with increased PFC activation on a simple memory task assessed with fNIRS. These measures alone classified participants as impaired vs exposed but not clearly impaired with high PPV and accuracy. Combining time course and connectivity methods of assessing brain activation improved impairment detection. As we showed that there was no difference in THC dose between those who became impaired from those who did not following THC, it is likely that a brain- or behavior-based metric (e.g. eye tracking or cognitive testing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]), rather than a per se blood or oral fluid limit of THC, is required to distinguish THC impairment from simple exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Future work is warranted to determine if observed brain signatures are specific to THC intoxication-related impairment or are a more general signature of impairment.</p>
