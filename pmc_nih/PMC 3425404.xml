                  <p>Rapamycin/interleukin-2 (IL-2) combination treatment of NOD mice effectively treats autoimmune diabetes. We performed a phase 1 clinical trial to test the safety and immunologic effects of rapamycin/IL-2 combination therapy in type 1 diabetic (T1D) patients. Nine T1D subjects were treated with 2â4 mg/day rapamycin orally for 3 months and 4.5 Ã 10<sup>6</sup> IU IL-2 s.c. three times per week for 1 month. Î²-Cell function was monitored by measuring C-peptide. Immunologic changes were monitored using flow cytometry and serum analyses. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) increased within the first month of therapy, yet clinical and metabolic data demonstrated a transient worsening in all subjects. The increase in Tregs was transient, paralleling IL-2 treatment, whereas the response of Tregs to IL-2, as measured by STAT5 phosphorylation, increased and persisted after treatment. No differences were observed in effector T-cell subset frequencies, but an increase in natural killer cells and eosinophils occurred with IL-2 therapy. Rapamycin/IL-2 therapy, as given in this phase 1 study, resulted in transient Î²-cell dysfunction despite an increase in Tregs. Such results highlight the difficulties in translating therapies to the clinic and emphasize the importance of broadly interrogating the immune system to evaluate the effects of therapy.</p>

          <body>
            <p>Type 1 diabetes (TID) results from immune-mediated destruction of pancreatic Î²-cells, leading to hyperglycemia and life-long dependence on exogenous insulin. Although targeting T cells, B cells, or costimulation have all induced transient maintenance of Î²-cell function in patients with recently diagnosed T1D, treatment resulting in lasting remission of disease remains elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Thus, alternative approaches, such as combination therapy, may be required to treat and prevent T1D.</p>
            <p>An imbalance of autoreactive regulatory and effector cells is important in T1D pathogenesis. One predominant family of CD4<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells (Tregs) express high levels of CD25 (the high-affinity interleukin-2 [IL-2] receptor), and the forkhead box P3 (FOXP3) transcription factor. Impaired Treg function and decreased Treg persistence in response to IL-2 are present in T1D patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>) and occur along with apparent increased activity of pathogenic T-effector cells (Teffs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>).</p>
            <p>Rapamycin is used in transplantation due to its ability to block activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), which results in growth factorâdriven cell-cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Rapamycin preferentially inhibits proliferation of T helper (Th)1 and Th17 Teffs, with a weaker effect on Tregs, which do not require mTORC1 signaling for survival and growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). In a small study of long-standing T1D subjects, low doses of rapamycin enhanced FOXP3<sup>+</sup> Treg function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>).</p>
            <p>IL-2 acts on multiple cell types expressing the IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>), including CD25<sup>hi</sup> Tregs, which are highly IL-2 dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). In NOD mice and T1D patients, defects in IL-2 production and IL-2R signaling appear to play a central role in T1D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). In the NOD mouse, IL-2 both prevents and reverses hyperglycemia through selective activation and expansion of FOXP3<sup>+</sup> Tregs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Moreover, in recently reported clinical trials of low-dose IL-2 in graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>) and autoimmune vasculitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>), IL-2 therapy resulted in increased Treg numbers and beneficial clinical outcomes in some patients.</p>
            <p>Treatment of NOD mice with rapamycin and IL-2 resulted in prevention of both spontaneous diabetes and recurrent diabetes after islet transplant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). We performed an open-label phase 1 clinical trial in adult T1D subjects with rapamycin (Rapamune) plus IL-2 (Proleukin). Î²-Cell function, based on C-peptide values, transiently declined, and significant changes were observed in Tregs, Teffs, and natural killer (NK) cells. Thus, rapamycin/IL-2 therapy boosted Tregs, but also promoted a proinflammatory environment that may have resulted in transient Î²-cell dysfunction. Clinical and mechanistic data from this study will help guide future uses of IL-2 and combination therapy.</p>

                <p>In humans, FOXP3 is expressed constitutively in Tregs and transiently in activated Teffs. However, the FOXP3 locus remains methylated in Teffs, whereas similar analysis of natural Tregs (nTregs) displays demethylation at the TSDR, making TSDR methylation a more reliable marker of stable nTregs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>).

In comparison, IFN-Î³ secretion by FOXP3<sup>+</sup> cells is often indicative of activated Teffs. A limited amount of IFN-Î³ was secreted by CD4<sup>+</sup>FOXP3<sup>+</sup> cells, and the frequency of CD4<sup>+</sup>FOXP3<sup>+</sup> cells secreting IFN-Î³ did not increase with therapy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2<italic>D</italic></xref>).

                <p>Rapamycin is an mTOR inhibitor, and both S6 and Akt are in the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway and are phosphorylated after T-cell receptor ligation. The levels of pS6 and pAkt were measured in the presence or absence of anti-CD3/anti-CD28 stimulation.

Stimulated levels of pS6 in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells did not change with therapy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4<italic>B</italic></xref>). This lack of a reduction in pS6 after rapamycin therapy was not due to a compensatory increase in total S6 expression (data not shown).

                <p>We found no difference in autoantibody titers, absolute white blood cell counts, the frequency of lymphocytes and monocyte populations, or the CD4:CD8 ratio with combination therapy (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/db12-0049/-/DC1">Supplementary Table 1</ext-link> and data not shown). No changes were seen in the periphery in the frequency of naive and memory CD4<sup>+</sup> or CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, effector and central memory T-cell subsets, or frequency of CRTH2<sup>+</sup> or CXCR3<sup>+</sup> cells, indicative of Th2 and Th1 cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5<italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic></xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/db12-0049/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. 4</ext-link>). Likewise, no change in IFN-Î³ secretion, a cytokine made by Th1 cells, was observed over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5<italic>C</italic></xref>). Despite some variance, no significant difference was observed over time in IL-17 secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5<italic>C</italic></xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/db12-0049/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. 5</ext-link>). Activation of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells was measured by expression of CD38 and Fas, and no differences were observed over time (data not shown). Together, these data demonstrate that T-cell activation and memory composition along with CD4<sup>+</sup> helper subset differentiation may not have been altered in the peripheral blood during combination therapy in T1D patients.</p>

                <p>We observed significant eosinophilia in all subjects as early as day 14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6<italic>A</italic></xref>), which coincided with IL-2 but not rapamycin therapy. In parallel with the increase in eosinophils was a decrease in the frequency of neutrophils in the peripheral blood (data not shown). Serum cytokine levels were assessed for all patients before and after combination therapy (day 0 vs. 84) and for a subset (<italic>n</italic> = 6) of patients at earlier time points. Significant levels of soluble IL-2RÎ± (sIL-2RA) were detected on days 14, 21, and 28, with levels declining back to pretreatment levels by day 35, a week after IL-2 therapy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6<italic>B</italic></xref>). We also observed a subtle decrease in TGF-Î² secretion. Notably, we did not detect significant amounts of other serum cytokines tested. Thus, a systemic excess of cytokines at and beyond day 14 is unlikely to have contributed to the decreases observed in C-peptide levels. Whether earlier production of cytokines contributed to initiation of inflammation is not known.</p>

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>Coordinated analysis of both clinical and mechanistic data during trials may provide biomarkers of safety and efficacy. Using this approach, we found that rapamycin/IL-2 combination therapy had the unwanted effect of transiently decreasing Î²-cell function. This occurred despite the beneficial effects of this therapy in the NOD mouse model of diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>), the beneficial effects of low-dose IL-2 in GVHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>) and vasculitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>), and a wealth of in vitro and in vivo data supporting the hypothesis that this therapy would result in coordinated enrichment of Treg responses and inhibition of Teff responses. Treg numbers and IL-2 responsiveness in peripheral blood were boosted in patients in this trial. Yet, the number of NK cells and eosinophils also increased, suggesting that combination therapy promoted an environment that may have been responsible for the transient decrease in Î²-cell function. These studies test, for the first time, IL-2 and rapamycin therapy in human T1D subjects and highlight the challenges in translating studies from preclinical models. Moreover, this work suggests specific tests that may be informative in future trials to assess safety and efficacy.</p>
              <p>On the basis of mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>), we predicted that combination therapy would halt damage of Î²-islet cells. However, we observed a significant decline in 2-h AUC C-peptide values that occurred in all subjects at an accelerated rate, with a mean percent change of approximately four times that of comparable published control groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Of importance, Î²-cell function increased at later time points. This transient decrease in Î²-cell function may have occurred due to IL-2 and rapamycin dosing/timing issues, combination of rapamycin with IL-2, and/or factors unique to T1D subjects. In two recently reported clinical trials, low doses of IL-2 were beneficial in promoting tolerance in GVHD and vasculitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Although administered in different dosing schedules, the overall amount of IL-2 given in those studies over â¼2 months was similar to the amount we used (54 Ã 10<sup>6</sup> IU over 1 month) with 52.5 Ã 10<sup>6</sup> IU over 9 weeks in the vasculitis trial and the tolerated dose of â¼95 Ã 10<sup>6</sup> IU over 8 weeks in the GVHD trial. In our study, IL-2 was given for 1â2 weeks before rapamycin reached targeted blood levels (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/db12-0049/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. 1</ext-link>). This is unlike the mouse models where rapamycin was initiated at full dose with IL-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>) and may explain some of the early proinflammatory responses, even though IL-2 doses were similar to other low-dose regimens for tolerance induction. Future studies will benefit from including early assessment of both immunological and clinical parameters as biomarkers of safety and mechanisms of action.</p>
              <p>Although earlier observations in vitro and in transplant models have suggested that rapamycin may be Î²-cell toxic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>), evidence from this trial suggests that rapamycin may not be the primary or only cause of Î²-cell damage. C-peptide decline was seen even in two subjects who did not receive the full course of rapamycin, and the most significant changes in mechanistic data occurred within the first month of therapy concordant with IL-2. In addition, in long-standing T1D patients waiting for islet transplant, rapamycin monotherapy at doses similar to those used in our trial did not result in a drop in C-peptide levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). Nevertheless, in other clinical settings higher doses of rapamycin have resulted in impaired regulation of insulin levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). Thus, although we cannot rule out an impact of rapamycin on Î²-cell function, our evidence points to a detrimental effect of IL-2 or the combination of rapamycin and IL-2 in this patient population.</p>
              <p>Rapamycin/IL-2 combination therapy resulted in a significant increase in FOXP3<sup>+</sup> Tregs. Whether the function of FOXP3<sup>+</sup> cells in our trial was altered by therapy was not addressed. Isolated CD25<sup>hi</sup> T cells from patients in the low-dose IL-2 trial in GVHD were functional Tregs. Yet, it is interesting that not all GVHD patients showed beneficial effects of therapy even though Tregs were significantly elevated in all study subjects. In addition, the level of Treg enhancement was highly variable in the vasculitis study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>) while all patients improved clinically, suggesting that other cells beyond Tregs may play a role.</p>
              <p>Other cells known to be activated by IL-2 include eosinophils and NK cells, both of which increased in our trial. This response was equal to or greater than that observed with low-dose IL-2 treatment of GVHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>) and vasculitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>), but was not observed in NOD mice treated with IL-2, most likely due to multiple genetic defects associated with NK cells in these mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). The increased NK response to combination therapy occurred primarily in the CD56<sup>hi</sup> subpopulation, a population that has been shown to play both an effector and regulatory role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). Whether NK cells from patients in this trial secrete pro- or anti-inflammatory cytokines is not known. In multiple sclerosis patients, there is an increase in CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cells that produce IL-10 and are associated with clinical benefit upon daclizumab therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). Yet, a clinical trial of daclizumab plus mycophenolate mofetil did not alter the disease course in new-onset T1D subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). As in our trial, a transient increase in eosinophils has been observed in HIV patients with IL-2 monotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>) and low-dose IL-2 therapy for GVHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>) but, interestingly, not in the low-dose IL-2 vasculitis study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Eosinophils constitutively express the low-affinity IL-2R. Upon activation, they express CD25 and gain the potential to secrete peroxidase and IL-6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>), suggesting that eosinophilia could also contribute to the proinflammatory responses observed during combination therapy. Future studies should address the functional properties of NK cells and eosinophils that changed upon therapy.</p>
              <p>Remarkably, combination therapy resulted in a durable rescue of IL-2R signaling even a full year after initiation of therapy, most dramatically in the CD25<sup>+</sup> population. Increased response to IL-2 is most likely not solely due to increased expression of CD25, since CD25 MFI (mean fluorescence intensity) transiently increased with IL-2 therapy (data not shown) and the percentage of CD25<sup>+</sup>CD127<sup>lo</sup> Tregs increased during therapy whereas response to IL-2 persisted beyond therapy. Rescue of IL-2 responsiveness is not unprecedented. In some cancer patients treated with high doses of IL-2, pSTAT5 in CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells is enhanced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>), and IL-2 therapy for Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome rescues poor IL-2 responsiveness in NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). Thus, treatment with rapamycin and IL-2 may stably enhance IL-2R complex signaling molecules and/or promote selective outgrowth or homing of IL-2âresponsive cells. Even though IL-2 responsiveness was maintained, the increased frequency of FOXP3<sup>+</sup> Tregs was transient in the peripheral blood. These FOXP3<sup>+</sup> cells may have migrated from the periphery or may have undergone activation-induced cell death upon withdrawal of IL-2.</p>
              <p>Rapamycin has been shown to increase memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell formation, increase the Th2:Th1 ratio, and decrease activation and proliferation of CD4<sup>+</sup> Teffs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), whereas IL-2, when given alone, leads to an expansion of the CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> Teffs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). Yet, we did not observe such changes in peripheral blood samples. It remains possible that once activated, the relevant cells leave the circulation and move to the tissues or secondary lymphoid populations, or that combination of rapamycin with IL-2 negated the effect of rapamycin alone on T-cell differentiation. Alternatively, T cells of T1D subjects may be relatively resistant to rapamycin due to disease-specific defects in mTOR signaling, although the reduction in pAkt after therapy suggests that rapamycin did affect the Akt/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway. Thus, the functional composition of the memory T-cell pool may have been altered with combination therapy without causing measurable changes in the frequency of memory or helper T-cell subsets.</p>
              <p>Recently, the immunostimulatory effects of rapamycin on innate cells have been recognized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). Although we did not test monocyte function, we did find a significant decrease in TGF-Î² secreted by myeloid cells. We also noted increased serum sIL-2RA, a marker of immune activation. This increase is most likely due to IL-2RA shedding upon activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). Whether sIL-2RA has any biological effects is unclear, although one report suggested that high sIL-2RA levels block Treg function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). Future studies will benefit from a broader survey of immune cells, including array technologies, to determine all cell types impacted by therapy.</p>
              <p>Overall, these data suggest that Tregs of T1D subjects can be enhanced by IL-2 therapy, providing a foundation upon which to build future treatments designed to augment Tregs. However, rapamycin/IL-2 combination therapy also promoted an environment that presumably resulted in transient Î²-cell dysfunction. In future studies, approaches need to be identified that dissociate Treg expansion from effector responses. For next-generation trials, markers of IL-2 therapy safety should include early assessment of Î²-cell function as well as FOXP3 expression, eosinophil and NK frequencies, and changes in sIL-2RA levels.</p>
