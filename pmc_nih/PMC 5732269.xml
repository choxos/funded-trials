                <p id="Par1">Anaemia and malaria are both common in pregnant women in Sub-Saharan Africa. Previous evidence has shown that iron supplementation may increase malaria risk. In this observational cohort study, we evaluated <italic>P. falciparum</italic> pathogenesis <italic>in vitro</italic> in RBCs from pregnant women during their 2nd and 3rd trimesters. RBCs were collected and assayed before (n = 327), 14 days (n = 82), 49 days (n = 112) and 84 days (n = 115) after iron supplementation (60 mg iron as ferrous fumarate daily). <italic>P. falciparum</italic> erythrocytic stage growth <italic>in vitro</italic> is reduced in anaemic pregnant women at baseline, but increased during supplementation. The elevated growth rates parallel increases in circulating CD71-positive reticulocytes and other markers of young RBCs. We conclude that <italic>Plasmodium</italic> growth <italic>in vitro</italic> is associated with elevated erythropoiesis, an obligate step towards erythroid recovery in response to supplementation. Our findings support current World Health Organization recommendations that iron supplementation be given in combination with malaria prevention and treatment services in malaria endemic areas.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="Par2">Malaria and anaemia are two common health problems facing pregnant women in Sub-Saharan Africa. Anaemia is found in 43% of pregnant women worldwide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Iron deficiency accounts for 50–75% of anaemia cases, and is thought to be largely due to inadequate diet and increased nutritional requirements during pregnancy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Pregnant women are also at increased risk of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> malaria infection. Susceptibility peaks during the second trimester and risk remains elevated for up to 60 days post-partum. It is highest in primagravida women, however women of all gravidities have increased susceptibility to malaria. There are several possible explanations: (1) pregnant women are more attractive to mosquitoes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>; (2) pregnant women have higher rates of erythropoiesis and higher percentages of young red blood cells (RBCs) which are preferred by <italic>P. falciparum</italic>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>; and (3) parasitized RBCs accumulate in the placenta thus reducing immune surveillance associated with normal splenic circulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Specifically, it is well known that parasites infecting pregnant women express a particular protein encoded by <italic>var2csa</italic> that binds chondroitin sulphate A expressed on placental syncytiotrophoblasts which allows for placental sequestration of infected RBCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Primagravida women who have not been immunologically exposed to <italic>var2csa</italic> protein products are particularly vulnerable<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. No matter what the mechanism of increased susceptibility is, maternal infection has severe consequences for both the mother and fetus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par3">World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines recommend 30 to 60 mg elemental iron and 400 mg folic acid daily throughout pregnancy. These recommendations are based on evidence showing that daily iron and folic acid reduces the risk of low birth weight, preterm birth, maternal anaemia and maternal iron deficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. However, these recommendations have been questioned recently by several findings: (1) iron deficiency and anaemia are associated with protection against malaria in pregnant women and children<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>; and (2) iron supplementation in children has been associated with increased mortality and of risk of infectious diseases, including malaria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par4">Multiple studies have investigated the safety of iron supplementation of children in malaria endemic areas. However, there has been less focus on the safety of iron supplementation of pregnant women, mainly because WHO guidelines for pregnant women suggest the use of intermittent preventive treatment for malaria with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (IPTp-SP) in areas with moderate to high malaria transmission. Starting as early as possible in the second trimester, IPTp-SP is recommended at each scheduled antenatal care visit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. However, implementation of IPTp is low; in fact only about 25% of pregnant women in Sub-Saharan Africa received two or more doses of IPTp<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Hence, the issue of safety of iron supplements for pregnant women living in malaria endemic areas remains important.</p>
              <p id="Par5">In this study, we have used <italic>in vitro</italic> malaria growth assays in RBCs from pregnant women as a proxy for malaria susceptibility. Use of <italic>in vitro</italic> assays allowed us to assess the impact of host iron supplementation in the absence of the confounding effects from IPTp-SP or the host immune system. We have systematically assessed <italic>P. falciparum</italic> growth <italic>in vitro</italic> in RBCs drawn from pregnant women before, during, and after 12 weeks of iron supplementation, which was initiated during the 2<sup>nd</sup> trimester of pregnancy. The women in this study did receive IPTp-SP, however they donated blood for the malaria <italic>in vitro</italic> growth assays at each of the scheduled visits prior to ingestion of the monthly dose. Similar to our research involving <italic>in vitro P. falciparum</italic> growth assays in RBCs longitudinally collected from anaemic children undergoing iron supplementation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, here we observe that parasite growth correlates with host haemoglobin status at baseline. We also observe parasite growth increases with iron supplementation, paralleling increases in circulating young RBCs, and potentially representing a period of increased malaria susceptibility following iron supplementation of pregnant women.</p>

                <title>Subject recruitment</title>
                <p id="Par6">The pregnant women for this observational cohort study were recruited from the reference (Gambian government standard of care) arm of a randomized trial testing the efficacy and safety of a hepcidin-guided screen-and-treat strategy for combatting anaemia (see published protocol for full details including sample size calculations and randomization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>) and were 18–45 years old with estimated 14–22 weeks gestation at recruitment. Recruitment occurred from June 2014–March 2016 in the Kiang West and Jarra East regions of rural Gambia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. (Note we also included pregnant women in the other two arms of this trial, but only for observation at baseline, pre-randomization/pre-intervention.) As per current WHO and Gambian government recommendations, pregnant women in the reference arm received 60 mg/d iron as ferrous fumarate and 400 µg folic acid, given within a micronutrient capsule (UNIMMAP). Field workers visited the women frequently (twice weekly) in order to check their health status and deliver the supplements. For baseline population characteristics, see Supplemental Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>.</p>

                <title>Blood samples for parasite assays</title>
                <p id="Par8">Venous blood was collected at Days 0 (baseline), 14, 49 and 84 during 12wks of iron supplementation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). We compared subject characteristics of those whose blood was and was not able to be used for malaria growth rate data to ensure no sampling bias occurred (Supplemental Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Description of subjects and flow chart of sample collection and assays performed. Blood samples for haematological, biochemical, and parasite growth analyses were drawn at Day 0, as well as Days 14, 49, and 84 for those taking daily iron. A full haematology panel was measured in EDTA-stabilized blood (Medonic M20M GP). We also assayed ferritin, soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), serum iron, transferrin saturation (TSAT), C-reactive protein (CRP), alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) (Cobas Integra 400 plus); and hepcidin (Hepcidin-25 (human) EIA Kit (Bachem)). Genotyping for haemoglobinopathies was performed using haemoglobin electrophoresis. For malaria assays, 2.5 mL of venous blood was drawn directly into microvette tubes containing CPDA-1 (Sarstedt, Germany). Unavailable donors include safety exclusion (Hgb &lt; 7 g/dl or positive malaria test (RDT positive)), those who delivered prematurely or aborted, or general loss to follow up (withdrawal and travel). Failure to collect blood from subjects (e.g. from phlebotomy failure, subject moved or withdrew, delivered, or became significantly ill) was 0.2% at Day 0, 4.8% at Day 14, 8.4% at Day 49, and 16.8% at Day 84. RBCs from study subjects were evaluated with <italic>in vitro P. falciparum</italic> growth assays (using strain FCR3-FMG) as a proxy measure for malaria susceptibility. In order to standardize the growth assays, control for inter-assay variability and variability between parasite preparations, assays on clinical samples were run in parallel with and reported relative to growth assays done using RBCs from non-anaemic donors. Each available blood sample at every time point was subjected to growth assays but not all produced growth data, as some blood was unusable (e.g. clotted, hemolysed, or contaminated). Further growth data exclusions (e.g. parasites died or control blood did not provide a readable output for comparison) do not represent population sampling bias, as subject characteristics are the same between those with and without corresponding growth data (Supplemental Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41598_2017_16896_Fig1_HTML" id="d29e427"/></fig>

In detail, tightly synchronized parasite cultures (15 ml of 4% hematocrit cultures containing 5% parasitized RBCs) were treated with 50 U/ml of heparin as trophozoites. Approximately 12 h later, upon visualization of schizonts by Geimsa stain, schizonts were purified by MACS. Resulting schizont concentration was quantified using Sybr Green stain and flow cytometry, and schizonts were incubated in ACM containing 50 U/ml heparin under standard culture conditions to allow for 3–4 h of recovery. RBC concentrations of the donor samples were also quantified by flow cytometry. To set up the assay, schizonts were washed twice with 5 ml heparin-free ACM and distributed equally amongst triplicate wells (of a 96 well plate) for each assay condition. RBCs from anemic or non-anemic donors were then added to appropriate wells to bring the final concentration of schizonts to 10%. ACM with either no drug (to assay merozoite invasion), 1 µM Cytochalasin D (to assay merozoite attachment), or 200 U/ml heparin (to block both invasion and attachment), was added to appropriate wells and plates were incubated under standard culture conditions. At each time point (0, 3, and 7 h), 50 µl of each drug treatment condition from each blood sample was aliquoted in triplicate into 200 µl of fixative (PBS containing 0.116 M sucrose and 2% glutaraldehyde), with overnight fixation at 4°C before staining with DNA dye Sybr Green I and analysis by flow cytometry. Giemsa stains were also made from each time point and condition in order to confirm that attachment and invasion events were prevented by the various treatments and to verify that new events (in the ring region of the flow cytometry plot for DNA quantification) could correctly be counted as either invasion or attachment events. Flow cytometry analysis allows the use of DNA levels in parasite cultures to distinguish seeded schizonts present apart from new invasion or attachment events which occur at 3 and 7 h. To calculate attachment or invasion rates for each blood sample, the percent of new events was compared to the starting concentration of schizonts under each condition, then expressed relative to new events occurring in RBCs from healthy iron replete controls.</p>

                <title>Description of study population at baseline</title>
                <p id="Par20">The study population consisted of 498 healthy pregnant women identified in the Jarra West and Kiang East regions of rural Gambia who were estimated to be at 14–22 weeks gestation during recruitment, fit all enrolment criteria, and consented to participate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. It is difficult to assess anaemia and iron deficiency in pregnant women<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. It is complicated by changes in haematological dynamics during pregnancy and, in our setting, the backdrop of high levels of environmental inflammatory stimuli. The WHO defines anaemia in pregnant women as haemoglobin &lt;11 g/dL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. During the second trimester of pregnancy, the maternal plasma volume expands much more rapidly than the RBC mass, resulting in hemodilution and a drop in haemoglobin concentrations by 0.5 g/dl in normal pregnancies (reviewed in<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>). The US Center for Disease Control defines anaemia as haemoglobin &lt;10.5 g/dl in the 2nd trimester<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>, and the US Institute of Medicine recommends lowering haemoglobin reference values by 0.8 g/dl for African American women<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. We therefore assessed anaemia in our study population by multiple haemoglobin standards. We found 54.4% of our participants had Hgb &lt; 11 g/dl; 39.4% had Hgb &lt; 10.5 g/dl; 17.5% had Hgb &lt; 9.7 g/dl.</p>
                <p id="Par21">To further assess iron status, we classified our participants using two different definitions of iron deficiency: 1) ferritin &lt; 12 ng/ml or ferritin 12–30 ng/ml and CRP &gt; 5 mg/l; and 2) hepcidin &lt; 2.5 ng/ml<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. At baseline, 24.8% of the participants had ferritin &lt; 12 ng/ml and 8.3% had ferritin 12–30 ng/ml and CRP &gt; 5 mg/l. Thus, 33.1% of the participants fit the definition of iron deficiency based on ferritin measurements. Finally, using hepcidin to define iron deficiency, at baseline 54.2% of the participants were iron deficient (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

                <p id="Par23">To examine the impact of haematological, iron, and inflammatory variables on parasite growth in RBCs from our study population, we performed bivariate and multivariate linear regression analyses. We assessed the influence of several key factors known or assumed to influence anaemia and/or parasite growth (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Haemoglobin, haemoglobin genotype, MCV, transferrin saturation (TSAT), as well as log-transformed hepcidin, RDW, and sTfR, all influenced parasite growth in RBCs drawn from pregnant women prior to iron supplementation.

                <p id="Par24">To better compare the effect size of haemoglobin, haemoglobin genotype, MCV, MCH, RDW, TSAT and log hepcidin, we calculated percentage GR change for every one standard deviation (SD) in the variable of interest. Hgb (as a continuous variable) has the largest effect on parasite growth, changing 11.7% with every increment of 1 SD.

We assessed several different groupings of haemoglobin, trying to maintain clinical relevance (categorizing by anaemic and non-anaemic status (WHO criteria, CDC criteria, and adjusting for lower Hgb values in African populations); non-anaemic and mild and moderate anaemia (WHO criteria); and finally by every 1 g/dl change in haemoglobin). For all categorizations, haemoglobin maintained significant association with parasite growth rate at approximately the level seen using haemoglobin instead as a continuous variable (Supplemental Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>).</p>

Using a RBC barcoding invasion assay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>, we directly examined merozoite invasion into differentially labelled target RBCs from anaemic pregnant women (15 donors) versus non-anaemic controls using reference laboratory strain 3D7 and three transgenic <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasite strains, ΔPfRh1, ΔPfRh2a, and ΔPfRh2b, in parallel. The Susceptibility Index (SI) for the laboratory strain 3D7 was reduced (SI = 0.81), indicating reduced invasion into RBCs from anaemic donors. However, there were no differences in SI values between the parent (3D7) and transgenic parasite strains with altered PfRh expression. Mean SI values for each of the transgenic strains (ΔPfRh1, ΔPfRh2a, and ΔPfRh2b) were all below 1.0. This confirms merozoite invasion preference for RBCs from non-anaemic versus anaemic pregnant women, and demonstrates that PfRh1, PfRh2a and PfRh2b do not play in the RBC selection process (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>).</p>
                <p id="Par27">We next examined whether merozoite attachment was altered during invasion of anaemic RBCs.

                <p id="Par29">To evaluate the RBC population age structure of pregnant women undergoing daily iron supplementation, we measured levels of CD71-positive reticulocytes in RBCs drawn at baseline (Day 0), during (Day 14 and Day 49) and after (Day 84) iron supplementation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3C</xref>). Paralleling changes in parasite growth rates, relative CD71 levels increased significantly from Day 0 (mean 2.65, 95% CI 2.40–2.91) to Day 14 (mean 4.06, 95% CI 3.65–4.46) and remained higher at Day 49 (mean 3.22, 95% CI 2.77–3.68), before returning to baseline levels at Day 84 (mean 1.96, 95% CI 1.76–2.15). One-way ANOVA indicates differences between the means are significant (p &lt; 0.0001). If the analysis is limited to those pregnant women with values at all four time points (n = 60), the same pattern of increased young CD71-positive reticulocytes at Day 14 and Day 49 is observed (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>).</p>
                <p id="Par30">We further examined other surface markers on RBCs from pregnant women undergoing iron supplementation over time (n = 5), in order to better understand changes in RBCs which may contribute to increased parasite growth rates following iron supplementation. We measured RBC surface proteins that are either known parasite invasion receptors and/or used to assess RBC age and membrane integrity. Specifically, we measured: (1) glycophorin A (GPA), an abundant RBC sialoglycoprotein which contributes to RBC surface charge, is found at higher levels on younger RBCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>, and is a merozoite receptor; (2) CD47, an anti-phagocytic marker which is at higher concentration on young RBCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>; (3) CD35 (complement receptor 1), which is more abundant on younger RBCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>; (4) CD147 (Basigin), the only known essential <italic>P. falciparum</italic> invasion receptor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>; (5) CD55 (decay accelerating factor) which is involved in the complement system and has been shown to reflect RBC age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>; and (6) sialic acid, which is reduced on older RBCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. We again found significant increases from Day 0 to Day 14 (p &lt; 0.001) for all surface markers examined, with the exception of sialic acid residues where the increase from Day 0 to Day 14 was slightly less significant (p &lt; 0.01) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3E</xref>). Some proteins measured also remained elevated at Day 49 and beyond, though the biggest changes were consistently measured between Day 0 and Day 14. Shifts in relative expression of these RBC markers are highly indicative of an overall increase in young, healthy RBCs.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par31">Use of <italic>in vitro</italic> growth assays as our primary outcome provided an opportunity to systematically examine the cellular determinants of parasite growth in pregnant women. Here we show <italic>P. falciparum</italic> growth decreases in RBCs from anaemic (Hgb &lt; 11 g/dl) pregnant Gambian women and that protection offered by anaemia in pregnant women in the second trimester of pregnancy is substantial (~11.7% change per standard deviation shift in haemoglobin). Of course, these results are from <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments that cannot fully capture disease protection dynamics in the real world, and we purposefully eliminated potentially confounding factors such as IPTp protection. However, our findings are consistent with many epidemiological studies observing reduced malaria infection rates in anaemic versus non-anaemic pregnant women<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> and do provide additional insight into the degree of protection afforded by anaemia. Furthermore, our findings reveal parasite growth in RBCs from pregnant Gambian women directly correlates with other markers of iron deficiency such as MCV, TSAT, hepcidin, and sTfR. Overall, this parasite growth and linear regression data is highly consistent with the data we have previously reported on anaemic Gambian children<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par32">The molecular mechanisms by which RBCs from anaemic pregnant women are protected remain unknown. We examined whether specific <italic>P. falciparum</italic> PfRh invasion ligands contribute to the differential invasion. <italic>P. falciparum</italic>’s multiple invasion ligands represent different invasion pathways which the parasite can utilize to enter RBCs (reviewed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>). We hypothesized that PfRh ligands may help the parasite detect the healthiest RBCs through their putative ATP binding domains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. However, we found no differences between the wild type and the transgenic parasite strains missing either PfRh1, PfRh2a or PfRh2b. We next examined whether merozoite attachment was affected during invasion of anaemic RBCs and again found no differences. Both of these sets of experiments are consistent with the hypothesis that the mechanical properties of RBC membranes from anaemic donors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup> influence invasion. Recent work on merozoite invasion has demonstrated that localized RBC deformation is important for parasite invasion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par33">Finally, we demonstrate that parasite growth increased dramatically relative to baseline in RBCs taken from pregnant women during iron supplementation, transiently rising as early as 14 days after iron supplementation was initiated. The growth remained high at Day 49 relative to non-anaemic controls and returned by Day 84 to baseline levels. These patterns in growth rate changes were paralleled by measurements of markers of young RBCs in circulation, specifically CD71-positive reticulocytes together with other markers of RBC age such as GPA and CD47. While the majority of individuals’ growth rates peaked at Day 14, some peaked at Day 49. Differences in gestational age and other physiological factors that may influence RBC properties and differences in RBC population dynamics in response to iron administration may cause this. The rapid increase in both parasite growth and young RBC populations reflect a shift that can be observed quite quickly in pregnant women already subject to physiological erythrocytic drive. Pregnant women naturally have elevated levels of erythropoietin, which drives a blood volume and RBC mass expansion. Similarly, it is not surprising that CD71 levels in pregnant women are generally higher than in non-anaemic, non-pregnant control donors at baseline, as pregnant women have an expanding erythroid mass with increased levels of erythropoietin. These results are consistent with a report from Tian <italic>et al</italic>. who show that parasites grow better in RBCs from pregnant women (n = 9) in their 2<sup>nd</sup> trimester compared to non-pregnant women (n = 9)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par34">One of the important limitations of this study is that it does not include a group of women who did not receive iron supplements and therefore there is no way to separate the impact of pregnancy alone on malaria growth from the impact of iron supplementation. Nonetheless, whether or not significant haemoglobin increases are induced by iron supplementation or natural haematological changes occurring between the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> trimesters of pregnancy, the changing erythropoietic drive seems clearly linked to parasite growth increases <italic>in vitro</italic> and thus reflects a real concern for increased malaria susceptibility in pregnant women, particularly those taking iron. Another significant limitation is that we are using <italic>in vitro</italic> parasite growth data as a surrogate marker for malaria susceptibility. However, this approach has allowed us to test RBCs from over 400 anaemic and non-anaemic pregnant women on whom we had complete iron and inflammatory marker data. This has also allowed us examine the impact of RBCs on malaria susceptibility separate from the effects of IPTp and the immune response to infection.</p>
              <p id="Par35">Implementation rates of IPTp-SP are currently low in malarious areas; only about 25% of pregnant women in Sub-Saharan Africa receive two doses of IPTp<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. With low IPTp-SP uptake, our <italic>in vitro</italic> assays conducted in the absence of confounders help to increase understanding of the host-pathogen dynamics. In addition, our demonstration that there are profound increases in parasite invasion and growth rates in RBCs within 2 weeks of starting iron therapy provide compelling evidence to strengthen WHO’s existing recommendation that, where <italic>P. falciparum</italic> is endemic, iron supplementation should be given in combination with measures to prevent, monitor and treat malaria in pregnancy (primarily through provision of monthly IPTp-SP and access to adequate health care).</p>
