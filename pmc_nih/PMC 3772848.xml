              <abstract>
                <p>The epoxygenase CYP2J2 has an emerging role in inflammation and vascular biology. The role of CYP2J2 in phagocytosis is not known and its regulation in human inflammatory diseases is poorly understood. Here we investigated the role of CYP2J2 in bacterial phagocytosis and its expression in monocytes from healthy controls and Crohns disease patients. CYP2J2 is anti-inflammatory in human peripheral blood monocytes. Bacterial LPS induced CYP2J2 mRNA and protein. The CYP2J2 arachidonic acid products 11,12-EET and 14,15-EET inhibited LPS induced TNFα release. THP-1 monocytes were transformed into macrophages by 48h incubation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. Epoxygenase inhibition using a non-selective inhibitor SKF525A or a selective CYP2J2 inhibitor Compound 4, inhibited <italic>E. coli</italic> particle phagocytosis, which could be specifically reversed by 11,12-EET. Moreover, epoxygenase inhibition reduced the expression of phagocytosis receptors CD11b and CD68. CD11b also mediates <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> phagocytosis. Similar, to <italic>E. coli</italic> bioparticle phagocytosis, epoxygenase inhibition also reduced intracellular levels of <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>, which could be reversed by co-incubation with 11,12-EET. Disrupted bacterial clearance is a hallmark of Crohn’s disease. Unlike macrophages from control donors, macrophages from Crohn’s disease patients showed no induction of CYP2J2 in response to <italic>E. coli</italic>. These results demonstrate that CYP2J2 mediates bacterial phagocytosis in macrophages, and implicates a defect in the CYP2J2 pathway may regulate bacterial clearance in Crohn’s disease.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Monocyte-derived macrophages play a critical role in host defence, wound healing and chronic inflammation <xref rid="pone.0075107-Mantovani1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Arachidonic acid is metabolised into families of biologically active mediators by cyclooxygenase, lipoxygenase and CYP450 pathways <xref rid="pone.0075107-BishopBailey1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0075107-Zeldin1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. The main arachidonic acid-metabolising CYPs are the CYP2 family, <xref rid="pone.0075107-Zeldin1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0075107-Spiecker1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, of which CYP2J2 and CYP2C8 are present in human monocytes and macrophages <xref rid="pone.0075107-Bystrom1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Recombinant CYP2J2 metabolises arachidonic acid in to all four <italic>cis</italic>-EETs 5,6-EET, 8,9-EET, 11,12-EET and 14,15-EET <xref rid="pone.0075107-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, and all are produced by human macrophages <xref rid="pone.0075107-Werner1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. We recently published that CYP2J2 and its anti-inflammatory products are ligands for the peroxisome-proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) class of nuclear receptors <xref rid="pone.0075107-Wray1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Moreover, we showed that endogenous epoxygenases are anti-inflammatory in human monocytes and M1 macrophages in part via activation of PPARα. EETs are rapidly metabolized in the body. The main pathway for EET removal is through their conversion into dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acid (DHETs) by soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) <xref rid="pone.0075107-Nakayama1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. DHETs are generally considered to be less active than EETs; however they have been shown to inhibit monocyte migration <xref rid="pone.0075107-Kundu1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Endotoxin-induced lung inflammation is reduced with global sEH knockout <xref rid="pone.0075107-Deng1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, which showed significantly reduced activation of e-selectin mRNA, NFκB signaling, and neutrophil infiltration <xref rid="pone.0075107-Deng1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. In addition, sEH knockout or sEH inhibitors reduce the chronic inflammatory bowel disease <xref rid="pone.0075107-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> and its associated tumor formation <xref rid="pone.0075107-Zhang2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> in IL-10 knockout mice, which was also associated with a reduction in TNFα, MCP-1 and neutrophil infiltration <xref rid="pone.0075107-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. The roles of CYP450 pathways in mediating responses to pathogens remain poorly understood.</p>
              <p>Crohn’s disease is characterized by defects in bacterial clearance <xref rid="pone.0075107-Smith1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> and has been associated with an increased burden of bacteria including <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0075107-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Here we show CYP2J2 is induced by bacterial stimulation, but is absent in Crohn’s disease macrophages. Moreover, we show CYP2J2 and 11,12-EET mediate the phagocytosis and uptake of <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> in macrophages.</p>

None of the patients had received corticosteroid, immunosuppressant, anti-TNF, or metronidazole therapy within 3 months of enrollment. Healthy control subjects approximately matched for age, sex, and smoking history were recruited. Written informed consent was obtained from all volunteers. Unlike THP-1 cells which can be differentiated in to a macrophage phenotype over 24–48 h by PMA incubation, primary macrophages were produced by culture for 5d. Adherent cells were scraped on day 5 and re-plated in 96-well culture plates at 10<sup>5</sup>/well in X-Vivo-15 medium (Cambrex).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Here we show CYP2J2 is a LPS/<italic>E. coli</italic> inducible enzyme in PBMCs and macrophages. The CYP2J2 promoter does not contain a TATA box <xref rid="pone.0075107-Ma1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, and as such it has not been considered an inflammation or TLR-4 inducible target. However, consistent with these findings, CYP2J2 is up-regulated in preeclampsia and is induced in a trophoblast cell line with TNFα <xref rid="pone.0075107-Herse1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. As reported by us and others, <xref rid="pone.0075107-Bystrom1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0075107-Nakayama2" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, circulating PBMCs contain low levels of CYP2J2. However, similar to TLR-4 stimulation CYP2J2 could also be induced by PMA, M-CSF and GM-CSF <xref rid="pone.0075107-Nakayama2" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. These results together clearly suggest that CYP2J2 is inducible and therefore may be the major inflammation regulated epoxygenase in man.</p>
              <p>THP-1 monocytes and M1 macrophages contain CYP2J2 and CYP2C8 <xref rid="pone.0075107-Bystrom1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Inhibition of epoxygenases with the non-selective epoxygenase inhibitor SKF525A and a selective chemically distinct CYP2J2 inhibitor, Compound 4 <xref rid="pone.0075107-Lafite1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> equally reduced <italic>E. coli</italic> phagocytosis, strongly implicating CYP2J2 as the enzyme responsible. We routinely use SKF525A to inhibit CYP2J2 as we previously demonstrated 10 µM SKF (the concentration used in this study) abolishes CYP2J2-dependent activation of PPAR responses <xref rid="pone.0075107-Nakayama2" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Compound 4 similarly inhibits CYP2J2-dependent activation of peroxisome-proliferator activated receptor responses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0075107.s001">Figure S1</xref>). <italic>E. coli</italic> uptake was reversed selectively by 11,12-EET, but not 14,15-EET, or linoleic acid epoxygenase products. Indeed, 9,10-EPOME itself reduced phagocytosis. This <italic>E. coli</italic> phagocytosis assay therefore distinguishes 11,12-EET from 14,15-EET and 9,10-EPOME from 12,13-EPOME.</p>
              <p>In contrast, 11,12- and 14,15-EET both reduced TNFα release from LPS-stimulated monocytes, consistent with their known anti-inflammatory actions <xref rid="pone.0075107-Thomson1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. In contrast the linoleic acid CYP2J2 products 9,10-EPOME and 12,13-EPOME had no effect on TNFα release. As the receptors for epoxygenase products are poorly defined <xref rid="pone.0075107-Thomson1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> these findings are of particular interest, as the EETs and EPOMEs used here show clear and distinct regio-isomer specific action on phagocytosis and TNFα release, suggesting that specific receptor targets are present and in the future could be identified from these assays.</p>
              <p>To examine the potential mechanism by which CYP2J2 could regulate phagocytosis we screened a broad spectrum of phagocytosis receptors by RT-PCR. Of those tested, only CD11b (Mac-1, CR3) and CD68 showed regulation by epoxygenase inhibition, and both were reduced. As CD68 is considered an oxidized lipid receptor and not a bacterial sensing receptor <xref rid="pone.0075107-daSilva1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, we focused on CD11b. CD11b is a versatile pattern recognition receptor that can mediate both Gram negative (e.g. <italic>E. coli</italic>) as well as Gram positive bacterial phagocytosis <xref rid="pone.0075107-Ehlers1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. For example, CD11b is associated with gram positive <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> phagocytosis and killing <xref rid="pone.0075107-Drevets1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. We therefore tested whether live <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> uptake by macrophages could also be affected by epoxygenase inhibition. Similar to the <italic>E. coli</italic> bioparticle, intracellular uptake of live <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> was inhibited by SKF525A and reversed by 11,12-EET.</p>
              <p><italic>L. monocytogenes,</italic> like <italic>E. coli</italic>, has been found at higher levels in Crohn’s disease tissue <xref rid="pone.0075107-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Moreover, <italic>L. monocytogenes and E. coli</italic> infection are a side-effect of anti-TNFα therapy in Crohns disease <xref rid="pone.0075107-Izbeki1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0075107-Willson1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. CD11b has also been shown to be expressed at lower levels in Crohn’s disease compared to ulcerative colitis <xref rid="pone.0075107-Vainer1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. We therefore examined CYP2J2 in Crohn’s disease macrophages.</p>
              <p>The rested macrophages from Crohn’s disease patients similar to healthy controls had low levels of CYP2J2. However, unlike healthy controls, CYP2J2 was not induced by further <italic>E. coli</italic> stimulation. Interestingly, these results confirm some of our previous microarray analysis of macrophages from healthy controls, and patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease <xref rid="pone.0075107-Smith1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. CYP2J2 was one of the un-validated targets absent specifically in Crohn’s disease (but not ulcerative colitis) macrophages treated with heat inactivated <italic>E. coli</italic>. The mechanism for this lack of induction is currently under investigation. Although CYP2J2 polymorphisms, particularly the 50G-T promoter polymorphism have been associated with cardiovascular disease and hypertension in some populations <xref rid="pone.0075107-Askari1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref> a polymorphisms of the CYP2J2 pathway has yet to be associated with any other form of inflammatory disorder in man.</p>
              <p>The lack of CYP2J2 in response to inflammation may therefore mediate some of the macrophage defects observed in Crohn’s disease. Using epoxygenase/CYP2J2 inhibitors reveals a dysregulation in bacterial clearance which is also a hallmark of Crohn’s disease <xref rid="pone.0075107-Smith1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Crohn’s disease is strongly associated with defective bacterial handling that is also linked to abnormalities in autophagy pathways <xref rid="pone.0075107-Baumgart1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Interestingly, we found epoxygenases may also regulate macrophage autophagy. Treatment of THP-1 macrophages with SKF525A results in LC3-II induction similar to that of a known autophagy inducer rapamycin A (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0075107.s002">Figure S2</xref>) providing a further link between the two processes which relate to a Crohn’s disease phenotype.</p>
              <p>11,12-EET reversed the actions of epoxygenase inhibition in all the assays tested. Elevation of epoxygenase products using soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibitors or the use of EET-agonists/mimetics may therefore be a therapeutic avenue to correct in Crohn’s disease. sEH inhibitors attenuate the chronic colitis associated with IL-10 knockout in mice <xref rid="pone.0075107-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, indicating that epoxygenases are protective at least in animal models of bowel inflammation. Since CYP2J2 appears particularly dysregulated, our results suggest EET mimetics and/or sEH inhibitors may be of particular benefit in Crohn’s disease.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, we show CYP2J2 is an inflammatory induced epoxygenase that has anti-inflammatory actions, and promotes Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria phagocytosis. An absence of CYP2J2 in Crohn’s disease macrophages in response to bacterial infection may contribute to the pathogenesis of Crohn’s disease, in part via a reduced expression of CD11b. Elevating epoxygenase products or the use of 11,12-EET mimetics may provide useful therapeutic avenues for the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases and in particular may correct a defect present in Crohn’s disease.</p>

LC3-II lipidylation from LC3-I was determined by Western blotting and densometric analysis of the bands performed using ImageJ image analysis software. The figure shows the relative expression of LC3-II expression as a % of the RAPA induced LC3-II. Data represents mean±s.e.m. from n = 3 separate experiments. Epoxygenase inhibition induces a comparable level of LC3-II expression as RAPA, which is reversed either my co-incubation with the autophagy inhibitor 3 MA or 11,12-EET.</p>
