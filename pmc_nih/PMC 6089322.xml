                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Hypoxaemia is the most common complication during endotracheal intubation of critically ill adults, and it increases the risk of cardiac arrest and death. Manual ventilation between induction and intubation has been hypothesised to decrease the incidence of hypoxaemia, but efficacy and safety data are lacking.</p>

                  <p>The Preventing Hypoxemia with Manual Ventilation during Endotracheal Intubation trial is a prospective, multicentre, non-blinded randomised clinical trial being conducted in seven intensive care units in the USA. A total of 400 critically ill adults undergoing endotracheal intubation will be randomised 1:1 to receive prophylactic manual ventilation between induction and endotracheal intubation using a bag-valve-mask device or no prophylactic ventilation. The primary outcome is the lowest arterial oxygen saturation between induction and 2 min after successful endotracheal intubation, which will be analysed as an unadjusted, intention-to-treat comparison of patients randomised to prophylactic ventilation versus patients randomised to no prophylactic ventilation. The secondary outcome is the incidence of severe hypoxaemia, defined as any arterial oxygen saturation of less than 80% between induction and 2 min after endotracheal intubation. Enrolment began on 2 February 2017 and is expected to be complete in May 2018.</p>

              <p>Endotracheal intubation is common in the care of critically ill patients and is frequently associated with complications.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1–3</xref> Hypoxaemia occurs in approximately 40% of intubations outside the operating room, and is associated with an increased risk for cardiac arrest and death.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 4–7</xref>
</p>
              <p>Rapid sequence intubation is the nearly simultaneous administration of a sedative and neuromuscular blocking agent (paralytic) to facilitate endotracheal intubation. This technique is intended to maximise the chances of intubation on the first laryngoscopy attempt and minimise the risk of aspiration. Rapid sequence intubation has been shown to increase the incidence of successful intubation on the first laryngoscopy attempt and to decrease complications compared with intubation without neuromuscular blockade.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8–10</xref> Regardless of the choice of induction agent and neuromuscular blocker, rapid sequence intubation involves an inherent delay between medication administration and onset of paralysis, at which time laryngoscopy is initiated. The relative benefits and risks of providing ventilation to patients during this interval are unknown. Some airway management texts and guidelines recommend that, for patients who are not hypoxaemic, no ventilation be provided between induction and intubation, allowing the patient to remain hypopnoeic or apnoeic with the onset of sedation and neuromuscular blockade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>).<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11–18</xref> This approach prioritises minimising the potential risk of aspiration over any potential benefit of preventing the development of hypoxaemia and hypercapnia. Other airway management texts and guidelines recommend the provision of manual ventilation between induction and intubation using a bag-valve-mask device for all patients, including those who are not hypoxaemic (referred to hereafter as ‘prophylactic ventilation’) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2</xref>).<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 17 17 19–22</xref> This approach prioritises the potential benefit of preventing the development of hypoxaemia and hypercapnia over the potential risk of aspiration. National and international surveys of anaesthesiologists demonstrate that up to 50% of anaesthesia practitioners report routinely performing prophylactic ventilation between induction and intubation during out-of-operating room intubations.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23 24</xref> The most recent published guidelines on intubation of critically ill adults recognises the arguments for and against prophylactic ventilation without making any recommendation as to whether or not it should be used.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>

              <p>Hundreds of thousands of critically ill adults require endotracheal intubation each year in the USA alone, but despite the frequency of this procedure, there are currently no high-quality data available to help providers understand the potential benefits and risks of providing prophylactic ventilation between induction and intubation.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> To address this knowledge gap, we designed a multicentre, randomised trial comparing prophylactic ventilation to no prophylactic ventilation during endotracheal intubation of critically ill adults. We hypothesise that, compared with no prophylactic ventilation, prophylactic ventilation will significantly increase the lowest arterial oxygen saturation between induction and 2 min after endotracheal intubation.</p>

                <p>The Preventing Hypoxemia with Manual Ventilation during Endotracheal Intubation (PreVent) trial is a multicentre, parallel-group, unblinded, pragmatic randomised trial being conducted in seven intensive care units (ICUs) at five medical centres across the USA. The trial compares prophylactic manual ventilation between induction and endotracheal intubation using a bag-valve-mask device to no prophylactic ventilation during endotracheal intubation of critically ill adults. Enrolment began on 2 February 2017 and is expected to be complete in May 2018. The primary outcome is lowest arterial oxygen saturation between induction and 2 min after endotracheal intubation. The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov prior to initiation of patient enrolment (ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: NCT03026322). An independent data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) is monitoring the progress and safety of the trial.</p>

Study group assignments were placed in sequentially numbered opaque envelopes and distributed to the study ICUs. Group assignment remains concealed from local study personnel and treating clinicians until the determination has been made that a patient (1) requires endotracheal intubation, (2) meets all inclusion criteria and (3) meets no exclusion criteria—at which point the enveloped is opened.

                  <p>Ventilation between induction and endotracheal intubation refers to the delivery of positive pressure breaths using a non-invasive ventilator or a bag-valve-mask device. Prophylactic ventilation describes ventilation administered to a patient without hypoxaemia to prevent the development of hypoxaemia. Separately, ventilation may represent treatment of hypoxaemia for patients who are experiencing hypoxaemia at the initiation of ventilation. The focus of this trial is on the administration of manual ventilation with a bag-valve-mask device to prevent the development of hypoxaemia. Treatment of hypoxaemia with manual ventilation is not considered prophylactic ventilation and is allowed at any time in either study group. Administration of ventilation with a non-invasive ventilator between induction and laryngoscopy is prohibited in both study groups because it represents a source of confounding with regard to the provision of prophylactic ventilation. Preoxygenation prior to induction is allowed in either group with any preoxygenation modality, including non-invasive ventilation.</p>

                  <title>Prophylactic ventilation</title>
                  <p>For patients assigned to the prophylactic ventilation group, manual ventilation is provided using a bag-valve-mask device beginning at induction and continuing until the initiation of laryngoscopy. If more than one attempt at laryngoscopy occurs, manual ventilation using a bag-valve-mask device may be reinstituted between laryngoscopy attempts. Manual ventilation may be discontinued at any point if felt by the treating clinicians to be necessary for patient safety.</p>
                  <p>Manual ventilation with a bag-valve-mask device is a routinely employed technique familiar to clinicians who perform endotracheal intubation in the ICU. In keeping with the pragmatic nature of the trial, manual ventilation with a bag-valve-mask device is provided during the trial by the same treating clinicians who would perform the intervention outside of a research setting. Trainees responsible for airway management in participating units received an educational intervention prior to the beginning of enrolment reviewing best practices in manual ventilation using a bag-valve-mask device. This training emphasised proper mask placement, airway patency manoeuvres, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), oxygen flow rates and ideal ventilation rates and volumes. In addition, the group assignment sheet for the prophylactic ventilation group includes reminders of best practices for manual ventilation using a bag-valve-mask device, including instructions to use: oxygen flow rates of at least 15 L per minute; a PEEP valve set to 5–10 cm of water; an oral airway; a two-handed mask seal performed by the intubating clinician with a head tilt–chin lift (with a stock photograph demonstrating proper technique); and ventilation at 10 breaths per minute until laryngoscopy. Details of patients’ receipt of manual ventilation between induction and intubation are prospectively recorded. Failure to administer manual ventilation with a bag-valve-mask device beginning at induction is documented as a protocol violation.</p>

                  <p>Patients assigned to the no prophylactic ventilation group do not receive prophylactic ventilation between induction and intubation. Manual ventilation is allowed as treatment (1) for hypoxaemia (oxygen saturation &lt;90%) or (2) following a failed laryngoscopy attempt. In addition, manual ventilation may be initiated at any point if felt by the treating clinicians to be necessary for the safe treatment of the patient. Details of patients’ receipt of ventilation between induction and endotracheal intubation are prospectively recorded. Administration of ventilation using a bag-valve-mask device before the first attempt at laryngoscopy in a patient who does not experience hypoxaemia (oxygen saturation &lt;90%) is documented as a protocol violation. The group assignment sheet for the no prophylactic ventilation group includes reminders that apnoeic oxygenation is allowed, that non-invasive ventilation should be removed at induction and that bag-valve-mask ventilation is allowed for oxygen saturation &lt;90%.</p>

The optimal outcome for clinical trials attempting to improve oxygenation during endotracheal intubation of critically ill adults is unknown. In addition to the primary outcome of lowest arterial oxygen saturation as a continuous variable, some experts have recommended examination of the endpoint of ‘severe hypoxemia’ as a dichotomous outcome. We therefore highlight the incidence of oxygen saturation less than 80% as our prespecified approach to analysis of lowest oxygen saturation as a dichotomous outcome.

The outcomes of SpO<sub>2</sub>, FiO<sub>2</sub> and PEEP are selected to capture objective clinical manifestations of periprocedural aspiration. The time point of 6 to 24 hours postintubation is chosen to account for the practice, at some centres, of initiating patients at 100% FiO<sub>2</sub> and low PEEP immediately after intubation, and subsequently titrating FiO<sub>2</sub> and PEEP over several hours to achieve the target SpO<sub>2</sub>.</p>

                <p>Full details of the initial sample size calculation can be found in the online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">supplementary file 1</xref>, section 5. In short, using PS V.3.1.2<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> and assuming an SD of 14% in lowest oxygen saturation (the primary outcome) and less than 5% missing data, we calculated that enrolling 350 patients would provide 90% power to detect a difference of 5% between groups in lowest oxygen saturation at a two-sided alpha of 0.05. The trial protocol and DSMB charter specified that the DSMB would recommend sample size re-estimation at the interim analysis if the SD for lowest oxygen saturation in the control arm was larger than 14%, in order to prevent the final study from being underpowered to detect the planned difference between groups in lowest oxygen saturation. At the interim analysis, the observed SD for lowest oxygen saturation in the control arm was 15%. To maintain 90% statistical power to detect a 5% difference between groups in lowest oxygen saturation, the DMSB recommended increasing the sample size to 400 patients. Additional details of the sample size re-estimation can be found in the online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">supplementary file 1</xref>, section 6.</p>

                <title>DSMB and interim analysis</title>
                <p>An independent DSMB was appointed to oversee the conduct of the trial and review one interim analysis (DSMB charter available in the online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">supplementary file 1</xref>, section 7). The DSMB was composed of two academic intensivists experienced in the conduct of clinical trials. The DSMB conducted a single interim analysis for efficacy and safety at the anticipated halfway point of the trial, after enrolment of 175 patients. The stopping boundary for efficacy was specified as a p value of 0.001 or less for the difference between groups in the primary outcome. Use of a conservative Haybittle-Peto boundary (p&lt;0.001) allows the final analysis to be performed using an unchanged level of significance (p=0.05). The primary determination of safety was based on the highest FiO<sub>2</sub> and highest PEEP between 6 and 24 hours after intubation. If (1) the p value for the difference between study groups in both of these physiologic variables was less than 0.001, (2) the difference between groups in both physiological variables was concordant in direction with the point estimate for in-hospital mortality, and (3) the p value for the difference between study groups in in-hospital mortality was less than 0.1, it was recommended that the study be stopped early for safety.</p>
                <p>The DSMB was also provided with data in each group on the rates of operator-reported aspiration and new infiltrates, pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum on chest imaging. Although no prespecified rules dictated stopping based on operator-reported aspiration or imaging findings without associated changes in physiological or clinical outcomes, the DSMB reserved the right to stop the trial at any point, request additional data or interim analyses or request modifications of the study protocol as required to protect patient safety.</p>
                <p>At the time of submission of this manuscript, the DSMB has completed the sole planned interim analysis following the enrolment of the first 175 patients. The DSMB has recommended continuing the trial to completion with the only change being to increase the sample size to 400 patients, as described above.</p>

                  <p>Prophylactic manual ventilation between induction and endotracheal intubation using a bag-valve-mask device and no prophylactic ventilation are each recommended approaches to endotracheal intubation of acutely ill adults.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13 25</xref> Currently, no randomised trials or evidence-based guidelines support the choice of one approach over the other. Both approaches are used intermittently in current care in the study ICUs. Moreover, the current study specifically excludes patients for whom treating clinicians feel that the provision of prophylactic ventilation is either required or contraindicated.</p>
                  <p>The current study is felt by the investigators to represent minimal risk because the interventions studied (1) are used in current clinical care in the participating ICUs, (2) are interventions to which patients would be exposed even if not participating in research, (3) have no prior data to suggest the superiority of one approach over the other, and (4) are equivalent options from the perspective of the treating clinicians performing the procedure (otherwise the patient is excluded from the trial). Additionally, endotracheal intubation of critically ill adults is frequently a time-sensitive procedure for which obtaining informed consent is impractical. Given the minimal risk and impracticability of obtaining informed consent, a waiver of informed consent was requested from the Vanderbilt University Institutional Review Board.</p>

              <p>We describe, before the conclusion of enrolment or data unblinding, our approach to analysing the data from a pragmatic multicentre randomised trial comparing prophylactic ventilation between induction and intubation using a bag-valve-mask to no prophylactic ventilation (PreVent trial).
