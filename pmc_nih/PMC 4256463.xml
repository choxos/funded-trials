              <abstract>
                <p>Damaged cardiac valves attract blood-borne bacteria, and infective endocarditis is often caused by viridans group streptococci. While such bacteria use multiple adhesins to maintain their normal oral commensal state, recognition of platelet sialoglycans provides an intermediary for binding to damaged valvular endocardium. We use a customized sialoglycan microarray to explore the varied binding properties of phylogenetically related serine-rich repeat adhesins, the GspB, Hsa, and SrpA homologs from <italic>Streptococcus gordonii</italic> and <italic>Streptococcus sanguinis</italic> species, which belong to a highly conserved family of glycoproteins that contribute to virulence for a broad range of Gram-positive pathogens. Binding profiles of recombinant soluble homologs containing novel sialic acid-recognizing Siglec-like domains correlate well with binding of corresponding whole bacteria to arrays. These bacteria show multiple modes of glycan, protein, or divalent cation-dependent binding to synthetic glycoconjugates and isolated glycoproteins in vitro. However, endogenous asialoglycan-recognizing clearance receptors are known to ensure that only fully sialylated glycans dominate in the endovascular system, wherein we find these particular streptococci become primarily dependent on their Siglec-like adhesins for glycan-mediated recognition events. Remarkably, despite an excess of alternate sialoglycan ligands in cellular and soluble blood components, these adhesins selectively target intact bacteria to sialylated ligands on platelets, within human whole blood. These preferred interactions are inhibited by corresponding recombinant soluble adhesins, which also preferentially recognize platelets. Our data indicate that circulating platelets may act as inadvertent Trojan horse carriers of oral streptococci to the site of damaged endocardium, and provide an explanation why it is that among innumerable microbes that gain occasional access to the bloodstream, certain viridans group streptococci have a selective advantage in colonizing damaged cardiac valves and cause infective endocarditis.</p>

                <p>Bacterial infective endocarditis remains a disease with considerable morbidity and mortality. Of the numerous bacteria that can enter the bloodstream, certain oral commensal viridans group streptococci are among the major causative organisms of endocarditis. However, mechanisms underlying this selectivity are incompletely understood. Interactions between adhesins of such bacteria and human platelet sialoglycans are believed to play an important role in this selectivity, by facilitating bacterial adherence to damaged heart valves. Nevertheless, the molecular requirements for these interactions are not fully explored. Particularly, it is unclear whether selective targeting of platelets by these bacteria actually occurs in fluid human whole blood, an environment where numerous potential sialoglycan competitors exist. In the present work, we have addressed these important issues. We characterize in detail the glycan-binding spectra of a series of serine-rich repeat adhesins of oral streptococci. For the first time, we demonstrate that oral streptococci can indeed selectively target platelets in whole human blood. As a proof of concept, we also show that soluble recombinant bacterial adhesin binding region proteins can block the preferred platelet-bacterial interactions in whole blood. The knowledge gained from this study may help the development of novel preventive or therapeutic approaches against infective endocarditis.</p>

              <p>Infective endocarditis (IE) remains a disease with considerable morbidity and mortality <xref rid="ppat.1004540-Werdan1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004540-Baddour1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Of the numerous bacteria that have the opportunity to enter the bloodstream, three major genera of Gram-positive pathogens (streptococci, staphylococci and enterococci) dominate in IE. Streptococci and staphylococci account for 80% of IE cases <xref rid="ppat.1004540-Hoen1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, and viridans group streptococci, including <italic>Streptococcus gordonii</italic> and <italic>Streptococcus sanguinis</italic>, make up to half of such cases <xref rid="ppat.1004540-Murdoch1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Unlike the intrinsically virulent staphylococci, streptococci causing IE are commensal species that normally reside in the oral cavity and show relatively weak or no pathogenicity. However, they have the potential to cause life-threatening IE when they enter the bloodstream through lesions in the oral epithelia or after dental procedures <xref rid="ppat.1004540-Duval1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. The question arises as to why these particular organisms have such a selective advantage in causing IE. Answers to this question are of importance in preventing and treating this serious disease.</p>
              <p>The pathogenesis of IE is complex but bacterial adherence to damaged heart valves is a required event <xref rid="ppat.1004540-Werdan1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004540-Moreillon1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Platelets appear to play a crucial role in pathogenesis, as the streptococci associated with IE can bind to platelet components to initiate adherence to damaged human heart valves <xref rid="ppat.1004540-Moreillon2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Several streptococcal adhesins are known to bind human platelets <xref rid="ppat.1004540-Kerrigan1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>â<xref rid="ppat.1004540-Plummer1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Among the best characterized are GspB and Hsa of <italic>S. gordonii</italic> and SrpA of <italic>S. sanguinis</italic>, all belonging to a conserved family of serine-rich repeat (SRR) glycoproteins <xref rid="ppat.1004540-Bensing2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>â<xref rid="ppat.1004540-Plummer1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. The SRR glycoproteins and corresponding specialized secretion systems are being defined in a growing number of pathogens, indicating their important roles in the behavior of Gram-positive organisms <xref rid="ppat.1004540-Lizcano1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004540-Bensing3" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. However, we are only beginning to understand the functions of this interesting family of proteins.</p>
              <p>All human cell surfaces are covered by a dense and complex layer of glycans <xref rid="ppat.1004540-Varki1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>â<xref rid="ppat.1004540-Hart1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Glycan-mediated host-pathogen interactions are involved in various human disease processes <xref rid="ppat.1004540-Nizet1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Sialic acids (Sias) are a diverse group of Î±-keto acids with a shared nine-carbon backbone <xref rid="ppat.1004540-Angata1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004540-Deng1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Given their presence at terminal positions of cell surface and secreted glycoconjugates, they mediate or modulate various biological interactions <xref rid="ppat.1004540-Varki2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004540-Varki3" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Interestingly, GspB, Hsa and SrpA are all Sia-binding adhesins. GspB, the SRR adhesin from <italic>S. gordonii</italic> strain M99, was recently found to contain a subdomain in its binding region (BR) <xref rid="ppat.1004540-Pyburn1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, with the topology and strand inserts similar to the V-set Ig-like fold adopted by mammalian <underline>s</underline>ialic acid binding <underline>i</underline>mmuno<underline>g</underline>lobulin-like <underline>lec</underline>tins (Siglecs) <xref rid="ppat.1004540-Crocker1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Each of the other two homologous SRR adhesins, Hsa from <italic>S. gordonii</italic> strain DL1 and SrpA from <italic>S. sanguinis</italic> strain SK36, also contains a Siglec-like subdomain in their BRs <xref rid="ppat.1004540-Pyburn1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.</p>
              <p>Taken together, existing data suggests that the Sia-binding capabilities of GspB, Hsa and SrpA are conferred by their Siglec-like modules, and that such binding assists interactions with platelets. This surface property may help targeting the bacteria to the coagulum made of platelets and other components on damaged cardiac valves and act as a contributory factor in the pathogenesis of IE. However, detailed characterization of cognate ligands of such adhesins is lacking. It is also not known whether these bacteria could selectively target platelets in fluid human whole blood, a process that is under-explored but may contribute to the pathogenesis of IE <xref rid="ppat.1004540-Werdan1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. This question is of particular interest also because the endovascular system is an environment where numerous potential sialoglycan competitors exist <xref rid="ppat.1004540-Gopaul1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Such selectivity would thus play an essential role for the successful delivery and adhesion of bacteria to damaged valvular endocardium, and provide an explanation to the selective advantage of certain types of bacteria in causing IE.</p>
              <p>Here we utilize a number of complementary techniques and novel assays to study the role of the Siglec-like domain-containing SRR-adhesins in bacterial recognition of host sialoglycans. We explore mechanisms of these bacterial interactions with saliva and in whole blood. Our finding extends previous understanding of the mechanisms of infective endocarditis. The novel insights gained help us to better understand the contribution of Sia-binding adhesins in the pathogenesis of IE. In particular, we address questions including the following: 1) What are the detailed sialoglycan-binding characteristics of GspB-BR, Hsa-BR, and SrpA-BR?; 2) Are the Siglec-like BRs of these adhesins responsible for whole bacterial recognition of sialoglycans?; 3) Are Siglec-like domain-containing SRR adhesins common among oral streptococci, and is there a good phylogeny-function relationship?; 4) How do these oral streptococci interact with saliva from the oral cavity, and with blood components from the bloodstream?; and 5) Can these bacteria preferentially recognize platelets in the setting of whole human blood via Sia-adhesin interactions, despite numerous potential sialoglycoprotein competitors from plasma and surfaces of other blood cells?</p>
              <p>In addressing the last issue, we have developed a novel whole blood-whole bacterium flow cytometry assay that is most relevant to bona fide human conditions. For the first time, we have demonstrated that oral streptococci can indeed selectively target platelets in human whole blood. It appears that circulating platelets may act as inadvertent Trojan horse carriers of oral streptococci to the site of damaged endocardium. By serendipity, certain sialoglycan-binding properties that facilitate normal oral commensalism seem to have set these bacteria up to be inadvertent, yet highly specific causative agents of endocarditis, via platelet intermediaries. As a proof of concept, we have also shown that soluble recombinant bacterial adhesin binding region proteins can block the preferred platelet-bacterial interactions in whole blood. The knowledge gained may contribute to the development of novel preventive or therapeutic approaches against infective endocarditis.</p>

                <p>GspB-BR interacted with a very narrow spectrum of sialoglycans, primarily Neu5AcÎ±2-3GalÎ²1-3GalNAcÎ±1- (Glycan #15, the <underline>s</underline>ialyl <underline>T a</underline>ntigen, sTa) and related structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004540-g001">Figure 1A and 1D</xref>). 9-<italic>O</italic>-Acetylation of the Neu5Ac moiety of sTa (Glycan #9, compared to #15) did not influence binding significantly. Sulfation of underlying glycans also showed no effect (Glycans #57, 58 and 62, 63, compared to #55, 56, and 11, 12, respectively). In contrast, Hsa-BR bound a broad range of Sias with different underlying glycans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004540-g001">Figure 1B and 1D</xref>). Conspicuously, it recognized all Î±2-3-linked Sias but not any Î±2-6- or Î±2-8-linked ones. This finding expands on previous studies, which showed that Hsa could bind Î±2-3-linked Sias with three different underlying glycans, specifically, sTa, Neu5AcÎ±2-3GalÎ²1-4GlcNAcÎ²1- (3â²SLn) and Neu5AcÎ±2-3GalÎ²1-4GlcÎ²1- (3â²SL) structures <xref rid="ppat.1004540-Takahashi2" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004540-Takamatsu1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Our microarray displays Sias with over 10 different underlying glycans (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004540.s010">Table S2</xref>), and it appears that every Î±2-3-linked Sia present on the array could be bound by Hsa-BR (Glycans #1, 2, 7-16, 21, 22, 25, 26, 29, 30, 33-36, 39, 40, 55-58, and 60-63) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004540-g001">Figure 1B and 1D</xref>). Similar to GspB-BR, 9-<italic>O</italic>-acetylation on Sia did not block Hsa-BR binding. In contrast to GspB-BR, Hsa-BR could not only recognize tri- and oligo-saccharide Sias, but also di-saccharide Sias (Glycans #25, 26, 29, 30). Sulfation significantly increased binding (Glycans #57, 58 and 62, 63, compared to #55, 56, and 11, 12, respectively). Notably, SrpA-BR recognized sialoglycans in a manner resembling Hsa-BR more than GspB-BR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004540-g001">Figure 1C</xref>), showing binding to both di-saccharide and tri-/oligo-saccharide Sias. Sulfation also increased binding. Moreover, we tested the maltose-binding protein (MBP)-tagged Hsa-BR, which showed the same binding characteristics as GST-tagged Hsa-BR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004540.s001">Figure S1</xref>), indicating that tagging methods did not alter adhesin binding.</p>

                <p>To test whether the SRR adhesin-BR fusion proteins faithfully represent the binding properties of the corresponding whole organisms, we assessed direct binding of strains M99, DL1, and SK36 to the same microarray. To confirm that binding was due to expression of the adhesin, we also tested isogenic variants of each strain, in which the gene encoding the SRR glycoprotein had been deleted (M99Î<italic>gspB</italic>, DL1Î<italic>hsa</italic>, and SK36Î<italic>srpA</italic>). Prior glycan microarray studies using whole bacteria were characterized by high background noise or no success at all (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.functionalglycomics.org/glycomics/publicdata/selectedScreens.jsp">http://www.functionalglycomics.org/glycomics/publicdata/selectedScreens.jsp</ext-link>). However, our current efforts at optimization yielded good signal-to-noise ratios (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004540.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Notably, DL1 and M99 showed nearly identical binding profiles as their respective adhesins, Hsa and GspB, on the array (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004540-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). In keeping with the relatively low binding of SrpA to the arrayed Sias (see mean relative fluorescence intensities in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004540-g001">Figure 1Aâ1C</xref>), the corresponding bacteria SK36 showed minimal binding. Importantly, all adhesin-deficient mutant strains showed no binding to the sialosides on the microarrays. Thus, whole bacterial binding to the immobilized sialoglycans was SRR adhesin-dependent.</p>

                <p>The SRR glycoproteins comprise a large family of adhesins in Gram-positive bacteria <xref rid="ppat.1004540-Lizcano1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. To determine the prevalence of Siglec-like domain-containing adhesins in the family, we searched public databases and gathered additional sequence data from our lab collection (strains PS478, 72-40, and G9B). Seventeen additional predicted SRR homologs of GspB, Hsa, and SrpA were identified based on their Siglec-like domain-containing BR sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004540-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). While GspB clustered with five other SRR proteins, Hsa and SrpA appeared in a different branch, and were more closely related to each other than to GspB. The phylogenetic relationship agreed with their functional relationships in terms of ligand repertoire (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004540-g001">Figure 1Aâ1C</xref>). To further demonstrate this phylogeny-function relationship, we produced additional GST-tagged adhesin-BR proteins (GspB<sub>PS478</sub>BR, GspB<sub>72-40</sub>BR, and GspB<sub>G9B</sub>BR), which differ from GspB<sub>M99</sub>BR by only a few amino acid residues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004540.s003">Figure S3</xref>). We then labeled the corresponding whole bacteria (strains PS478, 72-40, and G9B), and tested the organisms together with their adhesin-BRs on the same sialoglycan microarray. The new adhesin-BRs displayed binding properties that were nearly identical to those of GspB<sub>M99</sub>BR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004540.s004">Figure S4</xref>). The strains also showed binding patterns nearly identical to that of their adhesins, as well as to strain M99, whereas an adhesin-deficient mutant of 72-40 (PS1070) <xref rid="ppat.1004540-Takamatsu2" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> showed no binding to any sialoglycan. Moreover, the glycan-binding properties of all above-mentioned adhesin-BR fusion proteins were confirmed by a conventional enzyme-linked lectin assay <xref rid="ppat.1004540-Pyburn1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, using two model glycans, sTa and 3â²SLn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004540-g002">Figure 2B and 2C</xref>).</p>

                <title>Bacteria show multiple modes of binding to human saliva, purified glycoproteins and related glycoconjugates</title>
                <p>Streptococci normally reside in the oral cavity, where they use multiple adhesins for commensal interactions <xref rid="ppat.1004540-Jenkinson1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, and only a subset of strains are known to become opportunistic pathogens in the endovascular environment, causing diseases such as IE. We thus wanted to probe the broader range of adhesins on DL1, M99 and SK36, asking if they use the same adhesins in the oral cavity for colonization and in the bloodstream. We used a dot blot assay to assess bacterial binding to whole human saliva, salivary ductal secretions, isolated and purified glycoproteins, and related glycoconjugates. In addition, we examined whether binding required divalent cations.</p>
                <p>Under divalent cation-chelating conditions (+EDTA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004540-g003">Figure 3A</xref>, see substrate info in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004540.s005">Figure S5</xref>), wild type DL1 bound saliva samples A1, A3, and A5, but not de-sialylated samples A2, A4 and A6. Similarly, DL1 interacted with various sialylated glycoproteins but showed much reduced or no binding to corresponding desialylated glycoproteins. These included, for example, salivary mucins MUC5B (B1) and MUC7 (B3). When the adhesin-deficient strain DL1Î<italic>hsa</italic> was used under the same conditions in the bacterial overlay, binding was not seen.

                <p>In contrast, the binding profiles changed considerably in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004540-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Additional binding activities that did not involve Sias were observed and those interactions largely obscured the Sia-dependent patterns seen in EDTA. Most conspicuously, DL1 bound to <italic>N</italic>-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc)-terminated structures (G5, K1, K3 and K4), and these interactions were still present with the Hsa-deficient mutant. This fits previous findings <xref rid="ppat.1004540-Takahashi3" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, indicating that lectin-like adhesins apart from the Sia-binding ones are also expressed on such oral streptococci. Similarly, M99 bound to terminal Î²-galactose (Gal) glycan structures (I6, and K6), while SK36 also interacted with GalNAc-terminated structures, as was seen with DL1 (G5, K1, K3 and K4) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004540.s005">Figure S5</xref>).</p>
                <p>Taken together, the data indicate that these bacteria express additional adhesins beyond Sia-binding ones. These multiple adhesins likely evolved to interact with salivary and oral mucosal glycoproteins and/or other glyco-epitopes, e.g. the ones present in Gal/GalNAc receptor polysaccharides on coaggregating bacterial strains <xref rid="ppat.1004540-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, which could be essential for their biofilm formation and colonization in the oral cavity. Moreover, the asialoglycan-binding adhesins require divalent cations for action, unlike the Sia-binding SRR-adhesins.</p>

                <title>Streptococcal strains primarily depend on Sia-binding adhesins to hemagglutinate red blood cells in vitro</title>
                <p>When oral streptococci enter the bloodstream, they encounter a drastically different environment, with regard to terminal glycan sequences available for adhesin binding. Unlike the case in the oral cavity, terminal Gal and GalNAc residues are not tolerated on plasma- or blood cell surface glycoconjugates, as they are immediately recognized for clearance by receptors on hepatocytes or macrophages <xref rid="ppat.1004540-Wahrenbrock1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004540-Sorensen1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Instead, the endovascular system is an environment where numerous sialoglycans exist <xref rid="ppat.1004540-Gopaul1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Thus, the Sia-binding SRR adhesins should theoretically become the more prominent determinants of glycan-mediated binding in the bloodstream. To test this hypothesis we probed interactions of DL1 and DL1Î<italic>hsa</italic> with human RBCs in traditional hemagglutination assays, in the presence or absence of EDTA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004540-g003">Figure 3Câ3F</xref>). Hemagglutination was comparable under all conditions when untreated RBCs were used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004540-g003">Figure 3C</xref>, all three rows), i.e., independent of divalent cations. Moreover, no hemagglutination was observed with DL1Î<italic>hsa</italic> under any condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004540-g003">Figure 3D</xref>, all three rows). Thus, GalNAc- or Gal-binding adhesins do not contribute significantly to bacterial hemagglutination, which is predominantly mediated by Sia-recognition.</p>
                <p>In contrast, when the RBCs were sialidase-treated and underlying glycans were exposed, DL1 bound avidly to such RBCs in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004540-g003">Figure 3E</xref>, third row). Furthermore, this was independent of the Sia-binding adhesin Hsa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004540-g003">Figure 3F</xref>, third row). These hemagglutination reactions were most likely mediated by GalNAc- and/or Gal-binding adhesins expressed on DL1, when their ligands on RBCs became exposed by sialidase treatment, and in the presence of divalent cations. Indeed, neither DL1 nor DL1Î<italic>hsa</italic> showed any hemagglutination of sialidase-treated RBCs when Ca<sup>2+</sup>/Mg<sup>2+</sup> were absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004540-g003">Figure 3E and 3F</xref>, first two rows).</p>
                <p>Taken together, the results fit the finding that normal RBCs are primarily covered by sialoglycans without many exposed GalNAc or Gal residues <xref rid="ppat.1004540-Bratosin1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Although DL1 possesses both the Sia-binding adhesin and other adhesins including other types of lectin-like adhesins, the bacterium depends primarily on the former to bind RBCs. In the oral cavity, where these streptococci normally reside, they likely utilize many kinds of adhesins evolved for colonization <xref rid="ppat.1004540-Takahashi3" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004540-Nobbs1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. However, when they enter the blood stream, an environment where Sias dominate the terminal glycome, they become primarily dependent on their Sia-reactive SRR adhesins to mediate binding.</p>

                <p>Although binding of the different strains to separate human blood components has been studied by us and others, evaluation of such binding in human whole blood has not been addressed to date. However, the latter approach is most biomedically relevant. Bacteria entering the bloodstream would encounter â¼2 mM concentration of competing sialoglycoproteins in the plasma <xref rid="ppat.1004540-Crook1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref> and over 100-fold larger total RBC surface area than that of platelets (average single RBC surface area: 2Sâ=â2ÃÏr<sup>2</sup>â=â2Ã3.14Ã(4 Âµm)<sup>2</sup>, and average RBC count: 4.40â6.00Ã10<sup>6</sup>/ÂµL; average single platelet surface area: 2Sâ=â2ÃÏr<sup>2</sup>â=â2Ã3.14Ã(1.5 Âµm)<sup>2</sup>, and average platelet count: 0.14â0.40Ã10<sup>6</sup>/ÂµL). Thus the question arises as to whether these bacteria can preferentially detect platelets under such conditions.</p>
                <p>To address this question we developed a novel whole bacterium-whole blood flow cytometry (WBWB-FC) assay, in which fluorochrome-labeled bacteria and antibodies were mixed into fresh anti-coagulated human blood, allowed to interact for short time, and then rapidly diluted before immediate analysis by flow cytometry. Two distinct populations of cells were seen when the mixture was analyzed by forward (FSC) and side scatter (SSC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004540-g005">Figure 5A, 5D, 5J and 5M</xref>).

This is not surprising considering the ubiquity of sialic acids on host cell surfaces and in mucosal secretions, and their usual occurrence at terminal positions of various glycoproteins and glycolipids <xref rid="ppat.1004540-Varki3" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Notably, 70%â90% of streptococcal strains from a collection of <italic>S. sanguinis</italic>, <italic>S. gordonii</italic>, and <italic>S. oralis</italic> species were reported to express sialic acid-reactive adhesins, unlike the other streptococcal species such as the <italic>S. anginosus</italic>
<xref rid="ppat.1004540-Hsu1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. This is in intriguing coincidence with independent findings that <italic>S. sanguinis</italic>, <italic>S. gordonii</italic>, and <italic>S. oralis</italic> are among the leading causative organisms of streptococcal IE <xref rid="ppat.1004540-Simmon1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. Taken together, the Sia-adhesin mechanism we have elaborated in the current study might play a much more prevalent role in the pathogenesis of IE than currently recognized. Of course, such a mechanism may not be restricted to SRR type adhesins that we emphasize in the present work.</p>
              <p>On a broader scale, SRR glycoproteins constitute an important family of conserved cell surface proteins associated with Gram-positive pathogenesis. Among the important questions arising, it is imperative to achieve full characterization of cognate ligands for these adhesins <xref rid="ppat.1004540-Lizcano1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. In this regard, glycan microarrays serve as a valuable tool. It allows simultaneous screening of hundreds of glycan-protein interactions in a high-throughput manner and only requires minimal materials. For the first time, we characterize in detail the glycan-binding spectra of a series of serine-rich repeat adhesins of oral streptococci. This is a highly conserved family of glycoproteins that contribute to virulence for a broad range of Gram-positive pathogens <xref rid="ppat.1004540-Lizcano1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. The information may help us to understand tissue and site tropism of the streptococcal adhesion within the oral cavity and elsewhere.</p>
              <p>Useful glycoanalytical probes are also identified. The bacterial adhesin Hsa-BR fusion protein shows great promise in replacing plant lectins MAL-I and MAL-II as a broad-range probe for Î±2-3-linked sialic acids. For instance, to our knowledge, there was not a good lectin for glycan microarray quality control to probe all Î±2-3-linked sialic acids. Hsa-BR will thus prove useful in such efforts as well as in other applications including cell and tissue staining. It is also gratifying to have achieved successful whole bacterial binding onto sialoglycan microarrays, which enables direct comparison of glycan-binding properties between whole bacteria and their corresponding adhesins. This approach not only confirms that adhesin-BRs faithfully represent the Sia-binding properties of corresponding whole organisms, but also demonstrates that the Siglec-like domain-containing SRR adhesins are responsible for the observed binding.</p>
              <p>Whole bacteria bind defined sialoglycoproteins in a Sia- and SRR adhesin-dependent manner as well. The evaluation of divalent cation effects on adhesin binding also provides valuable information for understanding differential contribution of bacterial adhesins in different biological niches. In the oral cavity, where free divalent cation concentrations in saliva usually exceed 1 mM in healthy individuals <xref rid="ppat.1004540-Gradinaru1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, the multiple Ca<sup>2+</sup>/Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent adhesins on different bacteria bind their receptors and obscure the Ca<sup>2+</sup>/Mg<sup>2+</sup>-independent Sia-adhesin recognition events. In human blood, the normal plasma level of divalent cations typically exceeds 2 mM <xref rid="ppat.1004540-Gradinaru1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. However, the Ca<sup>2+</sup>/Mg<sup>2+</sup>-independent sialic acid-reactive SRR-adhesins become dominant in recognition events in the bloodstream.</p>
              <p>Animal models of IE have been used for decades as tools for examining this disease <xref rid="ppat.1004540-Garrison1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>â<xref rid="ppat.1004540-Takahashi4" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. However, there are general concerns about merely relying on animal models to infer human relevance <xref rid="ppat.1004540-vanderWorp1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004540-Perel1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. For example, studies of sepsis in mice versus humans have shown markedly different outcomes, which were corroborated by markedly different gene expression profiles <xref rid="ppat.1004540-Seok1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. Also, marked differences among human and animal glycomes exist <xref rid="ppat.1004540-Varki4" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004540-Cummings1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. In this regard, our whole bacterium-whole human blood evaluation is highly complementary to animal studies and most relevant to the native human conditions.</p>
              <p>Compared to conventional in vitro studies, several advantages are evident with the WBWB-FC assays developed here. For example, these assays faithfully present all components involved in real human conditions (other than endothelium), a feature incomparable by any other experimental system. Minimal sample manipulation is required. No RBC lysis, wash or separation steps are required, rendering the assays fast and facile. Minimizing manipulations of whole blood not only avoids loss of cells, but also ensures minimal alterations to blood cell phenotypes so that results obtained reflect more accurately the in vivo situations. In addition, the method allows routine analysis using whole blood volumes of merely 10 ÂµL per tube, a considerable reduction compared to standard methods. Finally, the assay is simple, sensitive, and reproducible.</p>
              <p>The WBWB-FC assays in the present work provide the first definitive evidence that these oral streptococci can preferentially recognize platelets in intact human whole blood, despite the numerous alternative sialoglycoprotein ligands in plasma and on other blood cells. This preferential platelet-bacterial interaction readily occurs in the fluid whole blood, and may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of IE. Platelets may thus act as discriminative vehicles to deliver particular Sia-binding bacteria to damaged valvular endocardium. In other words, these bacteria inadvertently hitch a ride on circulating platelets and the platelets act as Trojan horse carriers of oral streptococci to the site of damaged endocardium.</p>
              <p>Aside from novel mechanistic insights, the present work also provides valuable information from a biomedical point of view. Recent guidelines on the prevention of infective endocarditis have greatly reduced the indications for antimicrobial prophylaxis, in part because of concerns that the risks of these agents may outweigh the benefits <xref rid="ppat.1004540-Nishimura1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004540-Wray1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>. Targeting virulence has been proposed as a promising means to reduce antibiotic use and circumvent increasing antibiotic resistance <xref rid="ppat.1004540-Clatworthy1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004540-Nathan1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>. The various sialoglycan ligands identified by our glycan microarray screening might be used to produce glycan-based inhibitors against bacterial adhesion, and the rigorously verified Sia-binding adhesin-BR proteins could be potentially developed into prophylactic drugs to block the host target which the opportunistic pathogens exploit to cause IE. As a proof of concept, we have shown that Hsa-BR can successfully block corresponding DL1 binding to platelets in intact human whole blood. Alternatively, these adhesin-BR proteins might be explored as vaccines to boost immunity and generate blocking antibodies against such streptococcal infections. Moreover, the WBWB-FC assay provides a novel method for determination of susceptibility of culprit pathogens to potential virulence inhibitors.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, our data provide an explanation why it is that among numerous microbes that can gain access to the bloodstream, certain viridans group streptococci have a selective advantage in colonizing damaged cardiac valves. Unlike the common situation where pathogens systematically evolve virulence by optimizing binding to specific host targets, this is a case wherein sialoglycan-binding properties that aid normal oral commensalism inadvertently predispose these bacteria to become serendipitous, yet highly specific pathogens.</p>
