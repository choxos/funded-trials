                  <title>Purpose</title>
                  <p>Bosutinib is a potent dual SRC/ABL kinase inhibitor approved for adults with Philadelphia chromosome–positive chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) resistant and /or intolerant to prior therapy. We assessed the efficacy and safety of bosutinib versus imatinib for first-line treatment of chronic-phase CML.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>In this ongoing, multinational, phase III study, 536 patients with newly diagnosed chronic-phase CML were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive 400 mg of bosutinib once daily (n = 268) or imatinib (n = 268). Per protocol, efficacy was assessed in patients who were Philadelphia chromosome–positive with typical (e13a2/e14a2) transcripts (bosutinib, n = 246; imatinib, n = 241). Patients with Philadelphia chromosome–negative–/<italic>BCR-ABL1</italic>–positive status and those with unknown Philadelphia chromosome status and/or atypical <italic>BCR-ABL1</italic> transcript type were excluded from this population.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>The major molecular response (MMR) rate at 12 months (primary end point) was significantly higher with bosutinib versus imatinib (47.2% <italic>v</italic> 36.9%, respectively; <italic>P =</italic> .02), as was complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) rate by 12 months (77.2% <italic>v</italic> 66.4%, respectively; <italic>P =</italic> .0075). Cumulative incidence was favorable with bosutinib (MMR: hazard ratio, 1.34; <italic>P =</italic> .0173; CCyR: hazard ratio, 1.38; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), with earlier response times. Four patients (1.6%) receiving bosutinib and six patients (2.5%) receiving imatinib experienced disease progression to accelerated/blast phase. Among treated patients, 22.0% of patients receiving bosutinib and 26.8% of patients receiving imatinib discontinued treatment, most commonly for drug-related toxicity (12.7% and 8.7%, respectively). Grade ≥ 3 diarrhea (7.8% <italic>v</italic> 0.8%) and increased ALT (19.0% <italic>v</italic> 1.5%) and AST (9.7% <italic>v</italic> 1.9%) levels were more common with bosutinib. Cardiac and vascular toxicities were uncommon.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p>Patients who received bosutinib had significantly higher rates of MMR and CCyR and achieved responses faster than those who received imatinib. Consistent with the known safety profile, GI events and transaminase elevations were more common with bosutinib. Results indicate bosutinib may be an effective first-line treatment for chronic-phase CML.</p>

              <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
              <p>Management of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) has changed significantly since the development of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), with greatly improved response rates and lower risk of transformation<sup><xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> translating into a relative survival similar to that of the general population.<sup><xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>-<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> This evolution has been paralleled by the establishment of increasingly stringent criteria for clinical response. In the era of TKIs,<sup><xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) became the minimum acceptable response, with greater emphasis placed on achieving major molecular response (MMR) and deeper molecular responses.</p>
              <p>Bosutinib is a second-generation TKI with considerable activity against the BCR-ABL1 kinase and most imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL1 mutants except T315I and V299L.<sup><xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Bosutinib 500 mg daily is approved for use in CML as second- or subsequent-line therapy. In a phase I/II study, significant clinical activity was reported with bosutinib in patients with CML resistant and/or intolerant to prior TKIs and in patients with advanced disease.<sup><xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>-<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> This led to a randomized trial of bosutinib versus imatinib as initial therapy for patients with Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)–positive chronic phase (CP) CML (Bosutinib Efficacy and Safety in Newly Diagnosed Chronic Myeloid Leukemia [BELA]).<sup><xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Despite an improvement in MMR rate at 12 months, shorter time to response, and a lower rate of transformation to accelerated phase (AP) or blast phase (BP) with bosutinib, the study’s primary objective (superior rate of CCyR at 12 months) was not met.<sup><xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Considering the clinical efficacy of bosutinib in these trials, and recognizing the shortcomings of the BELA study, we designed another randomized trial of bosutinib versus imatinib as front-line therapy for CP CML—the BFORE (Bosutinib Trial in First-Line Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia Treatment) study—in which a lower starting dose of bosutinib (400 mg daily) was administered.

                <p>Eligible patients were adults diagnosed with CP CML (confirmed by the presence of <italic>BCR-ABL1</italic> transcripts) within 6 months before random assignment, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, and adequate hepatic and renal function. Additional eligibility criteria are available in the Data Supplement. Patients who were Ph-positive or Ph-negative/<italic>BCR-ABL1</italic>–positive were eligible, but primary end point analysis was restricted to a modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population comprising Ph-positive patients with typical <italic>BCR-ABL1</italic> transcript types (e13a2 and/or e14a2); Ph-negative patients (ie, 0 out of ≥ 10 to 99 metaphases at baseline) and those with unknown Ph status and/or atypical transcript type were excluded from this population but included in the safety analyses and analyses of the ITT population of all patients randomly assigned.

                <title>Study Design and Treatments</title>
                <p>Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive 400 mg of bosutinib or imatinib once daily. Randomly assigned patients who discontinued treatment or withdrew from the study before treatment began could not be re-enrolled and randomly assigned again. Stratification by Sokal risk group and geographic region was done to ensure balance between treatments.</p>
                <p>Up to two sequential dose escalations for suboptimal response were permitted unless prohibitive toxicity was present (Data Supplement). Dose interruptions and reductions were permitted to manage toxicity. Patients continued treatment until unacceptable toxicity or treatment failure (defined as disease progression to AP or BP; confirmed loss of previously achieved cytogenetic response or complete hematologic response [CHR]; failure to achieve a CHR after 24 weeks or an adequate cytogenetic response after 24, 48, and 72 weeks; or doubling of WBC count for patients without CHR after dose escalation [unless prohibited]).</p>
                <p>Molecular response was centrally assessed (MolecularMD, Portland, OR) on peripheral blood by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and reported at baseline and on the international scale every 3 months thereafter during the core treatment phase. Cytogenetic assessment was performed locally at baseline and every 3 months thereafter until achievement of MMR, after which it was performed only if clinically indicated, disease progression was suspected, or MMR was lost and a five-fold increase in <italic>BCR-ABL1</italic> transcripts was demonstrated.</p>

                <title>End Points</title>
                <p>Per protocol, efficacy was assessed in the mITT population, with the prespecified primary efficacy end point being MMR rate at 12 months (48 weeks). Key secondary efficacy end points include CCyR (0% Ph-positive from ≥ 20 metaphases or MMR because, per protocol, bone marrow aspirates were not required once MMR was achieved) by month 12; MMR by month 18; duration of CCyR and MMR; event-free survival (EFS); and overall survival (OS). Exploratory end points include MMR at 12 months in the ITT population; MMR at 3, 6, and 9 months; MR<sup>4</sup> (defined as ≤ 0.01% <italic>BCR-ABL1</italic> transcripts on the international scale with ≥ 9,800 <italic>ABL1</italic> assessed) and MR<sup>4.5</sup> (defined as ≤ 0.0032% <italic>BCR-ABL1</italic> transcripts on the international scale with ≥ 30,990 <italic>ABL1</italic> assessed) at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months; time to MMR; time to CCyR; and time to on-treatment transformation to AP or BP CML; additional information about end points is in the Data Supplement.</p>
                <p>Adverse events (AEs), serious AEs, suspected or unexpected serious adverse reactions, and laboratory evaluations were assessed throughout the treatment phase up to 28 days after last dose in all patients who received one or more doses of study drug (safety population). Events were graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0.</p>

                <p>The primary end point (MMR at 12 months in the mITT population) was tested at a two-sided significance level of .05. CCyR by month 12 was tested at a level of .025.</p>
                <p>All efficacy end points included data up to 28 days after last dose except OS, which included deaths occurring after this time point.

                <p>A total of 590 patients with newly diagnosed CP CML were screened for eligibility between July 2014 and August 2015 at 151 centers in 26 countries. Among them, 536 patients were randomly assigned to receive bosutinib (n = 268) or imatinib (n = 268); 54 patients (9.2%) failed screening (Data Supplement). All patients randomly assigned to bosutinib received study therapy; three patients randomly assigned to imatinib were not treated. At the time of data cutoff (August 11, 2016), all patients had a minimum follow-up of 12 months (48 weeks). The treatment groups were well balanced with regard to baseline demographics and disease characteristics, including the primary mITT population (bosutinib, n = 246; imatinib, n = 241; <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Excluded from this population were 12 patients who were Ph-negative (six in each arm), eight patients with atypical transcripts (bosutinib, n = 3; imatinib, n = 5), and 31 patients with unknown Ph status (bosutinib, n = 13; imatinib, n = 18; which included two patients receiving imatinib also listed as having atypical transcripts). The safety population includes all patients randomly assigned who received one or more doses of study drug.</p>

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>Results of this trial indicate improved outcomes with bosutinib versus imatinib as initial therapy for patients with CP CML, as demonstrated by a higher rate of MMR at 12 months in the mITT population (47.2% <italic>v</italic> 36.9%; <italic>P =</italic> .0200; primary end point) and other efficacy measures. This improved response was accompanied by a favorable toxicity profile. In addition, although the magnitude of MMR rate improvement is numerically larger among patients with high-risk Sokal, there was a nonstatistically significant trend for benefit in all Sokal risk groups.</p>
              <p>Although National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines indicate that CCyR by 12 months is the goal of TKI therapy along with prevention of disease progression,<sup><xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> the significance of achieving MMR within 12 months has been established in various studies to correlate with EFS. This hallmark is recognized by the European LeukemiaNet as an optimal response,<sup><xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network considers <italic>BCR-ABL1</italic> transcript levels ≥ 0.1% as a consideration for possible changes in therapy.<sup><xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Consistent with the current study, a previous trial of bosutinib versus imatinib in the front-line setting (BELA) demonstrated improvement in MMR rate at 12 months with bosutinib (41% <italic>v</italic> 27%, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001).<sup><xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> However, BELA did not meet its primary end point of CCyR at 12 months. In a subsequent analysis of BELA data, the rate of CCyR by 12 months was higher with bosutinib versus imatinib (75.6% <italic>v</italic> 67.1%; <italic>P</italic> = .032).<sup><xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> These results are similar to those of BFORE, which demonstrated a significantly higher CCyR rate by 12 months with bosutinib (77.2% <italic>v</italic> 66.4%; <italic>P</italic> = .0075). An important difference between the studies was the lower starting dose of bosutinib in BFORE versus BELA (400 <italic>v</italic> 500 mg/d). This was based on discontinuation rates from BELA (29% of patients receiving bosutinib <italic>v</italic> 20% of patients receiving imatinib) and increased experience with bosutinib gained over time. With a similar follow-up duration, 22.0% of patients discontinued bosutinib in BFORE despite more patients being ≥ 65 years of age (19.5% receiving bosutinib in BFORE <italic>v</italic> 12.0% in BELA)<sup><xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> and having medical histories that potentially predisposed them to AEs, suggesting the lower dose was associated with better tolerability and hence better responses. Differences in baseline characteristics may also account for the higher rate of imatinib discontinuation observed in this study (26.8%) compared with BELA and other studies of front-line imatinib.<sup><xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Similar studies that compared nilotinib (Evaluating Nilotinib Efficacy and Safety in Clinical Trials-Newly Diagnosed Patients [ENESTnd])<sup><xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> and dasatinib (Dasatinib Versus Imatinib Study in Treatment-Naïve Chronic Myeloid Leukemia Patients [DASISION])<sup><xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> with imatinib as front-line treatment of CML demonstrated higher response rates and deeper and earlier responses with the second-generation TKI therapies. However, there has been no clear benefit in EFS or OS with newer agents. Results in BELA and BFORE are consistent with these results.<sup><xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> With the short follow-up, there is currently no difference in EFS or OS between cohorts, although it is possible that differences will emerge with longer observation time. In addition, the higher rate of deep molecular responses may present an opportunity for more patients to become eligible for a trial of treatment discontinuation, an end point of increasing relevance.<sup><xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup></p>
              <p>The toxicity profile of bosutinib observed in this study was similar to those previously reported,<sup><xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> with the most common AEs being diarrhea and liver function abnormalities. Diarrhea events occurred early and were transient, with frequency and severity typically improving over time. Diarrhea was primarily grade 1 or 2, was manageable, and did not lead to a higher discontinuation rate compared with the imatinib arm. Liver function abnormalities were the most common AEs leading to discontinuation of bosutinib.</p>
              <p>In this study, 3.0% of patients receiving bosutinib and 0.4% of patients receiving imatinib had cardiovascular events; 2.2% and 0.4%, respectively, occurred during the first year of therapy. In BELA, incidence of cardiovascular events at 12 months was 0.8% in both arms; however, more patients enrolled in the current study had a history of cardiac disorders (BFORE: 14.2% of patients receiving bosutinib and 13.8% of patients receiving imatinib; BELA: 9.6% and 13.5%, respectively) and vascular disorders (BFORE: 36.9% and 33.6%, respectively; BELA: 24.4% and 27.4%, respectively; Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities System Organ Class) at baseline relative to those in BELA.<sup><xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> An analysis of 4-year data from BELA suggested no increased risk of cardiovascular events with long-term bosutinib versus imatinib treatment.<sup><xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Longer follow-up is needed to better assess and understand any possible difference between the two studies in the incidence of these events.</p>
              <p>We conclude that bosutinib 400 mg once daily provides benefit over imatinib, with higher rates of cytogenetic and molecular responses, and that these responses occur earlier. Bosutinib is associated with a favorable toxicity profile, with most AEs being low-grade, manageable, and improving over time. These results suggest that bosutinib can be an important alternative for patients with previously untreated CP CML.</p>
