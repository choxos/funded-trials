                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Studies finding perioperative hyperglycaemia is associated with adverse patient outcomes in surgical procedures spurred the development of blood glucose guidelines at many institutions. In this trial, we will assess the implementation of a clinical decision support tool that is integrated into the intraoperative portion of our electronic health record and provides real-time best practice recommendations for intraoperative insulin dosing in surgical patients at high risk for hyperglycaemia.</p>

                  <title>Methods and design</title>
                  <p>We will assess this intervention using a sequential and repeated cross-over design at the institutional level with periods of time for wash-out, control and study intervention. The unit of analysis will be the surgical case. The primary outcome will be the frequency of hyperglycaemia (&gt;180âmg/dL (10âmmol/L)) at first postoperative anaesthesia care unit measurement. There are several prespecified secondary analyses focused on perioperative glycaemic control.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p>This protocol and statistical analysis plan describes the methodology, primary and secondary analyses. The PeRiOperative Glucose PRAgMatic (PROGRAM) trial was approved by the Vanderbilt University Institutional Review Board (IRB), Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA (IRB, 220991). The study results will be disseminated via publication in a peer-reviewed journal and presented at national scientific conferences. The results of PROGRAM trial will inform best practice for perioperative standardised insulin administration in surgical patients at high risk of hyperglycaemia.</p>

              <p>Poor intraoperative glucose control has been linked to multiple types of postoperative infections including surgical site infections and urinary tract infections.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1â8</xref> Maintaining a blood glucose of less than 180âmg/dL (10âmmol/L) is associated with a reduced risk of infection and setting this target range minimises risks of hypoglycaemia as compared with stricter blood glucose targets.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 7 8</xref> Intraoperative control of hyperglycaemia is complicated by lack of knowledge of appropriate treatment goals and interventions, inattention secondary to the mental load of intraoperative management, glucose monitoring equipment availability or the time involved in measuring glucose and initiating insulin treatment.</p>
              <p>At our institution, a clinical decision support (CDS) reminder is triggered in the intraoperative portion of the electronic health record (EHR) to suggest that providers obtain glucose measurements in patients at high risk for hyperglycaemia (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>). Appropriate use of this CDS reminder has been successful in reducing surgical site infections,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> and a recent study demonstrated that when the reminder was removed there was a significant reduction in glucose monitoring which was improved on reinstitution of the glucose monitoring reminder.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> We hope to improve on the CDS reminder by adding our departmental insulin dosing guidelines to the reminder (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">figure 2</xref>). This automated insulin dosing reminder (AIDR) not only suggests the provider obtain a glucose, but also uses the last recorded glucose values in the EHR to propose appropriate insulin dosing to the anaesthesia care team.</p>

              <p>In this proposed study, we will assess the implementation of an AIDR. Our specific hypothesis is that by adding an AIDR containing a departmental insulin dosing guidelines that includes real-time data pertinent to the patient, in-room anaesthesia providers will deliver care that results in decreased rates of perioperative hyperglycaemia. In addition, the secondary analysis of detailed, prospectively collected data obtained in this study may help improve the perioperative insulin dosing best practices at our institution, and it could serve as a proof-of-concept model which could apply to other healthcare facilities managing surgical patients at high risk of hyperglycaemia.</p>

                <title>Study design and intervention</title>
                <p>The PROGRAM trial is a prospective, unblinded, pragmatic, sequential and repeated cross-over trial conducted in the operating rooms (ORs), postoperative anaesthesia care unit (PACU) and intensive care unit with periods of time for wash out, control and study intervention at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) in Nashville, Tennessee, USA. This multiple cross-over study is intended to limit the errant detection of secular institutional trends. The PROGRAM trial protocol was approved by the VUMC Institutional Review Board (IRB) (IRB, 220991). The trial protocol was also registered with ClinicalTrials.gov on 21 June 2022, prior to initiation of study participantsâ enrolment on 5 October 2022 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT05426096).</p>
                <p>The PROGRAM trial will assess the effect of an AIDR containing departmental insulin dosing guidelines that is triggered during anaesthetic care in the intraoperative portion of the EHR. We believe that the AIDR will influence anaesthesia providers to appropriately dose insulin and we hypothesise that this tool will result in improved glucose control in surgical patients at high risk for hyperglycaemia. The perioperative AIDR that will be implemented in the study was developed based on clinical practice parameters (practice standards, practice guidelines, consensus statements and practice advisories) with a focus on perioperative glucose control and management.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 12â15</xref> Consistent with the standard practice of the VUMC Department of Anesthesiology, this practice advisory was posted on the Center for Evidence Based Anesthesia (CEBA) website, and it was also made accessible through a link listed in the EHR under the in-built application of âI-careâ guidelines.

                <p>The AIDR delivers departmental guidelines to providers in the intraoperative portion of the EHR. When a patient meets the eligibility criteria (listed below), the AIDR will provide a notification through the EHR by opening a pop-up reminder at regular intervals (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">figure 2</xref>). The provider is not forced to follow the recommendations of the insulin dosing AIDR, and they are able to dismiss the reminder without penalty. In addition, the insulin dosing guidelines will continue to be available to all providers under the CEBA guidelines website via a link in the âI-careâ application from the EHR (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">figure 4</xref>). Prior to broad implementation of the insulin dosing AIDR, a volunteer group of 12 anaesthesia providers (attendings, resident doctors, certified registered nurse anaesthetists (CRNAs)) trialled the AIDR in the intraoperative clinical setting. A formal survey composed of structured and unstructured data fields was administered to the volunteers soliciting feedback on the tool. All the volunteers responded to the survey and no significant concerns were noted that prompted structural changes the tool.</p>
                <p>Given the pragmatic nature of our study the eligibility criteria for enrolment are broad. The mode of delivery of the proposed intervention is embedded in routine perioperative care and executed by anaesthesia providers, and data collection focuses on process related and clinical outcomes relevant to the care of surgical patients at high risk for hyperglycaemia.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>

                <p>The 12-month period of enrolment in the PROGRAM trial is divided into four 12-week blocks. During intervention blocks in cases where the patient meets eligibility criteria, the anaesthesia providers periodically receive AIDR at regular reminder intervals. During control blocks of the trial, the providers will not receive the AIDR notifications, but they will continue to receive the glucose monitoring CDS reminder. They will have access to the insulin dosing guidelines via a link in the âI-careâ application from the EHR. The trial will begin with a 12-week control block after which, the AIDR will be activated for a period of 12 weeks. The first 2 weeks of this period will serve as a wash-out, followed by 10 weeks of intervention. After the first 12-week intervention period, the AIDR will be switched off for 12 weeks (2-week wash-out, 10-week control period), which will be followed by the last 12-week intervention block of the trial (2-week wash-out, 10-week intervention period) (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">figure 5</xref>). The trial was started on 5 October 2022 and the trial is currently ongoing.</p>

                <p>Randomisation was not feasible at either the provider or patient level. In our anaesthesia care team model, an attending anaesthesiologist supervises CRNAs, anaesthesiology resident or fellow physicians and student registered nurse anaesthetists (SRNAs). Randomisation at the provider level was not possible because our staffing model would result in combinations of attending anaesthesiologists and CRNAs, SRNAs and residents from conflicting study groups. Randomisation at the patient level was not feasible out of concerns about randomly and repeatedly withholding a reminder tool on a case-by-case basis. As providers depend on reminders to reduce cognitive burden, we chose to minimise the number of times that the reminder was taken away from providers to the single transition from first experimental to second control period.</p>

Similarly, after the first 10-week block of the intervention period a 2-week analytic wash-out period will follow at the beginning of which the anaesthesia providers will stop receiving the AIDR. This wash-out is designed to account for the carryover effect of the tool in reminding anaesthesia providers to use the insulin dosing guidelines.</p>

According to that data, after excluding 36% of patients with missing postoperative glucose, our accrual rate is 95 subjects per week. After excluding patients recruited during the wash-out periods, this will allow us to recruit 2090 subjects during the 22 weeks of the control period and 1900 subjects during the 20 weeks of the intervention period, totalling approximately 3990 patients.</p>
                  <p>With this sample size, and the percentage of hyperglycaemic patients in the control group of 42%, we will be able to detect true failure rates of 0.38 and 0.46 (a 4.0% absolute decrease or increase) in exposed subjects with power of 80%. We believe this difference is clinically relevant. The type I error probability associated with the test of the null hypothesis that the risk of hyperglycaemia is equal in the intervention and control groups is 5%. Even if the proportion of hyperglycaemic patients in the control group is 0.54, the detectable hyperglycaemia rates in exposed subjects are 50% or 58% (4% absolute decrease or increase) with the power of 80%.</p>

                  <p>To test the primary hypothesis of whether the intervention reduces the rate of postoperative hyperglycaemia, we will fit logistic regression with hyperglycaemia (yes/no) as an outcome and intervention (control/intervention), time period (first/second round of control and intervention periods), and interaction of intervention and time period as the main covariates. The model will be adjusted for demographics (age, sex, body mass index, race and ethnicity (Hispanic, non-Hispanic black, Asian, non-Hispanic white, other)), clinical characteristics: (American Society of Anesthesiologist Physical Status Classification,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> diagnosis of type 1 diabetes, diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, last preoperative haemoglobin A1C (within 3 months prior to surgery), the use of insulin at baseline) and surgery characteristics: (surgery type, surgery service line, emergent/urgent case designation, duration of surgery). Continuous covariates will be modelled with restricted cubic splines with four knots.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> We chose four knots because our expected effective sample size is large enough to accommodate additional df and is a good compromise between the loss of precision and flexible modelling.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
</p>
                  <p>Adjustment variables missing more than 50% will be excluded from the analysis.</p>
                  <p>For the rest of the variables with missing values, we will use multiple imputation by chained equations with predictive mean matching to create 10 complete datasets.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21 22</xref> We will perform the analysis on each of these ten imputed datasets and combine the results using Rubinâs rule.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Based on the combined results, the overall significance of the intervention will be assessed by testing the null hypothesis that no difference exists between the intervention and control groups in either time period. The associations of intervention and outcome will be reported as adjusted ORs and their 95% CIs for each time period. To study to what extent missing data can affect our treatment estimate, we will also perform a complete-case analysis using the same modelling, testing and reporting approaches, as in the primary analysis.</p>
                  <p>Because our study does not have concurrent control/intervention groups, patients in these two groups may differ. For example, it is possible that the rate of type I and II diabetes will vary over the period of the study; and the likelihood of providers following the BPA protocol may depend on diabetes diagnosis. To compute the effect of the intervention for patients with similar characteristics, we will also analyse the main outcome after balancing the exposure groups using matching weights (MWs).<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Similar to inverse probability weights, MWs are computed from the propensity of receiving the intervention, p, but each weight is multiplied by the minimum between p and (1âp), resulting in min(p, 1âp)/p for intervention and min(p, 1âp)/(1âp) for control subjects. Analogous to one-to-one propensity score calliper matching without replacement, this approach has an advantage over matching because it retains all observations and allows for efficient and straightforward variance estimation. Another advantage of this method is that the estimated effect of the intervention can be interpreted as an effect between subjects with similar (overlapping) propensities of intervention.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>
</p>
                  <p>To compute MW, the propensity scores will be estimated using a logistic regression model with intervention (yes/no) as the outcome and the patient-specific and procedure-specific confounding variables listed earlier with continuous variables modelled using restricted cubic splines.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> The model for MW will not include time period. The weights will be computed for each imputed dataset and used to estimate the effect of the intervention using weighted logistic regression with postoperative hyperglycaemia as an outcome and intervention as the covariate. To account for potential residual confounding, the model will be adjusted for the same covariates as in the primary analysis excluding the time period and the interaction of the intervention and time period. The variance of the intervention coefficient will be computed using the sandwich variance estimators.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> The estimates from the ten models will be combined using Rubinâs rule. Based on the combined results, the association of outcome and intervention will be considered significant if the coefficient of intervention is significant. The association of the intervention with the outcome will be reported as an OR and 95% CI. The standardised differences between the covariates before and after applying MW will be reported for each imputed dataset. Successful balancing is defined as a standardised difference of&lt;0.10, which occurs, for example, when &gt;90% of categories overlap across two groups.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>
</p>
                  <p>For the primary outcome, we will perform a sensitivity analysis that includes patients with missing postoperative glucose. In this analysis, we will assume hyperglycaemia for treated patients and no hyperglycaemia for control patients (worst-case analysis). As an additional sensitivity analysis, we will also estimate the magnitude of potential unobserved confounding using (E value) for the main effect and its lower 95% confidence limit. E value is defined as a minimum strength of association on the OR scale that an unmeasured confounder in our study must have with both exposure and outcome to explain away their putative association. Higher E values indicate robustness to unmeasured confounding.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>
</p>
                  <p>Statistical analyses of the secondary outcomes will be performed like the primary analysis of the primary outcome (ie, using an adjusted regression with intervention, time period and intervention-time period interaction term).</p>
                  <p>In the exploratory analyses of the primary outcome, we will test for the intervention effect modification by the following baseline variables:</p>

The potential risk is minimal, and we do not anticipate any increased risks to the patients involved in this study. The insulin dosing guidelines have gained departmental approval and are currently in use. The study could not be practically conducted without a waiver of consent due to the impracticality of getting informed consent for target study population.</p>
                <p>A waiver of consent for provider participation in this study was granted by the Vanderbilt University IRB. There are no provider specific eligibility criteria. The CDS information that is being presented by the AIDR is already available to providers. The tool increases the availability of insulin dosing guidelines that have been approved by the department. There will be no direct or identifying data collected about providers. There will be no interactions with providers other than electronically through the AIDR in EPIC and an explanation of the tool at trial initiation. Provider behaviour will only be analysed secondarily based on appropriate treatment of intraoperative hyperglycaemia as evidenced by patient outcomes.</p>
