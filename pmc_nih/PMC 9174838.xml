                  <title>Purpose</title>
                  <p>Although recombinant human interleukin-15 (rhIL-15) has generated much excitement as an immunotherapeutic agent for cancer, activity in human clinical trials has been modest to date, in part due to the risks of toxicity with significant dose escalation. Since pulmonary metastases are a major site of distant failure in human and dog cancers, we sought to investigate inhaled rhIL-15 in dogs with naturally occurring lung metastases from osteosarcoma (OSA) or melanoma. We hypothesized a favorable benefit/risk profile given the concentrated delivery to the lungs with decreased systemic exposure.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Experimental design</title>
                  <p>We performed a phase I trial of inhaled rhIL-15 in dogs with gross pulmonary metastases using a traditional 3+3 cohort design. A starting dose of 10 µg twice daily × 14 days was used based on human, non-human primate, and murine studies. Safety, dose-limiting toxicities (DLT), and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) were the primary objectives, while response rates, progression-free and overall survival (OS), and pharmacokinetic and immune correlative analyses were secondary.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>From October 2018 to December 2020, we enrolled 21 dogs with 18 dogs reaching the 28-day response assessment to be evaluable. At dose level 5 (70 μg), we observed two DLTs, thereby establishing 50 µg twice daily × 14 days as the MTD and recommended phase 2 dose. Among 18 evaluable dogs, we observed one complete response &gt;1 year, one partial response with resolution of multiple target lesions, and five stable disease for an overall clinical benefit rate of 39%. Plasma rhIL-15 quantitation revealed detectable and sustained rhIL-15 concentrations between 1-hour and 6 hour postnebulization. Decreased pretreatment lymphocyte counts were significantly associated with clinical benefit. Cytotoxicity assays of banked peripheral blood mononuclear cells revealed significant increases in peak cytotoxicity against canine melanoma and OSA targets that correlated with OS.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>In this first-in-dog clinical trial of inhaled rhIL-15 in dogs with advanced metastatic disease, we observed promising clinical activity when administered as a monotherapy for only 14 days. These data have significant clinical and biological implications for both dogs and humans with refractory lung metastases and support exploration of combinatorial therapies using inhaled rhIL-15.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p>Cytokine immunotherapies have been a key area of research focus in cancer immunotherapy given their ability to stimulate powerful immune responses.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> Interleukin-15 (IL-15) in particular has shown promise as an antitumor immunotherapeutic and has been used to stimulate endogenous cytotoxic natural killer (NK) and T cell responses against advanced cancers.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3–9</xref> However, while durable responses have been achieved in some patients, clinical trials of IL-15 monotherapy for patients with advanced cancer have frequently resulted in stable disease as the best response, and many of these trials were limited by systemic toxicity.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 11</xref></p>
              <p>Distinct from direct intratumoral therapy, inhaled cytokine therapy offers the advantages of regional delivery of immunotherapy to the lungs, a frequent site of gross metastatic disease, while limiting systemic exposure and potential toxicity. In addition, the lungs are known to harbor a unique immune microenvironment, likely secondary to frequent pathogen exposure, and significant tissue-resident NK and CD8 +T cell immune populations have been identified in the lungs with both a memory-like and heightened cytotoxic phenotype.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p>
              <p>Cytokine immunotherapy using the inhalation route of delivery has previously been administered and demonstrated to be safe using IL-2 therapy for both dogs and humans with pulmonary metastases.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13–15</xref> Inhaled IL-2 has also been used in human cancer trials with response rates of approximately 15%.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14 16 17</xref> Yet, interest in this approach did not materialize in part because of concerns regarding the immunosuppressive effects of IL-2, including upregulation of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and induction of activation-induced cell death in cytotoxic T cells.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Given that there are critical differences in the mechanisms of action of IL-15 and IL-2, we sought to evaluate the safety and potential clinical efficacy of inhaled IL-15 as a phase I, proof-of-concept trial in dogs with pulmonary metastases from melanoma and osteosarcoma (OSA).</p>
              <p>Dogs are companion animals that develop spontaneous cancers in the setting of an intact immune system, which allows for the study of complex immune interactions during cancer therapies while also addressing efficacy and toxicity endpoints. Melanoma and OSA are common canine malignancies, estimated to occur in approximately 20,000–100,000 US dogs per year.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18 19</xref> Additionally, perhaps more so than humans, melanoma and OSA are overwhelmingly lethal diseases in dogs<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18 20 21</xref> with median survival times of less than 1 year. Although melanoma and OSA are associated with distinct immune tumor microenvironments (TMEs) and differential response to immunotherapy in humans, there are few, if any, effective immunotherapy options in dogs. Therefore, dogs with these cancers are ideal candidates for novel immunotherapy approaches.</p>
              <p>Here, we report the results of a first-in-dog phase I clinical trial of inhaled recombinant human (rh) IL-15 in dogs with gross pulmonary metastases from melanoma or OSA. We observed 50 µg inhaled twice daily × 14 days to be the recommended phase 2 dose with two dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) observed in the 70 µg cohort. Among 18 evaluable patients, we observed an objective response rate of 11%, including one complete response (CR) that lasted &gt;1 year and a clinical benefit rate of 39%. Immune correlative assays demonstrated systemic effects of therapy with evidence for delineation of responders and non-responders based on baseline absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) and correlation of ex vivo peripheral blood cytotoxicity assays with survival. Taken together, these data support ongoing evaluation of inhaled IL-15 as a strategy to improve immunotherapy outcomes in both dogs and people with gross pulmonary metastatic disease.</p>

                <p>The primary investigational agent used in this trial was <italic toggle="yes">Escherichia coli</italic> derived rhIL-15 manufactured by the Biopharmaceutical Development Program of the Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis/National Cancer Institute using current Good Manufacturing Practices. Patients were treated with inhaled rhIL-15 twice daily for 14 days at dose levels of 10, 20, 33, 50 or 70 µg (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1A</xref>). The first treatment was performed at the UC Davis VMTH to ensure that the patient and the owners were properly trained and tolerated the therapy. The nebulizer was attached to a fitted veterinary anesthesia cone, and depending on patient comfort and tolerability, the cone was placed directly over the patient muzzle (<xref rid="SP4" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental figure 1</xref>) or placed within a plastic boot cover that was placed over the muzzle during delivery. Owners were instructed to perform treatments a minimum of 8 hours apart, and owners were requested to complete a treatment log.

                    <p>Study design and assessment of clinical responses. (A) Schema of first-in-dog clinical trial of inhaled rhIL-15 delivered by nebulizer twice daily for 14 total days. Blood was drawn prior to treatment as well as on days 7, 14 and 28, and response was evaluated by chest radiograph (CXR) on days 28, 42, 70, and 98. (B) Waterfall plot demonstrating percent change of target tumor sizes in responders and non-responders. Progressive disease (PD) ≥20% increase from baseline, and partial response (PR) &gt;30% decrease from baseline. (C) Spider plot summarizing changes in sum of each patient’s longest tumor diameters from baseline over time. Evaluable patients were considered responders (blue) or non-responders (red) based on RECIST criteria. Stable disease was defined as within the thresholds of &lt;20% increase and &lt;30% decrease in tumor diameter as illustrated by dashed lines. (D) Representative radiographs illustrating changes in pulmonary lesions prior to and following treatment with inhaled rhIL-15. Patient 4 (top panel) experienced a PR with complete resolution of three out of five lesions at dose level 1, while patient 14 (bottom panel) showed a complete response with resolution of diffuse pulmonary metastatic lesions leading to remission that lasted &gt;1 year after completion of treatment. (E) Survival from first inhaled rhIL-15 treatment for responders/patients having clinical benefit versus non-responders. (F) Kaplan-Meier curve from initiation of treatment showing a trend for improved survival among responders/patients with clinical benefit. rhIL-15, recombinant human interleukin-15.</p>

                <p>Clinical assessments and vital signs were performed prior to the first treatment and then 1 hour, 3 hours, and 5 hours after the first treatment was completed. Blood work was performed at baseline and then at day 7, day 14, and day 28 of study. Plasma rhIL-15 concentrations were measured in a subset of patients analyzing samples collected prior to the first treatment, 5 min after starting treatment, at completion of the first inhaled treatment, and at 1, 4, and 6 hours post-treatment. Response was assessed based on the Response Evaluation Criteria for Solid Tumors in Dogs (RECIST V.1.0) by a board-certified veterinary radiologist (EGJ).<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Due to the frequent rapid progression of metastatic OSA and melanoma in canine patients, 10 mm lesions were considered acceptable for enrollment rather than 20 mm. To be considered stable disease (SD), patients had to have a minimum of 28 days between imaging to meet criteria for response assessment of between &lt;20% increase and &lt;30% decrease in longest tumor diameter. Three-view thoracic radiographs were performed within 1 month prior to beginning therapy and were repeated on days 28, 42, 70, and 98 after initiation of inhaled rhIL-15. Patients could be restaged early if clinically indicated, and patients surviving beyond day 98 were offered imaging every 28 days.</p>

                <p>We used Excel (Microsoft), Prism software (GraphPad Software Inc), and SAS Enterprise Guide V.7.15 (Cary, North Carolina, USA) for graph generation and statistical analysis. Data are expressed as mean±SEM. Where appropriate, normality of distribution was confirmed using Shapiro-Wilk normality test. Differences between two groups were analyzed using the paired or unpaired Student’s t-test as appropriate for parametric data and the Mann-Whitney test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test for non-normally distributed data. For analysis of three or more groups, one-way analysis of variance tests were performed with Tukey’s or Dunnett’s post hoc test as appropriate. To analyze differences in fold change over time, we used a mixed effects model with a random intercept for the subjects and fixed effects for responders (Y or N). Correlations between two values were performed using Spearman correlation test. Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank test were used to compare survival outcomes between subgroups. P&lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant unless an adjusted p value was indicated.</p>

                <p>Treatment-related serious adverse events (SAEs) are listed in <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>, and all study related AEs are provided independent of attribution (<xref rid="SP5" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental table 1</xref>). No fevers, hypotension or other abnormalities were identified during the monitoring period following the first treatment. Several owners reported a mild increase in coughing during or immediately following inhaled treatments at home. One dog enrolled in the 10 µg dose level was allowed to enroll with a grade 3 alkaline phosphatase elevation, a grade 2 alanine transaminase (ALT) elevation, and normal aspartate transaminase (AST). At the completion of inhaled therapy, this patient presented with a new metastatic lymph node and progressive hepatopathy. These were determined to be grade 3 ALT and AST elevations. Based on progressive disease (PD), the owners withdrew the dog from the study without a hepatic ultrasound. The owners also declined necropsy at the time of euthanasia. Without confirmation of hepatic metastasis, the progressive hepatopathy was attributed possibly to treatment. Therefore, this dose level was expanded to enrol three additional dogs. No other SAEs were observed at this dose level, so the study was advanced to dose level 2 (20 μg). Treatment related SAEs were not documented in any additional patients until the 70 µg cohort was reached. At this dose level, we observed clinically evident (grade 3) necrosis or abscessation of confirmed metastatic melanoma in the lymph nodes of two of six dogs. These were categorized as DLTs, and dose escalation was stopped per protocol. Accordingly, the MTD was determined to be 50 µg.</p>

                <p>Overall, three patients died or were euthanized prior to day 28 (and were thus not evaluable per protocol), leaving 18 patients evaluable for response (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>). Among 18 evaluable dogs, 1 dog demonstrated a CR, 1 showed a partial response (PR), 5 had SD, and 11 had PD. <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref> depicts a waterfall plot of percent change in size of index lesions when best response was achieved as stratified by responders and non-responders. <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref> depicts the summary of all RECIST evaluable patient timepoints over time. Two patients (UCD-IL15-009, UCD-IL15-012) had extensive PD noted on radiographs that precluded RECIST evaluation. One patient with OSA treated at the 10 µg dose demonstrated a strong PR (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1D</xref>), and one patient with melanoma treated in the 50 µg cohort experienced a complete remission of diffuse metastatic pulmonary lesions (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1D</xref>). This CR was maintained &gt;1 year until presentation with localizing neurologic signs of unclear etiology. The owners elected euthanasia and declined necropsy such that the cause of neurologic signs was undetermined, although brain metastases from melanoma remained within the differential diagnosis. Notably, there was no clinical or radiographic evidence of recurrent melanoma in any other location. Additionally, there were two patients with OSA with SD (46 and 55 days), and three patients with melanoma with SD (42, 56, and 147 days). Overall, the median survival time from the time of first inhaled rhIL-15 treatment was 82.5 days (range 36–655) for OSA patients and 113.5 days (range 34–407) for melanoma patients. Consistent with our response data (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1B, C</xref>), we observed that patients showing clinical benefit tended to have improved overall survival compared with non-responders (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1E, F</xref>), although the differences in survival between responders and non-responders were not statistically significant (p=0.09). The large majority of patients (16 of 18 evaluable dogs) had lung only disease at the time of therapy, having previously undergone treatment of the primary tumor. Interestingly, of the two patients with their primary tumor intact, the clinical course of the primary tumor mirrored the response of the lung metastases (one CR and one PD).</p>

                <title>Plasma rhIL-15 quantitation and cytokine induction</title>
                <p>Plasma sampling for rhIL-15 quantitation was instituted with patient UCD-IL15-011 (33 µg cohort) as part of our correlative assays. Results of our analysis correlate with human studies examining dosing of rhIL-15,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6–8</xref> demonstrating a time of maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) at approximately 4 hours (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">figure 2A</xref>). While rhIL-15 was numerically detectable and increased at 4 hours in all patients, concentrations were nevertheless below the limit of quantification (&lt;20 pg/mL) at the 4-hour plasma sample in 2/2, 1/3, and 4/6 dogs in the 33, 50, and 70 µg cohorts, respectively. These results are consistent with minimal systemic exposure to rhIL-15 after inhalation (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">figure 2B</xref>), as quantifiable plasma levels of rhIL-15 ranged from 20 to 124 pg/mL. In contrast, plasma obtained from dogs with buccal melanoma treated SQ with 3 µg/kg rhIL-15 as part of a separate clinical trial of palliative RT and allogeneic NK transfer yielded 4-hour concentrations for rhIL-15 ranging from 740 to 2954 pg/mL (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">figure 2C</xref>). Demographic data for these patients receiving SQ rhIL-15 are included in <xref rid="SP6" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental table 2</xref>. Importantly, baseline plasma levels of canine IL-15 were not detected with the human IL-15 ELISA nor was rhIL-15 detectable on the canine Luminex assay. Taken together, these data indicate that systemic exposure to inhaled rhIL-15 is low, but rhIL-15 exposure appears to be maintained at relatively stable plasma levels for up to 6 hours. These data also align with previously published studies demonstrating that the majority of radio-labeled inhaled rhIL-2 remains within the lungs of dogs after inhalation,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> but over 24 hours, slow release into the systemic circulation occurs. Despite low systemic exposure to rhIL-15 via the inhaled route, induction of KC-like and IL-8 were noted in the plasma 4 hours after treatment in the majority of dogs after either SQ or inhaled dosing (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">figure 2C</xref>). Interestingly, we observed that 4-hour plasma levels for both canine KC-like and IL-8 chemokines (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">figure 2D</xref>) were higher in responders compared with non-responders with the differences for KC-like reaching statistical significance (p=0.046), while for IL-8, the differences approached but did not reach statistical significance (p=0.09). In contrast, 4 hours following initial inhaled IL-15 treatment, there was no difference in plasma levels of human IL-15 between responders and non-responders (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">figure 2D</xref>). We did not observe any correlation between absolute canine IL-8 or KC-like plasma levels and human IL-15 levels at 4 hours, nor did we observe a correlation between changes in IL-8 or KC-like levels and change in plasma IL-15 levels (<xref rid="SP7" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental figure 3</xref>). Unlike human studies examining systemic delivery of rhIL-15, plasma concentrations of IL-6 or IFNγ 4 hours post-treatment were largely unchanged in most dogs (<xref rid="SP8" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental figure 4</xref>).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to implement inhaled rhIL-15 as a novel cancer immunotherapeutic in a first-in-dog clinical trial. The primary objectives of this phase 1 trial were to identify treatment-related adverse events (AEs), DLTs, and to determine a MTD for follow-up therapeutic trials. Attribution of AEs can present challenges in late-stage metastatic disease, particularly in subjects who experience rapid progression with short survival times.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18 35</xref> Importantly, but also somewhat surprisingly, we observed no evidence of pulmonary-related SAEs or DLTs despite the inhalational route. This is highly relevant for combination therapies, especially given the recent development of canine PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitory antibodies for clinical usage since these agents in humans have been observed to cause potentially severe pneumonitis.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36–38</xref> Instead, the DLT we observed in two dogs in the 70 µg cohort was abscessation or necrosis within regional lymph nodes confirmed to harbor metastatic melanoma. While infection/necrosis of lymph nodes does occasionally occur in the natural progression of metastatic cancer, we concluded that rhIL-15 therapy might be related to the occurrence of these events in our patients. We therefore determined that the MTD of inhaled rhIL-15 in cancer-bearing dogs was 50 µg twice daily. Of note, although the rationale that the highest dose that does not cause dose-limiting toxicity will result in the greatest probability of efficacy may not apply in the era of immunotherapy where clinical benefit may not be dose dependent, our impression is that a higher dose of inhaled rhIL-15 is preferable for phase 2 studies, especially given the uncertainties of using biomarkers for dose selection.</p>
              <p>Based on prior inhaled rhIL-2 data in dogs with primary or metastatic gross disease within the lungs, we anticipated that we might see responses to inhaled rhIL-15 in dogs with metastatic OSA or melanoma. While response was not a primary endpoint, we were encouraged to see documented responses, including a PR and a durable CR &gt;1 year in dogs with diffuse and bulky metastatic disease. Equally important is that these responses were prolonged despite receiving a limited 2-week window of inhaled cytokine. This short treatment duration was based on the likelihood that dogs would generate neutralizing antibodies to rhIL-15, making prolonged treatment a risk for allergic responses and immune pathology. Ultimately, the documented response rate per modified RECIST criteria remains low in our study. Human clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of single-agent rhIL-15 for advanced solid tumors via SQ, intravenous bolus, or continuous infusion yielded significant induction of NK and lymphocyte populations, but no documented clinical responses were noted with monotherapy.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 39</xref> While we did observe clinical responses in dogs treated via inhalation, the overall response rate of CR and PR remains relatively modest (11%), and the role for rhIL-15 may likely be most impactful in combination with other existing or novel immunotherapies. At the same time, we anticipate that studies of inhaled canine IL-15 will be highly informative given the potential for delayed responses with immunotherapy (which may convert some patients with SD at early time points to delayed responses after longer exposure). We hypothesize that a longer course of inhaled IL-15 using canine IL-15 will lead to a higher response rate and greater clinical benefit, especially since we and others have shown that canine cytokines (IL-2 and IL-15) are more potent in stimulating immune responses in canine PBMCs and canine NK cells than human cytokines.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28 40</xref></p>
              <p>The finding that patients with low ALC at baseline were more likely to have responses or SD is also intriguing. While this finding was statistically significant, conclusions based on a small phase 1 study should be interpreted with caution as additional studies are clearly needed. While it is possible that a pre-existing cytokine profile could favor or enhance the activity of inhaled rhIL-15, it is also possible that responses in patients with low lymphocyte counts could be unrelated to the activity of rhIL-15. Depletion of lymphocytes improves the effect of adoptive cell transfer by eliminating Tregs and by removing endogenous lymphocytes, thereby leading to more ‘space’ for adoptively transferred cells to proliferate in the setting of increased availability of homeostatic cytokines like IL-7 and IL-15.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41–43</xref> Thus, the decreased baseline ALC seen in responders in our cohort could be linked to less competition for exogenous cytokine among endogenous NK and cytotoxic T cells.</p>
              <p>Distinct tumor types may also contribute to differences in cytokine profiles and response to treatment. Although melanoma and OSA are both aggressive cancers with poor prognosis, they have unique immune phenotypes in both dogs and human.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18 19 21 40</xref> Plasma cytokine profiles were generally higher in dogs with OSA than dogs with melanoma, although only IL-10 was significantly higher in OSA. IL-10 can promote increased cytotoxicity and IFNy secretion in NK cells<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> but has an overall immunosuppressive effect on immune cells, contributing to cancer cells’ immune escape.<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> Concentrations of IL-7, a critical cytokine in the homeostatic expansion of T cells,<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43 46</xref> showed a trend to be higher in OSA versus melanoma, although remained highly variable among patients. Overall, this suggests that cytokine elaboration can be related to tumor type although other immune-modifying factors such as age, sex, and body habitus are clearly also important. Similarly, immune cell populations and cytokine patterns in the blood may not represent mechanisms of response or resistance in the lung TME. For example, NK cells in healthy human lungs comprise approximately 10% of tissue-resident lymphocytes and primarily express a CD56<sup>dim</sup> perforin<sup>high</sup> phenotype.<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47 48</xref> Neoplastic transformation of lung tissue recruits largely non-cytotoxic CD56<sup>bright</sup> cells,<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> and intravenous infusion of IL-15 induces an expansion of CD56<sup>bright</sup> cells with enhanced cytotoxic function and increased cytokine production compared with CD56<sup>dim</sup>.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Inhaled rhIL-15 ultimately may have many different effects in the target tissue versus PBMCs, and further studies are required to determine effects of inhaled rhIL-15 on the native lung and the TME of lung metastases, as well as any crosstalk.</p>
              <p>In summary, our first-in-dog phase 1 clinical trial using a novel inhaled delivery route of rhIL-15 produced promising clinical activity and identified an MTD of 50 µg twice daily. We also observed that the cytotoxicity of circulating effector cells in the blood while on therapy as well as baseline ALC appear to correlate with clinical benefit. Ultimately, these results support ongoing investigation of inhaled rhIL-15 in treating dogs with metastatic melanoma and OSA with an emphasis on combinatorial approaches.</p>
