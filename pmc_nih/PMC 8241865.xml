                <p id="Par1">In contrast with global trends, HIV prevalence in Kazakhstan and other Central Asian countries has been rising in recent years. In this study, we analyzed hepatitis B (HBV), hepatitis C (HCV), tuberculosis (TB) and sexually-transmitted (STI) co-infections among 500 HIV positive study participants recruited from all regions of Kazakhstan. Among our study participants, 27%, 8%, 2%, and 5% were coinfected with, respectively, HCV, TB, HBV, and STI. A considerable proportion of the study participants was also found with triple or quadruple infections of HCV/TB (12%), TB/STI (0.8%), HCV/STI (2%), HCV/HBV (1%), HBV/TB (0.4%), HBV/STI (0.2%), HBV/HCV/TB (0.4%), HBV/HCV/STI (0.2%), or HCV/TB/STI (0.2%). Strong associations were found of certain age groups, duration of HIV infection, and practices of injection drug use and sexual contact with PLWH, with co-infections of HIV/HCV and HIV/TB. The odds of having death was 4.07 times higher with TB/HIV as compared to other co-infections. Co-occurrence of HIV with HCV, HBV, and TB infections among participants of this study highlights the necessity of regular screening for HCV infection among HIV infected patients, together with implementation of vigilant vaccination protocols against HBV and TB. Additionally, persons who inject drugs especially need to be focused for harm reduction efforts that include opiate substitution therapy, needle or syringe exchange programs, regular screening, and increased availability of ART and direct acting antivirals.</p>

              <p id="Par2">Owing to improved preventive measures, the rates of new HIV infections declined from 2.8 million in 2000 to 1.7 million in 2019 worldwide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Unfortunately, Eastern Europe and Central Asia are exceptions to these trends where, between 2010 and 2018, a 30% increase in new HIV infections has been recorded<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. The HIV epidemic in Eastern Europe and Central Asia is prevalent mainly in high-risk populations: People who inject drugs (PWID), men who have sex with men (MSM), transgender people, sex workers, prisoners, and their sexual partners comprise 95% of new infections in this region<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Several factors have contributed to this high incidence of HIV infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. The dissolution of Soviet Union gave rise to a regional financial crisis in 1991<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, leading to a decline in per capita income, increased rate of unemployment, and consequent renascence of shadow economy. Aftermath of this situation was observed as, among other things, penetration of corruption through the infrastructure responsible for the governance of law, education and healthcare, illegal production and trafficking of opiates leading to noticeable increases in the number of PWID, contributing to the expansion of HIV epidemics in the region<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. In the beginning, new HIV infections were mostly among PWID, however, the infection quickly bridged into heterosexual populations where it is currently most prevalent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par3">In Kazakhstan, the number of people living with HIV was 22,000 in 2016, increasing to 24,000 in 2017 and 26, 000 in 2018<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. In 2018, the prevalence was highest among PWID (7.9%), followed by MSM (6.2%), prisoners (3.5%), and sex workers (1.9%). Trends in the mode of HIV transmission in the country are consistent with those in other Central Asian countries, where the frequency of heterosexual transmission has surpassed that through injection drug use<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Overlapping modes of transmission frequently lead to co-infections of human immunodeficiency, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C viruses (respectively, HIV, HBV, and HCV)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. In 2018, among people living with HIV (PLWH) in Kazakhstan, 62% and 63% were found coinfected with, respectively, HBV and HCV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Due to the overlapping sexual mode of transmission, sexually transmitted infections (STI) are also known to be common among PLWH<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par4">In this study we report prevalence of coinfection with HBV, HCV, TB, and STI (including gonorrhea, syphilis and trichomoniasis) among a cohort of 500 PLWH in Kazakhstan. We also show an analysis of associations between these co-infections and factors such as gender, risk behaviors, and travel.</p>

              <p id="Par5">Ethical approval for this study was obtained from Institutional Research Ethics Committee, Nazarbayev University, Kazakhstan. All methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations.</p>
              <p id="Par6">We recruited 500 PLWH from all 15 regions of Kazakhstan. The participants were registered with Republican Center for Prevention and Control of AIDS, Almaty, Kazakhstan, asked to signed an informed consent if they were interested in the study and responded to an orally administered questionnaire about their medical history, risk behavior, and existing co-infections, including hepatitis B/C, tuberculosis, and sexually transmitted infections. For diagnosis of HIV and other infections, blood samples were processed by Kazakh Scientific Center of Dermatology and Infectious Diseases, Almaty, where analyses for CD4â+âT-lymphocyte count, viral load, and HCV and HBV antibodies were performed using, respectively, BD FACS Count Reagent Kitâ¢ (BD Biosciences, San Jose, USA), AmpliSensÂ® HIV-Monitor-FRT kit (InterLabService, Moscow, Russia), Anti-HCV-ELISA Best kit (Vector-Best, Novosibirsk, Russia), and HBsAg-ELISA Best Kit (Vector-Best, Novosibirsk, Russia). Patients reporting TB symptoms, were tested for TB by chest X-ray and their sputum samples were tested for the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis using XpertÂ® MTB/XDR kit (Cepheid, US). For STIs, study participants were tested at regional or other clinics. In most cases, the following tests were used: For gonorrhea, AmpliSensÂ® Neisseria gonorrhoeae-Test-âFL (InterLabService, Moscow, Russia); for trichomoniasis, AmpliSensÂ® Trichomonas vaginalis-Test-FL (InterLabService, Moscow, Russia), and for syphilis, RecombBestÂ® Treponema pallidum-Summary antibodies Test (Vecor Best, Moscow, Russia).</p>
              <p id="Par7">Statistical analyses were performed using <italic>STATA</italic> version 15.0 statistical software<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Categorical variables were summarized in frequencies and percentages. Chi-square, Fisherâs exact, and two-tailed t-tests were used to assess the relationship between each independent categorical and continuous variable, and HCV, HBV, TB, STI/HIV co-infection status. A p-valueâ&lt;â0.05 was used to define statistical significance. Simple and multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to investigate the direction and strength of independent variables on different types of co-infection. Crude and adjusted odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated from bivariate and multivariate analysis, respectively.</p>

Moreover, among patients, who had 5â9 and 15â20Â years of HIV infection duration, the odds of having TB co-infection was 1.97 and 5.41 higher, respectively, compared to the other groups (OR 1.97; CI 1.17â3.29 and OR 5.41; CI 2.24â13.05) (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).

The odds of being co-infected with HCV increased by 2 and 7.6 times for those infected with HIV for, respectively, 10-14y and 15-20y age groups. Our study revealed a significant association between co-infection with HCV and PWID population (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Globally, an estimated 2.3 million HIV/HCV co-infections are reported, with 1.4 million (59%) of them being PWID. Our finding is in agreement with recent studies showing that the prevalence of HCV co-infection among HIV-infected individuals was highest among PWID in Eastern Europe and Central Asia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. This can be due to the overlapping mode of transmission, namely, through needles, for HIV and HCV.

In 2004, a study reported HCV co-infection among 97% HIV-positive patients, whereas that proportion was found to be 63% and 66% in 2005 and 2007, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. In a relatively recent study in 2012, HCV co-infection among HIV positive patients was reported to be 53%âhigher than, or similar to, the numbers reported from USA (30%), Thailand (50%), Eastern Europe (33%), and Russia (60%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Such high proportion of blood-borne virus infections in PWID clearly highlights a need for harm reduction efforts in this populations.</p>
                <p id="Par21">In our study group 4.2% of PLWH were co-infected with HBV (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A). Among these patients, 10 (48%) were diagnosed with double co-infection (HIV/HBV). Also, some participants were found to have triple or quadruple co-infections: 5 (24%) with HIV/HBV/HCV, 2 (9.5%) with HIV/HBV/TB, and 2 (9.5%) with HIV/HBV/HCV/TB, 1 (4.8%) with HIV/HBV/STI, and 1 (4.8%) with HIV/HBV/STI/HCV (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B). Since both HIV and HBV are transmitted by similar routes, i.e., sexually and through injection needles, HIV/HBV infection is common. Globally, 5â20% HIV-positive individuals are reported to be co-infected with HBV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, and our findings (4.2%) fall within that range. Since 2019 there were 19,300 registered cases of HBV reported in Kazakhstan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. However, due to the wide vaccination coverage number of HBV cases have been decreasing in the country. Over the past 25Â years, the incidence of HBV among children and adults has decreased by, respectively,1234.5 and 32 times<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. In our study, the most affected HIV/HBV age-group was 30-34y (7.4%), whereas no PLWH younger than 24y were diagnosed with HBV (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). It has been reported that HBV co-infection in HIV infected people leads to a greater risk of liver disease progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, increased mortality from AIDS-related events<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, and poor HIV replication control with combination antiretroviral treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Recent studies revealed the importance of employing sensitive biomarkers to identify HBV replicative activity in HIV-infected individuals who test anti-HBc-positive/HBsAg-negative<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>.</p>
                <p id="Par22">Among our study participants, 22% were found co-infected with HIV/TB (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A). The odds of TB/HIV co-infection among the study participants were highest among males, who had the HIV infection for 5â9 or 15â20Â years. In addition, a significant association was found between PWID and TB/HIV co-infection (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Furthermore, our analysis showed that odds of death among TB/HIV co-infected individuals were 4 times higher relative to other types of co-infections (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). In fact, co-infection with TB among HIV-infected population has been found to be the most common cause of HIV-related deaths<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup><italic>.</italic> According to WHO reports, TB is the most frequent life-threatening opportunistic infection among HIV/AIDS patients. TB co-infection is estimated to affect one-third of the world's HIV-positive population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. In HIV-infected people across the world, the prevalence of TB is around 30%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. In agreement with these figures, 22% of our HIV positive study participants were infected with TB.</p>
                <p id="Par23">Since 2005, there has been a gradual decrease in TB-associated morbidity and mortality levels in Kazakhstan, but still the country is among the ones, in the WHO European Region, with the highest TB incidence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. The probability that people living with HIV will be infected with an active form of tuberculosis is 20â30 times higher than that for HIV negative people<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. In 2018 the population of Kazakhstan reached 18 million people with 13,361 registered cases of TB, and 730 (5%) coinfected with TB/HIV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. Impairment of immunity in HIV infected individuals exposes them to TB infection, with a 20-fold higher risk of reactivation of latent TB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,]</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Further, susceptibility to TB infection might be increased among PWID due to limited access to health care, compromised housing conditions, overcrowding in places of injection, and poor adherence to treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>.</p>
                <p id="Par24">Among our participants, 8% were co-infected with HIV/STI (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A). The most common STIs among participants were syphilis (3.2%), trichomoniasis (3%) and gonorrhea (1.4%). In this study being PWID was significantly associated with STI co-infection (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). This might be due to the fact that PWID may frequently engage in risky sexual behaviors including sexual contact without protection or with multiple partners. According to the statistics of Kazakh Scientific Center of Dermatology and Infectious Diseases, incidence of STI has decreased by 34% between 2017 and 2018, including that of syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydial infection and urogenital trichomoniasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. MSM and PLWH are at the highest risk for syphilis, according to current surveillance data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. According to a comprehensive analysis of research completed across the world, syphilis is found among 9.5% of HIV-positive people<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. Since both HIV and syphilis are sexually transmitted infections, individuals are frequently found co-infected with both. These viruses can be transferred through oral, vaginal, or anal mucosa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. While only 3.2% were co-infected with syphilis, compared to other STIs, the prevalence of syphilis among our study participants was the highest. In comparison, 3% of the participants were found co-infected with trichomoniasis. The global prevalence of these co-infections varies depending on the country<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. Some studies highlight the significance of trichomoniasis in HIV positive people due to the potential role of trichomoniasis in increasing the risk of HIV transmission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. Among our study participants, co-infection of gonorrhea (1.4%) was to a lesser degree compared to what is globally reported. In the US, for instance, median point prevalence of HIV/gonorrhea co-infection is reported to be 9.5%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>.</p>

                <p id="Par25">Overall there are 17 AIDS centers throughout the country, with one center per region. Kazakhstan, unlike most other former Soviet Union nations, allocates the budget for HIV treatment without the help of international contributors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. The Republican AIDS Center, Almaty, conducts quarterly monitoring and prevention programs carried out in the country, among key populations (PWID, RS, MSM), with the help of trust points (TP), friendly offices (FO), and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). The tools for monitoring and evaluation are electronic online systems of authorities and the National Database of Customers of Professional Programs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. Needle and syringe programs (NSPs) have played a critical role in containing the HIV pandemic across the world by offering HIV prevention information, syringes, and condoms to high-risk populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. NSPs are widely available for PWID in Kazakhstan as well, with over 137 locations all over the country<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Moreover, since Kazakhstan is one of the nations affected most by the tuberculosis pandemic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>, recently integrated approaches for TB and HIV care have been implemented, including that all patients infected with TB must be tested for HIV and vice versa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. Additionally, pregnant women are tested for HIV twice amid pregnancy, and there are no laws prohibiting PLWH from entering the country, while they are legally protected from discrimination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. Finally, PLWH are entitled to get ARV treatment free of charge. The Joint United Nations Program has devised a 90â90-90 program with the goal of lowering new HIV infections to 500,000 per year by 2020<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>. In 2019, among 33,000 PLWH, 18,000 were receiving treatment, while 14,000 PLWH had achieved viral load control, and Kazakhstan's progress towards the 90â90-90 target had moved up to 77â68â80<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>.</p>

              <p id="Par26">We have found a high prevalence of HBV, HCV, and TB co-infections among the HIV-positive patients in our study, It is known that coinfection with HIV can promote the progression of the HBV- and HCV-associated liver disease, accelerate the development of fibrosis, and increase the risk of hepatic carcinoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup>. The significant association between HIV/HCV co-infection among participants in this study highlights the necessity of regular screening for HCV infection among HIV infected patients. Clearly there is an urgent need to prevent HIV and HCV transmission among PWID by harm reduction, including opiate substitution therapy, needle or syringe exchange programs, regular HCV screening, increased availability of ART and direct acting antivirals against HCV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup>.The prevalence of TB-HIV coinfection is highest in African and Asian countries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref></sup>.Â Furthermore, the incidence of TB-HIV coinfection is increasing in Kazakhstan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref></sup>. Implementation of vigilant vaccination protocols against TB and HBV is one effective way to prevent these coinfections among PLWH.</p>
