                <p>The Sustainable East Africa Research in Community Health (SEARCH), a universal test and treat (UTT) trial, implemented ‘Streamlined Care’—a multicomponent strategy including rapid linkage to care and antiretroviral therapy (ART) start, 3-monthly refills, viral load counseling, and accessible, patient-centered care provision. To understand patient and provider experiences of Streamlined Care to inform future care innovations, we conducted in-depth interviews with patients (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 18) and providers (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 28) at baseline (2014) and follow-up (2015) (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 17 patients; <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 21 providers). Audio recordings were transcribed, translated, and deductively and inductively coded. Streamlined Care helped to decongest clinic spaces and de-stigmatize human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) care. Patients credited the individualized counselling, provider-assisted HIV status disclosure, and providers’ knowledge of patient's drug schedules, availability, and phone call reminders for their care engagement. However, for some, denial (repeated testing to disprove HIV+ results), feeling healthy, limited understanding of the benefits of early ART, and anticipated side-effects, and mistrust of researchers hindered rapid ART initiation. Patients’ short and long-term mobility proved challenging for both patients and providers. Providers viewed viral load counselling as a powerful tool to convince otherwise healthy and high-CD4 patients to initiate ART. Patient-centered HIV care models should build on the successes of Streamlined Care, while addressing persistent barriers.</p>

              <p>The Sustainable East Africa Research in Community Health (SEARCH) study, a community-cluster randomized UTT trial (NCT01864603) in 32 communities across three regions of Kenya and Uganda, developed, implemented, and evaluated a multidisease, patient-centered strategy termed Streamlined Care.<sup><xref rid="bibr22-23259582211053518" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="bibr23-23259582211053518" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr22-23259582211053518" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Streamlined Care was a multifaceted intervention spanning the HIV care continuum, anchored in three core principles: reducing structural barriers to care, improving relationships between patients and the clinic, and enhancing patient and clinician knowledge of HIV.

                <p>The lead investigator for the qualitative study trained a team of local researchers in qualitative data collection, coding, and analysis. Audio recordings of interviews were transcribed and translated into English; transcripts were deductively and inductively coded in a process informed by constructivist grounded theoretical approaches.<sup><xref rid="bibr31-23259582211053518" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> A coding framework was initially developed with conceptual categories defined <italic toggle="yes">a priori</italic> on the basis of theory-informed interview guides. At defined stages during the data collection and analysis process, the coding framework was iteratively refined by the full study team (with codes added, re-organized, and expanded) through review of transcripts and team discussions of conceptual categories emergent in the empirical data. Difficult to code segments and contradictions in coding approaches were discussed to achieve and consensus and strengthen intercoder reliability. This coding framework was iteratively applied to the transcripts using <italic toggle="yes">Atlas.ti</italic> 7.0. Coded excerpts were then queried and reviewed to develop analytical memos describing dominant emergent themes as well as negative/deviant cases and contradictions in the findings. Here, we use selected participant quotes to highlight key aspects of the experiences of Streamlined Care among PLHIV and their care providers.</p>

                <p>Providers viewed Streamlined Care as a critical tool to reduce clinic wait times, decongest clinic spaces, improve patient-centered care, and improve care retention. A research assistant discussed the observed wait times at facilities implementing Streamlined Care, as compared to other non-SEARCH facilities:<disp-quote><p><italic toggle="yes">Nowadays [patients] don't wait for too long and especially the HIV positive clients […] I have gone to facilities where [Streamlined Care] is not implemented and the waiting time is normally longer.</italic> (Female provider, Kenya)</p></disp-quote></p>

                <p>Other providers discussed increased patient satisfaction in response to the reduced wait times, accomplished through a multidisease and one-stop streamlined service.</p>

                <p>Providers credited the multi-disease model and patient-centered approach for continued care engagement. The provision of multidisease services was perceived to destigmatize clinic spaces:<disp-quote><p><italic toggle="yes">About our waiting area, there are no longer concerns […] There are very many illnesses that we treat, we have NCD [non-communicable disease] patients, and there are ART patients as well.

                <p>Providers also credited the patient-centered and friendly approach:<disp-quote><p><italic toggle="yes">The interaction is very ok, if you are keen on how we interact with them, it will be hard for you to differentiate between a provider and a patient.

                  <p>While both men and women reported delaying care due to stigma and nondisclosure, provider-assisted disclosure was particularly important for women who anticipated violence and dissolution of marriages. Women, exclusively, reported needing to ask their male partners for permission, when considering ART initiation. Provider-assisted disclosure was therefore key in facilitating rapid-ART start.</p>

                  <p>Narratives revealed that, in some instances, patients were slow to accept new universal ART guidelines. Providers shared that some patients thought that rapid ART initiation conflicted with the standard national ART guidelines of prophylactic antibiotics to prevent opportunistic infections before eligibility for ART. Similarly, these new guidelines were in conflict with their knowledge of ART initiation following a drop in CD4 cell count. A provider discussed patients who thought they needed cotrimoxazole (prophylactic antibiotics) prior to ART start, and how rapid ART often conflicted with what they were witnessing among their peers:<disp-quote><p><italic toggle="yes">Patients will say, ‘I know a friend of mine, who has been on cotrimoxazole for about ten years, why should I be the one to start the ART?’</italic> (Male provider, Uganda)</p></disp-quote></p>

                  <p>Similarly, community discussions about the side effects of ART, along with accounts of HIV-positive individuals’ experiences of negative side effects, discouraged rapid ART start. A provider discusses a patient's worry about ART side effects and its impact on his livelihood:<disp-quote><p><italic toggle="yes">They say “I am a person who carries heavy things like matooke (local bananas) every day, if you tell me that this medication is going to make me dizzy, how will I work when I am dizzy, I need to work and provide for my family.</italic> (Male provider, Uganda)</p></disp-quote></p>
                  <p>A patient discussed the anticipated side effects of ART, including those she perceived would lead to others knowing her status and ART use:<disp-quote><p><italic toggle="yes">“When you take the drugs [ARTs], they have an effect on your body eg they can darken your skin or make you fat, and people easily get to know that you are taking the drugs.”</italic> (Female patient, Uganda)</p></disp-quote></p>

              <p>The SEARCH Streamlined Care model enabled the provision of patient-centered care that facilitated rapid ART initiation and supported retention in care, leading to the study's success in exceeding the UNAIDS 90-90-90 goals after 3 years and reducing mortality.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-23259582211053518" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bibr21-23259582211053518" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Both providers and patients felt that provider-assisted disclosure of HIV-positive status, individualized counseling and care, and understanding the utility of the VL test were elements of the Streamlined Care model that enabled patients’ progress across the ART treatment cascade. For some, our findings suggest that repeat HIV testing, stigma, nondisclosure of HIV status, ART misconceptions, and population mobility presented challenges. Overall, despite some challenges with drug stock outs, Streamlined Care was reported to reduce patient load, decongest clinic spaces, and reduce long-wait times.</p>
              <p>The SEARCH Streamlined Care model is thus informative for the development of DSD models, including individual, group, facility or community-based service delivery, which aim to provide tailored care to populations of interest and can address persistent social and structural barriers to HIV care engagement.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-23259582211053518" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="bibr11-23259582211053518" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr12-23259582211053518" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr13-23259582211053518" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr14-23259582211053518" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr15-23259582211053518" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr16-23259582211053518" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr10-23259582211053518" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="bibr32-23259582211053518" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> As millions join HIV care systems for ART, health systems need to optimize DSD models to manage the increased volume of patients.<sup><xref rid="bibr19-23259582211053518" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> The findings presented here suggest that key elements of the SEARCH approach should be considered for the development and implementation of DSD models. The first key element, reducing structural barriers to care, is a common focus of DSD models, which often include community-wide HIV testing, rapid ART initiation, mobile phone support, as well as VL-informed care.<sup><xref rid="bibr33-23259582211053518" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="bibr34-23259582211053518" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> These findings emphasize the importance of retaining other elements of the Streamlined Care, including training to improve relationships between patients and the clinicians, multidisease care, and enhanced patient and clinician knowledge of HIV.</p>
              <p>Despite the successes of this model, findings underscore that at the time of this study, not all newly diagnosed patients were ready to initiate ART on the same day they are diagnosed or soon thereafter. In our study, some delayed ART initiation as they slowly came to terms with their diagnosis, testing repeatedly in a bid to disprove results. Patients discussed undergoing additional HIV testing by visiting other providers, in instances where they doubted the validity of SEARCH-conducted HIV tests, or repeated testing at the study health campaign over the course of several days. In addition, patients reported repeat HIV testing as they hoped for a cure as a result of their faith and prayers. Repeated HIV testing may reflect a general mistrust of HIV test results, as has been documented in other settings; in a study in Eswatini, newly diagnosed patients sought repeat tests if they did not consider themselves at risk for HIV infection or if they had a different result previously, testing several times, and at times, over a period of years.<sup><xref rid="bibr35-23259582211053518" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> Our results and those of other researchers suggest that this phenomenon may be part of the patient's journey to acceptance of a new HIV diagnosis, underscoring the tension between rapid ART initiation and HIV-positive status acceptance.<sup><xref rid="bibr36-23259582211053518" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> HIV-care models, in an effort to be more patient-centered and facilitative, need to offer rapid ART initiation, in a way that conveys the importance of early ART and treatment as prevention, while also respecting patients’ decision-making process regarding when to start ART. Indeed, other studies support the imperative to strategize ART initiation, especially among healthy HIV patients, which is of particular importance in the context of increased ART rollout.<sup><xref rid="bibr36-23259582211053518" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="bibr37-23259582211053518" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Our findings also suggest that stigma, nondisclosure, ART misconceptions, and mobility also were reported to delay ART initiation. Moreover, stigma and non-disclosure were highly gendered, underscoring the individual, interpersonal, and health systems challenges women must overcome to initiate ART. As we previously observed in this population, men had more agency than did women to seek care and make treatment decisions autonomously.<sup><xref rid="bibr25-23259582211053518" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="bibr36-23259582211053518" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="bibr38-23259582211053518" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> Men also reported fewer negative consequences compared to women, in response to an HIV-positive status disclosure, did not need permission to seek care or start ART, and were generally well-supported, as we observed previously.<sup><xref rid="bibr39-23259582211053518" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> However, even in the context of highly gendered experiences of stigma and disclosure, patient narratives reveal the critical role of the assisted disclosure offered in the Streamlined Care model in supporting both men and women's care engagement. For men, disclosure support was helpful when fearing negative reactions such as accusations of infidelity, blame, and marital dissolution. For women, couples’ disclosure was especially helpful when fearing violent reactions and physical abuse, in addition to accusations and blame from their male partners, consistent with our previous findings.<sup><xref rid="bibr38-23259582211053518" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="bibr39-23259582211053518" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Provider support, education, and assisted disclosure were a critical element of Streamlined Care that facilitated care retention along the care cascade, especially immediately after HIV testing. Further, data were collected prior to the 2015 WHO guideline for treatment-for-all, and in a setting where nonintervention communities were providing care according to government guidelines. This served as a barrier towards rapid ART initiation as patients struggled to reconcile previous and more familiar regimens involving only cotrimoxazole (prophylactic antibiotics) prior to CD4-decline prompting ART initiation. Additionally, due to knowledge of past ART regimens that were associated with many pills and serious side effects, many healthy individuals discussed having to weigh the benefit of early ART and anticipated side effects. The fear of side effects may also have been fueled by more detailed language in the study consent form as compared to routine HIV care. Among high CD4 patients, physical well-being, determined as having no outward signs of HIV, along with anticipated negative side effects of ARTs, led to delays in starting treatment for some patients. This confluence of the feeling of being well, fear of negative side-effects, and confusion about treatment guidelines was at times a challenge for rapid ART initiation. Previous studies support these findings as barriers toward ART initiation.<sup><xref rid="bibr20-23259582211053518" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="bibr21-23259582211053518" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="bibr34-23259582211053518" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><xref rid="bibr35-23259582211053518" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr34-23259582211053518" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> For example, in a study among female sex workers who delayed treatment in Uganda, participants felt it was an achievement to not need to start ART and to stay on cotrimoxazole.<sup><xref rid="bibr40-23259582211053518" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> Patients also shared many misconceptions about the intended use of ART, discussing conspiracies around the control of African women's fertility. Although not widespread, such misconceptions may stem from historical experiences of injustice and exploitation within the community and SSA in general. While in SEARCH, community sensitization helped overcome some of these misconceptions, the persistence of these rumors and misconceptions underscores the importance of addressing the community mistrust of researchers, stemming from the colonial legacies of research within communities, for any large-scale prevention and treatment efforts to be successful.<sup><xref rid="bibr41-23259582211053518" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup></p>
              <p>While immediate linkage and rapid ART start had the potential to overcome barriers between HIV-testing and linkage, patients’ geographic mobility proved to be a major limitation to facilitating their care retention, concurrent with previous findings.<sup><xref rid="bibr20-23259582211053518" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="bibr39-23259582211053518" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> The Streamlined Care model helped patients overcome barriers to care engagement stemming from work-related mobility, by reducing wait times, providing flexibility in scheduling appointments, and permitting flexibility prescription refills; however, the mobility of some patients—particularly if unplanned, or if an out-migration to a distant community—proved untenable for sustained engagement in care in the study facilities. This suggests that care models must employ new elements to address the needs of mobile populations. Finally, VL counseling and education, a critical component of Streamlined Care, was reported to be an effective tool in the monitoring of HIV treatment success, as shown previously.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-23259582211053518" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bibr7-23259582211053518" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bibr42-23259582211053518" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> For patients who understood the purpose and results of VL tests, it served as a concrete measure of adherence success, and a motivator toward achieving their health goals. Viral suppression was reported to be associated with feelings of pride, accomplishment, and success by both clinicians and patients. However, some patients reported a limited understanding of VL tests, especially in the baseline year of the study. Despite this, some patients were able to articulate the importance of VL and could explain what the results meant to them personally. These findings underscore the importance of VL counseling, and of VL results for individualized patient education.<sup><xref rid="bibr43-23259582211053518" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Specifically, our study suggests the continuation and reiteration of viral load education and counseling, even among patients achieving viral suppression. Among providers, VL education was important in two ways: first, as a tool to convey the need for ART initiation among otherwise healthy and high CD4 individuals, and second, to foster trust and strengthen provider–patient relationships. For high CD4 patients, VL results helped communicate the benefits of a suppressed VL in maintaining a healthy immune system, and protecting HIV-negative partners, or unborn babies, even in the absence of immunological or physical signs of HIV infection.</p>
              <p>We note the limitations of this model of care with respect to key populations including highly mobile individuals. However, our findings and those of others also suggest that while community-based models may reduce some aspects of cost and barriers related to care seeking in facilities, some patients will still prefer to access care within facilities due to persistent fear of stigma and discrimination.<sup><xref rid="bibr42-23259582211053518" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> It is critical for care systems to do a comprehensive assessment of their patient populations to determine patients suitable for alternative ARV delivery models;<sup><xref rid="bibr19-23259582211053518" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> data on care models, such as the one provided in this study, can help care systems make informed decisions about which models of care to present to their communities.</p>

                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p>Data were gathered using semistructured guides that explored experiences of care and although we learned a great deal about aspects of the streamlined care model that may have influenced outcomes for patients, the inquiry was not designed to systematically explore each individual aspect of the Streamlined Care model, ie, the data from patients directly speaking to phone call reminders, longer refill dates, and other specific elements was limited. Moreover, patients may have lacked perspectives on alternative or standard models of care with which to compare their experiences, and interviews did not specifically pursue this line of inquiry. Nevertheless, the data is cross-regional from high and low HIV prevalence settings, varied mobility patents, and population density settings across four communities in two countries; it draws on both provider and patient perspectives. Analysis and interpretation involved the full study team including those who collected the data, strengthening the rigor of the study and validity of data interpretation.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>Our findings explored patient and provider experiences with Streamlined Care, a patient-centered, multiple disease model of HIV-care provision that led to successful attainment of the UNAIDS 90-90-90 goals in communities within the first 2 years of a UTT trial. Overall, the model was helpful in reducing wait times, decongesting clinic spaces, and improving care retention among stable populations. Although repeat HIV testing, ART misconceptions, stigma, nondisclosure, and mobility were barriers to the implementation of this model, VL education, assisted disclosure, and individualized counseling helped facilitate success. As HIV care delivery is scaled up in rural settings across sub-Saharan Africa, Streamlined Care is one approach that could be adapted and implemented in other settings. Innovative service delivery models will be key to engaging and retaining patients in care and ultimately achieving the UNAIDS 95-95-95 targets.</p>
