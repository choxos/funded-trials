                  <p id="P12">Olaparib treatment demonstrated activity across all cohorts. The greatest efficacy was observed in the BRCAm cohorts, regardless of gBRCAm/sBRCAm.

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="P13">Although treatment of newly diagnosed ovarian cancer with debulking surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy initially results in high response rates, approximately 70% of patients will experience relapse within 3 years [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Recurrent ovarian cancer is unfortunately often incurable, and overall, ovarian cancer represents the eighth most common cause of cancer-related mortality among women worldwide [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p>
              <p id="P14">Therapeutic advances, including poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP) inhibitors such as olaparib, have greatly improved patient outcomes. Maintenance olaparib significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with platinum-sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer (PSROC) unselected for <italic toggle="yes">BRCA1</italic> and/or <italic toggle="yes">BRCA2</italic> mutation (BRCAm) status [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], and further in patients with a BRCAm who were in response to prior platinum-based chemotherapy [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], resulting in approval as maintenance therapy for patients with PSROC irrespective of BRCAm status [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>–<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In the newly diagnosed advanced setting, maintenance olaparib significantly improved PFS over placebo in patients with a BRCAm [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and maintenance olaparib plus bevacizumab demonstrated a significant PFS improvement over placebo plus bevacizumab, particularly for patients with homologous recombination deficiency (HRD)-positive tumors (defined as a genomic instability score ≥ 42 and/or a BRCAm) [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p>
              <p id="P15">Outside of the maintenance setting, olaparib was FDA-approved for the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer in patients with a germline (g) BRCAm who have received three or more prior lines of chemotherapy [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In the phase III SOLO3 trial, which included patients with a gBRCAm and ≥2 prior lines of platinum-based chemotherapy and randomized patients to receive olaparib or non-platinum–based chemotherapy, olaparib treatment resulted in a significantly greater objective response rate (ORR) and PFS [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Identification and selection of patients with PSROC who may derive the greatest magnitude of benefit from PARP inhibitors is therefore of particular interest.</p>

                <p id="P17">LIGHT was a phase II, open-label, non-randomized, non-comparative, multicenter study in the USA and Canada. Eligible patients were ≥18 years old and had relapsed ovarian, primary peritoneal, and/or fallopian tube cancer that was histologically confirmed as high-grade serous or endometrioid with measurable disease (per the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] version 1.1; ≥1 lesion that can be accurately assessed at baseline).</p>
                <p id="P18">Following a protocol amendment (October 10, 2017) that reduced the number of prior lines of platinum-based chemotherapy from ≥2, eligible patients must have received ≥1 prior line of platinum-based chemotherapy. Eligible patients had disease progression ≥6 months after the end of their last platinum-based chemotherapy regimen. No prior PARP inhibitors were permitted. Complete eligibility criteria are described in the study protocol.</p>
                <p id="P19">Patients were assigned to cohorts according to BRCAm and HRD status based on the Myriad BRACAnalysis CDx<sup>®</sup> and myChoice<sup>®</sup> HRD assays (Cohort 1: presence of gBRCAm; Cohort 2: presence of somatic BRCAm [sBRCAm]; Cohort 3: HRD-positive [genomic instability score ≥42] without BRCAm; Cohort 4: HRD-negative [genomic instability score &lt; 42]; <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Patients received olaparib tablets 300 mg twice daily (BID) until investigator-assessed disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or other protocol-specified criteria. Patients without a Myriad test result were not assigned to a cohort but were still permitted to receive study treatment.</p>
                <p id="P20">The protocol was approved by ethics review committees at the participating institutions. The trial was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, Good Clinical Practice guidelines, and the AstraZeneca policy on bioethics [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].

                <p id="P21">The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed ORR (RECIST version 1.1). Secondary endpoints included disease control rate (DCR), investigator-assessed PFS, cancer antigen-125 response rate (CA-125 RR), time to any progression (TTAP), and safety.</p>
                <p id="P22">Adverse events (AEs) were continually monitored from informed consent. Treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) were defined as new or worsening of prior AEs following the first dose of study treatment through 30 days after the last dose of study treatment. AEs were coded to preferred terms using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA<sup>®</sup>) version 22.0, with AE severity graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03. Anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia are presented as grouped terms that included multiple preferred terms (defined in the <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Material</xref>). Additional information on AE management with dose modifications is in the study protocol.</p>
                <p id="P23">Tumor assessments were conducted at baseline and every 8 weeks (±1 week) from receipt of first dose of olaparib for up to 48 weeks, and 12 weeks thereafter until investigator-assessed progression as determined by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging per RECIST v1.1 criteria (including confirmatory RECIST scan).

However, given the estimated number of patients expected in each genetic cohort, a maximum of 90 patients may have been enrolled in each of Cohorts 1, 3, and 4 by the time sufficient patients were enrolled in Cohort 2. With 30 patients, the maximum precision of the estimated ORR is approximately ±19%, and approximately ±11% with 90 patients.</p>

CR or PR must have been confirmed ≥4 weeks after initial assessment. Responses were included until disease progression, last evaluable assessment in the absence of progression, or start of subsequent anti-cancer therapy.</p>
                <p id="P28">DCR was defined as the proportion of patients with a best overall response of confirmed CR, PR, or stable disease (SD) for ≥8 weeks from the first dose.</p>
                <p id="P29">CA-125 response was evaluated in patients with baseline CA-125 at least twice the upper limit of normal ≤2 weeks prior to treatment and was defined according to Gynecologic Cancer InterGroup (GCIG) criteria as a 50% reduction in CA-125 from baseline, confirmed and maintained for ≥28 days. CA-125 RR was the percentage of patients achieving a response. For CA-125 complete response, CA-125 must have additionally fallen within the normal range [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p>

In patients where a genomic instability score failed, reasons contributing to failure mainly included low tumor content in samples, no tumor in samples or low tumor DNA content detected in samples.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="P46">To our knowledge, LIGHT is the first prospective study to evaluate olaparib treatment in patients with PSROC who had received ≥1 prior line of platinum-based chemotherapy and who were assigned to cohorts according to known BRCAm and HRD status. Response to olaparib was seen across the cohorts and patients with a BRCAm had the highest ORRs (69% and 64% in the gBRCAm and sBRCAm cohorts, respectively) and longest PFS (~11 months). Similar efficacy was observed in both the gBRCAm and sBRCAm cohorts, consistent with prior reports in the PSROC setting [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>–<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Among patients without a BRCAm, greater efficacy was seen in those with a HRD-positive tumor, with an ORR of 29% and a median PFS of 7 months. Efficacy was generally similar within cohorts irrespective of the number of prior lines of chemotherapy.</p>
              <p id="P47">Previous reports have demonstrated the efficacy of PARP inhibition for the treatment of PSROC outside of the maintenance setting. The SOLO3 study reported a significant improvement in ORR as assessed by blinded independent central review (72.2% vs 51.4%; odds ratio [OR] 2.53 [95% CI 1.40–4.58]) and investigator-assessed PFS (HR 0.62 [95% CI, 0.43–0.91]) with olaparib treatment over non-platinum chemotherapy in patients with PSROC and a BRCAm who had received ≥2 prior lines of platinum-based chemotherapy [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Similarly, among patients with a gBRCAm in the phase III GY004 study of olaparib monotherapy or olaparib plus cediranib versus platinum-based chemotherapy as treatment for PSROC, the HR for PFS with olaparib monotherapy versus platinum-based chemotherapy was 0.63 (95% CI 0.37–1.07).</p>
              <p id="P48">Other trials, with niraparib [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and rucaparib [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], have demonstrated the efficacy of PARP inhibitors as treatment in populations beyond patients with a BRCAm. In the phase II AVANOVA2 study of niraparib with/without bevacizumab in PSROC, the niraparib monotherapy arm (including 37% with a BRCAm and 55% with one prior line of platinum-based chemotherapy) had an ORR of 27% (95% CI, 15–41) and median PFS of 5.5 months [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In the phase II QUADRA study of patients with PSROC (48% of patients had HRD-positive tumors), 13 of 47 patients (28%; 95% CI, 16–43) who had received ≥3 prior lines of therapy achieved a confirmed objective response to niraparib monotherapy with a median PFS of 5.5 months [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In part one of the phase II ARiEL2 study of rucaparib monotherapy, also in PSROC, 32 of 40 patients (80%; 95% CI, 64–91) achieved an objective response among patients with a BRCAm, 24 of 82 patients (29%; 95% CI, 20–40) without a BRCAm and with high loss of heterozygosity (LOH), and 7 of 70 patients (10%; 95% CI, 4–20) without a BRCAm and low LOH [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Although any cross-trial comparisons should only be made with caution due to disparate patient populations and procedures (particularly for assessing HRD status), it is notable in each of the previously mentioned studies [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] that the highest ORRs and longest PFS with PARP inhibitor treatment were observed in patients with BRCAm, HRD-positive tumors, or high LOH, consistent with the findings in LIGHT. For patients without a BRCAm in this study, a higher ORR and longer median PFS and TTAP were observed in the HRD-positive cohort than in the HRD-negative cohort. These data are consistent with the established utility of HRD (by BRCAm and/or genomic instability) as an indicator of particular benefit from PARP inhibition [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>–<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p>
              <p id="P49">The observed RECIST and CA-125 responses even in the HRD-negative cohort also suggest that platinum sensitivity is a key factor to predict response to PARP inhibitor treatment in PSROC. In addition, the high DCR of &gt;75% across all four cohorts suggests that a wide range of patients with PSROC may derive clinical benefit from PARP inhibitor treatment, consistent with other studies [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>–<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Therefore, olaparib may represent an effective chemotherapy-sparing treatment for all patients with PSROC, although the magnitude of benefit is greater in patients with BRCAm and/or HRD-positive tumors.</p>
              <p id="P50">Multiple tests have been used to identify patients with PSROC who may particularly benefit from PARP inhibitor therapy. This study used the Myriad myChoice<sup>®</sup> HRD assay, with a genomic instability score of ≥42 deemed HRD-positive. This assay is based on LOH, telomeric allelic imbalance, and large-scale state transitions and is consistent with testing methodology used in the AVANOVA2 and QUADRA studies [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, in ARIEL2, subgroups were defined using BRCAm and LOH, as determined by Foundation Medicine T5 testing [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Refinement of the markers used to select patients who may benefit would inform optimal treatment selection in PSROC. The ORR of approximately 30% in the HRD-positive (non-BRCAm) cohort in this study and in similar populations in other studies suggests that HRD assays may identify a patient population who can benefit from PARP inhibition. However, the higher ORRs in the BRCAm cohorts (69% and 64% for gBRCAm and sBRCAm, respectively) suggest that BRCAm is the best biomarker so far to predict response to PARP inhibition.</p>
              <p id="P51">Olaparib treatment was well tolerated and the safety profile was consistent with that seen in prior olaparib studies [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The median total duration of treatment was similar to the median actual duration of treatment (ie, excluding dose interruptions), suggesting dose interruptions did not have a notable impact. The majority of TEAEs with olaparib treatment were manageable with dose modification and supportive treatment and there was a low discontinuation rate due to TEAEs.</p>
              <p id="P52">Limitations of this study include its non-randomized nature and lack of a comparator arm. The protocol amendment that reduced the required number of prior lines of platinum-based chemotherapy from ≥2 to ≥1 meant that there were proportionally fewer patients who had received one line of therapy in the HRD-negative cohort, which was the fastest to enroll. The evolving ovarian cancer therapeutic landscape, with PARP inhibitor efficacy demonstrated as first-line maintenance (with or without bevacizumab), increases the likelihood of prior PARP inhibitor exposure among patients who receive PARP inhibition for PSROC. Although analyses have suggested some patients may derive benefit from PARP inhibitor retreatment [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], and the phase III OReO trial reported a PFS benefit with maintenance olaparib rechallenge [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], data fully exploring PARP inhibition in the treatment setting following prior PARP inhibitor exposure are limited.</p>
              <p id="P53">In conclusion, as previously observed in trials of PARP inhibitors in and outside of the maintenance setting, olaparib treatment for patients with PSROC in LIGHT demonstrated greatest efficacy among patients with a BRCAm, with similar efficacy seen with both gBRCAm and sBRCAm. For patients without a BRCAm, a higher ORR and longer median PFS were observed in the HRD-positive cohort than in the HRD-negative cohort. Therefore, olaparib may represent an effective chemotherapy-sparing treatment for all patients with PSROC.</p>
