                  <title>Objective:</title>
                  <p>The efficacy of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in HIV will diminish with poor adherence; pharmacologic measures of drug exposure have proven critical to PrEP trial interpretation. We assessed drug exposure in hair against other pharmacologic and more routinely used measures to assess pill-taking.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Design:</title>
                  <p>Participants were randomized to placebo, daily PrEP, or intermittent PrEP to evaluate safety and tolerability of daily versus intermittent tenofovir/emtricitabine (TFV/FTC) in 2 phase II PrEP clinical trials conducted in Africa. Different measures of drug exposure, including self-report, medication event monitoring system (MEMS)-caps openings, and TFV/FTC levels in hair and other biomatrices were compared.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods:</title>
                  <p>At weeks 8 and 16, self-reported pill-taking, MEMS-caps openings, and TFV/FTC levels in hair, plasma, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were measured. Regression models evaluated predictors of TFV/FTC concentrations in the 3 biomatrices; correlation coefficients between pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic measures were calculated. Both trials were registered on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> (NCT00931346/NCT00971230).</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results:</title>
                  <p>Hair collection was highly feasible and acceptable (100% in week 8; 96% in week 16). In multivariate analysis, strong associations were seen between pharmacologic measures and MEMS-caps openings (all <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001); self-report was only weakly associated with pharmacologic measures. TFV/FTC hair concentrations were significantly correlated with levels in plasma and PBMCs (correlation coefficients, 0.41–0.86, all <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001).</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions:</title>
                  <p>Measuring TFV/FTC exposure in small hair samples in African PrEP trials was feasible and acceptable. Hair levels correlated strongly with PBMC, plasma concentrations, and MEMS-caps openings. As in other PrEP trials, self-report was the weakest measure of exposure. Further study of hair TFV/FTC levels in PrEP trials and demonstration projects to assess adherence/exposure is warranted.</p>

              <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
              <p>The efficacy of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in which at-risk HIV-uninfected individuals take antiretrovirals to prevent HIV acquisition has been demonstrated in several recent trials.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Based on these results, a combination of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and emtricitabine (FTC) taken daily as PrEP was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for high-risk individuals in 2012 with recently updated guidelines from the Centers of Diseases Control<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> and World Health Organization<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> citing broad indications. Optimal strategies for PrEP administration are under intense investigation.</p>
              <p>Although PrEP was effective in reducing HIV acquisition in some trials,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> 2 large trials in sexually active African women (FEM-PrEP<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>–<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> and VOICE<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) were unable to demonstrate efficacy of daily TDF/FTC in reducing HIV acquisition. Rates of study product use in major PrEP trials as assessed by self-report or product return counts have been high (88%–95%), but direct measures of drug exposure indicate lower rates of actual use. Of paramount importance to the effective rollout of PrEP in both resource-rich and resource-limited settings is the incorporation of novel, accurate, and feasible ways to estimate adherence.</p>
              <p>Although adherence is described as the “behavioral bridge from efficacy to effectiveness”<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> in PrEP, each method to quantitate drug-taking has limitations. Self-report can be limited by recall bias, poor recollection, or a desire to please the provider (“social desirability bias”).<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Although pill counts and medication event monitoring systems (MEMS) can improve the accuracy of adherence monitoring,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> neither measure can record actual drug consumption<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>–<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> nor quantify pharmacokinetic parameters.</p>
              <p>Pharmacologic measures of exposure, most often involving the measurement of antiretrovirals in a matrix such as plasma, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), dried blood spots, or hair,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>–<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> reflect both adherence and pharmacokinetics. Measurement of antiretroviral (ARV) levels in single plasma samples has been frequently used to monitor exposure in PrEP trials, but represent a small window of exposure (2–7 days)<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>–<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> and may be susceptible to “white coat effects,” where adherence improves transiently before visits.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Drug levels in PBMCs have also proven useful in the interpretation of PrEP trial results,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> providing information on exposure over longer periods (7–14 days), although procedures to process, isolate, and count PBMCs can be costly and technically challenging. Drug levels in dried blood spots can reflect both recent and cumulative exposure<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> and were recently used in a large cohort of PrEP users<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>; although easier to collect and process than PBMCs, dried blood spots require standardization against hemoglobin concentrations and sample volume for interpretation.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Hair collection is noninvasive and does not require phlebotomy, and hair levels of ARVs reflect uptake from the systemic circulation over weeks to months,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> representing a long-term measure of exposure. Moreover, hair concentrations of tenofovir (TFV) are strongly and linearly related to dose.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></p>
              <p>Intermittent PrEP may facilitate adherence, reduce costs, and has demonstrated efficacy in simian models<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> and, in a recent trial, in men who have sex with men (MSM)<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> although this strategy is not yet clinically approved.

Comparing pharmacokinetic measures with more “traditional” measures of drug exposure (eg, self-report or MEMS) could provide insight into the utility of these measures across different PrEP dosing patterns and guide the selection of these measures in PrEP studies/settings. Multiple biologic samples for exposure monitoring (plasma, PBMCs, and hair) were collected in 2 phase II trials investigating daily or intermittent PrEP in HIV-negative serodiscordant couples in Uganda<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> and MSM in Kenya.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> We report here an analysis comparing hair levels of FTC and TFV with self-report of pill-taking, MEMS-caps openings, and plasma and PBMC drug concentrations in these 2 trials.</p>

                  <p>Because the target number of pills to be taken varied by treatment arm (intermittent versus daily) and from person-to-person within the intermittent arm, we did not define adherence. Our goal was to measure drug exposure, rather than a particular adherence pattern to a daily or intermittent regimen. Our analytic outcomes were therefore drug levels detected by various measures, including pharmacologic measures as continuous outcomes and traditional measures (eg, MEMS-caps openings and self-reported pill-taking) as count outcomes. Concentrations of TFV and FTC in the various biologic matrices were log transformed for linear regression models. All pharmacological measures below the detection limit were set equal to that limit, and the detection limit was added to all concentrations prior to log transformation to prevent very low levels from becoming large negative values; similarly, 1.0 was added to pill counts before log transformation.</p>

The main purpose of this report was to assess relationships between hair concentrations of TFV and FTC in 2 intermittent and daily phase II PrEP trials with other measures of drug exposure. We found a strong association between TFV/FTC concentrations in hair, plasma, and PBMCs with MEMS-caps openings in these trials. As has been observed in other HIV prevention and treatment settings, the relationship between pharmacologic measures of exposure and self-reported pill consumption was weak. These trials also showed strong correlations between hair concentrations of TFV and FTC with plasma and PBMC concentrations, with stronger correlations observed after a longer period on drug.</p>

Moreover, ours is the first study to comprehensively assess the relationship between pharmacologic measures and MEMS-caps openings in PrEP. In this analysis, the association between pharmacologic measures and self-reported pill-taking did not hold in multivariate analyses, and the correlations were weak or nonexistent.</p>
                <p>The finding that self-reported pill-taking did not show strong relationships with biologic measures of exposure is consistent with accumulating data that self-report overestimates pill-taking in HIV prevention trials.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The strong relationship between MEMS-caps openings and pharmacologic measures adds to the literature that MEMS monitoring may be more reflective of actual adherence than self-report.<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> The relationship between self-report and MEMS-caps openings (r = 0.80) may reflect similar day-to-day variation in behavior that is not captured by the pharmacologic exposure measures.

                <title>Strong Correlation Between Hair Concentrations and Other Pharmacologic Measures</title>
                <p>In HIV treatment, hair concentrations of ARVs are the strongest independent predictor of virologic outcomes.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> This article reports for the first time a strong correlation between hair concentrations of TFV and FTC and plasma or PBMC drug concentrations in intermittent PrEP. This study and another report<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> demonstrated strong correlations between TFV and FTC concentrations in hair, plasma, and PBMCs with daily PrEP. Because plasma and PBMC concentrations of TFV/FTC have both demonstrated associations with PrEP efficacy in clinical trials,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> this analysis suggests that hair concentrations may also serve as a useful pharmacologic monitoring tool in PrEP. Because drug levels in hair reflect exposure over long time periods, hair monitoring may be useful for monitoring long-term PrEP use; the stronger association between hair concentrations and the other pharmacologic measures at 16 weeks (versus 8 weeks) in this trial may represent achievement of steady-state concentrations over time. The higher number of participants with undetectable hair concentrations at 16 versus 8 weeks, however, may represent waning adherence with time.</p>
                <p>The use of any exposure monitoring method in PrEP trials or real-world settings will be partially determined by cost, convenience, and acceptability of the method. Hair collection is noninvasive and does not require phlebotomy skills, refrigeration, sterile equipment, or biohazardous precautions,<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>–<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> all features which may enhance the feasibility of hair measures for resource-limited settings. As such, the cost of hair assays may be relatively lower than PBMC or plasma assays, methods that require postcollection processing in the field and training for collection, processing and handling, but such a cost benefit will require validation. Moreover, work is underway on developing low-cost, point-of-care assays to measure ARVs in hair using low-technology methods.<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref> The feasibility and acceptability of hair collection in these 2 phase II PrEP trials were high, with 100% of participants agreeing to hair collection at week 8 and 96% of participants providing hair samples at week 16. A recent study in a rural Kenyan cohort examining ARV adherence through hair levels demonstrated acceptability rates for hair collection of &gt;95%,<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> and a qualitative South African study revealed a general willingness to provide hair samples for HIV research when the purpose behind hair sampling was explained.<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> Another trial collecting hair samples from Ugandan HIV-infected mothers and their infants also demonstrated high acceptability rates for collection.<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> This report therefore adds to accumulating data that hair collection for antiretroviral monitoring in cohort or trial settings in Africa is feasible, acceptable, and may provide a more “patient-friendly” method for evaluating drug exposure.<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></p>
                <p>Our study showed a trend between dosing patterns of TDF/FTC and concentrations of drug in hair: hair levels for those assigned daily dosing averaged more than two-fold those assigned to intermittent dosing. These findings correspond to a recent report demonstrating strong linear relationships between TDF dose and hair TFV concentrations in HIV-uninfected volunteers.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> An analysis between hair levels of TFV/FTC and efficacy in the iPrEx Open Label Extension study<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> is in progress and should further inform the field.</p>

                <title>Pharmacologic Measures Can Assess Pharmacokinetic Information in Addition to Adherence</title>
                <p>Pharmacologic measures seem to correlate with behavior, as evidenced by the comparisons with MEMS-caps openings but may also provide information regarding pharmacokinetics. The covariates additionally associated with pharmacologic measures in multivariate analyses (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>) are likely to be associated with effects on behavior, pharmacokinetics, or both. For instance, we found that lower rates of creatinine clearance were associated with increases in plasma TFV and FTC concentrations (13% and 18% increase, respectively, for every 10% decrease in clearance), consistent with primary renal clearance of these agents.<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref> Notably, absolute declines in creatinine clearance in these 2 studies were minimal, were not clinically significant, and were generally transient.</p>
                <p>The effects of khat and marijuana use on FTC levels in hair could reflect a detrimental impact on adherence not captured by the MEMS measurement or effects on drug metabolism, although such a relationship was not reflected in the other pharmacologic measures. However, the active intracellular phosphorylated forms of FTC have a shorter half-life than TFV<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>–<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>; therefore, lapses in adherence may impact FTC concentrations before TFV concentrations. The participants in serodiscordant heterosexual couples in Uganda had 48% higher TFV concentrations in hair than Kenyan MSM participants. This association was partially mediated by MEMS-caps openings and likely reflects specific challenges that MSM report in taking PrEP<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref> and higher PrEP adherence rates in HIV-negative partners of individuals with known HIV infection.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> Finally, the association between increased height and increased FTC concentrations in hair could be secondary to the known association between low body mass index and higher medication levels, although this effect was not seen with other pharmacologic measures, and body mass index did not retain significance in the multivariate model.</p>

                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p>The biggest limitation of any study evaluating pharmacologic measures of exposure is a lack of a “gold standard” for measuring drug exposure to antiretrovirals. However, this study did provide an opportunity to compare exposure in hair with other biologic measures, self-reported pill-taking, and electronic monitoring. The sample size in each of the active arms was relatively small, although statistically significant associations between key covariates and pharmacologic measures were still detected. Comparison of adherence rates in the active versus placebo arms was not permitted by this analysis because pharmacologic measures cannot assess drug exposure to placebo. Furthermore, we were only able to analyze PBMC concentrations in half of the person-visits, potentially limiting our ability to comprehensively model the impact of various covariates on PBMC measures. Finally, although hair collection was acceptable in this population and hair measures were associated with MEMS measures and other pharmacologic measures, these phase II PrEP trials did not assess the association between drug concentrations and HIV acquisition rates. Moreover, although hair concentrations of drug do not seem to vary significantly by texture or hair color (personal communication, UCSF Drug Studies Unit), further study of the effect of variability in these conditions on hair levels in the field is needed.</p>

              <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
              <p>This study demonstrates a number of novel findings, notably that monitoring concentrations of TFV/FTC in hair in the HIV prevention setting was feasible, acceptable, and correlated strongly with MEMS-caps measures and drug concentrations in other biomatrices. The lack of strong correlations between pharmacologic measures of exposure and self-reported pill-taking in this study adds to the growing evidence that self-reported adherence in HIV prevention trials performs poorly. The strong correlation between pharmacologic measures and behavior as assessed by electronic monitoring of bottle openings suggests a role for combining modalities of measuring adherence or exposure to PrEP. Given the urgent need for developing feasible, low-cost, and objective measures of adherence and exposure monitoring in PrEP, these findings pave the way for further exploration of hair concentrations as an exposure monitoring tool in PrEP investigational and implementation projects.</p>
