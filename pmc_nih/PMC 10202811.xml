                <p id="Par1">Neuroblastomas harbor <italic>ALK</italic> aberrations clinically resistant to crizotinib yet sensitive pre-clinically to the third-generation ALK inhibitor lorlatinib. We conducted a first-in-child study evaluating lorlatinib with and without chemotherapy in children and adults with relapsed or refractory ALK-driven neuroblastoma. The trial is ongoing, and we report here on three cohorts that have met pre-specified primary endpoints: lorlatinib as a single agent in children (12 months to &lt;18 years); lorlatinib as a single agent in adults (≥18 years); and lorlatinib in combination with topotecan/cyclophosphamide in children (&lt;18 years). Primary endpoints were safety, pharmacokinetics and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). Secondary endpoints were response rate and <sup>123</sup>I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) response. Lorlatinib was evaluated at 45–115 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/dose in children and 100–150 mg in adults. Common adverse events (AEs) were hypertriglyceridemia (90%), hypercholesterolemia (79%) and weight gain (87%). Neurobehavioral AEs occurred mainly in adults and resolved with dose hold/reduction. The RP2D of lorlatinib with and without chemotherapy in children was 115 mg/m<sup>2</sup>. The single-agent adult RP2D was 150 mg. The single-agent response rate (complete/partial/minor) for &lt;18 years was 30%; for ≥18 years, 67%; and for chemotherapy combination in &lt;18 years, 63%; and 13 of 27 (48%) responders achieved MIBG complete responses, supporting lorlatinib’s rapid translation into active phase 3 trials for patients with newly diagnosed high-risk, ALK-driven neuroblastoma.

              <p id="Par3">Neuroblastoma is an aggressive extracranial solid tumor of childhood that is responsible for a disproportionate number of pediatric cancer-related deaths<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Gain-of-function mutations in the <italic>ALK</italic> (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) oncogene were identified as the genetic etiology of familial neuroblastoma and as the most common somatic single-nucleotide variants in neuroblastoma, positioning <italic>ALK</italic> as the most frequently mutated oncogene tractable for targeted therapy in neuroblastoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Furthermore, relapsed neuroblastoma harbors increased somatic mutations, with enrichment of <italic>ALK</italic>-activating subclonal/clonal mutations compared to diagnostic tumors, with a frequency of 20% and rising as we sequence patient tumors and/or plasma more routinely at time of relapse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. ATP-competitive ALK/Met/ROS1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as crizotinib, have transformed the treatment of patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) harboring <italic>ALK</italic> translocations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> and demonstrated differential activity in pre-clinical models of ALK-driven neuroblastoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. A phase 1 trial of ceritinib in children with ALK-driven malignancies showed a response rate (RR; complete/partial) of 20% (6/30) with responses primarily observed in patients with an ALK R1275 mutation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. A phase 2 trial of crizotinib in children with refractory or relapsed ALK-mutant neuroblastoma reported an RR of 15% (3/20);<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> in stark contrast, far more objective and sustained responses were observed in ALK-fusion-driven refractory or relapsed anaplastic large cell lymphoma (RR 90%) and inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors (RR 86%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, highlighting the difference between therapeutic targeting of full-length mutated <italic>ALK</italic> in neuroblastoma compared to cytoplasmic ALK fusion proteins in other cancers. Primary resistance to crizotinib and early-generation ALK inhibitors represents a major obstacle for common <italic>ALK</italic> hotspot mutations in neuroblastoma (for example, F1174L and F1245C)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, supporting the need for next-generation ALK TKIs with improved selectivity and potency against neuroblastoma de novo resistant <italic>ALK</italic> mutations.</p>
              <p id="Par4">Lorlatinib, a third-generation macrocyclic inhibitor of ALK and ROS1, was developed to maintain potency across resistant <italic>ALK</italic> mutations that arise in response to first-generation or second-generation ALK TKIs in NSCLC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Early-phase clinical trials in adults with ALK-driven or ROS1-driven NSCLC demonstrated objective and durable responses to single-agent lorlatinib, including patients with central nervous system (CNS) metastases and those previously treated with other ALK TKIs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. One dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of grade 2 cognitive effects occurred in an adult receiving the 200 mg daily dose. The adult recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) was determined to be 100 mg per day, two dose levels below the DLT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Although common adverse events (AEs) of peripheral edema and neuropathy were similar to other ALK TKIs, unique AEs of hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia and CNS effects were also observed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par5">Lorlatinib demonstrates high potency across acquired <italic>ALK-</italic>activating mutations in adult cancers, including the intractable <italic>ALK</italic> variants (F1174L and F1245C) found de novo in neuroblastoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Lorlatinib exerts potent activity in ALK-driven neuroblastoma pre-clinical models in vivo, with anti-tumor doses 10–30-fold lower than crizotinib<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Lorlatinib induced complete tumor regression in both crizotinib-resistant and sensitive neuroblastoma-derived xenografts harboring F1174L, F1245C or R1275Q <italic>ALK</italic> mutations, demonstrating lorlatinib’s potential to overcome crizotinib resistance. These data provided the pre-clinical rationale for the clinical development of lorlatinib for patients with ALK-driven neuroblastoma.</p>
              <p id="Par6">Here we present the safety, tolerability and anti-tumor activity of a first-in-child New Approaches to Neuroblastoma Therapy (NANT) Consortium phase 1 study (NANT2015-02) of lorlatinib in children, adolescents and adults with ALK-driven refractory or relapsed neuroblastoma. Primary aims were to determine the toxicities, pharmacokinetics and RP2D of lorlatinib administered both as monotherapy and in combination with topotecan/cyclophosphamide. A secondary aim was to evaluate the anti-tumor activity by determining the RR (complete response (CR) and partial response (PR)) and a modified RR (CR/PR/minor responses (MRs)) (as defined in NANT version 2.0 response criteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>). This trial had four parts (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>): phase 1 dose escalation for &lt;18 years (A1); phase 1 dose escalation for ≥18 years (A2); dose escalation for lorlatinib with topotecan/cyclophosphamide for &lt;18 years (B2), all determined by 3 + 3 design; and dose expansion for single-agent lorlatinib (B1). We report the data for cohorts A1, A2 and B2 that have met the pre-specified protocol endpoints for determination of the RP2D, description of toxicity and activity. Dose levels (DLs) and treatment regimens for each cohort are described in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a,b</xref>. Patients ≥12 months with measurable or evaluable refractory or relapsed high-risk neuroblastoma, including CNS metastases and/or prior treatment with ALK TKIs aside from lorlatinib, were eligible (<xref rid="Sec8" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>). DLTs occurring in course 1 and DLTs from CNS effects (CNS DLTs) occurring in courses 1 and 2 informed dose escalation and RP2D determination. Patients were evaluable for dose escalation if they had received ≥75% of expected doses or experienced a DLT in courses 1 or 2. Neurobehavioral functioning was routinely assessed to provide real-time measures of cognition, behavior and mood during lorlatinib administration. Patients who received any amount of lorlatinib were considered evaluable for response unless deemed by central review to have inadequate imaging to assess overall response. An exploratory aim to prospectively determine the frequency of circulating tumor cell-free DNA (ctDNA) detection of <italic>ALK</italic> and acquired mutations at study entry and with each disease evaluation was performed and will be reported separately (Berko, <italic>et al.</italic>, Nat. Comm. 2023, in press).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Study design and patient disposition.</title><p><bold>a</bold>, NANT 2015-02 study design. <bold>b</bold>, Treatment regimen by cohort. <bold>c</bold>, Patient distribution. *Cohort B2 opened at 95 mg/m<sup>2</sup> once cohort A1, DL4 (95 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) was deemed tolerable and safe.

The symptoms recurred despite dose reduction in course 3, necessitating cessation of therapy and prompting an amendment to exclude rechallenge for grade 4 neuropsychiatric toxicity. No other courses 1 and 2 DLTs occurred during the dose-escalation phase, defining 150 mg daily dosing as the single-agent RP2D for patients ≥18 years of age. In the A2, 150 mg dose expansion cohort, a DLT of grade 4 mania and grade 3 memory impairment, anxiety and delusions occurred (course 1) in a patient who was concurrently taking marijuana, which resolved with lorlatinib discontinuation; no drug rechallenge occurred. Additionally, one patient had a DLT of grade 3 agitation and neuropathy in course 2 that recurred in course 3 despite dose reduction and resolved after discontinuation of lorlatinib. One other patient had a delayed DLT in course 4 of grade 2 neuropathy/edema but has tolerated reduced-dose lorlatinib.

Patient 3 treated at DL1 on cohort A1 had a germline <italic>ALK</italic> R1275Q mutation with metastatic primary refractory neuroblastoma.

              <p id="Par20">Despite an exponential increase in discoveries related to neuroblastoma genomics and immune evasion, a child diagnosed with high-risk neuroblastoma today is subjected to a largely empiric and vastly intensive regimen of genotoxic chemotherapeutics, radiation and GD2-targeted immunotherapy that, although effective, has substantial acute and long-term side effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. We have sought to change this paradigm by developing and implementing biomarker-directed precision therapies. In this first-in-child phase 1 study of lorlatinib given alone or in combination with chemotherapy, lorlatinib was found to be safe and tolerable in pediatric, adolescent and adult patients with relapsed or refractory <italic>ALK-</italic>mutated or <italic>ALK</italic>-amplified neuroblastoma.</p>
              <p id="Par21">The RP2D of 115 mg/m<sup>2</sup> daily in patients &lt;18 years of age was about twice the regulatory-approved adult NSCLC starting dose, as predicted by pre-clinical studies of neuroblastoma harboring <italic>ALK</italic> mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. The clinical studies of crizotinib and ceritinib for patients with refractory or relapsed ALK-driven neuroblastoma showed responses that were limited mainly to tumors harboring an ALK R1275 mutation with no activity in tumors harboring an F1174 mutation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Single-agent lorlatinib demonstrated clinical activity across patients of all ages harboring the three neuroblastoma-specific hotspot <italic>ALK</italic> mutations, including patients who had previously received other ALK TKIs. Remarkably, the only patient with a germline <italic>ALK</italic> mutation who was treated at DL1 with widely metastatic chemo-refractory disease had an outstanding and sustained response to lorlatinib, similar to the responses seen with crizotinib and ceritinib in the same context<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, providing further proof of concept that ALK inhibition in the context of a germline mutation is highly effective. Notably, adolescents and adults with ALK-driven neuroblastoma had objective and sustained responses, an important outcome for patients who often have an indolent clinical course with de novo chemotherapy resistance and an abysmal overall outcome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Genomic correlates of indolent neuroblastoma, such as somatic alterations in the ATRX gene or activation of the alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) mechanism, have been defined<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>, but we have been unsuccessful at leveraging these discoveries into more precise therapies. Future studies looking at ALK status in conjunction with an ALT phenotype will be integral for bringing new therapies to these patients.</p>
              <p id="Par22">Overall, younger patients treated with lorlatinib monotherapy, in particular those also harboring <italic>MYCN</italic> amplification, had fewer responses than older patients despite similar PK exposure. There is a significant correlation in the A1 cohort between age at study entry and response, but this is clearly confounded by <italic>MYCN</italic> amplification status (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). The ongoing Childrenʼs Oncology Group ANBL1531 phase 3 trial and planned European trial also integrating lorlatinib into frontline therapy will provide more definitive data on any relationship between age and anti-tumor activity and will interrogate ALT status for all enrolled patients. <italic>MYCN</italic> amplification is a truncal event in neuroblastoma that is almost never detected in tumors of patients &gt;12 years of age, and it portends an especially aggressive disease course at relapse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. We posit that, due to intra-tumor heterogeneity and clonal evolution, mutations in <italic>ALK</italic> are branched events in these patients and that lorlatinib monotherapy will be insufficient<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Notably, we observed objective responses in two patients with <italic>MYCN</italic> amplification treated with lorlatinib in combination with chemotherapy, suggesting that <italic>MYCN</italic>-amplified, ALK<italic>-</italic>mutant disease can potentially be overcome with the addition of chemotherapy. We posit that future development of a strategy of lorlatinib in combination with, for example, a MYCN-directed protein degrader may be especially impactful for this patient population.</p>
              <p id="Par23">In the context of this phase 1 trial of safety and tolerability, we observed objective responses, and, of those, patients who achieved objective responses of CR/PR to lorlatinib as well as those with MR/SD went on to receive multiple courses of therapy owing to sustained responses. These response rates to lorlatinib compare favorably to previous trials of first-generation and second-generation ALK inhibitors crizotinib (15% CR/PR) or ceritinib (20% CR/PR) in children with ALK-driven neuroblastoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Notably, responses to lorlatinib monotherapy were seen across all hotspot mutations, as opposed to crizotinib and ceritinib where primary resistance was observed in common neuroblastoma mutations F1174 and R1245. Certain key characteristics, such as MYCN status and prior ALK TKI exposure, were not specified in those trials, making it difficult to further compare efficacy.</p>
              <p id="Par24">Although historical trials report CR/PR rates, there is now international consensus that minor response be used given the importance of MIBG response. Some patients with BOR of MR/SD were notable for having CR by functional imaging (MIBG or PET becoming non-avid) and bone marrow CRs achieved, with halted soft tissue tumor growth control that was not reflected in the BOR. In the era of targeted therapies such as lorlatinib, we are recognizing that durable metabolic responses result in sustained tumor control, supporting why the international community has added minor response in the overall response assessment. We speculate that <italic>ALK</italic> mutations may contribute to a differentiation block and that potent ALK TKI therapy can cause tumors to terminally differentiate, which is why response determination using RECIST may fall short in demonstrating the full effects of ALK TKIs. These data support that novel response criteria may be necessary to understand the anti-tumor activity of molecularly targeted agents.</p>
              <p id="Par25">The safety profile of lorlatinib across all ages was similar in scope and grade to those reported in NSCLC studies, with the unique toxicities of lorlatinib, such as weight gain and increased circulating lipids, manageable with supportive care, diet management and statins. Only one patient, who had a germline <italic>ALK</italic> mutation, discontinued lorlatinib owing to significant weight gain. AEs such as peripheral neuropathy, peripheral edema and CNS effects reported in adults with ALK fusion NSCLC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> were more frequently observed in adults with neuroblastoma compared to children. Although superior responses were observed at the 150-mg dose (four CRs), the A2 cohort is ongoing at 100 mg to determine whether the established RP2D in adults with neuroblastoma can be further refined. Patients &lt;18 years of age treated with lorlatinib monotherapy overall had less toxicity, with only 9% requiring a dose reduction. Lorlatinib in combination with topotecan/cyclophosphamide was well tolerated and showed no overlapping toxicities in patients &lt;18 years of age, allowing for the monotherapy RP2D to be combined with standard-of-care chemotherapy.</p>
              <p id="Par26">Lorlatinib was optimized to penetrate the blood–brain barrier, leading to improved CNS distribution as well as intracranial responses in patients with NCSLC with brain metastases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Although this contributes to the CNS effects seen in adults with neuroblastoma enrolled on this study, neuroblastoma has a propensity for recurrence in the brain, especially after anti-GD2 antibody therapy that does not cross the blood–brain barrier<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>; thus, lorlatinib’s CNS penetration is an advantageous attribute. Intracranial anti-tumor activity could not be assessed in our study as no patient with CNS metastases enrolled; however, proof of concept has been demonstrated in a child with ALK-fusion-positive glioma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. Real-time neuropsychological surveillance on our study identified the presence of baseline (that is, pre-therapy) neurobehavioral symptoms across patients of all ages, including those who did and did not develop CNS effects, suggesting challenges in differentiating and predicting later CNS effects via pre-treatment neurobehavioral screening methods in this patient population. Serial neuropsychological monitoring detected increased risk for neurobehavioral decline in all patients who experienced a CNS DLT and assisted with their Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grading. However, risks for neurobehavioral decline were also identified in patients who did not have a CNS AE. Therefore, future studies examining the sensitivity and specificity of neurobehavioral screening measures to detect change in neurocognitive functioning in response to lorlatinib in pediatric patients are warranted, considering the limitations and feasibility of real-time monitoring within the context of a larger clinical trial.</p>
              <p id="Par27">Grade 4 CNS AEs were limited to two adult patients, with one having a prior undisclosed psychiatric history, supporting the continued need for strict eligibility criteria to exclude those patients who are most at risk. Failure of certain patients to disclose prior psychiatric clinical history has also highlighted the need to identify more robust objective mechanisms to screen for pre-treatment psychiatric risk. Most importantly, CNS effects consistently improved with dose hold and reduction, allowing most to continue lorlatinib to benefit from its potent anti-tumor effects. Lorlatinib exposure was not affected by age nor by addition of chemotherapy.</p>
              <p id="Par28">The source of tumor tissue used for <italic>ALK</italic> gene sequencing was variable, with some from tumor obtained before relapse and others from tissue biopsies performed at relapse yet not at time of enrollment. These single tumor biopsies are inadequate representations of the entire disseminated tumor bulk, and, therefore, sequencing data used for enrollment may not represent the intra-tumor heterogeneity and clonal evolution at study entry. We, therefore, collected research-based serial ctDNA to characterize genomic changes in response to therapy, detect early disease progression and identify evolving alterations driving tumor heterogeneity and lorlatinib resistance. This same assay has already informed on the genetic evolution of relapsed neuroblastoma for patients not on this trial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. The full landscape of ctDNA genomic alterations in patients with ALK-driven refractory or relapsed neuroblastoma treated on this trial is detailed in a companion manuscript.</p>
              <p id="Par29">The current therapeutic paradigm for patients with high-risk neuroblastoma is to treat with an intense and largely empiric multi-modal approach. The discovery of ALK as a biomarker of inferior prognosis and of these oncogenic mutations as drivers of tumorigenesis in a significant subset of newly diagnosed patients has shifted the paradigm to study ALK inhibition in frontline therapy. Based on the results of this phase 1 study, which supports the hypothesis that lorlatinib will be safe and effective for patients with newly diagnosed ALK-driven, high-risk neuroblastoma, we recently implemented a major amendment to replace crizotinib with lorlatinib in the Childrenʼs Oncology Group phase 3 trial (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03126916">NCT03126916</ext-link>). Incorporation of lorlatinib in the European phase 3 trial in collaboration with the International Society of Paediatric Oncology European Neuroblastoma (SIOPEN) is planned as well. Integration of a potent targeted therapy in the treatment of newly diagnosed patients with <italic>ALK-</italic>aberrant, high-risk neuroblastoma holds substantial promise for improving patient outcomes.</p>

Patients had to meet criteria for presence of neuroblastoma tumor 4 weeks before enrollment in at least one of the following sites: soft tissue (at least one target or non-target lesion); bone (minimum of one site of disease by functional imaging using MIBG or FDG-PET); or presence of tumor in bone marrow (tumor detected in bone marrow biopsies or aspirates). Eligible <italic>ALK</italic> somatic aberrations included an <italic>ALK-</italic>activating mutation, <italic>ALK</italic> amplification (&gt;10 signals of the <italic>ALK</italic> gene) or the presence of any <italic>ALK</italic> fusion that arises from a chromosomal translocation. Patients had to be fully recovered from prior therapy, including a minimum of 2 weeks off chemotherapy; 7 days off biologic therapy; the longer of 7 days or three half-lives off monoclonal antibody; 2 weeks off radiation, except large field that required 12-week washout; and 6 weeks from prior autologous stem cell transplant. Prior ALK inhibitor therapy, except for prior lorlatinib, was allowed, and active CNS disease was allowed. All patients met standard organ function criteria before enrolling. Patients were excluded if they were pregnant, breastfeeding, on hemodialysis, had an active or uncontrolled infection or had a known chronic severe psychiatric disorder or any history of suicidal ideation or attempt.</p>

                <title>Trial design: clinical considerations</title>
                <p id="Par32">We conducted a phase 1 international multi-center study in the NANT Consortium of lorlatinib both as single agent and in combination with chemotherapy in patients with <italic>ALK-</italic>aberrant relapsed, refractory or progressive neuroblastoma. Lorlatinib was administered orally once daily for 28 days per course in both the single-agent and chemotherapy combination cohorts. Patients ≥12 months of age and &lt;18 years of age and &lt;1.73 m<sup>2</sup> body surface area (BSA) for DL1 and DL2, &lt;1.43 m<sup>2</sup> BSA for DL3 and &lt;1.56 m<sup>2</sup> BSA for DL4 were assigned to the pediatric and adolescent cohort A1, where lorlatinib was given as a single agent. Five DLs (45, 60, 75, 95 and 115 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/dose) were assessed in A1, using a 3 + 3 design. Patients ≥18 years of age or ≥ corresponding BSA noted above for DL1, DL2, DL3 and DL4 were assigned to cohort A2, where two doses of single-agent lorlatinib at 100 mg (the RP2D for adult NSCLC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>) and 150 mg daily were assessed. Patients ≥12 months to &lt;18 years of age who received lorlatinib in combination with chemotherapy were assigned to cohort B2. B2 patients received fixed doses of topotecan (0.75 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/dose intravenously (IV)) and cyclophosphamide (250 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/dose IV) on days 1–5 of each course (topotecan/cyclophosphamide) in combination with two escalating doses of lorlatinib (95 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/dose or 115 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/dose daily on days 1–28 of each course). Myeloid growth factor was given 24 hours after the completion of topotecan/cyclophosphamide on B2, according to institutional standards. Instructions and hands-on training for a tablet dispersion formulation, validated by Pfizer, was provided to families of patients who could not swallow tablets. In the absence of disease progression or meeting off-protocol criteria, patients were allowed to continue lorlatinib indefinitely. Cohort B2 opened at DL4 once cohort A1 DL4 was deemed tolerable and safe. B2 did not dose escalate to DL5 (115 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) until both cohort B2 DL4 in chemotherapy combination and cohort A1 DL5 (115 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) as single agent was deemed tolerable and safe.</p>

                <title>Trial design: statistical methods</title>
                <p id="Par34">In this phase 1 trial, evaluation of lorlatinib DLs followed the 3 + 3 dose-escalation design in each of the three cohorts separately. Hence, at each DL during the escalation portion, the plan was to enroll either three or six patients who were evaluable for DLT, with six DLT-evaluable patients at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or highest DL planned. In this trial, two exceptions occurred. In cohort A1 at DL4, because two of the first five patients were inevaluable for DLT assessment (due to disease progression before starting the second course, although neither had experienced DLT in the first course), the Study Management Committee (SMC) decided to expand DL4 to two additional patients to further evaluate later course toxicities before escalating to DL5. Once none of the first five DLT-evaluable patients experienced DLT during the DLT observation period, the SMC decided to open DL5 (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> and Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). The second exception occurred in cohort A2 at the first DL of 100 mg. Initially, this was the only DL planned, but, with a subsequent amendment, a second DL was added to cohort A2 (150 mg). At that time, because all five patients enrolled at 100 mg were DLT evaluable and none had experienced DLT during the DLT observation period, the SMC decided to assign the next A2 patient to the 150-mg DL. Finally, because of the nature of the patients in cohort A2 (which had only two planned DLs), an expansion of up to six additional patients was planned for the highest DL tested with zero or one DLT in six DLT-evaluable patients. Accrual could continue in the expansion cohort as long as none, or at most one, of the patients experienced DLT in the DLT observation period; if two or more patients experienced DLT in the DLT observation period, this would lead to a discussion of the suitability of this dose. The probability of observing more than two patients with DLT, out of six patients, is 0.11, 0.22, 0.47, 0.68 and 0.77 when the true probability of DLT is 0.10, 0.15, 0.25, 0.35 and 0.40, respectfully.</p>
                <p id="Par35">All DLTs in the first course of therapy and CNS DLTs through the second course of therapy had an impact on decisions regarding dose escalation due to delayed CNS toxicities observed in the adult lorlatinib trials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. In cohorts A1 and A2, patients were deemed evaluable for toxicity and contributed to dose-escalation purposes if they received a minimum of 75% of the planned lorlatinib doses in courses 1 and 2 or if they experienced any DLT during course 1 or a CNS DLT in courses 1 or 2. For patients in cohort B2, patients were evaluable for dose-escalation purposes if they had received at least 75% of the planned lorlatinib, cyclophosphamide and topotecan doses in course 1 or if they had a course 1 DLT. Patients who were not evaluable for DLT were replaced for dose-escalation purposes. All eligible patients who received any amount of lorlatinib were considered evaluable for response unless deemed by the SMC to have inadequate imaging to assess overall response. The MTD was defined as the highest DL tested at which zero of six or one of six patients experience DLT. After determination of the MTD and review of all toxicities, and provided that other safety considerations were acceptable, the MTD was labeled the RP2D.</p>

                <title>Toxicity assessment</title>
                <p id="Par37">Toxicity was graded according to CTCAE version 4. DLT definitions included only toxicities deemed at least possibly related to therapy. For A1 and A2, hematologic DLT was defined as grade 4 thrombocytopenia or grade 4 neutropenia &gt;7-day duration or a delay in the start of subsequent course by more than 14 days due to ongoing thrombocytopenia or neutropenia, in the absence of bone marrow disease progression seen on clinically indicated bone marrow biopsy (if performed). For cohort B2, hematological DLT is defined as a delay in the start of subsequent course by more than 14 days due to ongoing thrombocytopenia or neutropenia, in the absence of bone marrow disease progression seen on clinically indicated bone marrow biopsy after the first dose reduction of cyclophosphamide and topotecan. Non-hematologic DLT was defined as any non-hematologic toxicity that delayed the start of a subsequent cycle by more than 14 days or any grade ≥3 toxicity, with the exception of the following grade 3 toxicities: nausea, vomiting, anorexia or dehydration resolving to grade ≤2 within 72 hours; increase in hepatic transaminase or electrolyte abnormality resolving eligibility levels within 7 days; diarrhea persisting for less than 72 hours; fever; infection; febrile neutropenia; high cholesterol or triglycerides if responsive (to ≤grade 2) with statin treatment; weight gain; and hyperglycemia if responsive (to &lt;grade 2) with dietary modification. Additional non-hematologic DLT included any grade 2 non-hematological toxicity that persists for more than 7 days and is considered sufficiently medically significant or sufficiently intolerable by patients that it requires treatment interruption; recurrence of grade 2 neuropsychological effects; grade 2 radiologically confirmed pancreatitis; recurrence of grade 2 first-degree symptomatic heart block; and grade 1 second-degree (Mobitz type 1 or 2) asymptomatic heart block.</p>

                <p id="Par43">Only measures with established language translations were used. If measures were not available in a patient’s primary language, neurobehavioral toxicity assessment was based on the treating physician’s clinical determination using CTCAE version 4.0 grading criteria. All measures were individually administered by trained, qualified site personnel. Standardized scores were obtained for each instrument administered by comparing raw scores to normative samples provided by the test publishers. All evaluation results were reviewed, analyzed and interpreted centrally in real time by a pediatric neuropsychologist. Determination of clinically meaningful change in functioning (that is, significant decline) relative to baseline or previous screening exam was made at each retest interval. This was calculated using reliable change indices (RCIs) for individual tests or scales, which account for standard errors of measurement, to determine whether a statistically significant change in scores occurred between two timepoints. Meaningful change in performance was considered to occur when clinically significant decline (using 90% CI) was present in 50% of select administered measures. Risk for possible decline and consideration for modification of neuropsychological retest interval (increased screening frequency) was determined using a 25% impairment classification model in an effort to reduce potential for type 1 error. A neuropsychological status report detailing findings was generated and provided to the treating oncologist within 72 hours to assist with CNS toxicity grading. A neuropsychology grading tool was used as a tool for physicians to grade patient baseline and subsequent toxicities. The physician assessment used both the neuropsychological report and history to grade neuropsychological toxicities.</p>

                <title>Response evaluation</title>
                <p id="Par44">Patients underwent disease staging at baseline, after courses 2 and 4 and then every four courses thereafter. The primary endpoint for response analysis is the BOR, defined as the best response observed before progression or start of another therapy. All eligible patients who receive any amount of lorlatinib were considered evaluable for response unless deemed by the SMC to have inadequate imaging to assess overall response. Response was graded according to the NANT response criteria version 2.0 (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>), modified from the International Neuroblastoma Response Criteria (INRC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. NANT response criteria use three components for assessment of overall response: soft tissue response assessed by anatomical imaging and avidity on MIBG or FDG-PET; bone response assessed by uptake in bone by MIBG or bone involvement on FDG-PET; and bone marrow response assessed by morphology on bilateral aspirates and biopsies. Each response component (soft tissue, bone and bone marrow) are graded as CR, PR, SD and PD. Overall response grading is defined as: CR, if a response of CR in all components that are involved at baseline; PR, if a response of PR or better in all involved components; MR, if a response of PR or better but with at least one involved component as SD and no PD in all involved components; SD, if a response of SD in all involved components; and PD, if a response of PD in at least one involved component. The overall response definitions are identical to overall responses (CR, PR, SD and PD) as defined by the INRC. Response assessment is initially performed by sites and reviewed against source documents by NANT operations. Additional blinded central review of all radiological or pathological data was conducted for patients with overall PR or better and, in addition, radiologic pathological data of all involved sites for patients with MR to assign the final BOR on this study. Response by MIBG was determined using the Curie criteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. RR was determined as the proportion of patients with BOR of CR and PR in each cohort. Based on an international consensus by the National Cancer Institute Clinical Trials Planning Committee to refine tumor site eligibility criteria and evaluation of disease response for early-phase clinical trials in children with high-risk recurrent, refractory and progressive neuroblastoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, we also performed an ad hoc analysis to determine a modified RR that includes the proportion of patients with BOR of CR, PR and MR.</p>
