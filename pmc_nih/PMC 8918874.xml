                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Rates of shared decision making (SDM) are relatively low in early stage prostate cancer decisions, as patients’ values are not well integrated into a preference-sensitive treatment decision. The study objectives were to develop a SDM training video, measure usability and satisfaction, and determine the effect of the intervention on preparing patients to participate in clinical appointments.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>A randomized controlled trial was conducted to compare a plain-language decision aid (DA) to the DA plus a patient SDM training video. Patients with early stage prostate cancer completed survey measures at baseline and after reviewing the intervention materials. Survey items assessed patients’ knowledge, beliefs related to SDM, and perceived readiness/intention to participate in their upcoming clinical appointment.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Of those randomized to the DA + SDM video group, most participants (91%) watched the video and 93% would recommend the video to others. Participants in the DA + SDM video group, compared to the DA-only group, reported an increased desire to participate in the decision (mean = 3.65 v. 3.39, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.001), less decision urgency (mean = 2.82 v. 3.39, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.001), and improved self-efficacy for communicating with physicians (mean = 4.69 v. 4.50, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.05). These participants also reported increased intentions to seek a referral from a radiation oncologist (73% v. 51%, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.004), to take notes (mean = 3.23 v. 2.86, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.004), and to record their upcoming appointments (mean = 1.79 v. 1.43, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.008).</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>With improvements in the early detection of prostate cancer among men, a growing number of patients are faced with the difficult decision of active surveillance, radiation, or surgery.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-0272989X211028563" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> The best treatment for each patient depends on both his medical factors (e.g., cancer severity and medical comorbidities) and also on how he personally values the risks (e.g., erectile dysfunction) and benefits (e.g., chance of curing the cancer) of each choice<sup><xref rid="bibr2-0272989X211028563" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>; therefore, this is a clinical situation that can be considered a preference-sensitive decision. The process of shared decision making (SDM) offers a framework for patients and physicians to identify the best treatment option based on both patients’ medical factors and personal values.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-0272989X211028563" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> To be able to fully participate in SDM, patients must 1) be knowledgeable about their medical condition and treatment choices, 2) feel empowered to engage in decision making processes, and 3) have the skills required to participate in the actual clinical appointment.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, baseline rates of SDM in early stage prostate cancer are relatively low, and physicians frequently do not incorporate patients’ values into their recommendations.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-0272989X211028563" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="bibr5-0272989X211028563" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="bibr6-0272989X211028563" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> One reason for these low rates of SDM may be the information asymmetry between patients and physicians, such that patients do not feel qualified to participate during clinical appointments.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-0272989X211028563" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Traditional decision aids have focused on addressing this issue by increasing patients’ knowledge about their medical conditions and treatment options. However, even with decision aids designed to decrease information asymmetry, patients with early stage prostate cancer still often do not receive treatments that are aligned with their preferences.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-0272989X211028563" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bibr7-0272989X211028563" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> One reason for this may be that most decision aids focus on increasing patients’ knowledge about their medical conditions and treatment options but do not necessarily empower them to engage in decision making. Men with early stage prostate cancer face particularly high barriers to participating in clinical appointments, given that they are generally older in age and may need to talk about sensitive topics such as impotence and incontinence.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-0272989X211028563" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Many interventions have attempted to improve patient participation in clinical appointments by teaching physicians better communication skills, with good success across multiple domains.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-0272989X211028563" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> However, effective SDM “takes two to tango,”<sup><xref rid="bibr3-0272989X211028563" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> and improving communication skills in physicians is only part of the equation. Physicians cannot fully engage in SDM if patients are not prepared to engage with them.</p>
              <p>Combining a decision aid (DA) with a patient SDM training video may be a new approach to improve SDM by teaching patients more specifically about the SDM process, including how to participate actively in clinical appointments. Despite their promise, there have been relatively few intervention studies on how to improve patient communication skills<sup><xref rid="bibr10-0272989X211028563" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> and even fewer that have looked at the effect of combining a DA with a communication skills intervention. Currently, the effects of communication skills interventions have been mixed, although it does seem that patients are overall more participatory during clinical appointments.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-0272989X211028563" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="bibr11-0272989X211028563" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr12-0272989X211028563" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr13-0272989X211028563" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="bibr14-0272989X211028563" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Notably, many patient communication skills interventions suffer from 3 broad limitations: 1) lack of conceptual or theoretical framework, 2) outcome measures that do not match their interventions, and 3) an exclusive focus on question asking, which is only 1 form of patient participation.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-0272989X211028563" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Finally, many studies have provided patients with communication coaching through one-on-one trainings, which are relatively resource intensive and not easily scalable.<sup><xref rid="bibr16-0272989X211028563" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="bibr17-0272989X211028563" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup></p>
              <p>In this study, we conducted a randomized trial to compare the effect of a DA alone v. the DA plus a SDM training video on patients’ knowledge, beliefs about the SDM process, and perceived readiness to participate in their upcoming clinical appointments. Our study addressed previous studies’ limitations by incorporating a theoretical basis for the SDM video training, examining multiple aspects of SDM beyond question asking, and matching our outcome measures to the content that was being taught within the video. This article reports 1) the development of a novel SDM training video, 2) patients’ evaluation of the training video, and 3) the extent to which a DA paired with a SDM training video (relative to the DA alone) changed patients’ knowledge of prostate cancer, beliefs about the SDM process, and perceived readiness to participate in their upcoming clinical appointments. Specifically, we hypothesized that compared with patients who only received the DA, patients who received the DA plus the SDM training video would report 1) equivalent knowledge about their medical condition and treatment options since the SDM video was not designed to affect knowledge, 2) feel empowered to engage in decision making processes (e.g., desire to participate in the decision), and 3) feel more prepared to participate in upcoming clinical appointments (e.g., greater self-efficacy for communicating with physician).</p>

                  <p>The DA was based on the existing booklet “Making the Choice: Deciding What to Do about Early Stage Prostate Cancer,” which was designed to empower men with early stage prostate cancer to engage in treatment decision making.<sup><xref rid="bibr18-0272989X211028563" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> The DA uses plain language and simple graphics to be accessible to men with eighth-grade literacy levels.

                  <p>Patients who received the SDM training video received a slightly modified DA that summarized the important material in the video. First, there was a summary page of the communication skills and participatory behaviors emphasized in the video, with pictures of a patient modeling the behavior. Second, the “questions you may wish to ask your doctor” page listed more questions about preferences and the decision making process rather than purely about medical knowledge. Finally, there was more space for “notes.” Otherwise, the DAs were identical.</p>

                  <title>SDM training video</title>
                  <p>The SDM training video incorporates several theoretical models of communication and human behavior, including Bandura’s (1977) model of self-efficacy,<sup><xref rid="bibr19-0272989X211028563" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> the Comskill model of physician communication skills training,<sup><xref rid="bibr20-0272989X211028563" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> and previously established barriers to and facilitators of SDM.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-0272989X211028563" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> The intervention primarily focused on increasing patients’ self-efficacy through 3 separate methods outlined by Bandura<sup><xref rid="bibr19-0272989X211028563" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>: 1) “vicarious experience” by actors modeling communication skills, 2) “verbal persuasion” of the importance of SDM by verbal suggestion and encouragement, and 3) “performance accomplishments” by asking patients to visualize using SDM skills. A video was chosen as the method for demonstrating adaptive patient communication in a clinical visit because visual modeling has been shown to be an effective way to increase self-efficacy regarding new behaviors.<sup><xref rid="bibr19-0272989X211028563" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup></p>
                  <p>To develop the content of the SDM training video, we assembled a team of clinicians and health communication experts to review audio-recorded clinical appointments from another study<sup><xref rid="bibr6-0272989X211028563" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> in which patients received their prostate cancer diagnoses and discussed treatment options with their urologists. The team first identified the typical appointment flow as follows: introduction, discussion of biopsy experience and results, discussion of treatment options, and making a treatment decision or deciding the next steps.<sup><xref rid="bibr21-0272989X211028563" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Then, using an iterative process, the team identified categories of “shared decision making problems” that often occurred within each of these sections of the appointment. In consultation with communication and SDM experts, the team identified strategies that patients could use to overcome each of these communication problems (<xref rid="table1-0272989X211028563" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). An initial video script was created using the identified problems and solutions as a template. The video script was then reviewed by clinician stakeholders (i.e., urologists, radiation oncologists, medical oncologists, and primary care providers) and experts in the field of medical decision making, decision aids, and patient-centered care. The tool was also influenced by the results of a previous focus group and semistructured interviews that were conducted with men who had a history of prostate cancer during the development of the first patient decision aid. In the focus group and interviews, men read the DVD script and listened to an audio recording with readers portraying the patient, doctor, and narrator and gave their reactions to it. The focus group and interviews were conducted in a semistructured format to identify specific content that was useful, confusing, helpful, upsetting, and/or valuable and to suggest improvements. Revisions to the script were made based on feedback from the focus group, interviews, and our experts prior to filming.</p>

                  <p>At the end of this process, the video was designed to address elements of the decision making process that are optimal for SDM, including the 1) importance of participating in the treatment decision and communicating one’s personal preferences and values, 2) acceptability of taking time to make the decision, 3) utility of getting a second opinion, and 4) feeling confident and prepared to participate in the clinical appointment (e.g., bring recorder, list of questions, communication self-efficacy).</p>
                  <p>The final video was 26 minutes long and portrayed a hypothetical clinical appointment in which a patient met with a urologist to receive his prostate biopsy results, learned that he had a diagnosis of localized prostate cancer, and discussed his treatment options. The videos portrayed clinical interactions between a patient and physician (played by professional actors) to demonstrate areas where there are often communication problems and where SDM could be beneficial. The video then modeled 1 or more solutions. Throughout the video, the narrator emphasized other aspects of how to participate in SDM, such as reassuring patients they could take time for their decision, that their preferences mattered, and encouraging them to take notes during their appointments.</p>
                  <p>There were two versions of the final video: 1 primarily featuring a black patient actor and 1 primarily featuring a white patient actor (although both videos included both patient actors). The urologist in both videos was white. Patients who self-identified as white or black received the version that more predominantly featured the patient actor that matched their own race to increase their likelihood of identifying with the individual performing the desired behavior, which has been shown to more effectively improve self-efficacy.<sup><xref rid="bibr19-0272989X211028563" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="bibr22-0272989X211028563" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="bibr23-0272989X211028563" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Patients who identified as a race other than black or white (e.g., Asian) were randomized between the 2 video versions. Due to limited resources and the patient population served at the site of the study, the study team decided to limit the patient actor races to white and black since these were the primary races in the anticipated study population, while acknowledging that unfortunately this means that some individuals (e.g., Hispanic or Asian) would not see themselves reflected racially in the video.</p>

                <p>The study took place from November 2010 through April 2014 at 2 clinics within a university-affiliated hospital in the midwestern United States. We recruited male patients at the time of their prostate biopsy appointment to test for cancer (primarily due to elevated prostate-specific antigen [PSA] levels on screening tests). Participants completed an initial baseline survey and were then randomized to 1 of 2 groups: DA only v. the DA plus the SDM training video. Randomization at biopsy ensured that men had the opportunity to review the intervention materials (i.e., decision aid ± video) before they discussed their diagnoses and treatment options with their physicians (which typically occurred 1–2 weeks after the biopsy). Only men diagnosed with low- or intermediate-risk prostate cancers (Gleason score of 6 or 7 and PSA &lt;20) were eligible to continue in the study, as these are the cancers for which patient preferences were the most salient at the time of the study and the clinical condition for which the decision aid was designed.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-0272989X211028563" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Participants completed a preappointment survey after reviewing the intervention materials but prior to their appointment with their physician to discuss biopsy results. <xref rid="fig1-0272989X211028563" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> shows the CONSORT diagram for who was included in the study sample for analyses.</p>

                <title>Use and Evaluation of Study Materials</title>
                <p>Most participants reported using the study materials (i.e., DA ± video) and would recommend them to other men with prostate cancer. Overall, 76% of participants reported that they spent 30 minutes or more reading the DA (a reasonable amount of time to fully review the contents) and 92% would “probably” or “definitely” recommend it. Neither of these assessments differed across condition (for time spent reviewing, <italic toggle="yes">F</italic>(1, 198) = .03, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.70, and for recommending the DA, <italic toggle="yes">F</italic>(1, 198) = 2.31, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.10). Of the participants who received the SDM training video, 91% of participants reported that they watched the entire video, and 93% of those would “probably” or “definitely” recommend it.</p>
                <p>Participants felt that the amount of information they received from the materials they received (either DA only or DA plus video) was appropriate in quantity, with mean ratings not significantly different from the midpoint (3) of the response scale (1 = too little and 5 = too much), <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>(199) = .59, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.56. Participants’ evaluation did not differ by condition (<italic toggle="yes">F</italic>(1, 198) = 1.14, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.29). Ninety-five percent of participants “agreed” or “strongly agreed” that the information was balanced. Participants’ evaluation did not differ by condition (<italic toggle="yes">F</italic>(1, 198) = 1.47, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.23). Finally, participants believed that the information was trustworthy, with a mean trustworthiness score of 9.36 (SD = 1.65) (0 = completely untrustworthy and 11 = completely trustworthy). Participants in the DA plus SDM video group rated the materials they received as more trustworthy than participants in the DA-only group (mean [SD]: DA + video, 9.63 [1.5] v. DA only, 9.04 [1.74]; <italic toggle="yes">F</italic>(1, 195) = 6.39, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0. 012), although average trustworthiness ratings were high across both conditions.</p>

                <p><xref rid="table5-0272989X211028563" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> presents the analyses assessing differences between the DA only v. DA plus SDM video on key SDM outcomes. As expected, prostate cancer knowledge did not differ across conditions. Participants who received the DA plus SDM training video reported a significantly greater preference for taking a more active role in decision making, even though participants in both groups were significantly above the midpoint of the scale (for DA-only group: <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>(92) = 6.53, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.001; for DA + SDM video group: <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>(106) = 12.86, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.001). This indicates a preference for patient-led decision making regardless of condition. Participants who received the DA plus SDM video reported significantly less decision urgency and more frequently planned to seek a referral to a radiation oncologist. However, participants’ plan to seek a second opinion from another urologist or speak to a primary care physician did not differ across condition. Participants who received the DA plus SDM training video reported significantly higher communication self-efficacy and reported that they were more likely to take notes and bring a tape recorder to their appointment. Participants’ reported likelihood of bringing a list of questions or bringing someone with them to the appointment did not differ by condition.</p>

              <p>In this study, we developed a novel SDM training video for patients with early stage prostate cancer, evaluated its usability and acceptability, and conducted a randomized trial to evaluate the effect of the training video plus an educational DA v. the educational DA alone on a number of outcome measures associated with SDM. Both the DA and SDM training video were well received and highly used by patients. As expected, the SDM training video did not affect patients’ knowledge of their condition or treatment options because both groups received the DA, which aligns with the intention of the DA to improve factual knowledge.<sup><xref rid="bibr29-0272989X211028563" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> Rather, the training video improved several measures of outcomes associated with effective SDM: an increased desire to participate in the decision, less decision urgency, improved physician communication self-efficacy, and increased intentions to seek a referral from a radiation oncologist, take notes, and record their upcoming appointments.</p>
              <p>While DAs have been shown to improve patient knowledge,<sup><xref rid="bibr29-0272989X211028563" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> studies have found that patients with early stage prostate cancer do not receive treatment concordant with their preferences,<sup><xref rid="bibr6-0272989X211028563" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bibr7-0272989X211028563" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> suggesting that SDM among patients with prostate cancer could be improved. Video may be an effective medium to provide patients with SDM training, including elements of communication skills training. In our study, we found that using a SDM training video that had trained actors who modeled SDM and effective communication with a physician improved both participants’ desire to engage in SDM and related behaviors (e.g., intention to take notes) and their self-efficacy for communicating with their physician. Prior studies attempting to improve patients’ communication self-efficacy have relied on “high-intensity” one-to-one coaching sessions between patients and professional communication coaches.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-0272989X211028563" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="bibr16-0272989X211028563" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="bibr17-0272989X211028563" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="bibr30-0272989X211028563" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> Although several of these interventions showed promise for improving SDM, the utility of these interventions is limited by their resource intensiveness. Other approaches that focus on encouraging patients to ask questions can improve physician provision of information, which is an important aspect of the SDM process.<sup><xref rid="bibr31-0272989X211028563" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> These approaches do not, however, address some of the more nuanced aspects and challenges of engaging in a full SDM process during clinical appointments. Our study suggests that videos may be an ideal low-resource format to deliver this more nuanced training to patients facing preference-sensitive decisions. Distribution of the materials could be easily incorporated into the clinic workflow; for example, the staff member rooming the patient for their biopsy could provide the patient with a packet of information that contained both the decision aid and the training video, as well as a letter explaining that all patients who undergo biopsies receive this information to help prepare them in case their biopsy comes back positive for early stage prostate cancer. Because clinicians often provide biopsy results and discuss treatment options in the same visit, this is likely best timing for distribution of the materials. For patients who do not end up getting diagnosed with early stage prostate cancer, the video would still be beneficial because the SDM skills taught in the video can be applied across multiple health care settings.</p>
              <p>There are some limitations to our study. First, our participant group lacked diversity. Most men were white and highly educated, which was a reflection of the patient population at the study site. Replication of our study with a more diverse sample would be important to evaluate for external validity, especially given that prior studies have found race differences in treatment preference after viewing decision aids for prostate cancer.<sup><xref rid="bibr32-0272989X211028563" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> Unfortunately, we were underpowered to reliably test for interactions between patient characteristics (e.g., race or income) and the effectiveness of the intervention within our data set, but future research should be attuned to this possibility and more actively recruit a diverse patient population. Second, it is not clear whether the increases in self-efficacy and intentions we observed will translate into increases in empowerment during clinical appointments. Self-efficacy expectations are a significant determinant of behavior,<sup><xref rid="bibr19-0272989X211028563" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> but clinical appointments are complex, and other factors may affect whether or not patients participate in clinical appointments. Future analyses that examine actual patient participation in appointments will help elucidate whether the statistically significant increase in self-efficacy and SDM intentions associated with the video intervention translated into a practically significant difference in patient participation in SDM. Third, we intentionally chose to evaluate the effect of the addition of a SDM training video to a DA to isolate the effects of a SDM training video from the effects of knowledge provision, and the DA was slightly modified for the SDM training video group to reinforce material in the video. As a result, we did not have a “true control” in which no intervention was provided. We made this choice given the extensive evidence that decision aids improve decisional outcomes compared to no decision aid.<sup><xref rid="bibr33-0272989X211028563" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> We feel that the benefits gained from our approach outweigh the cons but recognize that there are implications for the interpretation of our results. Fourth, due to logistical constraints and our anticipated patient population, we only developed 2 versions of the video: one that primarily featured an African American patient and one that primarily featured a white patient. As a result, some patients may not have seen themselves racially represented in the training video. Future research could examine whether it would be equally efficacious to use a single video that included patients from more racial groups and/or multiracial individuals. This would also decrease the resources needed to produce the training video and simplify the video distribution process. Fifth, although we chose our outcome measures intentionally to reflect the targets of our intervention, we acknowledge that all outcome measures have inherent limitations, and there are aspects of SDM that we did not address in our choice of measures. Last, the American Urology Association updated treatment guidelines in 2017,<sup><xref rid="bibr34-0272989X211028563" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> after this study was conducted, to distinguish recommendations for low-risk (recommend active surveillance) v. intermediate-risk prostate cancer (recommend surgery or radiotherapy). However, they still recommend that counseling of patients should incorporate SDM principles as there are often multiple clinically accepted options. Therefore, we believe these findings continue to provide guidance in best practices for engaging patients with clinically localized prostate cancer (both low and intermediate risk).</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>Patient communication skills training interventions show promise for increasing patients’ participation in SDM, but previous interventions were limited in the scalability of their interventions. We developed and tested a novel, theory-based SDM training video as an alternative to one-on-one intensive communication training interventions. We found that a SDM training video plus a DA, compared to a DA alone, improved several measures associated with patient participation in SDM. Specifically, it 1) increased patients’ intentions to record their appointments and take notes, 2) increased patients’ sense of self-efficacy regarding patient–physician communication, 3) decreased decision urgency, and 4) increased patients’ desire to participate in the decision. The SDM video may be a cost-effective, scalable approach to teach patients with early stage prostate cancer how to more fully participate in the SDM process, although additional research is needed to determine whether these changes will translate into differences in patient behavior during clinical appointments and final decision making process.</p>
