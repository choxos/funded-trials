                <p>The HIV-1 latent reservoir is the major barrier to cure. Analysis of the replication competent latent reservoir that can be induced in viral outgrowth assays (VOAs) showed little or no overlap with HIV viruses that emerge in plasma after treatment interruption. To determine whether intact proviruses amplified from DNA are more closely related to rebound viruses than those obtained from VOA, we sequenced HIV proviral genomes from CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells of individuals who underwent analytical treatment interruption. We find that intact proviruses obtained from DNA overlap in part with those obtained by VOA, but do not overlap with rebound viruses. However, nearly half of all rebound sequences could be accounted for in part by recombination of intact near full-length sequences.</p>

                <p>Combination antiretroviral therapy controls but does not cure HIV-1 infection because a small fraction of cells harbor latent viruses that can produce rebound viremia when therapy is interrupted. The circulating latent virus reservoir has been documented by a variety of methods, most prominently by viral outgrowth assays (VOAs) in which CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are activated to produce virus in vitro, or more recently by amplifying proviral near full-length (NFL) sequences from DNA. Analysis of samples obtained in clinical studies in which individuals underwent analytical treatment interruption (ATI), showed little if any overlap between circulating latent viruses obtained from outgrowth cultures and rebound viruses from plasma. To determine whether intact proviruses amplified from DNA are more closely related to rebound viruses than those obtained from VOAs, we assayed 12 individuals who underwent ATI after infusion of a combination of two monoclonal anti–HIV-1 antibodies. A total of 435 intact proviruses obtained by NFL sequencing were compared with 650 latent viruses from VOAs and 246 plasma rebound viruses. Although, intact NFL and outgrowth culture sequences showed similar levels of stability and diversity with 39% overlap, the size of the reservoir estimated from NFL sequencing was larger than and did not correlate with VOAs. Finally, intact proviruses documented by NFL sequencing showed no sequence overlap with rebound viruses; however, they appear to contribute to recombinant viruses found in plasma during rebound.</p>

            <p content-type="flushleft">During the HIV-1 infection cycle, viral DNA is inserted in the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells as a provirus and is then actively transcribed to produce new virions. In the vast majority of infected cells, this burst of HIV-1 production leads to cell death by apoptosis or pyroptosis (<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). A far less frequent alternative fate is for the provirus to be suppressed and to become latent (<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Upon treatment interruption, latent proviruses are stochastically activated leading to rebound viremia and the requirement for life-long therapy for HIV-1 infection (<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p>
            <p>Although numerous methods have been evaluated to measure the latent reservoir, viral outgrowth assays (VOAs) are considered to be the gold standard (<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). In this assay, infected donor CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are activated in vitro to induce HIV-1 production in the presence of uninfected recipient CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. When performed at limiting dilution, and combined with sequence analysis of the emerging viruses, VOAs can yield both quantitative and qualitative information about the latent reservoir (<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p>
            <p>When the reservoir is assayed by VOAs, individuals that have achieved viral suppression on antiretroviral therapy (ART) are typically found to harbor 1 between 10<sup>5</sup>–10<sup>6</sup> circulating CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells that contain replication competent latent proviruses (<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Longitudinal studies have estimated that the half-life of the latently infected CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the HIV-1 reservoir is 44 mo (<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). However, there are several caveats to interpreting the results of the VOAs: (<italic>i</italic>) The assay is highly variable and any difference of less than sixfold is not considered to be significant (<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>); (<italic>ii</italic>) a single round of stimulation captures only a fraction of the latent cells that can be reactivated (<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>); (<italic>iii</italic>) individual latent cells differ in their requirements for reactivation (<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>); (<italic>iv</italic>) VOAs are typically performed on cells derived from blood and this compartment may not be representative of the entire latent reservoir (<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>); and (<italic>v</italic>) the requirements for reactivation in vitro and in vivo may differ significantly (<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).</p>
            <p>Sequencing intact viral genomes from limiting dilution CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell DNA samples is a recently developed alternative method to document the HIV-1 reservoir (<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). An advantage of this sequencing method is that it does not require latent virus reactivation in vitro. However, it too is subject to the same sampling caveats as VOAs, and the additional question of whether intact proviruses contribute to rebound viremia during treatment interruption.</p>
            <p>A small number of intact proviral sequences obtained by near full-length (NFL) sequencing have been compared with VOAs and rebound viruses in a clinical trial where individuals underwent analytical treatment interruption (ATI) after monotherapy with the 3BNC117 monoclonal anti–HIV-1 antibody (<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). To further examine the relationship between proviruses obtained from circulating CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells by NFL sequencing and the viruses that emerge from the reservoir during treatment interruption, we analyzed samples from 12 individuals enrolled in a clinical trial that involved ATI after infusion of a combination of two broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (bNAbs) (<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p>

              <p>NFL proviral genomes were amplified from DNA extracted from purified CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells obtained from the two leukapheresis samples from nine individuals that maintained viral suppression for &gt;12 wk after ATI, including two that remained virologically suppressed during the entire observation period (&gt;30 wk, participants 9254 and 9255) (<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).

              <p>Overall, the amount of HIV-1 DNA in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in circulation did not change significantly during the observation period. On average <italic>gag</italic><sup>+</sup> proviruses were found at a frequency of 942 and 841 out of 10<sup>6</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells at the preinfusion and week-12 time points, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1<italic>C</italic></xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1813512115/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Table S1</ext-link>). Although individual participants showed some variation in the frequency of <italic>gag</italic><sup>+</sup> proviruses at the two time points, the degree of variation was consistent with 2.5-fold variability in the assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1<italic>C</italic></xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1813512115/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Table S1</ext-link>).</p>
              <p>Defective HIV-1 proviruses frequently carry deletions in <italic>env</italic> (<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). We found that the median number of proviruses containing full-length <italic>env</italic> was 21 times lower than <italic>gag</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> proviruses for both preinfusion and week-12 time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1<italic>C</italic></xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1813512115/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Table S1</ext-link>). Proviruses with a near full-size HIV-1 genome were found at a still lower frequency of 20 and 11 out of 10<sup>6</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells at the preinfusion and week-12 time points, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1<italic>C</italic></xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1813512115/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Table S1</ext-link>). The difference between the number of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells containing <italic>env</italic> and a near full-size HIV-1 genome is expected because a fraction of defective proviruses retains intact <italic>env</italic> (<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Similar to <italic>gag</italic> or <italic>env</italic>, there was no significant difference in the frequency of cells containing near full-size HIV genomes between the two time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1<italic>C</italic></xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1813512115/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Table S1</ext-link>).</p>
              <p>To determine the frequency of intact proviruses in circulating CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, we sequenced all near full-size HIV-1 proviruses and counted only those with intact reading frames, packaging signals, and major splice donors (MSDs). Intact proviruses were found at a median frequency of 2.8 out of 10<sup>6</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells at both time points, which is 5.9- and 6.9-fold lower than the number of proviruses containing near full-size HIV-1 genomes at the preinfusion and 12-wk time points, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1<italic>C</italic></xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1813512115/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Table S1</ext-link>). Overall, on average only 1 out of 336 or 300 <italic>gag</italic><sup>+</sup> proviruses were intact at the preinfusion and week-12 time points. Nevertheless, there was a positive correlation between the number of intact and <italic>gag</italic><sup>+</sup> proviruses, and also between intact and near full-size proviruses (<italic>P</italic> = 0.042, <italic>r</italic> = 0.471 and <italic>P</italic> = 0.019, <italic>r</italic> = 0.532, respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1<italic>D</italic></xref>).</p>
              <p>The difference between the number of proviruses with near full-sized genomes and intact sequences can be explained by a combination of hypermutation, small insertions and deletions (indels), and defects in the packaging site and/or major splice donor. The relative contribution of each of these differed significantly between individuals but was similar at the two time points for each participant. For example, packaging site and major splice site defects were dominant in participant 9252, but these defects were not found in participant 9241 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1813512115/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Table S2</ext-link>). Overall, hypermutation accounted for ∼55% of all defective near full-sized genomes, but this too varied between individuals. After hypermutation, the next most frequent source of defective proviruses was packaging site and/or major splice donor mutation or deletion at an overall rate of ∼27%, with the remainder accounted for by indel/nonsense mutations (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1813512115/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Table S2</ext-link>).</p>

In contrast, in participant 9255, the percentage of <italic>gag</italic><sup>+</sup> proviruses that contain intact provirus is only two times higher than the percentage of viruses that emerges in the Q<sup>2</sup>VOA (0.26% and 0.13%, respectively) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1813512115/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S2</ext-link>).

              <p>To determine whether rebound sequences could have evolved by accumulating mutations during ATI, we used a mathematical model to simulate this process (<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). We found that only 12 out of 246 rebound sequences (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1813512115/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S7</ext-link>, blue bars) could be accounted for by mutation of reservoir sequences (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1813512115/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S7</ext-link>, gray bars). Consistent with a previous report, the observed distance between latent and rebound viruses decreased in 205 out of 246 rebound sequences when the possibility of recombination was included (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1813512115/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S7</ext-link>, yellow bars). Using the 3SEQ recombination algorithm (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mol.ax/software/3seq/" xlink:show="new">mol.ax/software/3seq/</ext-link>), we found that 48% of the rebound viruses could be recombinants between intact NFL and/or Q<sup>2</sup>VOA proviruses. For example, in participants 9249, 9253, 9244, and 9246, the “parent” <italic>env</italic> sequences were either from intact NFL or Q<sup>2</sup>VOA, and in participant 9245, the parent sequences were uniquely from intact NFL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4<italic>C</italic></xref>). In addition, rebound viral sequences also served as parents for recombination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4<italic>C</italic></xref>). There was no discernible pattern to the recombination events. However, among the 12 latent parent sequences, there was only one instance in which the parent virus was part of an expanded clone. Finally, the sensitivity to bNAbs was comparable between recombinants and other rebound viruses. In conclusion, some of the rebound viruses that emerge during ATI appear to be recombinants derived from the circulating latent reservoir characterized by Q<sup>2</sup>VOA or NFL sequencing.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p content-type="flushleft">Long-lived integrated proviruses represent the key barrier to HIV-1 cure (<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Several different assays have been used to try to characterize and measure the latent reservoir, most prominently nucleic acid based and viral outgrowth assays (<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Although these assay have produced a great deal of information on latent proviruses found in circulating CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, the precise relationship between these viruses and those that emerge in HIV-1–infected individuals during ART interruption has not been defined. To add to the dataset that addresses this important question, we have compared 435 intact NFL proviruses obtained from circulating CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells by NFL sequencing to 650 Q<sup>2</sup>VOA and 246 plasma rebound viruses from individuals enrolled in a clinical trial of combination immunotherapy with broadly neutralizing antibodies 3BNC117 and 10-1074 (<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p>
              <p>Overall Q<sup>2</sup>VOA and NFL sequencing yield overlapping and similarly diverse sets of viruses. As might be expected, the overlap between the sequences obtained by the two methods was most significant in individuals with a more clonal and less diverse reservoir. One of the differences between the two methods was that clones obtained from NFL sequencing appeared to be more stable between the two time points. For example, participants 9241, 9254, and 9255 showed significant clonal variation by Q<sup>2</sup>VOA not found by NFL sequencing. These qualitative differences could be due to stochastic activation of latent viruses in vitro and/or to sampling error because the total number of cells sampled in the NFL sequencing was on average 24-fold lower than in Q<sup>2</sup>VOA.</p>
              <p>There were also significant quantitative differences between proviruses enumerated by NFL sequencing and Q<sup>2</sup>VOA. In the individuals assayed, Q<sup>2</sup>VOA underestimates the size of the latent reservoir by an average of 8.5-fold, but there is tremendous variation between individuals ranging from 1.4- to 915-fold. This finding is consistent with previous reports showing that VOA underestimates the size of the latent reservoir, and that there is no clear correlation between the two methods (<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). These quantitative differences could be accounted for if some of the intact proviruses documented by NFL sequencing cannot be reactivated or are simply defective in some way that has not been detected. However, in all instances reported to date, proviruses reconstructed based on intact NFL sequences were productively infectious in vitro (<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). An alternative and nonexclusive explanation for the disparity between the measurements is that the requirements for latent virus reactivation are both cell or stimulus specific such that only a seemingly random fraction of all latent viruses are reactivated by a particular stimulus in vitro (<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p>
              <p>The vast majority of near full-sized genomes we sequenced, 83% were defective due to hypermutation or mutant packaging signals or major splice donors. Defective proviruses can produce protein products that are targeted by cytotoxic T cells (<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>); however, we found little fluctuation in the number of these proviruses or the types of defects they carry between two time points.</p>
              <p>Three recent clinical studies that included ATI after bNAb infusion evaluated the relationship between circulating latent viruses documented by VOA and rebound viruses (<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). A total of 1,411 VOA and 682 rebound viruses were characterized from 30 individuals undergoing ATI. A small number of intact NFL sequences were also obtained by Cohen et al. (<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). In all, there were only 13 instances of overlap between latent and rebound viruses and this occurred in only 4 of the 30 individuals. Although there are antibody-dependent selective changes in the rebound viruses, viral sensitivity to the bNAb and time to rebound did not influence the results (<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). In addition, Cohen et al. found that the differences between the latent and rebound viruses could not be accounted for by HIV-1 mutation, but instead, it appeared that rebound viruses were frequently composed of recombinants between viruses emerging in Q<sup>2</sup>VOA (<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).</p>
              <p>Our results comparing 435 <italic>env</italic> sequences from intact proviruses with 246 plasma-derived rebound <italic>envs</italic> add to this growing body of data. Although proviruses found in circulation can contribute to rebound (<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), we did not observe direct overlap between intact NFL and rebound sequences. Instead, 48% of all rebound <italic>env</italic> sequences in 10 individuals could be accounted for in part by recombination when both intact NFL and Q<sup>2</sup>VOA sequences are taken into account. This is likely to be an underestimate since we are only considering recombination within <italic>env</italic>. Thus, intact proviral NFL sequences found in the circulating reservoir may be able to contribute to rebound by recombination. Whether similar effects will also be seen in individuals undergoing ATI in the absence of bNAb therapy remains to be determined.</p>
              <p>Recombination is a frequent occurrence during active infection (<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). We are unable to determine directly whether the recombinant viruses observed during ATI preexist in the reservoir or emerge during rebound. If they do preexist then they must be very rare in circulation (&lt;1%) and may be resident in tissues such as the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Cells carrying these proviruses could be activated to produce them by stimuli that are either unavailable to, or simply fail to activate cells in the blood. For example, tissue resident CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the gut are exposed to far higher concentrations of bacterial products than cells in circulation. However, VOAs and/or NFL sequencing have not been performed on tissues from individuals undergoing ATI and so this possibility remains speculative.</p>
              <p>The alternative equally speculative idea is that latent proviruses are generally unable to propagate robust infection in vivo, and that establishment of proviral latency is facilitated by lower overall viral fitness. According to this hypothesis, recombination during rebound would facilitate selection of HIV-1 variants capable of producing robust viremia in vivo. The availability of large numbers of latent and rebound HIV-1 viruses should enable the testing of this idea.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, Q<sup>2</sup>VOA and NFL sequencing assays provide complementary sets of information on HIV-1 proviruses in the latent reservoir. However, the significance of this information in assessing therapies aimed at HIV-1 cure is unclear and requires further investigation (<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). The results emphasize the importance of ATI in evaluating therapies aimed at long-term remission or cure of HIV-1 infection.</p>

                <p>Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained by leukapheresis at the preinfusion and week 12. DNA was extracted from 1 to 10 × 10<sup>6</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells using Qiagen Gentra Purgene Cell Kit. Near full-length HIV-1 genome was generated as previously described (<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).

Seminested <italic>gag</italic> PCR conditions were 94 °C for 2 min; 50 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 61 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 3 min; and 68 °C for 10 min. PCR products were visualized and quantified using 1% agarose gels. DNA dilutions wherein &lt;30% of the <italic>gag</italic> PCR wells were positive, were selected for further analysis because they have more than an 80% probability of containing a single copy of HIV DNA in each PCR based on the Poisson distribution. NFL outer PCR was performed on DNA diluted to single genome levels using Platinum Taq High Fidelity polymerase, and 1-μL aliquots were subjected to nested <italic>env</italic> PCR using envB5out 5′-TAGAGCCCTGGAAGCATCCAGGAAG-3′ and envB3out 5′-TTGCTACTTGTGATTGCTCCATGT-3′ (<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). NFL samples containing ∼3,000-bp amplicons were subjected to four-segment PCR (A–D) (<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) and then visualized on 0.7% agarose gels. If the size of either segment A + C, A + D, B + C, or B + D was correct, two-segment PCR products were combined and then subjected to library preparation and sequencing (<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Paired-end reads were adapter trimmed and filtered for quality with a Phred score cutoff of 10, using trimgalore v0.4.1 and cutadapt v1.11. De novo assembly of the reads into scaffolds was performed using SPAdes genome assembler v3.9.0. Scaffolds were then used to find the closest HIV reference by BLAST, either against a local database of HIV <italic>env</italic> annotations in the case of <italic>env</italic> assembly, or the National Center for Biotechnology Information database in the case of full genome assembly. The closest reference and the scaffolds are then assembled using Mira v4.0.2 to generate an edited reference that more closely reflects the actual sampled sequence. Finally, this edited reference is used as a backbone to assemble the reads.</p>
