                  <title>BACKGROUND</title>
                  <p>While most children who contract COVID-19 experience mild disease, high-risk children with underlying conditions may develop severe disease, requiring interventions. Kinetics of antibodies transferred via COVID-19 convalescent plasma early in disease have not been characterized.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>METHODS</title>
                  <p>In this study, high-risk children were prospectively enrolled to receive high-titer COVID-19 convalescent plasma (&gt;1:320 anti-spike IgG; Euroimmun). Passive transfer of antibodies and endogenous antibody production were serially evaluated for up to 2 months after transfusion. Commercial and research ELISA assays, virus neutralization assays, high-throughput phage-display assay utilizing a coronavirus epitope library, and pharmacokinetic analyses were performed.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>RESULTS</title>
                  <p>Fourteen high-risk children (median age, 7.5 years) received high-titer COVID-19 convalescent plasma, 9 children within 5 days (range, 2â€“7 days) of symptom onset and 5 children within 4 days (range, 3â€“5 days) after exposure to SARS-CoV-2. There were no serious adverse events related to transfusion. Antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were transferred from the donor to the recipient, but antibody titers declined by 14â€“21 days, with a 15.1-day half-life for spike protein IgG. Donor plasma had significant neutralization capacity, which was transferred to the recipient. However, as early as 30 minutes after transfusion, recipient plasma neutralization titers were 6.2% (range, 5.9%â€“6.7%) of donor titers.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>CONCLUSION</title>
                  <p>Convalescent plasma transfused to high-risk children appears to be safe, with expected antibody kinetics, regardless of weight or age. However, current use of convalescent plasma in high-risk children achieves neutralizing capacity, which may protect against severe disease but is unlikely to provide lasting protection.</p>

              <p>Passive transfer of immunity (e.g., antibody therapy) has been used to prevent and treat infectious diseases (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Immunoglobulins are routinely used in clinical practice to prevent infections, such as rabies, hepatitis B, chickenpox, and respiratory syncytial virus, in exposed, susceptible children (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Similarly, passive transfer of maternal antibodies renders protection against several pathogens in infants (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is usually mild in children. Some children, however, may have higher risk of disease progression due to underlying conditions (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>â€“<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). The role of antibody-based therapeutics for COVID-19 is being investigated, and data suggest that early administration of either high-titer convalescent plasma or neutralizing monoclonal antibodies may be useful (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>â€“<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Randomized controlled trials to evaluate COVID-19 convalescent plasma for prophylaxis and early treatment in adults are currently underway (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Studies evaluating antibody kinetics of convalescent plasma have been conducted in infected individuals who developed endogenous antiâ€“SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). However, antibody kinetics in SARS-CoV-2â€“exposed individuals or those early in disease and without endogenous antibody production, where antibody therapies are most useful (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), have not been well characterized. Additionally, characteristics such as safety and antibody pharmacokinetics may also differ in children.</p>
              <p>This study (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04377672), conducted at Johns Hopkins Childrenâ€™s Center (between May 2020 and April 2021; see Methods, <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, and <xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 1</xref>; supplemental material available online with this article; <ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.151518DS1" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.151518DS1</ext-link>), was performed under a US FDA exploratory investigational new drug application. High-risk children exposed to or infected with SARS-CoV-2 were enrolled prospectively and received pretitered COVID-19 convalescent plasma. Passive transfer of antibodies and endogenous antibody production were evaluated in study participants serially for up to 2 months after plasma administration. Several antibody tests, including 2 commercial assays, research ELISAs, viral neutralization assays, a high-throughput phage-display assay utilizing a coronavirus epitope library, and pharmacokinetic analyses, were performed.</p>

              <title>Results</title>
              <p>Fourteen high-risk children (8 female and 6 male children; median age, 7.5 years; range, 3 months to 17 years) were prospectively enrolled and received high-titer COVID-19 convalescent plasma (&gt;1:320 anti-spike [anti-S] IgG by Euroimmun assay corresponding to &gt;1:1620 anti-S IgG using a research ELISA) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> and <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Detailed clinical and laboratory data for all participants are outlined in <xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Tables 1â€“4</xref>. Nine children received early treatment within 5 days (range, 2â€“7 days) of symptom onset and 5 received prophylaxis within 4 days (range, 3â€“5 days) after exposure to SARS-CoV-2. There were no serious adverse events (AEs) related to plasma administration. Three participants developed a rash that resolved rapidly and with no sequelae. One participant was excluded after receiving plasma, due to a false-positive SARS-CoV-2 test. Passive transfer of antibodies and endogenous antibody production were evaluated in all recipients for up to 2 months after plasma administration.</p>
              <p>SARS-CoV-2 anti-nucleocapsid and anti-S antibodies were undetectable in all recipients before plasma administration (as measured by the Bio-Rad and Euroimmun commercial ELISA assays, respectively), except for recipient 13 (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). The donor geometric mean and range for antiâ€“receptor binding domain (anti-RBD) and anti-S titers were 1:2478 (1:180 to 1:14,580) and 1:6271 (1:1,620 to 1:393,660), respectively (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2, B and C</xref>). Recipient titers 30 minutes after plasma transfusion (available for 9 participants, participants 5â€“13) were on average 5.6% (range, 1.2%â€“7.5%) of donor titers. Recipient antibody titers declined by 14â€“21 days (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2, B and C</xref>), although 7 SARS-CoV-2â€“infected participants demonstrated an increase due to endogenous antibody production (participants 1, 4, 6, 7, and 11â€“13). Three children who developed severe pneumonia requiring positive pressure ventilation (participants 6, 7, and 11) had the highest endogenous antibody titers (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2, B and C</xref>). While serology using commercial assays (Euroimmun and Bio-Rad) yielded positive results for all the donors, they were positive in only 5 recipients (recipients 6, 7, and 11â€“13) who also had the highest endogenous antibody titers (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 2</xref>).</p>
              <p>Pharmacokinetic analysis was performed in participants without endogenous antibody production within the first 14 days after transfusion (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 7; <xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 3</xref>). The mean half-lives were estimated to be 15.1 and 15.4 days for anti-S and anti-RBD IgG, respectively, and were consistent with the expected half-life for IgG (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). The clearance and half-life were independent of body weight or age.</p>
              <p>All donor plasma (but that from one donor) had neutralization capacity, as measured by the microneutralization assay, with a geometric mean titer of 1:97 (range 1:40 to 1:640; <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). However, recipient plasma (even as early as 30 minutes after transfusion) had undetectable neutralization capacity using this assay, unless endogenous antibody responses developed (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Results of a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT<sub>50</sub>) were available for 5 recipients (recipients 9â€“13) and 4 donors (donors 9 and 11â€“13). Recipient neutralization titers 30 minutes after plasma transfusion were on average 6.2% of donor titer (range, 5.9%â€“6.7%) and declined to 4.5% (range, 2.1%â€“5.8%) by 7 days after transfusion or otherwise increased due to endogenous immune response (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>).</p>
              <p>Pan-coronavirus cross-reactive epitopes, particularly at the conserved regions of the S protein, are associated with antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Morgenlander et al. defined a set of immunodominant epitopes shared by SARS-CoV-2 as well as endemic coronaviruses and associated them with antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Therefore, to better characterize donor versus endogenously produced antibodies, plasma from 4 recipients (recipients 1â€“4) was subjected to a high-throughput analysis using a phage-display epitope library, spanning across the SARS-CoV-2 genome as well as the 4 endemic human coronaviruses, SARS, and MERS. Plasma obtained from the recipients before and at 7, 14, and 21â€“28 days and 2 months after transfusion were assayed. A distinct set of antibodies in the donor plasma could be identified in all recipients, with antibody kinetics similar to those of anti-S and anti-RBD IgG (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). We also compared the antibody spectrum between adult donors and convalescent response in pediatric recipients who developed endogenous antibody responses. The endogenous antibody responses (in those participants who developed them) represented a distinct set of antibodies, different from those transferred from the donor plasma (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). Moreover, antibody reactivities of convalescent plasma among adult donors were more diverse and had higher antibody titers, compared with the convalescent response in pediatric recipients, 2 months after transfusion (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Multiple cross-reactive antibodies directed at immunodominant epitopes were transferred from donors to recipients, expanding their antibody repertoire (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>).</p>
              <p>Finally, all febrile recipients (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 7) became afebrile within 3 days of convalescent plasma transfusion or earlier (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Table 2</xref>). Four recipients required intensive care and 3 required noninvasive positive pressure ventilation for up to a week (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Tables 1 and 4</xref>). These recipients also received remdesivir and dexamethasone. In symptomatic recipients for whom data were available, the initial high viral load decreased substantially when measured at day 7 (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 4</xref>). One asymptomatic, negative recipient reported new fever and cough 2 weeks following exposure (recipient 4). This recipient became PCR positive on day 12 and remained positive on day 21 (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 4</xref>).</p>

            <sec sec-type="discussion">
              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Currently, only a limited number of case reports and case series have been published on the use of COVID-19 convalescent plasma in children (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>â€“<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), and a detailed pharmacokinetic analysis is lacking. In this prospective study, high-titer convalescent plasma appears to be safe when given to high-risk children. Recipient titers 30 minutes after plasma transfusion were about 20-fold lower than donor titers, most likely due to a dilution effect. Despite donor plasma having significant neutralization capacity, only 5%â€“6% of the donor neutralization titer could be detected in plasma from recipients, even as early as 30 minutes after transfusion.</p>
              <p>All participants received a dose of 5 mL/kg COVID-19 convalescent plasma. This dose was informed by previous experience using convalescent plasma for other infections (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), by volume limitations particularly due to inclusion of children with congestive heart disease, and by dosing in adult studies evaluating convalescent plasma, where a similar or lower dose is being utilized (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Additionally, 1 unit of convalescent plasma (i.e., equivalent to ~3.5 mL/kg) was utilized in a study where high-titer convalescent plasma that was administered early to high-risk older adults decreased subsequent severe respiratory disease (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). This was correlated with an increase in anti-S IgG in recipients, but neutralizing capacity was not measured. Models predicting the relationship between in vitro neutralization levels and observed protection (based on vaccine trials and convalescent cohorts), estimated the neutralization level required for protection against severe disease to be 3% of the mean convalescent level (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Based on our data, when measured 30 minutes after administration, the recipient will have about 5%â€“6% of the neutralization capacity of the corresponding donor, which may therefore protect against severe disease. However, this titer is expected to decline and may not provide lasting protection.</p>
              <p>While clinical data was collected, this study was not designed to evaluate the clinical efficacy of convalescent plasma. Children who were febrile, became afebrile within 72 hours following administration of convalescent plasma. Five children were hospitalized; 3 developed severe pneumonia before administration of convalescent plasma and ultimately required noninvasive positive pressure ventilation. All of them survived to hospital discharge.</p>
              <p>Antibody reactivities of convalescent plasma among adult donors were more diverse, with higher antibody titers, compared with the convalescent response in pediatric recipients, 2 months after transfusion. This is consistent with previous reports demonstrating a lower antibody response in children with COVID-19 (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Still, children with a more severe COVID-19 course did develop a more robust endogenous antibody response.</p>
              <p>Our study has some limitations. First, the sample size of this cohort is small, although we did obtain clinical samples prospectively at several time points for a detailed pharmacokinetic analysis that can be performed adequately, even with a small number of participants (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Second, some participants in this study were immunocompromised, which could have altered their endogenous antibody responses. Third, single donor plasma was utilized rather than hyperimmune globulin (i.e., pooled high-titer plasma) due to practical issues of producing the product in the settings of a rapid response to a pandemic. Finally, the pharmacokinetic analysis for participants 3, 9, and 10 was limited by the fact they received intravenous immunoglobulins as part of their routine care. Saturation of immunoglobulins with supraphysiological concentrations may lead to accelerated excretion. Indeed, pharmacokinetic analysis showed that transferred IgGs had a shorter half-life in these participants.</p>
              <p>To conclude, in this prospective study, administration of high-titer convalescent plasma to high-risk children appears to be safe, with transfer of multiple coronavirus antigen-specific antibodies from the donor to the recipient. Donor plasma had significant neutralization capacity; however, this resulted in only 5%â€“6% of donor neutralization titer as early as 30 minutes after transfusion and declined thereafter. Achieving higher neutralization titer in recipients will require the use of plasma with much higher neutralizing titers, such as that obtained from individuals who had COVID-19 and were subsequently vaccinated (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). While further research is needed to validate these results in a larger cohort, these data suggest that current use of convalescent plasma in high-risk children may only achieve low titers of neutralizing antibody.</p>

                <p>The purpose of the study was to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of high-titer COVID-19 convalescent plasma in children (age, 1 month to 18 years) who were defined to be at high-risk for disease progression (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 1</xref>). Briefly, this was based on the American Academy of Pediatrics definition of immunocompromised children and reported high-risk pediatric subpopulations: immunocompromised, hemodynamically significant cardiac disease (e.g., congenital heart disease), lung disease with chronic respiratory failure, and infants, i.e., children at or less than 1 year old (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>â€“<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). High-risk children exposed to or infected with SARS-CoV-2 were enrolled to receive convalescent plasma (pretitered &gt;1:320 Euroimmun assay at 5 mL/kg) within 5 days of exposure or 8 days of symptom onset. Exclusion criteria included history of severe allergic reaction to transfusion of blood products and pregnancy. One participant was excluded after receiving the plasma, due to a false-positive SARS-CoV-2 test.</p>
                <p>The primary endpoint was safety, defined as the combined cumulative incidence of grade 3 and 4 AEs and serious AEs during the study period. Secondary objectives included the characterization of SARS-CoV-2 antibody pharmacokinetics after plasma administration and evaluation of effects on the natural immunological response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. A total of 38 blood samples and 26 nasopharyngeal swabs were collected and analyzed. Whole blood was collected in acid citrateâ€“dextrose tubes. All samples were deidentified before laboratory testing. The samples were separated into plasma within 12 hours of collection. The plasma samples were immediately frozen at â€“80Â°C.</p>
                <p>Individuals at or over 18 years of age with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 by detectable RNA on a nasopharyngeal swab were eligible to donate plasma (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>).</p>

Briefly, 96-well plates (Immulon 4HBX, Thermo Fisher Scientific) were coated with either full-length S protein or S-RBD at a volume of 50 Î¼L of 2 Î¼g/mL diluted antigen in filtered, sterile 1Ã— PBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 4Â°C overnight. For serial dilutions of plasma on either S- or S-RBDâ€“coated plates, plasma samples were prepared in 3-fold serial dilutions, starting at 1:20. All assays were performed in duplicate. The following anti-human secondary antibody was used: Fc-specific total IgG HRP (1:5000 dilution, catalog A18823, Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The OD of each plate was read at 490 nm (OD490) on a SpectraMax i3 ELISA Plate Reader (BioTek Instruments). The positive cutoff value for each plate was calculated by summing the average of the negative values and three times the SD of the negative values. All values at or above the cutoff value were considered positive.</p>

                <p>Plasma neutralizing antibody titers were quantified against 100 fifty percent tissue culture infectious doses (TCID<sub>50</sub>) using a microneutralization assay in VeroE6-TMPRSS2 cells, which has been previously described (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Briefly, plasma was diluted 1:20 and subsequently 2-fold dilutions were used. Infectious SARS-CoV-2 virus was added to the plasma dilutions at a final concentration of 1 Ã— 10<sup>4</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>/mL. After 1-hour incubation at room temperature, 100 Î¼L of each sample dilution was added to 6 wells in a 96-well plate of VeroE6-TMPRSS2 cells and incubated for 6 hours at 37Â°C. The inocula were removed from the plate, fresh media were added, and the plate was incubated at 37Â°C for 48 hours. The cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde (in each well), incubated for 4 hours at room temperature, and stained with Napthol Blue Black (Sigma-Aldrich). We calculated a neutralizing antibody titer AUC value for each sample using the exact number of wells protected from infection at every dilution. Samples with no neutralizing activity were assigned a value of one-half the lowest measured AUC.</p>

                <p>Vero E6-TMPRSS2 cells were seeded in 6-well plates and allowed to reach 95%â€“100% confluence. Plasma samples were initially diluted 1:10 and further diluted in 2-folds until 1:1280, with enough volume for duplicates. Equal volumes of virus solution containing 100 PFU of infectious SARS-CoV-2 virus (hCoV-19/USA/WA1/2020) and plasma dilution were mixed and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. 250 Î¼L of each virus-plasma mixture was added to a seeded well in duplicate and incubated at 37Â°C for 1 hour, with occasional rocking of the plate to distribute the inoculum evenly. Virus-plasma mixtures were aspirated, and 2 mL of virus overlay media (a mixture of equal parts of 2% methylcellulose in water and 2Ã— MEM containing 10% FBS, 2% Pen/Strep, and 1% L-glutamine) was overlaid on each infected well and incubated for 48 hours at 37Â°C. The overlay was removed after adding 2 mL/well PBS and cells were fixed with 2 mL/well 4% formaldehyde for at least 12 hours at room temperature. Wells were stained using Napthol Blue Black for at least 6 hours, and plaques were counted to determine PFU and PRNT<sub>50</sub>. IC<sub>50</sub> values were calculated using the inhibition dose-response, nonlinear regression model in GraphPad Prism 9 software.</p>

Briefly, 0.2 Î¼L plasma was individually mixed with the coronavirus phage library and immunoprecipitated using protein Aâ€“ and protein Gâ€“coated magnetic beads. A set of 6â€“8 mock immunoprecipitations (no plasma input) were run on each 96-well plate. Bead washing was implemented on a Bravo liquid handling robot. Magnetic beads were resuspended in PCR master mix and subjected to thermocycling. A second PCR reaction was used for sample barcoding. Amplicons were pooled and sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500 instrument. The number of times a clone was detected in each immunoprecipitate was counted and then compared against a negative control without serum (mock immunoprecipitations) using edge-R (R software) and a negative binomial model. Plasma-reactive peptides required at least 100 counts and a 5-fold change from control. Analysis of recipient antibody subsets was performed for antibodies with high fold change at 2 months after plasma transfusion (endogenous antibodies) and for antibodies that were high in the donors and low in the recipients before and 2 months after plasma transfusion (transferred antibodies). Only antibodies unique to each group are shown.</p>

                <p>(<bold>A</bold>) Commercial ELISA assays were used to measure SARS-CoV-2 anti-nucleocapsid protein IgG/IgM/IgA (Bio-Rad) and anti-spike IgG (Euroimmun) titers of donor and recipient plasma prior to plasma administration (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 13 pairs of donors and recipients). S/C, signal-to-cutoff ratio. (<bold>B</bold> and <bold>C</bold>) Indirect ELISAs were used to measure IgG antibody levels against spike or spike receptor binding domain (RBD) in 3-fold serial dilution starting at 1:20. Results are presented as AUC values on a logarithmic scale (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 12 donors and <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 13 recipients for all time points other than 30 minutes, for which <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 9). (<bold>D</bold>) Microneutralization assay was performed on each plasma sample in 2-fold serial dilutions starting at 1:20. Results are presented as AUC values on a logarithmic scale (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 12 donors and <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 13 recipients for all time points other than 30 minutes, for which <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 9). (<bold>E</bold>) Plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT<sub>50</sub>) was performed on plasma from 5 recipients (recipients 9â€“13) and 4 donors (donors 9 and 11â€“13) in 2-fold serial dilutions starting at 1:10. Results are presented as AUC values on a logarithmic scale. A 2-tailed Mann-Whitney <italic toggle="yes">U</italic> test was used to compare donor to recipient titers and recipient titers before and 30 minutes after transfusion. The corresponding <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> values are shown.</p>

                <p>Plasma from 4 recipients (R1â€“R4) was subjected to VirScan, a phage-display library of epitopes from various coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. Fold change (FC) was measured for antibody subsets in recipient plasma (each line represents a single antibody subset): donor antibodies (red) and endogenous antibodies (blue). Note that participants R1, R2, and R4, who developed SARS-CoV-2 infection, demonstrate endogenous antibody production. However, participant R3, who remained asymptomatic and SARS-CoV-2 PCR negative throughout the study period, did not develop an endogenous response.</p>
