              <abstract>
                <p>While <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> infections are frequently
asymptomatic, mechanisms that regulate host response to this intracellular
Gram-negative bacterium remain undefined. This investigation thus used
peripheral blood mononuclear cells and endometrial tissue from women with or
without <italic>Chlamydia</italic> genital tract infection to better define this
response. Initial genome-wide microarray analysis revealed highly elevated
expression of matrix metalloproteinase 10 and other molecules characteristic of
Type 2 immunity (e.g., fibrosis and wound repair) in
<italic>Chlamydia</italic>-infected tissue. This result was corroborated in flow
cytometry and immunohistochemistry studies that showed extant upper genital
tract <italic>Chlamydia</italic> infection was associated with increased
co-expression of CD200 receptor and CD206 (markers of alternative macrophage
activation) by endometrial macrophages as well as increased expression of GATA-3
(the transcription factor regulating T<sub>H</sub>2 differentiation) by
endometrial CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Also among women with genital tract
<italic>Chlamydia</italic> infection, peripheral CD3<sup>+</sup>
CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD3<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>-</sup> cells that
proliferated in response to <italic>ex vivo</italic> stimulation with
inactivated chlamydial antigen secreted significantly more interleukin (IL)-4
than tumor necrosis factor, interferon-γ, or IL-17; findings that repeated
in T cells isolated from these same women 1 and 4 months after infection had
been eradicated. Our results thus newly reveal that genital infection by an
obligate intracellular bacterium induces polarization towards Type 2 immunity,
including <italic>Chlamydia</italic>-specific T<sub>H</sub>2 development. Based
on these findings, we now speculate that Type 2 immunity was selected by
evolution as the host response to <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> in the human
female genital tract to control infection and minimize immunopathological damage
to vital reproductive structures.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p><italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> is an obligate intracellular Gram-negative
bacterium that infects human ocular and genital epithelium. Ocular <italic>C.
trachomatis</italic> infection causes trachoma, an important cause of
preventable blindness whose earlier stages are often asymptomatic <xref rid="pone.0058565-Hu1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Typically,
<italic>C. trachomatis</italic> genital tract infection is also asymptomatic, a
feature enhancing its sexual transmission <xref rid="pone.0058565-Geisler1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. When untreated, female genital
tract <italic>Chlamydia</italic> infection may cause Fallopian tube damage that
increases the risk of ectopic pregnancy and infertility <xref rid="pone.0058565-Peipert1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. More often, however, even
long-standing infection is cleared in the absence of overt genital tract damage,
while advancing age is associated with increased resistance to infection <xref rid="pone.0058565-Molano1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0058565-Brunham1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Such
observations imply the formation of <italic>Chlamydia</italic>-specific protective
immunity and the possibility of developing a prophylactic vaccine (provided better
understanding of human host response to natural <italic>C. trachomatis</italic>
genital tract infection is achieved).</p>
              <p>In cogitation of a clinical picture signaling that <italic>C. trachomatis</italic>
infection does not elicit the robust inflammation that drives differentiation of
T<sub>H</sub>1 and T<sub>H</sub>17 immunity, our lab posited that Type 2
immunity (including T<sub>H</sub>2-type responses) represents the primary defense
against <italic>Chlamydia</italic> in the human female genital tract <xref rid="pone.0058565-VicettiMiguel1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. This
hypothesis opposed current dogma, developed in murine models of genital
<italic>Chlamydia muridarum</italic> infection, which maintains that response to
<italic>C. trachomatis</italic> in the human genital tract is similarly
dominated by Type 1 immunity <xref rid="pone.0058565-Darville1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Providing context for the formation and validity of our
alternative hypothesis, Type 2 immunity is induced by numerous microbes that
establish chronic infection, creating tissue environments that dampen inflammation
and promote wound healing <xref rid="pone.0058565-Allen1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Playing a pivotal role in this response are
IL-4-secreting T<sub>H</sub>2 cells that stimulate macrophages to promote tissue
repair (i.e., alternative macrophage activation) <xref rid="pone.0058565-Anthony1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Although Type 2 immunity is
established as an important defense against extracellular parasites, its role
against intracellular parasites is not well explored. Offering preliminary, albeit
indirect evidence for the formation of <italic>Chlamydia</italic>-specific Type 2
immunity, our lab detected only short-lived T<sub>H</sub>1 and negligible
T<sub>H</sub>17 <italic>Chlamydia</italic>-specific immunity among women with
documented history of <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> infection <xref rid="pone.0058565-VicettiMiguel2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Because
of these unremarkable <italic>Chlamydia</italic>-specific T<sub>H</sub>1 and
T<sub>H</sub>17 responses, in the current study, peripheral blood mononuclear
cells (PBMC) and endometrial tissue from women with or without genital <italic>C.
trachomatis</italic> infection were used to determine if this intracellular
bacterium is instead a more potent inducer of T<sub>H</sub>2 immunity. As posited,
<italic>C. trachomatis</italic> infection of genital tissue stimulated robust
Type 2 immunity, including T<sub>H</sub>2 differentiation, alternative macrophage
activation, and increased expression of IL-24 and other molecules enhancing tissue
repair. Of equal importance, we observed that secretion of IL-4, and not IFN-γ
or IL-17, was the principal effector function of peripheral T cells responding to
<italic>ex vivo</italic> stimulation with chlamydial antigen. Taken together,
these results newly uncover exuberant Type 2 immunity elicited upon <italic>C.
trachomatis</italic> infection of the human female genital tract.</p>

and <italic>Chlamydia</italic>-infected endometrial tissue were performed. Initial
analysis of this data showed that <italic>Chlamydia</italic> infection caused
significant enrichment of canonical pathways associated with Type 2 immunity <xref rid="pone.0058565-Graham1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, including
pathways involved in fibrosis and wound repair (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0058565-t001">Table 1</xref>). Moreover, 3 of the 4 genes most highly
upregulated in <italic>Chlamydia</italic>-infected tissue, matrix metalloproteinase
10 (MMP10) (15-fold increase), IL-13α<sub>2</sub> receptor
(IL-13Rα<sub>2</sub>) (13-fold increase), and IL-24 (11-fold increase),
regulate biological functions that are characteristic of Type 2 immunity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0058565-g001">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0058565-t002">Table 2</xref>). MMP-10, a
metalloproteinase produced by T cells in response to IL-4, stimulates wound healing
<xref rid="pone.0058565-Conca1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0058565-VanThemsche1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>; while
interactions between IL-13 to IL-13Rα2, also regulated by IL-4, promotes tissue
repair by increasing production of transforming growth factor-β1 <xref rid="pone.0058565-FichtnerFeigl1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0058565-FichtnerFeigl2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.
Likewise, IL-24 secretion by monocytes and T<sub>H</sub>2 cells increases the
activity of signaling pathways responsible for wound healing <xref rid="pone.0058565-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>-<xref rid="pone.0058565-Soo1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Endometrial
<italic>Chlamydia</italic> infection also induced a 10-fold increase in MUC5AC,
a mucin gene expressed at low levels in normal endometrial tissue but upregulated by
IL-4 <xref rid="pone.0058565-Hebbar1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0058565-Turner1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, and a 9-fold
increase in aquaporin 4, an integral membrane protein highly upregulated among
individuals with asthma <xref rid="pone.0058565-Jardim1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0058565-t002">Table

                  <p>Compared to expression in uninfected controls, endometrial tissue from women
with existing endometrial <italic>Chlamydia</italic> infection displayed
15-fold, 13-fold, and 11-fold increases in the expression of MMP-10, IL-24,
and IL-13Rα2, respectively. These genes, each with biological activity
linked to Type 2 immunity, were 3 of the 4 most dramatically upregulated
genes in <italic>Chlamydia</italic>-infected tissue. Significance of
differences between groups was determined by use of Dunn’s test (see
Methods section for further details regarding statistical considerations).

              <p>As microarray analysis showed <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> promotes exuberant
<italic>in situ</italic> differentiation of Type 2 immunity, we postulated this
pathogen must also elicit T<sub>H</sub>2-type responses. To test this hypothesis,
PBMC isolated from women with no <italic>Chlamydia</italic> infection history or
women with existing (at enrollment) and then treated (at 1- and 4-month follow-up
visits) endocervical or endometrial <italic>Chlamydia</italic> infection were used
in intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) assays that used flow cytometry to
delineate the effector function of T cells responding to stimulation with
inactivated <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> elementary bodies (EB). As predicted,
CD3<sup>+</sup> cells in these assays from women with existing or treated
<italic>Chlamydia</italic> infection proliferated in response to stimulation
with inactivated EB (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0058565.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Interestingly, proliferation was more robust at the 1-month
follow-up visit than at the enrollment or 4-month follow-up visits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0058565-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Calculating the
adjusted percentages of cytokines produced by peripheral CD3<sup>+</sup>
CD4<sup>+</sup> or CD3<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>-</sup> cells that
proliferated in response to EB, we saw negligible production of IL-17 in samples
from uninfected and <italic>Chlamydia</italic>-infected women at all study visits
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0058565-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Conversely,
there was enhanced intracellular accumulation of IFN-γ and TNF by proliferating
CD3<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD3<sup>+</sup>
CD4<sup>-</sup> cells from <italic>Chlamydia</italic>-infected women, but only
in specimens collected at the 1-month follow-up visit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0058565-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Interestingly, these results were
congruent with our recently published cross-sectional study in which peripheral
blood specimens obtained from <italic>Chlamydia</italic>-infected women 30-60 d
after starting a <italic>Chlamydia</italic>-specific antimicrobial displayed a
higher frequency of CD4<sup>+</sup> cells producing IFN-γ in response to EB
stimulation compared to specimens collected &lt;30 d or &gt; 60 d after starting
therapy <xref rid="pone.0058565-VicettiMiguel2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Even more interesting, in the current investigation we

              <p>Based on the substantial T<sub>H</sub>2 response elicited in EB-stimulated peripheral
T cells, we further posited that CD4<sup>+</sup> cells in
<italic>Chlamydia</italic>-infected tissue are polarized towards a
T<sub>H</sub>2 profile. To test this hypothesis, IHC was used to examine
CD4<sup>+</sup> cell expression of T-bet and GATA-3 (transcription factors
regulating T<sub>H</sub>1 and T<sub>H</sub>2 differentiation, respectively) in
paraffin-embedded endometrial biopsy sections from women without current
<italic>Chlamydia</italic>, <italic>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</italic>, or
<italic>Trichomonas vaginalis</italic> infection and women with extant upper
genital tract <italic>Chlamydia</italic> infection. As predicted by our ICS assay
results, each <italic>Chlamydia</italic>-infected tissue section demonstrated
greater expression of GATA-3 than T-bet (representative results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0058565-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Interestingly,
expression of GATA-3, but not T-bet, was present in uninfected tissue, indicative of
the role this transcription factor plays in estrogen receptor-responsive tissue

higher in <italic>Chlamydia</italic>-infected vs. uninfected tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0058565-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Taken together, these

(A) In uninfected endometrial tissue, we observed scarce numbers of

              <p>Prompted by these results, we returned to our microarray data to examine endometrial
transcription factor expression. Based on the high levels of GATA-3 levels expressed
in uninfected and <italic>Chlamydia</italic>-infected endometria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0058565-g004">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0058565-g005">Figure 5</xref>), it was not surprising that
<italic>Chlamydia</italic> infection induced no significant fold-change in
GATA-3 expression. On the other hand, expression of several macrophage-associated
transcription factors was significantly modulated by <italic>Chlamydia</italic>
infection (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0058565-t003">Tables 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0058565-t004">4</xref>). This included increased
expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG), which
promotes polarization of macrophages to the M2 phenotype <xref rid="pone.0058565-Fujisaka1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. As T<sub>H</sub>2 immunity
stimulates macrophages that promote fibrosis, tissue remodeling, and wound repair
(alternative macrophage activation) <xref rid="pone.0058565-Allen2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0058565-Pulendran1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, we hypothesized that macrophages in
<italic>Chlamydia</italic>-infected endometrial tissue display evidence of
alternative activation. As predicted, flow cytometry studies showed macrophages in
endometria with extant <italic>Chlamydia</italic> infection significantly increased
their expression of the CD200R, a marker of alternative macrophage activation and a
negative regulator of classical macrophage activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0058565-g006">Figure 6</xref>) <xref rid="pone.0058565-Martinez1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Because CD200R binding
triggers macrophages to dampen inflammation and suppress collateral damage to host
tissue during chronic microbial infection <xref rid="pone.0058565-Hoek1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>-<xref rid="pone.0058565-Snelgrove1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, increased expression of
CD200R by macrophages in <italic>Chlamydia</italic>-infected tissue is consistent
with the clinical presentation of an infection that persists in genital tract
epithelial cells without eliciting overt inflammatory changes. Furthermore, we found
that <italic>Chlamydia</italic> infection increased the percentage of endometrial
macrophages co-expressing CD200R and CD206 (mannose receptor), another classic
marker of alternative macrophage activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0058565-g006">Figure 6</xref>) <xref rid="pone.0058565-Stein1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. In addition,
<italic>Chlamydia</italic> infection promoted increased macrophage expression of
CD40, a costimulatory molecule critical for induction of B cell responses in mucosal
tissue <xref rid="pone.0058565-VicettiMiguel3" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. This result correlated with our microarray findings showing
<italic>Chlamydia</italic>-infected endometrial tissue had significant
enrichment of the B cell development pathway (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0058565-t001">Table 1</xref>) and significantly increased expression

              <p>In conclusion, the picture of the host response to <italic>Chlamydia</italic>
infection of the human female genital tract emerging from our lab is a response
skewed towards Type 2 immunity, including differentiation of IL-4-secreting
CD3<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD3<sup>+</sup>
CD4<sup>-</sup> cells and stimulation of alternative macrophage activation.
Clearly, further interrogation of the phenotype and function of these
CD3<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD3<sup>+</sup>
CD4<sup>-</sup> cells is needed, and is an area of active research in our lab.
On the other hand, as <italic>Chlamydia</italic> host defense in humans is still
thought dominated by highly inflammatory Type 1 immunity <xref rid="pone.0058565-Darville1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0058565-Taylor1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, our findings already
communicate that development of a safe and effective <italic>C. trachomatis</italic>
vaccine will require new understanding of immune responses elicited by natural
infection and <italic>Chlamydia</italic>-specific immune responses that protect
against infection and immunopathological tissue damage. Our study was responsive to
the first requisite, offering fresh information about host responses elicited
against this obligate intracellular bacterium in the human female genital tract.
Regarding the second requisite, our recent <xref rid="pone.0058565-VicettiMiguel2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> and current work implies
that Type 2 immunity was evolutionarily selected to control genital <italic>C.
trachomatis</italic> infection and minimize immunopathological damage to vital
reproductive anatomy. Our work also supports prior observation that IL-13 production
by PBMC stimulated with chlamydial antigen correlated with enhanced resistance to
<italic>Chlamydia</italic> genital tract re-infection in women <xref rid="pone.0058565-Cohen1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. However, only
additional work will resolve if <italic>Chlamydia</italic>-specific Type 2 immunity
is sterilizing or if Type 2 immunity plays a role in host defense against other
intracellular bacterial pathogens.</p>

                <p>Nonpregnant women 15–35 years old at high risk for genital tract infection
were eligible for enrollment, while women presenting with symptoms of pelvic
inflammatory disease were not. In a separate study, nonpregnant women

informed consent, at least 40 ml of peripheral venous blood was collected into
sodium heparin-containing blood tubes (Becton-Dickinson). Peripheral blood that
was collected from 7 women (average age  =  24.6 years)
enrolled with no history of <italic>Chlamydia</italic> infection and 14 women
(average age  =  20.8 years) enrolled with existing
<italic>Chlamydia</italic> infection (and also collected 1 and 4 months
after treatment of infection with 0.25 g ceftriaxone IM and 1 g azithromycin)
was used to isolate PBMC by density gradient centrifugation, and these cells

                <p>Endometrial tissue from 10 women with no identified genital infection and 12
women with existing <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> endometrial infection (but
no other identified infection) was dissociated into single-cell suspension or
placed into RNAlater (Qiagen). Samples underwent total RNA purification using
the Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit in accordance with manufacturer’s instructions
and were suspended in nuclease-free water. Inclusion in ensuing <italic>in
vitro</italic> amplification assays required a spectrophotometric 260/280
absorption ratio &gt; 1.8 as determined using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer
(Thermo Scientific). RIN (RNA Integrity Index) values were determined via
electrophoretic analysis (Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100, Agilent Technologies)
(results ranged between 5–8). Amplifications were performed with 100 ng
total RNA using the NuGEN whole transcription approach involving use of the
Ovation FFPE WTA assay (NuGEN) that employed random 3’ primers to
eliminate amplification bias. Confirmation of cDNA diversity for each
amplification reaction was obtained using the Bioanalyzer 2100 to generate an
electrophoretogram regarding sample yield, integrity, and size diversity against
a laboratory human RNA standard and a Universal Human Reference RNA
(Stratagene). 5 µg of purified cDNA was incubated with fragmentation
buffer (NuGEN) for 30 m at 37°C, then 2 m at 95°C. Each cDNA sample
underwent hybridization on Affymetrix GeneChip HG U133A 2.0 arrays that
contained transcripts representing the functionally characterized human genome.
In summary of this process, fragmented cDNA was combined with water in
hybridization cocktails to a final volume of 220 µl, and 130 µl of
this cocktail was hybridized on each array for 18 h at 45°C. Arrays were
washed, stained with streptavidin-phycoerythrin in a GeneChip Fluidics Station
450 (Affymetrix), and scanned using a GeneChip Scanner 3000 (Affymetrix).
Quality control parameters were derived from the MAS 5.0 algorithm of the
Expression Console software (v. 1.2.0.20; Affymetrix), and expression data
derived from raw intensity files generated by this algorithm. Of 22,277 chip
panels (i.e., transcript sequences) gauged, 7,759 panels showed ≥ 2-fold
change in average gene expression between infected and uninfected tissue. Among
such panels, we required the higher expressing group to show detectable
transcript (i.e., a “Present” call) in at least 2/3 of samples
(i.e., 7 of 10 for uninfected controls and 8 of 12 for infected women).
Dunn’s test was then used to determine significance of the differences
between the two groups. Selecting differences between mean ranks greater than
5.45 (α  =  0.05) identified 1329 panels, representing
1087 unique characterized genes which have Gene Symbols listed at the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene</ext-link> website. These 1329 panels were
submitted to the Ingenuity Pathways Analysis website which parsed data into 36
significantly enriched canonical pathways consisting of 509 occurrences of 206
unique, characterized genes. Microarray data was deposited to Gene Expression
Omnibus (GEO) repository under accession number GSE41075, following MIAME
(Minimum Information About a Microarray Experiment) guidelines.</p>
