                  <p id="P4">We implemented a multi-arm, cluster-randomised community effectiveness trial in three rural subcounties across 60 villages (clusters) in western Kenya. Eligible participants were mothers or female primary caregivers aged 15 years or older with children aged 6–24 months at enrolment. If married or in established relationships, fathers or male caregivers aged 18 years or older were also eligible. Villages were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to one of three groups: group-only delivery with 16 fortnightly sessions; mixed delivery combining 12 group sessions with four home visits; and a comparison group. Villages in the intervention groups were randomly assigned (1:1) to invite or not invite fathers and male caregivers to participate. Households were surveyed at baseline and immediately post-intervention. Assessors were masked. Primary outcomes were child cognitive and language development (score on the Bayley Scales of Infant Development third edition), socioemotional development (score on the Wolke scale), and parental stimulation (Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment inventory). Analysis was by intention to treat.

                  <p id="P5">Between Oct 1 and Nov 12, 2018, 1152 mother–child dyads were enrolled and randomly assigned (n=376 group-only intervention, n=400 mixed-delivery intervention, n=376 comparison group). At the 11-month endline survey (Aug 5–Oct 31, 2019), 1070 households were assessed for the primary outcomes (n=346 group only, n=373 mixed delivery, n=351 comparison). Children in group-only villages had higher cognitive (effect size 0·52 SD [95% CI 0·21–0·83]), receptive language (0·42 SD [0·08–0·77]), and socioemotional scores (0·23 SD [0·03–0·44]) than children in comparison villages at endline. Children in mixed-delivery villages had higher cognitive (0·34 SD [0·05–0·62]) and socioemotional scores (0·22 SD [0·05–0·38]) than children in comparison villages; there was no difference in language scores. Parental stimulation also improved for group-only (0·80 SD [0·49–1·11]) and mixed-delivery villages (0·77 SD [0·49–1·05]) compared with the villages in the comparison group. Including fathers in the intervention had no measurable effect on any of the primary outcomes.</p>

              <p id="P7">Approximately 250 million (43%) children younger than 5 years in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) will not reach their full developmental potential due to poverty, nutritional deficiencies, or inadequate psychosocial stimulation.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Early childhood development (ECD) interventions that integrate responsive parenting and early learning with nutrition education have effectively improved short-term child development outcomes in numerous LMIC settings.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Early childhood can be a cost-effective period to address developmental outcomes, because early investments have the potential to improve adult human capital.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Despite increasing evidence for the effectiveness of ECD interventions to improve short-term child developmental outcomes, key questions remain about how to make these programmes scalable,<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> particularly in rural, low-income settings.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p>
              <p id="P8">Two primary methods for delivering ECD interventions are individual home visits and group-based meetings in a primary care or community setting.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Individual home visits can offer personalised feedback, support, and problem solving to overcome personal and family barriers to behaviour change, but can be expensive to implement at scale in LMIC settings.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Group-based models offer potential economies of scale, might modify group norms for child-care, and can provide mothers with increased peer support.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> However, group meetings might be comparatively weak in overcoming personal barriers to behaviour change.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> A mixed-delivery model that combines group sessions with a small number of personalised home visits has been hypothesised to balance the cost savings and peer support of groups with the benefits of personalised attention and feedback from home visits, but the added value of home visits to a purely group-based intervention is unknown.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> ECD programmes have primarily focused on mothers and children, although involving fathers has also been suggested to be beneficial for child and family wellbeing.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup></p>

                <p id="P9">The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of two potentially scalable models of delivery for an integrated parenting intervention to improve child developmental outcomes among families with young children in rural Kenya. Because individual home visits in dispersed rural settings such as those found in Kenya would be prohibitively time-consuming and expensive for scaling, we tested a model based on group meetings versus a mixed-delivery model that combined a small number of home visits with group meetings. We also aimed to assess the added value of explicitly inviting fathers into the intervention across both delivery models.</p>

                <title>Study design and participants</title>
                <p id="P10">In collaboration with a Kenyan non-governmental organisation, Safe Water and AIDS Project (SWAP), we did a multi-arm, cluster-randomised community effectiveness trial in the subcounties of East Rachuonyo, South Rachuonyo, and Sabatia in western Kenya. These predominantly rural areas are characterised by high rates of poverty, child mortality, and stunting (31–34%).<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Sabatia’s population is predominantly from the Luhya tribe and speaks Luhya and Swahili. The populations of South Rachuonyo and East Rachuonyo are predominantly Luo and speak Luo. No other ECD programmes or interventions existed in these areas at the time of the study. The majority of villagers are subsistence farmers or unskilled informal workers.</p>
                <p id="P11">Eligible participants within villages were mothers or other female primary caregivers aged 15 years or older with a child aged 6–24 months without signs of severe mental or physical impairment. If married or in established relationships, fathers or male caregivers aged 18 years or older were also eligible to participate. We identified eligible mother–child dyads using a census run by SWAP immediately before baseline data collection. All participants (female and male caregivers) provided written informed consent at the time of data collection before randomisation. Ethics approval was obtained from the ethics committee at Maseno University in Kisumu, Kenya, and the RAND Corporation. The study protocol has been published elsewhere.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup></p>

                <title>Randomisation and masking</title>
                <p id="P12">Villages comprised clusters and were the unit of randomisation to minimise the risk of contamination within villages, and to align with the territory of community health volunteers.</p>
                <p id="P13">We first listed all villages in the three subcounties estimated to have at least 20 households with eligible children; next, using a computer-generated random number in Stata and stratifying by subcounty, 60 villages were randomly sampled for inclusion as long as they maintained a minimum distance (1·5–2·5 km) from all other sampled villages. A team of trained enumerators did a census within the villages and a baseline survey on the final sample of eligible households. Using a random number generator in Stata, two authors (JEL and ILG) randomly assigned villages in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of three study groups, stratified by subcounty. One group featured a group-only delivery model with fortnightly sessions; the second group featured a mixed-delivery model combining 12 group sessions with four home visits; and the third group served as a comparison group and received no intervention.</p>
                <p id="P14">Among the villages assigned to one of the two intervention groups, half were randomly assigned (1:1) to invite only mothers and children (mothers-only group); the remaining villages also invited fathers to the 16 sessions (father group). The geographical location of the sampled villages and their randomisation status are shown in the <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">appendix</xref> (p 3).</p>
                <p id="P15">Due to the nature of the intervention, masking of participants and community health volunteers who delivered the intervention was not possible. Data collection teams worked independently from the community health volunteers, and all efforts were made to keep them as masked to group status as possible. Data analysis was blinded. Interviews of enumerators at the end of data collection showed that they were unaware of details about the intervention and treatment allocation. For quality assurance, subcounty supervisors randomly supervised 20% of child and mother interviews.</p>

                <title>Procedures</title>
                <p id="P16">Each village had a predesignated community health volunteer who was invited to deliver the programme in intervention villages; none refused. Community health volunteers are part-time volunteers and members of their communities tasked with improving community health and linking individuals to primary health-care services. The research project paid community health volunteers a monthly stipend for their duties, according to local policy.</p>
                <p id="P17">SWAP introduced the project to village leaders, secured local approvals, and managed local implementation. Community health volunteers delivered 16 fortnightly sessions to both intervention groups between mid-November, 2018, and mid-July, 2019. The responsive stimulation and nutrition education intervention was named Msingi Bora (Good Foundation in Swahili). It was based on a structured curriculum adapted from previous successful parenting trials in LMICs and expanded to include more activities around responsive play and talk with children.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Six sessions were piloted in April–June, 2018, in six villages not included in the main trial. The finalised curriculum included session-specific activities and materials, with Luo or Swahili and English manuals for each community health volunteer. The Msingi Bora curriculum focused on five key practices: responsive play, responsive communication, hygiene, nutrition, and love and respect in the family. The sessions emphasised parents learning new practices with their child, spouse, and peers through demonstration and coached practice, group-based problem solving, and peer support. Sessions took place in local community centres or churches. More details of the intervention are in the <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">appendix</xref> (p 1).</p>

                <p id="P19">Mothers and children were invited to attend all 16 sessions, and received a small gift for attendance (eg, small bar of soap [US$0·15]). Every fourth session served as a review session, for which households receiving the group-only intervention continued with group meetings and households receiving the mixed-delivery intervention received individual home visits (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">appendix</xref> p 4). Community health volunteers in mixed-delivery villages visited each participant household during the same week that a group review session was held in group-only villages. During these home visits, the community health volunteers delivered review messages identical to those in the group reviews, but the focus was tailored to that family. In the villages where fathers were invited to participate in the intervention, they were invited to all 16 sessions; 12 of which were for both mothers and fathers, and four of which were separate sessions by sex, including the first two, as a way to try to encourage their participation (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">appendix</xref> p 4). The father-only sessions emphasised topics such as practising respectful communication, father involvement in child-care, and emotional support between spouses. Similar topics were covered in the four corresponding mother–child sessions so that the curriculum was identical across mothers, regardless of the intervention group. Households in villages assigned to the comparison group did not receive any interventions other than information about child feeding during the baseline survey.</p>
                <p id="P20">Community health volunteers in villages assigned to an intervention group received 8 days of intensive training in November, 2018, covering sessions 1–8, and another 8 days in April, 2019, covering sessions 9–16. Monthly 1-day refresher trainings were done in each subcounty for that month’s sessions. The 40 community health volunteers who were trained included ten men and 30 women, with a mean age of 44 years (SD 11·02; range 26–69), 11 years of education (minimum 7 years; SD 1·74), and 9 years of community health volunteer experience (SD 5·98; range 1–24). The initial training was led by FEA, ILG, JEL, HOP, and DRS; all subsequent trainings were led by SWAP staff in a train-the-trainers model.</p>

Community health volunteers were provided with supervisor feedback immediately after each session. Attendance sheets were also completed at each session. Qualitative interviews of community health volunteers (n=11), participant mothers (n=8), fathers (n=3), and SWAP supervisory staff (n=6), selected to cover the districts equally, were done at the end of the intervention and used to assist in the interpretation of quantitative data.</p>

                <p id="P27">Our sample size was calculated on the basis of the primary outcome of child cognitive development assessed with the Bayley score, which has a usual mean of 10 (SD 1·5).<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> We assumed 75% session attendance among households invited to the intervention, 15% attrition, and an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0·07 within villages. In a side-by-side comparison between any two study groups, a sample of 400 children per group was estimated to provide 80% power to detect an increase in Bayley score of 0·30 SD. All analyses clustered SEs at the level of villages, which is the unit of randomisation. Significance was defined as p&lt;0·05.</p>
                <p id="P28">Analyses were done with Bayley scaled scores, as well as Bayley raw scores that were internally age-standardised in 2-month bands relative to the comparison group. This approach was adopted because the official scaled scores show substantial age gradients in our sample, as is common in LMICs.<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> For ease of interpretation, we adopted the same standardisation procedure in all child and parent measures.</p>
                <p id="P29">Analyses of all outcomes were by intention to treat among the final endline sample. Random assignment of villages to each study group allowed us to estimate intention-to-treat effects for all outcomes by doing a series of pairwise comparisons across intervention groups. All reported results include pre-planned adjustments for child sex, birth order, maternal education, household wealth, corresponding baseline outcomes (if available), and subcounty strata to account for sampling design.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Adjustments used multivariate linear regressions for continuous outcomes and logistic regression for stunting, which is binary. To account for imperfect attendance of parents at sessions, we also estimated the average treatment effect on the treated using a two-stage least squares regression approach and the recorded attendance data as our measure of compliance. We corrected for multiple hypothesis testing using the Romano-Wolf estimator.<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup></p>

              <title>Results</title>
              <p id="P32">During August, 2018, 1265 mother–child dyads were identified in the census across the 60 included villages, and 1152 (91%) dyads were successfully enrolled into the study between Oct 1 and Nov 12, 2018. 20 villages with 376 enrolled dyads were randomly assigned to the group-only intervention, 20 villages with 400 enrolled dyads were randomly assigned to the mixed-delivery intervention, and 20 villages with 376 enrolled dyads were randomly assigned to the comparison group (figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Each village had a mean of 19 children enrolled (SD 2·74; range 14–26). The endline survey was done approximately 11 months after enrolment (between Aug 5 and Oct 31, 2019) when children were aged 16–34 months. 1070 (93%) of the enrolled children were followed up and included in the primary analysis (figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). There were no differences in attrition across study groups (30 [8%] in the group-only group, 27 [7%] in the mixed-delivery group, and 25 [7%] in the comparison group; p value of joint F-test 0·76). Households lost to follow-up are similar to retained households in sociodemographic characteristics, but attrition was more likely in the two Luo subcounties (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">appendix</xref> p 6).</p>
              <p id="P33">Child and household characteristics, as well as all child and parental measures, were balanced across the groups at baseline, with the exception that villages inviting fathers had higher rates of fathers being present (table <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Rates of stunting were low at baseline, probably due to the young mean age of children at enrolment (14 months; SD 4·79).</p>
              <p id="P34">Monitoring data on session implementation showed that the intervention was delivered as intended, with 16 fortnightly sessions per intervention village. 496 (89%) of 560 mother group sessions were monitored by a SWAP supervisor, and 122 (9%) of 1411 home visits were supervised. The median number of sessions attended was 13 (IQR 8–15), with a median group size of 13 (10–15) mothers at a group meeting. Attendance was higher for the mixed-delivery intervention (mean attendance of 11·9 [74%] of 16 sessions) than for the group-only intervention (10·3 [64%] of 16 sessions), with the bulk of this difference stemming from higher attendance in the four review sessions, which were home visits for the mixed-delivery group (mean attendance of 3·53 [88%] of 4 home visit review sessions <italic toggle="yes">vs</italic> mean attendance of 2·58 [65%] of 4 group review sessions, p&lt;0·0001). Attendance among fathers was substantially lower overall than among mothers: fathers attended a median of one of 16 sessions (IQR 0–3) and 168 (52%) of 328 fathers ever present in the household attended at least one session. Sessions lasted a median of 90 min (IQR 70–110). Community health volunteers were reviewed by supervisors to be “very good” or “excellent” in how well they coached parents for 325 (67%) of 487 sessions, and in how well they facilitated discussions for 296 (60%) of 496 sessions.</p>
              <p id="P35">Children in group-only villages showed significant improvements in cognitive, receptive language, and socioemotional scores compared with the comparison group (table <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Children in mixed-delivery villages showed smaller but still significant improvements in cognitive and socioemotional scores, but not in receptive language scores. There was no improvement in expressive language in either intervention group.</p>
              <p id="P36">Mothers in both group-only and mixed-delivery villages showed significantly better HOME scores at endline than mothers in the comparison group (table <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). We observed significant improvements in the secondary outcome of child’s dietary diversity in group-only villages compared with the comparison group, but not in mixed-delivery villages. There was no improvement in child stunting status in either intervention group compared with the comparison group (table <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).</p>
              <p id="P37">Improvements were seen in mediator measures of maternal knowledge of child development and maternal recall of intervention messages under both intervention models compared with the comparison group. The intervention did not significantly improve measures of maternal wellbeing under either delivery model (table <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Inviting fathers to the sessions did not have an effect on child and maternal outcomes (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">appendix</xref> p 7).</p>
              <p id="P38">All significant results remained significant after accounting for multiple hypothesis testing at the 5% level or above. Adjusting for covariates did not affect the magnitude or statistical significance of estimated effects, but increased precision. Results were not sensitive to the internal standardisation.</p>
              <p id="P39">Higher levels of compliance with the intervention resulted in greater cognitive gains under both delivery models, with signs of increasing returns by number of sessions attended in analyses of the effect of treatment on the treated (figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). For example, in the group-only intervention group, increasing from attending at least one to at least 12 sessions improved cognition by 0·36 SD (95% CI 0·54–0·90). Similarly positive dose–response relationships were observed for all other outcomes with significant effects in the intention-to-treat analyses (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">appendix</xref> p 8). When we focus on attendance at only the four review sessions that differed between the two intervention groups (mixed-delivery villages had home visits for these sessions), the added benefits for child cognition of attending each additional review session increased steeply for groups, but not for home visits (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">appendix</xref> p 9). For example, children who attended all four group review sessions had cognitive scores 1·26 SD (95% CI 0·48–2·05) higher than children in the comparison group, whereas children who attended all four home visit review sessions had 0·41 SD (0·07–0·74) higher cognitive scores (p=0·044 on the difference between group and home visit reviews). Monitoring data show that supervisors generally rated group review sessions higher than home visits in many aspects of delivery quality (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">appendix</xref> p 10). In qualitative interviews, mothers commented that both they and their children liked interacting with others in their group, benefited from questions and problems raised by other mothers, and learned how to play games and talk with their child by watching others.</p>
              <p id="P40">We found no evidence of differential effects in prespecified subgroup analyses by maternal education, child age, or baseline outcomes (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">appendix</xref> pp 11–12), although there is suggestive evidence of greater effects on primary outcomes for children with less educated mothers. Effects on child outcomes and parental stimulation practices were systematically larger and occasionally statistically significant for girls versus boys (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">appendix</xref> p 12). A mediation analysis using structural equation modelling showed that stimulation, dietary diversity, maternal knowledge, and recall of intervention messages together explain up to 33% of the effects on cognition and 58% of the effects on receptive language in the group-only intervention group (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">appendix</xref> p 13).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="P41">In this cluster-randomised trial, we tested the effectiveness of two potentially scalable group-based delivery models for an early childhood development intervention in rural Kenya. We found that both the group-only and mixed-delivery models significantly improved child cognitive and socioemotional development, as well as maternal stimulation practices. The group-only model also showed significant improvements in child receptive language, although the mixed-delivery model did not. Expressive language was not significantly improved in either intervention group. Effect sizes for the group-only model were generally larger than for the mixed-delivery model, although the difference was statistically significant only for dietary diversity. However, we can nearly reject our initial hypothesis that the mixed-delivery intervention would provide larger benefits than the group-only intervention for cognition (p=0·099) and receptive language (p=0·084) based on one-sided tests derived from the two-sided p values in table <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. We interpret this as suggestive evidence that the group-only model was more effective in our setting.</p>
              <p id="P42">Children who attended more sessions showed greater benefits from both delivery models. Maternal stimulation practices similarly improved with attendance. These positive dose–response relationships have important implications for the optimal design and intensity of ECD programmes. Tests of heterogeneity also suggest that our intervention might have greater benefits for girls than for boys.</p>
              <p id="P43">Effect sizes from this community-based effectiveness trial are similar to or larger than in previous studies using either intensive home visits, group interventions, or a combination thereof,<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> yet are generally smaller than two effectiveness trials from Asia (from 2014 and 2019).<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> However, those two studies featured more intensive interventions over a period of 1–2 years instead of the 8 months of our programme, and differed in other crucial ways as well. For example, the 2-year trial in Pakistan had much more emphasis on home visits, and the 25-session, year-long trial in Bangladesh worked with small groups of two mothers and targeted children who were stunted at baseline (for whom ECD interventions can have particularly large effects).<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> Our results show that an exclusively group-based ECD intervention for all age-eligible children in an LMIC (who are not receiving conditional cash transfer benefits) can have positive effects on cognitive, language, and socioemotional development. Moreover, our delivery format of relatively large groups of women makes our results particularly promising to inform ECD policy on the implementation of scalable and potentially cost-effective programmes in similar contexts.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Our use of existing community health workers to deliver an intervention that improves child development in a rural low-income setting directly addresses the top two questions (whether child development packages focusing on nurturing care and parent support can improve child cognitive development in rural low-income settings and whether community health workers or paraprofessionals can be trained to deliver ECD interventions effectively) generated by a panel of worldwide ECD experts in a recent ranking of priority questions for the field.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p>
              <p id="P44">Our intervention brought about improvements in parental stimulation practices under both delivery models. Maternal knowledge of child development also increased, yet our intervention did not improve measures of maternal wellbeing, contrary to our expectations and programme emphasis on topics related to maternal mental health. Both stimulation and maternal knowledge might have affected how the intervention improved child outcomes. However, our preliminary mediation analysis does not correct for the endogenous nature of parental investments nor potential measurement error in outcomes, which future work will do. If parents continue to practise the newly learned behaviours at home and responsively adapt them as children age, the effects of our intervention might be sustainable. Yet we recognise that this is a central challenge of ECD interventions worldwide, in which immediate effects have dissipated over time.<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup></p>
              <p id="P45">Contrary to our hypotheses, group meetings consistently outperformed a mixed-delivery model in key outcomes such as child cognition and receptive language, although differences were generally not significant with two-sided tests. Nonetheless, this is important for considerations of cost-effectiveness because group sessions were also less burdensome to deliver: a time-use survey (internal implementation data from our study that will be used in a cost-effectiveness analysis to be reported later) showed that community health volunteers doing home visits spent an average of 27 additional h per session travelling to and doing home visits relative to group sessions. This opportunity cost of delivery agents’ time would need to be accounted for in any plans for scaling the programme.</p>
              <p id="P46">The review sessions were the only sessions that differed between the two intervention groups. Our particular model of mixed delivery differed from other interventions that had mostly home visits and a few group sessions<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> in that our home visits were infrequent and, as review sessions, introduced little new material. One possible explanation for why children seem to benefit more from the group review sessions might have to do with peer learning. Learning, or imitation of behaviours of similarly aged peers, is noted under specific conditions that are similar to our four review sessions, namely, when the behaviour is familiar and being consolidated, and when peers are familiar from past experience.<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> In our group review sessions, children were consolidating the conversation and play behaviours learnt in previous sessions. Thus the group, but not home visit, review sessions might have enhanced learning through the cognitive and social functions of peer imitation. More opportunities for peer learning at group review meetings could explain the divergence in child outcomes across delivery models, especially as there were larger returns from attendance at successive group review sessions compared with home visits. These results also suggest that having periodic reviews of ECD programme content for participants might help to consolidate learning.</p>
              <p id="P47">Our study has many strengths related both to the intervention and evaluation of its effects. The intervention was implemented by a local organisation whose staff were also trained to train delivery agents. It used paraprofessional community health workers as delivery agents, was low cost, and showed generally high rates of uptake among mothers in the intervention groups despite large group sizes. These factors make it a strong contender for future replication and scaling in similar low-resource settings. Strengths of our experimental evaluation included data collectors being masked to group assignment, low attrition with no differential attrition by study group, and the collection of child outcomes based on direct assessments, not maternal report. We also estimated causal effects on participants (average treatment effect on the treated) to show the key role of compliance in the intervention, we corrected for multiple hypothesis testing, and we explored mediating pathways for how the intervention affects children’s development.</p>
              <p id="P48">Despite these strengths, a key limitation of our study is that outcomes were assessed immediately following the end of the intervention, constraining our ability to know the longer-term effects of the intervention. Another limitation is the use of subjective measures of maternal wellbeing and parenting practices. Although these measures are often used to evaluate intervention effects in low-resource settings, they might be subject to self-report biases. We also cannot say what the effects would have been in a pure home visiting delivery model. Finally, we had hoped that our study would inform whether involving fathers in these programmes delivers additional benefits, but low father attendance prevented us from succeeding. Future work should focus on learning ways to engage fathers into an ECD programme, as well as re-examine child and household effects in later years to understand the sustainability of measured effect over time.</p>
              <p id="P49">Our results show that an integrated child development intervention featuring exclusively group sessions delivered by paraprofessional community health workers to large groups of mothers can benefit multiple child outcomes and parental behaviours. We find no added benefit from the substitution of personalised home visits for group sessions. Our results represent a promising avenue for scaling similar interventions in low-resource rural settings where many children and families could potentially benefit from ECD programming.</p>

                <p id="P55">The de-identified datasets generated during the study along with the statistical plan and analytic code will be available from the corresponding author on reasonable request at the end of the 5-year project after all planned manuscripts have been accepted for publication. We will make the data without identifiers available to users only under a data-sharing agreement that provides for: (1) a commitment to using the data only for research purposes and not to make the attempt of identifying any individual participant; (2) a commitment to securing the data in case there are still some sensitive variables after the identifiers have been removed, by using appropriate computer technology; (3) a commitment to destroying or returning the data after analyses are complete; and (4) a commitment to not publish any information that is not treated at the aggregate level so that no specific characteristics can be linked to small communities.</p>

                <title>Evidence before this study</title>
                <p id="P70">We reviewed two systematic reviews published in 2015 and 2017 and searched the Global Health (Ovid) database on Dec 31, 2019, for publications since Jan 1, 2015. We focused on studies done in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) with children younger than 3 years and that featured psychosocial stimulation as a primary component. Our search terms included: “child development”, “responsive care”, “responsive play”, “parenting behavior”, “parenting”, “psychosocial stimulation”, “early childhood”, and “intervention”. We found eight studies in addition to the 40 previously included in the meta-analyses, which overall show effect sizes for cognitive and language development in the order of 0·40. Of the most recent eight studies, five yielded significant child outcomes, and three were non-significant. In sum, although effect sizes for psychosocial stimulation parenting programmes are in the moderate range, there is still the question of why some are more effective than others. Recommended features of successful programmes included having a structured curriculum, with opportunities for parental practice and feedback on the new behaviours, as well as sufficient frequency of sessions. However, most ECD interventions in LMIC settings feature a home visiting model of delivery, which can be prohibitively expensive to scale. Studies of ECD programmes that feature a group-based delivery model have been predominantly efficacy studies and often feature smaller group sizes (two to eight mothers), with supplemental home visits that sometimes outnumber the group sessions, drawing into question the effectiveness of group-only delivery and larger group sessions. Although some studies allowed fathers to participate in the interventions, none had explicitly tested the effects of including fathers.</p>

                <title>Added value of this study</title>
                <p id="P71">Our study directly compared a purely group-based model versus a mixed-delivery model that combines home visits with group sessions in a community effectiveness trial in a rural LMIC setting. We also tested the effectiveness of a group-based ECD intervention using community health workers in an African country and attempted to rigorously test the added value of inviting fathers into the intervention. We tested the effectiveness of both delivery models and found that group visits alone were sufficient to improve child cognitive, receptive language, and socioemotional outcomes by magnitudes similar to or larger than previous efficacy studies. Our results show that a group-based intervention is at least as effective as a mixed-delivery model that combines home visits, but is less burdensome to deliver. Our use of existing paraprofessional community-based health workers as delivery agents and relatively large group sizes (median attendance of 13 mothers) makes our model potentially scalable to other settings in which potential demand vastly outpaces supply of these programmes.</p>

                <title>Implications of all the available evidence</title>
                <p id="P72">ECD interventions can be delivered effectively in large village group settings by existing paraprofessional community agents without loss of effects compared with a more personalised (and thus more expensive and time-consuming) delivery model featuring home visits. The added benefits of involving fathers in these programmes is unclear and more research is needed to understand how to successfully engage fathers into ECD programmes in low-resource settings.</p>
