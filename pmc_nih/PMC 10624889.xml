                <p id="Par1">The identification of prognostic markers in patients receiving neoadjuvant therapy is crucial for treatment optimization in HER2-positive breast cancer, with the immune microenvironment being a key factor. Here, we investigate the complexity of B and T cell receptor (BCR and TCR) repertoires in the context of two phase III trials, NeoALTTO and CALGB 40601, evaluating neoadjuvant paclitaxel with trastuzumab and/or lapatinib in women with HER2-positive breast cancer. BCR features, particularly the number of reads and clones, evenness and Gini index, are heterogeneous according to hormone receptor status and PAM50 subtypes. Moreover, BCR measures describing clonal expansion, namely evenness and Gini index, are independent prognostic factors. We present a model developed in NeoALTTO and validated in CALGB 40601 that can predict event-free survival (EFS) by integrating hormone receptor and clinical nodal status, breast pathological complete response (pCR), stromal tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte levels (%) and BCR repertoire evenness. A prognostic score derived from the model and including those variables, HER2-EveNT, allows the identification of patients with 5-year EFS &gt; 90%, and, in those not achieving pCR, of a subgroup of immune-enriched tumors with an excellent outcome despite residual disease.</p>

              <p id="Par3">Neoadjuvant treatment escalation approaches with dual anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) blockade have been proven effective in early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer, leading to an increase in pathological complete response (pCR) rates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. In the neoadjuvant lapatinib and/or trastuzumab treatment optimization (NeoALTTO) trial, dual anti-HER2 blockade with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor lapatinib and the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab improved pCR rates in comparison to each targeted agent alone, and a survival benefit was demonstrated for patients achieving pCR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Moreover, the cancer and leukemia group B (CALGB) 40601 trial reported a significant survival benefit for dual HER2-targeting with lapatinib and trastuzumab compared to the single anti-HER2 agents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par4">HER2-positive breast cancer is considered an immunogenic tumor, and the host immune response in this breast cancer subtype has been extensively explored due to its known role in modulating the activity of anti-HER2 agents [e.g., through antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC)]<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Therefore, understanding the immune microenvironment in HER2-positive breast cancer represents a key element for biomarker research in this disease. In the NeoALTTO trial, higher levels (expressed in %) of stromal tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) predicted improved responsiveness and prognosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, while immune gene signatures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> and usage of specific T cell receptor (TCR) <italic>β</italic> chain variable genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> were positively associated with response in the combination arm. A prominent role of immune gene signatures (particularly related to B cell response) in predicting both pCR and prognosis has also been described in the CALGB 40601 study, even outperforming TILs in multivariable analyses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, opening questions regarding the need to integrate morphology with a more specific characterization of immune cell subtypes. An association with TIL frequencies has also been described for PAM50 subtypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> and hormone receptor status<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par5">Of note, increased diversity and clonal expansion of B cell receptor (BCR) and TCR repertoires, which can be described with different metrics (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) are characteristics of the immune response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Interestingly, several studies have recently focused their efforts on characterizing the role of B cells in different tumor types, including breast cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. These works have linked B cell infiltration and clonal diversity with improved outcomes as well as responsiveness to immunotherapy, and have depicted the role of B cells in orchestrating the immune response in tumors.</p>
              <p id="Par6">Moreover, the achievement of pCR after neoadjuvant treatments is a robust prognostic indicator<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. However, many patients with residual disease (RD) never experience recurrence, whereas disease relapse can still be observed in a subgroup of patients achieving pCR.</p>
              <p id="Par7">In this retrospective study, we further dissect the heterogeneity of HER2-positive breast cancer by evaluating the characteristics of the BCR and TCR repertoires in the context of two phase III clinical trials, namely NeoALTTO and CALGB 40601, evaluating neoadjuvant paclitaxel with trastuzumab and/or lapatinib in women with HER2-positive breast cancer. Moreover, we explore the impact of BCR and TCR repertoires and diversity measures on treatment response and long-term clinical outcomes. We present a prognostic model integrating baseline immunological and clinical features, as well as treatment response, aimed at identifying distinct prognostic groups in HER2-positive breast cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant therapies. The prognostic stratification of patients and the biological characterization of determinants of prognosis can open the avenue for the implementation of optimized neoadjuvant/post-operative treatment strategies.</p>

                <title>BCR and TCR repertoires in the NeoALTTO and CALGB 40601 trials</title>
                <p id="Par9">Aiming at investigating the complexity of the immune response in HER2-positive breast cancer, we explored the diversity of BCR and TCR repertoires in pre-treatment baseline tumor samples. The MiXCR tool<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> was used to identify BCR and TCR clones from RNA sequencing data, with some differences noted between NeoALTTO and CALGB 40601.</p>
                <p id="Par10">In NeoALTTO, all samples had at least one read mapping to BCR, while one sample did not have any read mapping to TCR. In the CALGB 40601 study, all samples showed reads mapping to both BCR and TCR. As the library size can impact the number of BCR/TCR reads, for the subsequent analyses we normalized the number of BCR/TCR reads by the total number of reads mapping to genes in each sample. The number of reads mapping to TCR was significantly lower than BCR in both studies, and the number of normalized reads and clones were significantly higher in NeoALTTO compared to CALGB 40601 (Supplementary data <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">1</xref>). In this regard, differences in the RNA sequencing between the two studies, namely the read length [50-base pairs (bp) in CALGB 40601 and 100-bp in NeoALTTO] have to be considered. Indeed, while different read lengths can be used in MiXCR, 100-bp read libraries allow detection of higher numbers of clonotypes compared to shorter read lengths<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, potentially leading to the identification of a lower number of clones in CALGB 40601. This was further confirmed when testing MiXCR in NeoALTTO after trimming reads at 50-bp (details in METHODS), comparing the read and clone counts obtained with the original NeoALTTO data used for the analyses (Supplementary data <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">1</xref>).</p>
                <p id="Par11">The proportions of reads mapping to the different immunoglobulin and TCR chains are shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3a–d</xref>. In both studies, the majority of the reads were generated from the κ light chain for BCR repertoires, and from both the <italic>α</italic> and the <italic>β</italic> chain for TCR.

The proportion of the most frequent (top) and the second clone, and the length in nucleotides of the complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3) were also calculated (Supplementary data <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">2</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Illustrative examples are depicted in Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>. Correlations between measures computed on the single-chain types and the total BCR/TCR measures (calculated considering all reads mapping to any BCR or TCR gene) are shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref> for NeoALTTO and Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref> for CALGB 40601 (values reported in Supplementary data <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">4</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>). Except for the CDR3 length, which differed in the various chains (Supplementary data <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">1</xref>), and TCR gamma and delta chains, presenting a low number of reads, we observed moderate to high correlations (rho &gt; 0.50) with the total BCR/TCR metrics for the majority of the single-chain features in both trials.</p>

                <p id="Par17">We then compared BCR and TCR measures according to PAM50 subtypes. For this purpose, in order to have uniformity in the PAM50 analyses, we adopted in NeoALTTO the method described in Fernandez-Martinez et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. NeoALTTO and CALGB 40601 presented similar populations in terms of PAM50 classification (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, Supplementary data <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">9</xref>).

                <p id="Par18">Of interest, we observed heterogeneity in terms of BCR repertoire across PAM50 subtypes for both trials, with different distributions (Kruskal-Wallis FDR &lt; 0.05) for read counts, evenness, Gini index, Gini-Simpson, as well as top and second clone proportions (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10</xref>). TCR measures were overall more homogeneous (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">11</xref>), although some differences could be noted (e.g., differences in the number of reads in both studies). Overall, HER2-E, basal-like, and luminal B tumors showed features in line with an activation of the B-cell mediated immune response and clonal expansion, as described by higher BCR Gini index and lower BCR evenness, compared to luminal A and normal-like samples.

In contrast, a negative correlation with TIL levels (rho = −0.29 to −0.41) was noted for BCR evenness, as well as TCR top and second clone proportions. As top and second top clone proportions are also negatively correlated with the number of clones, higher values may represent populations with low levels of both immune infiltration and number of clones. Since correlations between TIL levels and BCR/TCR diversity measures were moderate, the information brought by TILs quantification and BCR/TCR characterization may be complementary, with diversity measures potentially providing a “qualitative” information in terms of immune response compared to the quantification of TILs.</p>

The model was developed on a training cohort of 221 patients from the NeoALTTO trial with all included data available, using a forward stepwise approach with Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) to select the best model (Supplementary data <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">12</xref>).</p>

A score, named HER2-EveNT for hormone receptor status, pCR, BCR evenness, nodal status, and TILs, was then calculated as the sum of the values assigned to each variable multiplied by the estimated coefficient derived from the Cox model (details in METHODS).</p>

                <p id="Par39">To explore the relationship of BCR/TCR characteristics, TILs and prognosis with the tumor microenvironment composition in the NeoALTTO and CALGB 40601 cohorts, we applied the microenvironment cell populations (MCP)-counter tool<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>, which allows to estimate the abundance scores of different immune and stromal cells (Supplementary data <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">15</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">16</xref>). Indeed, differences in the microenvironment composition were associated to BCR/TCR measures and TIL levels, as well as to the HER2-EveNT prognostic score.</p>
                <p id="Par40">We first evaluated the correlations of the abundance scores for each cell type were with the BCR/TCR measures, TIL levels and the HER2-EveNT score (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">21</xref>, Supplementary data <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">17</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">18</xref>). In both trials, BCR and TCR read counts were highly correlated with the B cell lineage scores (rho = 0.95–0.97) and the T cell subtypes (rho ≥ 0.8), respectively. Instead, lower correlations between MCP-counter results and TIL levels were noted, with the highest value belonging to the B cell lineage in both studies (rho = 0.54 and 0.56 in NeoALTTO and CALGB 40601, respectively). These results are reassuring in that BCR/TCR measures highly correlate with B/T cells measured by MCP-counter, which may be expected as both are derived from RNA sequencing data, and suggest that MCP-counter fits better with BCR/TCR normalized reads than with TILs. BCR evenness was negatively correlated to the B cell lineage score, monocytic cells, as well as cytotoxic T cells (rho = −0.2 to −0.52), while a weak positive correlation (rho = 0.2 to 0.35) was found with neutrophils and endothelial cells in both studies. Therefore, we can hypothesize a relationship between the network of different cell types in the tumor microenvironment and B cell clonal expansion. In line with their suggested immunosuppressive role<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>, neutrophils, endothelial cells and fibroblasts were positively correlated with the HER2-EvenNT score, while negative correlations with TILs were noted for endothelial cells and fibroblasts.</p>

Gene set enrichment analysis for hallmark biological processes performed on ranked genes from differential expression analysis showed comparable results to the GSVA analysis (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">23</xref>, Supplementary data <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">26</xref>). A gene ontology (GO) analysis on genes presenting a log<sub>2</sub>(fold change) &gt; 0.58 or &lt; −0.58 also revealed similar results, with immune-related GO processes associated with good prognosis (Supplementary data <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">27</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">28</xref>). The top 30 biological processes associated with poor prognosis were more heterogeneous (Supplementary data <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">29</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">30</xref>) and included, among others, neural biological processes (e.g., neuropeptide signaling pathway, nervous system process, nerve growth factor signaling pathway). Interestingly, neural processes have been recently found to be associated with lack of pCR and higher RD burden<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>.</p>
                <p id="Par45">Among the differentially expressed genes with a log<sub>2</sub>(fold change) &gt; 0.58 or &lt; −0.58, 408 genes associated with good prognosis were in common in the two studies (Supplementary data <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">31</xref>).

                <p id="Par48">As shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">24</xref>, signatures negatively correlated with the risk score were mainly immune-related (Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">34</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">35</xref>). Of interest, among the signatures correlated (rho &gt; 0.2) with a higher risk score, several were shared in the two studies, including signatures related to stemness, a lobular “reactive-like” signature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>, as well as a signature previously associated to lack of response to immune-checkpoint inhibitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>.</p>

Both pCR and RD groups with good prognosis presented a clear enrichment in immune features. The poor prognosis samples, particularly those with RD, presented a lower immune-related signal instead.

              <p id="Par51">HER2-positive breast cancer represents a heterogeneous entity, as shown by PAM50 molecular subtypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. From a therapeutic point of view, the interplay between the immune response and the activity of anti-HER2 agents is of crucial importance, as highlighted by evidence pointing to ADCC as a primary mechanism for the effect of trastuzumab<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Indeed, several studies have demonstrated an association between immune response (as described by TIL levels and/or gene expression signatures), pCR and prognosis in HER2-positive breast cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. However, the determinants of relapse after either pCR or RD have not been fully understood yet. In the present retrospective study, we adopted an approach aimed at describing both the “quantity” and “quality” of immune response in early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer by exploring the characteristics of baseline BCR and TCR repertoires in the NeoALTTO and CALGB 40601 phase III neoadjuvant clinical trials. We showed heterogeneity in BCR and, to a lesser extent, TCR measures according to hormone receptor status and PAM50 subtypes. Furthermore, we demonstrated the association between BCR repertoire measures describing clonal expansion suggestive of an antigen-specific response, namely lower evenness and higher Gini index, and better EFS in both NeoALTTO and CALGB 40601. We then built a model aimed at predicting EFS integrating clinicopathological characteristics, treatment response and immune-related features (i.e., TILs and BCR evenness). Of utmost importance, our model was developed in the NeoALTTO trial and independently validated in the CALGB 40601 study. By deriving the prognostic HER2-EveNT score from the model, we identified two groups of patients with distinct prognosis after neoadjuvant therapy, demonstrating an association with long-term EFS in the overall population as well as in the RD subgroup in both studies.</p>
              <p id="Par52">While pCR achievement is a strong prognostic factor in HER2-positive breast cancers after neoadjuvant therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, the selection of further variables in the model suggests the importance of additional processes/features in determining prognosis. In fact, the risk of relapse is influenced by the interaction of several variables, particularly in the absence of pCR where the other biomarkers play a crucial role. The neoadjuvant setting presents some peculiar challenges in terms of biomarker discovery, as the relationship between prognostic features (related to survival/relapse risk) and predictive markers (related to pCR) may be complex. Indeed, some features such as proliferation, HER2 signaling or luminal phenotype may provide discordant information for pCR and survival (e.g., lower pCR rates and improved outcomes for luminal features)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. As additional factors such as treatment administered could impact response to neoadjuvant therapies, pCR achievement may not be, still, fully captured by pre-treatment biomarkers, though progresses in this regard are being made<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par53">Other predictive/prognostic models have been developed in early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer. For example, a combined score of TILs and tumor cellularity (CelTIL) measured at week 2 after starting neoadjuvant anti-HER2 therapy (without chemotherapy) provided predictive information in the PAMELA study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup> and was recently evaluated for long-term outcome prediction in the NeoALTTO trial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>. Furthermore, a model including clinicopathological variables, TIL levels, PAM50 subtypes and genes was used to calculate a prognostic score (HER2DX) in the adjuvant Short-HER trial and evaluated in four neoadjuvant studies, including the CHERLOB and PAMELA trials, showing prognostic value<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>. More recently, this test has been refined and adapted to predict also pCR after pre-operative anti-HER2-based chemotherapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. Importantly, our score was specifically designed and validated to predict prognosis in the neoadjuvant setting.</p>
              <p id="Par54">By characterizing the gene expression profiles of the prognostic groups, we showed an enrichment for immune-related processes in the group presenting good prognosis after either pCR or RD, leading us to hypothesize that tumors presenting an active immune response at baseline present biological similarities beyond HER2/estrogen receptor pathways activation.</p>
              <p id="Par55">As we are moving toward optimizing treatment strategies, we may argue that the lack of pCR in patients with baseline favorable clinical/immune features may not necessarily require treatment escalation approaches in all patients. In the seminal trial KATHERINE, post-operative trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) showed remarkable benefit compared to trastuzumab in patients with RD at surgery; however, more adverse events were also observed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>. Identifying a population in which treatment escalation with T-DM1 is not beneficial would be very valuable both from a toxicity and a cost-effectiveness standpoint. In a biomarker analysis of KATHERINE, the benefit of T-DM1 appeared to be independent of the biomarkers assessed, including immune-related gene expression signatures and <italic>ERBB2</italic> expression levels computed essentially from RD samples<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>. Given evidence of transient gene expression changes induced by anti-HER2 drugs, it is not clear whether the same would be true of analyses performed on samples prior to drug exposure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup>. Based on our data, a combination of biomarkers performed on pre-treatment specimens may help identify a subset of patients (which according to our model may account for 20–30% of the patients with RD) with excellent outcomes and for whom post-operative trastuzumab alone could represent a viable option. Importantly, these patients can be identified computing the score with only the baseline features, as not achieving pCR will not have an impact on the prognostic category based on the HER2-EveNT score.</p>
              <p id="Par56">The role of B cell infiltration and clonal diversity in modulating the immune response in cancer has been described by several works<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. The contribution of B cells to the response to immunotherapy is of interest in HER2-positive breast cancer, as several trials are currently testing immunotherapeutic strategies in this subtype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>. Results in the advanced disease setting suggested a potential benefit for immunotherapy in pre-treated patients with PD-L1 positive tumors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref></sup>. However, in the neoadjuvant setting, the primary analysis of the IMpassion050 trial did not show improvement in pCR rates when adding atezolizumab to standard treatment, and adverse events were more frequent in the atezolizumab arm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref></sup>. These results highlight the necessity of implementing new immune biomarkers, and lead us to hypothesize that HER2-positive tumors with lower BCR evenness/higher Gini index and higher TIL levels (which can be related to higher levels of genes coding for immune checkpoints) could benefit from immunotherapy, considering that a precise selection of patients is crucial due to the potential associated toxicities. In addition, considering the importance of immune-related features and signatures in patients with good outcomes regardless of pCR status, we may speculate that a potential benefit from immunotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting would translate mainly in longer EFS rather than increased pCR rates. Of note, the treatment arsenal of HER2-positive breast cancer is rapidly evolving, with several agents (e.g., antibody–drug conjugates and novel tyrosine kinase inhibitors) which are being evaluated in the early-stage setting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup> and may reshape the current biomarker landscape.</p>
              <p id="Par57">In light of all these aspects, our model could be prospectively tested in studies designed to evaluate approaches involving the use of immunotherapy-based regimens and/or de-escalation/shorter duration of post-operative treatments in low risk patients with an excellent prognosis, as well as alternative therapeutic strategies in those with poor outcome.</p>
              <p id="Par58">Our study presented several challenges and limitations. In addition to the already-discussed differences in terms of patient populations, the NeoALTTO and the CALGB 40601 trials had some differences in study design, namely in the timing of the start of neoadjuvant paclitaxel and in the post-operative treatments (details in the METHODS). We standardized the survival outcome measure (EFS) used for our analyses across the two trials; however, neither NeoALTTO nor CALGB 40601 were powered to detect survival benefits. Moreover, these trials evaluated lapatinib, which is not currently adopted in early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer. Therefore, validating these findings in cohorts receiving standard treatment regimens (e.g., pertuzumab in combination with trastuzumab) would be extremely valuable.</p>
              <p id="Par59">Characterizing the BCR and TCR repertoires from bulk RNA sequencing data represents a challenge in itself<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref></sup>. In line with previous reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref></sup>, the number of reads mapping to BCR was higher than TCR, suggesting higher transcription of immunoglobulin mRNA compared to TCR mRNA, as well as a lower sensitivity in retrieving full TCR CDR3 sequences. Importantly, bulk RNA sequencing analysis does not allow to pair BCR/TCR chains (i.e., to identify the combination of heavy/light chains or alpha/beta chains forming a single BCR or TCR), contrary to single-cell sequencing technologies which enable to a better BCR/TCR as well as B and T cell characterization. In addition, RNA sequencing-based methods to describe BCR/TCR may provide a partial picture of the repertoires compared to more sensitive technologies for BCR/TCR sequencing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref></sup>. These aspects may contribute to explain the moderate correlation of BCR/TCR read counts with TILs, although similar correlations have also been reported for other RNA sequencing-derived data such as immune-related gene expression signatures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> and, as we showed, MCP-counter results. Differences in RNA sequencing pipelines between the two studies were also present, and we acknowledge that standardization of the methodology would be necessary to strengthen our findings further.</p>
              <p id="Par60">In addition, more reliable cutoffs may need to be defined for the HER2-EveNT score. Moreover, the inclusion of the residual cancer burden, given its prognostic value in patients with RD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref></sup>, as well as the integration of RD biological features, which may add an essential layer of information to the baseline characteristics, could further improve our model.</p>
              <p id="Par61">Despite these considerations, findings from NeoALTTO were confirmed in CALGB 40601, suggesting the robustness of the results, which first and foremost provide the rationale for interrogating more extensively the role of B cells in this disease.</p>
              <p id="Par62">In conclusion, we demonstrated the heterogeneity of BCR repertoire measures and immune response within HER2-positive breast cancer and the potential of BCR diversity as a prognostic biomarker. Our model identified a group of patients with immune-enriched tumors who may be eligible for treatment de-escalation approaches, even after RD, and highlighted the importance of integrating clinicopathological characteristics, treatment response information, and immune-related features to define the clinical risk in the neoadjuvant setting. Further validation of our findings and exploration of the role of BCR/TCR repertoire measures in HER2-positive as well as other breast cancer subtypes is warranted.</p>

                <p id="Par76">BCR/TCR repertoires were extracted from bulk RNA sequencing data using the MiXCR tool<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> (v3.0.13) with default parameters, specifying the option “OallowPartialAlignments = true”, and including all immunoglobulin and TCR chains. Briefly, we aligned sequencing reads to reference V, D, J and C genes of T- or B- cell receptors. Clonotypes were assembled using aligned reads to extract the CDR3, which is the region conferring the antigen recognition capability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. The option “OallowPartialAlignments” allowed to rescue incomplete alignments related to the absence of V or J CDR3 part, as the tool builds contigs from different initial alignments while avoiding artificial diversity generation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Indeed, this enables to assemble alignments only partially covering the CDR3 region, which is a possible occurrence due to the random coverage of BCR/TCR segments by fragmented reads in RNA sequencing. In particular, clones were defined as having the same CDR3 nucleotide sequence. Moreover, we tried to assign each clone to a specific type of BCR (kappa, lambda or heavy) or TCR (alpha, beta, gamma, delta) chain, based on the V, D, and J genes. For some clones MiXCR gives multiple matches for some or all genes. If all genes pointed to the same chain type, the clone was assigned to that type. In the case of a clone with a gene with discordant chain types (e.g., V genes <italic>TRAV17</italic> and <italic>TRBV5</italic>), the other gene of the clone was checked, and its chain type was used if it was univocal and compatible with the other gene (e.g., <italic>TRAJ50</italic>). In the cases where discordant chains were found between the genes (e.g., <italic>TRAV24</italic> for V gene and <italic>TRBJ2-5</italic> for J gene) or where it was impossible to determine univocally the chain type, the clone was kept and considered as either BCR or TCR, but its chain type was left as missing.</p>
                <p id="Par77">Isotypes (IgG, IgA, IgM, IgD, IgE) for the BCR heavy chain were determined based on the constant region (C region) information, whenever present. In particular, the isotype could not be determined in 23% of the IGH clones in NeoALTTO and 19% in CALGB 40601. For the remaining IGH clones, isotype proportions are shown in Supplementary Fig <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3e–f</xref>.</p>
                <p id="Par78">The following BCR and TCR repertoire metrics were calculated: read counts, number of clones, length of the CDR3, top and second top clone proportions. Diversity indices including Gini index, Gini-Simpson index and species evenness were calculated as well. Those measures were computed for each BCR/TCR chain separately, as well as “global” measures considering all clones belonging to either BCR or TCR (Supplementary data <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">2</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">3</xref>).</p>

CDR3 length was calculated when at least one clone was present. We defined BCR/TCR metrics (illustrative examples in Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) as follow: read count reflects the number of reads mapping to CDR3 regions of BCR or TCR, and was normalized (i.e., divided) by the total number of reads mapping to the transcriptome in each sample and multiplied by a factor of 1000; the number of clones is defined as the total number of different clones in the sample; the CDR3 length is calculated as mean of the number of nucleotides included in that region; top and second top clone proportions measure the proportion of reads mapping to the first and second most expressed clone in the BCR/TCR population for that sample; Gini index describes the degree of inequality among values within the BCR/TCR population and was calculated using the function “gini” from the “reldist” R package (v1.6-6)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref></sup>; Gini-Simpson index is determined by the total number of clonotypes and their relative abundance, and describes the probability that two entities are from different types; evenness is Shannon entropy normalized by the number of clones and describes the uniformity of the clonotypes, measuring distribution equality.

The list of variables, steps and corresponding AIC values, as well as the details of the final model are shown in Supplementary data <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">12</xref>.</p>
                <p id="Par83">Before calculating the signature scores, genes with a total read count across all samples &lt; 20 were excluded, and normalization was performed by dividing gene counts by the sample mean gene count followed by log<sub>10</sub> normalization after adding a small constant (0.001). Then, signature scores were computed as the weighted mean of the log-expressions of their genes, with gene-specific weights equal to +1 or −1 based on the direction of their association with the phenotype in the original publication or to specific coefficients for the AURKA signature.</p>
                <p id="Par84">With regards to BCR and TCR measures, the same procedure followed for uni- and multi-variate analysis was applied in NeoALTTO (i.e., transformation according to the Shapiro-Francia test, then centering and scaling).</p>

                <p id="Par86">A prognostic score (HER2-EveNT) was computed multiplying the coefficient obtained for each variable in the final Cox model (Supplementary data <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">12</xref>) for the value of the same variable, and summing up the obtained values.

                <p id="Par87">The score was therefore calculated as:</p>

                <p id="Par89">As the coefficients are the natural logarithm of the HRs for each variable, the score represents a measure of the relative risk of relapse calculated based on the values of each variable in the single patient, with a lower score being associated with a better prognosis. Variables with a negative coefficient were associated with improved EFS, while a positive coefficient was associated with worse prognosis.</p>
                <p id="Par90">This score was then divided into tertiles. As EFS &gt; 90% was reached for the first tertile in NeoALTTO, the cutoff between the first and the intermediate tertiles was used to define the two final prognostic groups. An external independent validation was performed testing the model in 230 patients from the CALGB 40601 trial with pCR, hormone receptor, clinical nodal status, TILs, and BCR evenness data available. As BCR evenness was not log transformed in NeoALTTO, the BCR evenness values in CALGB 40601 were only centered by removing the mean of NeoALTTO BCR evenness (0.7917893) and scaled dividing the obtained values by the NeoALTTO BCR evenness standard deviation (0.1004482) before computing the HER2-EveNT score.</p>

This analysis allowed a more direct comparisons between the prognostic groups in NeoALTTO and CALGB 40601, ensuring the robustness of the findings described when evaluating each study separately.</p>
                <p id="Par98">The signature scores were computed by calculating the median expression of all the genes within a signature. Multiple immune-related biomarkers were included in this gene-signature collection, most of them initially extracted by comparing the gene expression pattern of different immune cell sub-populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref></sup>.

                <p id="Par99">Signature scores were then centered removing their mean and scaled dividing them by their standard deviation in the two studies. We next computed the correlation of the signature scores with the prognostic score as continuous value (considering as significant correlations with <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). We then selected 98 signature scores/single gene expression levels to compare four groups created based on the prognostic score and pCR status (ypT0/is ypN0), i.e., “pCR, good prognosis”, “pCR, poor prognosis”, “RD, good prognosis”, “RD, poor prognosis”. The effect size was obtained by applying a linear regression model and the <italic>P</italic> value derived from a Wilcoxon rank sum test, comparing each group against the rest.</p>

For reproducibility purposes, the NeoALTTO clinical data at IJB can be obtained upon signature of a data transfer agreement between the investigator and IJB, subject to applicable laws. The access to these data can be requested by contacting the corresponding Author (christos.sotiriou@hubruxelles.be). For investigators aiming to perform original research, the NeoALTTO RNA sequencing data at baseline and the clinical data are available upon request after submission of a research project proposal (RPP) to the RPP’s administrator (alttoresearchproposals@frontier-science.co.uk). In detail, access to data for research will be granted upon review of the RPP and its endorsement by the study Steering Committee, and after entering into an appropriate data access agreement between BIG, IJB, and the investigator, subject to applicable laws.

The policy for access to residual biological samples and data in the NeoALTTO study is a fair scientific review process set up to ensure precious biological samples or data collected in the studies are accessed appropriately, to avoid duplication of efforts and foster collaboration. The data from the study are not anonymized yet, only pseudonymized, therefore they are still considered identifiable, and cannot be made publicly available at this point. In order to ensure that they are shared in a way that preserves the privacy of patients and complies with the relevant laws and regulations including the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), researchers can only access the data after they sign the data transfer agreements mentioned above, either for reproducibility or for original research purposes.
