                <p id="Par1">Anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies are mainstay COVID-19 therapeutics. Safety, antiviral, and clinical efficacy of bamlanivimab were evaluated in the randomized controlled trial ACTIV-2/A5401. Non-hospitalized adults were randomized 1:1 within 10 days of COVID-19 symptoms to bamlanivimab or blinded-placebo in two dose-cohorts (7000 mg, <italic>n</italic> = 94; 700 mg, <italic>n</italic> = 223). No differences in bamlanivimab vs placebo were observed in the primary outcomes: proportion with undetectable nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 RNA at days 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28 (risk ratio = 0.82–1.05 for 7000 mg [<italic>p</italic>(overall) = 0.88] and 0.81–1.21 for 700 mg [<italic>p</italic>(overall) = 0.49]), time to symptom improvement (median 21 vs 18.5 days [<italic>p</italic> = 0.97], 7000 mg; 24 vs 20.5 days [<italic>p</italic> = 0.08], 700 mg), or grade 3+ adverse events. However, bamlanivimab was associated with lower day 3 nasopharyngeal viral levels and faster reductions in inflammatory markers and viral decay by modeling. This study provides evidence of faster reductions in nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels but not shorter symptom durations in non-hospitalized adults with early variants of SARS-CoV-2. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04518410.</p>

              <p id="Par3">Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), continues to exert an enormous global public health and economic toll, and in the U.S. case-fatality rates exceed estimates for the 1918 influenza pandemic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibody (mAb)-based therapies have shown sufficient clinical efficacy to receive emergency authorization (EUA) by regulatory agencies for the treatment of COVID-19 in non-hospitalized persons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par4">Bamlanivimab is a neutralizing immunoglobulin G (IgG)−1 mAb directed to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. On November 9, 2020, based on data from the Blocking Viral Attachment and Cell Entry with SARS-CoV-2 Neutralizing Antibodies (BLAZE-1) trial (NCT04427501)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an EUA for its use as a one-time 700 mg intravenous (IV) infusion for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in non-hospitalized adults with risk factors for progression to severe disease who were within 10 days of symptom onset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Since then, the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with decreased susceptibility in vitro to bamlanivimab<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> led to withdrawal of the EUA.</p>
              <p id="Par5">With the rapid development of additional anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAbs and non-antibody antivirals such as remdesivir, nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir, and molnupiravir for treatment of early COVID-19<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, understanding the antiviral activity and characterizing the clinical benefits of mAbs in this setting remains a critical need. Here, we describe the safety, virologic, and clinical outcomes of a placebo-controlled phase 2 evaluation of bamlanivimab at two doses, 7000 mg and 700 mg, in non-hospitalized adults with COVID-19. The lessons learned are relevant to clinical trial design for SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics and understanding potential mechanisms for the observed clinical benefits associated with anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAbs.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par18">We present results of a placebo-controlled phase 2 evaluation of the safety and efficacy of single dose bamlanivimab 700 mg and partially enrolled phase 2 evaluation of single dose bamlanivimab 7000 mg given by IV infusion for the treatment of non-hospitalized adults with COVID-19. Consistent across both dose cohorts, in which participants received study intervention a median of 6 days from symptom onset, bamlanivimab was safe and reduced NP SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels and circulating measures of inflammation more rapidly than placebo. We also demonstrate that antiviral activity of mAbs in the nasal compartment may be observed with treatment out to 10 days from symptom onset and identify key limitations of NP SARS-CoV-2 RNA measures for assessing the antiviral activity of COVID-19 therapeutics.</p>
              <p id="Par19">We found that, among participants who were enrolled within 5 days of symptom onset, NP SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels were &gt;1.5 log<sub>10</sub> copies/mL higher at study entry than among those enrolled &gt;5 days from symptom onset and differences in early post-treatment NP SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels favoring bamlanivimab were more pronounced amongst those treated within 5 days of symptom onset. Modeled viral decay rates were not different between those enrolling earlier versus later, with both groups showing more rapid decline with bamlanivimab than placebo. These findings highlight the limitations of nasal compartment SARS-CoV-2 RNA measures for the evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 treatment interventions, particularly when examining absolute levels or changes in levels from baseline, as has been done in multiple randomized clinical trials of mAbs and oral antivirals for early COVID-19 treatment. In these trials, both significant reductions (with bamlanivimab, bamlanivimab/etesevimab, casirivimab/imdevimab, and nirmatrelvir/ritonavir)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> and absence of significant reductions (with remdesivir and sotrovimab)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> in NP SARS-CoV-2 RNA have been found despite evidence of a large beneficial effect of treatment on hospitalizations and deaths. Our data suggest that NP RNA shedding analyzed as such to measure antiviral activity is likely to be most informative early after symptom onset, and that modeling of viral decay rates may be a more consistent measure of antiviral activity; the association of decay rates with hospitalization and death outcomes should be explored.</p>
              <p id="Par20">In addition to reductions in NP SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels, we found biological evidence of activity of bamlanivimab against COVID-19 progression, with greater reductions in inflammatory biomarker levels (CRP, ferritin, and fibrinogen) with bamlanivimab compared to placebo. Greater reductions in CRP in the first four weeks following effective treatment were recently reported in a randomized placebo-controlled trial of molnupiravir (the MOVe-OUT trial) for COVID-19 treatment in non-hospitalized persons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Our findings are consistent with these and extend them to other markers of inflammation. Our findings also suggest potential benefits of antiviral therapies beyond the first few weeks after treatment, as we observed benefits in CRP as late as 24 weeks after bamlanivimab treatment (measures beyond day 29 were not reported for the MOVe-OUT trial). Considering the different mechanisms of action and half-life of bamlanivimab and molnupiravir, these data suggest the initial improvement in inflammatory markers is due to direct virus neutralization and inhibition of further viral replication. However, one could consider if there might be further benefit specific to mAbs that is not related to direct antiviral activity, such as through non-neutralizing Fc-mediated effector functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> and clearance of infected cells, that could theoretically induce greater and more prolonged benefits in SARS-CoV-2-associated inflammation and complications; a head-to-head study of small molecule antivirals with antibody-based therapies would be needed to explore this. As more potent oral antivirals for COVID-19 are becoming increasingly available, future studies are needed to interrogate the potential benefits of small molecule vs antibody-based antivirals for populations at high risk of severe COVID-19 (immunocompromised persons with limited endogenous immune responses) and for potential inflammation-mediated complications in all persons at risk for COVID-19, such as post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC). The reductions in inflammatory biomarkers with bamlanivimab, including as late as 24 weeks after treatment, suggest some promise for early antiviral therapy to mitigate or prevent the development of PASC, or some PASC manifestations.</p>
              <p id="Par21">While no impact of bamlanivimab therapy on symptom duration was found in our study, we note that symptom-based outcome measures for assessing treatment response have not yet been validated and persistence or brief recurrence of mild symptoms may have made our primary symptom outcome definition overly sensitive to symptoms that may not have been clinically meaningful. Across outpatient COVID-19 therapeutic studies, definitions of symptom improvement or resolution, symptom diaries, severity scoring scales, analytical approaches, and included symptoms have differed, yielding differing effect sizes ranging from modest (1 day reduction in time to symptom resolution) in the BLAZE-1 study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> to 4 days with casirivimab/imdevimab<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. One obvious impact of the different definitions of symptom resolution is on the duration of symptoms from study entry – shorter durations were reported in the BLAZE-1 and REGEN-COV studies than in our study (median durations of &gt;20 days). Based on clinical observations that COVID-19 symptoms may wax and wane day-to-day, we sought to minimize the possibility of recurrent or relapsing symptoms in defining our population with improved symptoms, resulting in long durations of symptoms. An additional challenge is distinguishing between symptoms that are specific to COVID-19 or due to comorbidities, given many viral illness symptoms are non-specific. The potential for mAbs to modify symptom duration and accelerate symptom resolution may also depend on timing of mAb therapy during the COVID-19 disease course – where later administration (as late as 10 days after symptom onset, as in our study and past mAb EUA guidance) may have less impact, although this is unknown. Validation of COVID-19 symptom diary content and outcome measures are ongoing, by our group and others.</p>
              <p id="Par22">Our study yielded information on virus shedding in nasal and plasma compartments in early COVID-19 – we found NP and AN SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels are not associated with risk factors for disease progression or correlated with self-reported symptom scores but are higher among persons with SARS-CoV-2 viremia compared to those without detectable viremia. Symptom scores also tended to be higher among viremic compared to aviremic participants, suggesting plasma viral measures may be more specific measures of symptom burden or disease severity. Given the small number of hospitalizations, we could not determine if nasal shedding, viremia, or changes with treatment were associated with COVID-19 severity, as has been observed in hospitalized persons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par23">In this study, we also expand on the reported PK of bamlanivimab and found the characteristics in 108 non-hospitalized persons were comparable with those reported in the first-in-human study in hospitalized patients for both the 700 and 7000 mg doses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Absolute dose proportional PK were not observed, explained by the faster total body clearance with 7000 mg than 700 mg. The 700 mg dose (the dose that was granted an EUA) achieved sustained serum concentrations above the predicted IC<sub>90</sub> for SARS-CoV-2 neutralization for authentic and early SARS-CoV-2 variants in nearly all participants with available PK data, supporting the selection of this dose for clinical use. However, bamlanivimab concentrations in target tissues such as the respiratory tract have not been measured in humans and whether this same pharmacodynamic relationship exists in tissues is not known.</p>
              <p id="Par24">As noted throughout this report, this study has several limitations including small sample size for the 7000 mg dose cohort and for higher risk participants and low rate of hospitalization/death events, which precludes analysis of the clinical significance of virologic and inflammatory marker changes with respect to progression to severe COVID-19. The study also evaluated an agent that no longer has sufficient antiviral activity against circulating variants. However, while bamlanivimab and, increasingly, other anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAbs that have received FDA EUA do not currently have clinical utility based on the lack of in vitro neutralizing activity against variants that have emerged over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, these phase 2 trial results affirm the overall safety and antiviral activity of bamlanivimab and offer insights into the potential benefits of mAbs and COVID-19 clinical trial design. Our study also suggests a benefit of mAbs on systemic inflammation, demonstrates that timing of COVID-19 treatment can markedly impact nasal compartment SARS-CoV-2 RNA outcomes, and highlights key areas for future work in SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics for early COVID-19, including exploration of alternate virologic measures such as viral decay rates as a predictor or surrogate for hospitalizations and deaths in COVID-19 treatment trials, and further exploration of mechanisms by which mAbs may uniquely, distinct from direct antivirals and based on individual mAb design, serve an important role in improving both early and late COVID-19 outcomes.</p>

                <p id="Par39">Blood samples for quantitation of bamlanivimab serum concentrations were collected pre-dose and at the following times after the end of infusion: 30 minutes, days 14 and 28 and weeks 12 and 24. Serum concentrations of bamlanivimab were determined using a validated hybrid LC-MS/MS method. Extraction was performed using Protein G coated magnetic beads for affinity capture of immunoglobulins, followed by sample purification, sequential reduction and alkylation of cysteines, and overnight on-beads enzymatic digestion with trypsin. A specific tryptic signature peptide from the Fab region of bamlanivimab was used for quantitation, with a stable isotope 4 labelled form used as the internal standard (IS). The signature peptide was identified and quantified using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) detection over an analyte concentration range of 5.00 to 500.00 µg/mL. Concentrations were calculated using peak area ratios of analyte to IS, and the linearity of the calibration curve determined using least squares regression analysis with a weighting factor of 1/<italic>x</italic><sup>2</sup>. The assays were performed once on each sample. The assay has met FDA requirements for accuracy and reproducibility. Additional details of the method and its use in the first-in-human study of bamlanivimab have been published<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. PK parameters of interest were maximum concentration (Cmax), area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 to infinity (AUC<sub>0-∞</sub>), elimination half-life, and total body clearance (CL), which were calculated based on the statistical moment theory using the trapezoidal rule and linear regression (WinNonLin v8.3.4, Certara, Princeton, NJ, USA).</p>

At the time the study was designed, there were no data in outpatients with COVID-19 to inform expected differences in proportion undetectable for NP SARS-CoV-2 RNA over 28 days. We estimated that a 20% absolute increase in the proportion undetectable would be clinically relevant, and 110 participants assigned to each arm would have 82.5 to 95.5% power dependent on the proportion undetectable in the placebo arm, with a two-sided Type I error rate of 5%.</p>

Four participants enrolled to the 7000 mg dose cohort received 700 mg bamlanivimab or placebo and were included in the 700 mg analysis population (the randomization to active agent or placebo remained valid). One participant enrolled in the 700 mg dose cohort received 7000 mg bamlanivimab and was included in the 7000 mg analysis population.</p>

The proportion of participants with undetectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA was compared between arms across study visits using Poisson regression with robust variance adjusted for baseline (day 0) log<sub>10</sub> transformed SARS-CoV-2 RNA level and summarized with RR and 95% CI at each time, and Wald test across the multiple times. Quantitative SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels were compared between arms using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, separately at each post-entry study visit, without adjustment for baseline value. For this comparison, results below the LoD were imputed as the lowest rank, and values above the LoD but below the LLoQ were imputed as the second lowest rank. For summaries of quantitative RNA levels, values below the LoD were imputed as 0.7 log<sub>10</sub> copies/ml (i.e., half the distance from zero to the LoD), values above the LoD but below the LLoQ were imputed as 1.7 log<sub>10</sub> copies/ml (i.e., half the distance from the LoD to the LLoQ), and values above the ULoQ were imputed as 8 log<sub>10</sub> copies/ml if a numerical value was not available.</p>

Spearman correlations evaluated associations between total symptom scores and NP and AN RNA levels. Wilcoxon tests and chi-square tests were used to evaluate NP and AN RNA levels and symptom scores between subgroups. The rates of decline of NP and AN virus after study entry were quantified in separate models using Monolix 2020 (Lixoft, Antony, France).
