                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Increases in life expectancy from antiretroviral therapy (ART) may influence future health and wealth among people living with HIV (PLWH). What remains unknown is how PLWH in care perceive the benefits of ART adherence, particularly in terms of improving health and wealth in the short and long-term at the individual, household, and structural levels. Understanding future-oriented attitudes towards ART may help policymakers tailor care and treatment programs with both short and long-term-term health benefits in mind, to improve HIV-related outcomes for PLWH.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">In this qualitative study, we conducted semi-structured interviews among a subsample of 40 PLWH in care at a clinic in Uganda participating in a randomized clinical trial for treatment adherence in Uganda (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT03494777). Interviews were transcribed verbatim and translated from Luganda into English. Two co-authors independently reviewed transcripts, developed a detailed codebook, achieved 93% agreement on double-coded interviews, and analyzed data using inductive and deductive content analysis. Applying the social-ecological framework at the individual, household, and structural levels, we examined how PLWH perceived health and wealth-related benefits to ART.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">Our findings revealed several benefits of ART expressed by PLWH, going beyond the short-term health benefits to also include long-term economic benefits. Such benefits largely focused on the ability of PLWH to live longer and be physically and mentally healthy, while also fulfilling responsibilities at the individual level pertaining to <italic>themselves</italic> (especially in terms of positive long-term habits and motivation to work harder), at the household level pertaining to <italic>others</italic> (such as improved relations with family and friends), and at the structural level pertaining to <italic>society</italic> (in terms of reduced stigma, increased comfort in disclosure, and higher levels of civic responsibility).</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p id="Par4">PLWH consider short and long-term health benefits of ART. Programming designed to shape ART uptake and increase adherence should emphasize the broader benefits of ART at various levels. Having such benefits directly integrated into the design of clinic-based HIV interventions can be useful especially for PLWH who face competing interests to increase medication adherence. These benefits can ultimately help providers and policymakers better understand PLWH’s decision-making as it relates to improving ART-related outcomes.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="Par5">Globally, almost 25.4 million people are now accessing lifesaving antiretroviral therapy (ART) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Increased access to ART has been shown to improve the health, quality of life, and life expectancy of people living with HIV (PLWH) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, maximizing the benefits from ART—such as delayed HIV-related symptoms—depends on optimal retention in care and continued adherence to treatment over time (also called ART persistence). Poor adherence, such as missing doses, could increase a person’s viral load and the risk for transmitting HIV. Data from clinic-based adult populations in sub-Saharan Africa suggests than 21–44% of ART clients have poor adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In Uganda, less than half of clinic-based adult PLWH on ART achieve 85% adherence to their ART medication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], even though 93% of eligible adults receive ART and 82% of PLWH have suppressed viral loads [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Few studies have examined adherence among those clinic-based adult PLWH who have been on treatment over the long term [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Sustained engagement in HIV care and adherence to ART is largely determined by long-term individual behavior, as well as issues at the household and structural levels (especially those influenced by economic, institutional, political factors) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par6">Evidence from the HIV and public health literatures indicate that there are various demand and supply-related reasons for ART initiation and continued adherence—these include socio-demographic and socio-economic characteristics, existing health status, affective factors (such as fear of stigma, depression), social support, as well as institutional and health system barriers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. While these factors help understand how ART adherence is shaped, it is equally important to understand how long-term factors can be leveraged to promote ART investment and sustain present-day ART adherence. One way to do this is to consider how such treatment provides benefits in the future. Evidence from the economics literature shows that declining mortality and increased life expectancy shape future-oriented behavior and affect economic choices and human capital investments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The availability of an HIV treatment that increases life expectancy by an average of 18 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] could potentially alter how individuals consider health-related risk-taking and information-seeking, and wealth-related investment decisions. Highlighting the perceived benefits of ART adherence in the short and long-term, especially how it affects both health and wealth can be a promising approach to expand ART use.</p>
              <p id="Par7">Prior literature has extensively reported on how existing attitudes and perceptions of ART determine adherence among PLWH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In addition, structural, and institutional barriers such as lack of privacy and confidentiality, maltreatment by healthcare workers, and stigma-related factors influence health behaviors of PLWH as well. ART availability may also influence long-term behavior to improve clinical outcomes. HIV literature in this space does not explicitly discuss the role of continued ART adherence in improving these outcomes, nor does it explicitly discuss the economic benefits of being physically healthy after taking ART, but these studies provide useful context to better understand how PLWH perceive benefits in this space and may change their behavior across the HIV care continuum. For example, when ART was made available in Kenya, female PLWH reported a 70% increase in pregnancies and 35% increase in self-reported sexual behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. These estimates suggest that availability of ART treatment can change health behaviors, but exactly how and why individuals change their behaviors is not well understood. A study from Malawi found that improved ART availability decreased individuals’ self-reported mortality risk as measured by their life expectancy, but also increased labor supply, and future-oriented expenses in their children in the form of their education and clothing expenses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. There is also some evidence from South Africa suggesting that increased knowledge about ART-related life expectancy gains had an effect on human capital investments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par8">In terms of the kinds of other broader benefits that ART confers especially on long-term factors such as wealth, increased access may also offer some financial benefits to households by reducing out of pocket spending on medical care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] or allow for continued employment and higher earnings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. These studies demonstrate this increase in wealth by focusing on how ART reduces a variety of health care and non-health care costs (such as burial expenses or opportunity cost of time attending funerals) or reduces anxiety and stress, which may in-turn increase household income. However, despite this strand of evidence, what remains unexplored are the broader benefits of ART reported by PLWH, especially in the qualitative literature. Investigating such factors may help understand short and long-term benefits of ART. Understanding how individuals perceive benefits of ART use on other domains such as wealth can help promote expansion of, and investment in ART.</p>
              <p id="Par9">In this qualitative study, we explored the perceived benefits of ART adherence on health and wealth at the individual, household, and structural levels. We interviewed adult PLWH at an HIV clinic in Kampala, Uganda where the waiting area had visible reminders and cues about the positive influence of ART (Appendix B)—these cues initially served as motivation for exploring our research question more rigorously using one-on-one interviews with PLWH in care. The results from this study can guide policymakers and researchers alike—they can be especially useful since broadening the focus of HIV care and treatment programs to not just the short-term health benefits but also the long-term effects on other domains can be helpful to tailor interventions and improve HIV-related outcomes.</p>

This two-year trial is testing the efficacy of using small lottery incentives to support ART adherence for treatment-mature PLWH in care, eventually enrolling 320 participants.</p>
                <p id="Par12">The participants in these semi-structured interviews (as those for BEST) were all patients at Mildmay Uganda, a clinic in Kampala, Uganda that has a longstanding research collaboration with local partners (as well as the BEST study team). Mildmay is a non-governmental organization in Kampala, Uganda that specializes in the provision of free comprehensive HIV/AIDS prevention, care, and treatment services through outpatient and inpatient care for over 15,000 patients. They were recruited into the RCT and were all 18 years of age or older, receiving ART at the participating clinic for 2 or more years, and had demonstrated recent adherence problems within six months of being recruited based on clinical records (defined as showing lack of viral suppression, being sent to adherence counseling, or at disease stage 3 or 4 as per WHO guidelines). Individuals were excluded if they were not mentally fit enough to provide informed consent, spoke neither English nor Luganda (the local language), were participating in any other adherence-related study, were inconsistently using the trial-issued Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS) cap to monitor adherence. The target sample size for this study was 40 PLWH in care as this was sufficient to achieve saturation, and these individuals enrolled in the parent RCT prior to the baseline survey (and before treatment assignment in BEST). The qualitative sample was chosen via a convenience sample of 40 PLWH in care who enrolled in BEST, and none of the participants who had enrolled in BEST declined to participate in the qualitative study. Specifically, when reviewing the initial round of transcripts, we noticed similar emerging themes cited by participants across the short and long-term benefits of ART. These themes did not improve the explanation of existing themes or add any new ones. This practice follows recommendations from the literature which suggest operationalizing saturation and devising stopping criteria for the number of interviews in which no new themes are identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Additionally, some literature cites this as a range of 25–30 in-depth, semi-structured interviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p>

                <title>Recruitment</title>
                <p id="Par13">We used Mildmay’s electronic medical record system to identify eligible participants. Once identified in the clinic database, the study team took note of the subsequent recruitment opportunity based on their next available date of appointment. The study coordinators then looked out for individuals due for a visit that day and approached all eligible participants in-person and inquired whether s/he was interested in participating in an ongoing study. Respondents were assured they would not lose their spot in the queue for any clinic services. Those individuals that initially agreed were taken to a separate study room to verify eligibility, and the survey objective and procedures were explained. Once the participant gave written informed consent to participate in the RCT, s/he was given a MEMS cap to monitor real-time adherence and instructed to store their HIV medication in a pill bottle with the MEMS-cap attached. All participants who had chosen to be enrolled in the RCT agreed to be part of this individual semi-structured qualitative interview. The qualitative interview was then conducted with only the participant and interviewer present in the room, and the participant was compensated USh 20,000 (equivalent to US $5) as a form of transport reimbursement for their time.</p>

                <title>Data collection</title>
                <p id="Par14">A team of one male and one female trained qualitative researchers (co-authors LL and PW) conducted semi-structured interviews in English and/or the local language Luganda at the preference of the participant, with interviews typically lasting 30–40 min. The interviewers (one male, one female) had undergone an extensive 30-h qualitative interview training (led by co-authors US and SM) and had previously conducted other qualitative and quantitative studies with PLWH, especially those with ART adherence challenges. The interview guide (Appendix C) focused on understanding the determinants of ART adherence, as well as the effects of ART adherence on health, life expectancy, and wealth. Prior to interviews with any study participants, the data collection team piloted the interview guide among themselves and other team members to ensure use of appropriate language and local context cues. Open-ended questions focused on the key facilitators and challenges in taking ART, how ART affected health currently and in the future, and whether taking ART as prescribed would also influence wealth and life expectancy.</p>
                <p id="Par15">All interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and translated from Luganda into English, and stored on a secure data portal. To ensure confidentiality, we separated personal identification information from the response data, and respondents were only identified through their clinic ID. Approximately 20% of the participant interviews were re-transcribed by an additional team member for quality control and re-evaluated against the original transcript to ensure consistency. The transcripts were then entered into Dedoose software. Transcripts were not returned to participants for comment and/or correction.</p>
                <p id="Par16">The interview team met regularly with two co-authors (US and SM) over the course of three weeks to discuss feedback on how participants described the effects of ART adherence on health and wealth. The team also discussed any problems that came up relating to interviewing goals and techniques. Troubleshooting involved improving the style of interviewer probing especially when they encountered issues such as when respondents said there was nothing stopping them from taking medications and did not report any barriers to taking ART. Interviewers were instructed to probe participants further on these points since they were eligible for the parent RCT (and then this this qualitative study) precisely due to their exhibited adherence-related problems (and should in theory report barriers to taking ART which resulted in adherence-related problems in the first place). Another issue raised was that of translating certain words into the local language, Luganda – for example, the words “health” and “lifestyle” are often interchangeable. As a result, when asked about the effects of ART on one’s health, many respondents provided responses focused on their life goals (e.g., job, home, family etc.) rather than discussing immediate health-related impacts.</p>
                <p id="Par17">Demographic and adherence data on 38 of the 40 PLWH in care were obtained from a follow-up baseline interview in October 2018-January 2019. In 2 cases (5% of overall sample), demographic data were not obtained due to non-participation in the follow-up baseline interview. At this stage, these participants had MEMS-recorded adherence that was less than 30%, which made them ineligible to continue in the parent study. Participants were typically eligible for their baseline interview three months after the pre-baseline visit when the qualitative interviews were conducted. These quantitative data collected at the follow-up baseline interview included age, sex, level of education, marital status, WHO HIV infection stage, employment status, MEMS-measured adherence, and whether participant currently had undetectable viral load (to act as a proxy for the biological response to ART). These data were used as participant descriptors and if relevant, to gauge qualitative differences across groups of participants (e.g., by sex, infection stage etc.).</p>

                <title>Theoretical framework</title>
                <p id="Par18">To thematically categorize data in terms of participants’ attitudes and expectations of future outcomes from ART adherence, we relied on health behavior change frameworks that incorporated behavioral learning theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. In the case of our study sample, we sought to understand how PLWH perceived the benefits of ART adherence in the short and long-term, especially how factors at the social ecological levels shaped how they evaluated their own pill-taking behavior, and especially how individual-level factors could be influenced by structural factors too [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The social-ecological model has been extensively studied and used to understand how factors with various domains determine health behavior such as ART adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par19">In this study, we hoped to better understand the extent to which factors at the individual, household, and structural levels influenced how PLWH perceived the benefits of ART. The individual level identified intrapersonal influences including the experiences and attitudes towards the long-term impacts of ART adherence, while the household level examined interpersonal factors incorporating social dynamics with family and friends; the structural factors included the larger political and cultural context and includes beliefs such as stigma and fatalism, and beliefs about disclosure to family and friends that may influence individuals’ ability to assess the effects of ART on health and wealth.</p>

                <title>Analysis</title>
                <p id="Par20">We used a combination of inductive and deductive content analysis to categorize data based on emergent themes as well as previously structured hypotheses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. We repeatedly read the 40 transcripts to become familiar with the data managed in Dedoose, and coded the data based on recurring key issues and themes. We developed a structured coding framework based on a close assessment of all transcripts that included themes as well as content descriptions, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and sample quotes. Additional codes were created based on reading the transcripts. The coders double-coded eight interviews separately to reach a total of 130 excerpts, after which 30 were randomly picked using a random number generator, and each coder blind-coded them. This resulted in 93% agreement, after which one coder (US) continued coding the remaining interviews. These coders met biweekly thereafter to identify any emerging themes and discuss any questions or concerns. Once all coding was completed, one coder (US) read the excerpts per code application and extracted selected quotes per theme, and then reviewed all coded excerpts and wrote a summary of results. We grouped themes at the levels of the social ecological model and examined the effects of ART use on respondents’ health and wealth. As a final step, we extracted quotations to illustrate common themes or responses among PLWH in care. Each quotation was labeled with the individual’s sex and WHO HIV stage.</p>

                <p id="Par22">We identified several factors pertaining to the perceived effects of ART on health and wealth at individual, household, and structural levels that are described in further detail below. Structural influences operate due to the existing individual/intrapersonal and household/intrapersonal relationships. Some structural factors are more removed from individual control than others, and they may still be inter-connected given the nature of the socio-ecological framework and how these factors affect behavior change.

                  <p id="Par54">Male respondents also mentioned how taking ART mitigated the negative influence of family and friends. Respondents reported reduced engagement in risky behavior such as unprotected sex and substance abuse. Interestingly, none of the female respondents cited these factors.<disp-quote><p id="Par55"><italic>“What might stop me from living long is maybe going back to something like adultery; I used to take alcohol but its good when you are taking medicine. I also used to take cigarettes and I left it when they told me it wasn’t good for the medication, they told me too to eat well and also (be more mindful of) God because I allowed Him to enter my life. I thank God that He has keep live for long.”- Male, Stage 3</italic></p><p id="Par56"><italic>“You do not have to go out with girls without protection because even if you take medicine you can still get infected with other diseases that can kill you.

                  <p id="Par57">One respondent suggested that reduced engagement in risky behavior translated to savings because he avoided risky activities that he would have otherwise engaged in had he not been taking his medication.<disp-quote><p id="Par58"><italic>“It helps me because a lot of boys I live with as for them, he can spend his money and goes for women but as for me I do not usually do that because I am keeping my money because I know my life depends on the medication because the medication does not interact with alcohol.” – Male, Stage 2</italic></p></disp-quote></p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par89">We conducted a cross-sectional qualitative study among clinic enrolled Ugandan PLWH and examined the kinds of benefits they experienced in terms of their health and wealth. Our findings outline the contexts PLWH face when thinking about the broad benefits of ART to their lives, especially their attitudes and expectations of future outcomes resulting from ART. In our study, such benefits included those at the individual, household, and structural levels, and largely focused on their ability to live longer and be physically and mentally healthy, while also fulfilling responsibilities pertaining to themselves (in terms of positive long-term habits and motivation to work harder), others (such as improved relations with family and friends), and society (in terms of improved civic responsibility). Even though the study population was entirely made up of PLWH in care who had documented adherence problems (as evidenced by inclusion criteria for the parent RCT), we observed that respondents in this study perceived these various benefits of ART.</p>
              <p id="Par90">At the individual level, respondents described the health-related benefits of ART in terms of physical health improvements and lack of illness, as well as adoption of positive long-term habits over their longer lifespan. Respondents felt they had more control of their health and well-being because of adhering to ART. Wealth-related benefits included increased financial earnings and increased personal motivation to work harder. Prior research has quantitatively examined how increases in life expectancy stemming from ART can encourage forward-looking behavior because individuals are aware of their lowered mortality risk and subsequently make different life decisions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. These studies have sought to examine how PLWH respond to taking ART and change their patterns of risk-taking, information-seeking, and monetary investments in children (especially in education and clothing) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. The qualitative findings from our study substantiate and contextualize some of these changes reported elsewhere; respondents on ART believe they will have a longer life with HIV and they can see direct benefits to themselves in terms of both their health and personal wealth.</p>
              <p id="Par91">At the household level, respondents highlighted benefits of ART on health and wealth, such as increased ability to do routine things, plan for their future and have a higher income potential. Female respondents especially described how ART helped them to better plan for their future and raise children who are not HIV positive, while also earning money to meet the needs of their families. This finding corroborates evidence from other studies describing that adherence to ART changes the context of childbearing for PLWH, specifically since having children indicates that PLWH are leading a healthy adult life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. A meta-analysis found that the prevalence for fertility desires was 42% among PLWH, and this was higher among male PLWH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Our qualitative findings in this clinic-enrolled sample of PLWH show that females were more likely to describe these ART-related benefits. This could indicate that counseling and reproductive health care be provided to female PLWH who generally would feel a greater sense of responsibility to their families. Male respondents on the other hand described the importance of ART in helping to reduce risky behavior such as unprotected sex and substance abuse. Such behaviors are well established risk factors for poor HIV care outcomes, especially in terms of facilitating testing uptake, engagement and retention in care, and ART use and adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Evidence from Kenya and Uganda has shown that alcohol use especially among men was associated with decreased ART use, mostly due to poor engagement and retention in care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Our qualitative findings among male respondents suggest that future ART support interventions may benefit from being more tailored to those with low or medium level alcohol use. As care models of ART delivery branch out of the clinic, adherence support interventions should take advantage of such tailored messaging to incentivize PLWH who could possibly benefit from changes to their benefits and enhance the benefits they derive from ART.</p>
              <p id="Par92">At the structural level, many respondents described the link of ART with comfort in HIV status disclosure, lowered stigma, and increased civic responsibility, as well as increase in appreciation for health care workers at the clinic. Our qualitative findings are in line with related evidence which describes how ART can reduce internalized stigma in Uganda and even hasten disclosure due to improved coping mechanisms and social support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. All respondents highlighted the link with employment and ability to increase their earnings if they continued taking their ART. Some of these findings are consistent with studies highlighting the important role of employment in ART adherence. This literature describes the supportive role of employment among PLWH because it is associated with improved adherence; these studies normally describe the factors that determine adherence since financial constraints are a key barrier to ART adherence. A systematic review of ART adherence and employment status described how employed PLWH were 27% more likely to adhere to ART than their unemployed counterparts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Our findings corroborate other studies also reporting that benefits described by our study respondents (e.g. improved wealth, employment etc.) are associated with movement along the HIV care continuum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Respondents who cite these benefits will be more likely to engage in continued care and improved adherence.</p>
              <p id="Par93">One major implication of our findings is that despite knowing about the broad short and long-term benefits of ART, PLWH in care who were part of this study still had challenges in terms of adherence. Literature has discussed various reasons for this, especially among those who have been on ART for several years. PLWH in care may fail to take their pills regularly due to treatment fatigue and waning motivation from engaging in routine pill-taking behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Behavioral biases such as present bias—where individuals give in to current temptations and forego future benefits—contribute to suboptimal behavioral such as lowered adherence rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Additional reasons may include not having sufficient education and counseling on ART and possibly not having a lifestyle suitable to continuous pill taking (e.g. living far away from ART refill clinics, experiencing stigma etc.) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Our study findings underscore those from elsewhere that describe how PLWH taking ART for long periods of time fall in and out of adherence. In the case of our study population, they do so despite knowing about the various benefits of ART.</p>
              <p id="Par94">Our study was subject to several limitations; while there were some observable differences in themes across male and female respondents, we were not able to assess if benefits varied based on access, availability, or quality of education, jobs, or other factors related to the benefits described by respondents. While the sample size was large enough to reach saturation, this difference especially between sub-groups may be possible to assess with a larger qualitative sample. Our findings may also differ with a study sample that was not enrolled in a study seeking to improve adherence among low adherers—these individuals may already believe that ART improves health. The ordering of the questions (starting with health, describing effects on life expectancy, and then finally wealth) may have followed a natural order, but perhaps responses would be slightly different if the order were switched. Each participant was also interviewed only once, and had they been interviewed at the end of the 2-year parent study, we could assess if their perspectives had changed, and collected data on whether they experienced first-hand any of the benefits they described. While not exactly a limitation, the study findings point to the discrepancy between participants perceiving the benefits of ART to their health and wealth, yet not adhering to their medication (which is why they are enrolled in a treatment adherence RCT). This could be due to a desirability bias where they may not internalize the messages about ART, or they may be subject to short-term structural and behavioral barriers (such as behavioral biases) that prevent them from fully realizing the benefits they mentioned in the qualitative findings.</p>
              <p id="Par95">Strengths of this study include the fact that we included individuals on long-term ART with recent adherence problems in a clinical setting and investigated the benefits of ART in two distinct domains within their lives: health and wealth. This subject has previously not been studied extensively in literature using qualitative methods and can help understand how PLWH perceive these benefits.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p id="Par96">When recounting the contributions of ART in their lives, PLWH do not simply consider the short-term health benefits, but also the longer-term implications on other domains. This is evident from the findings of this qualitative study. Our study findings can be useful as testimonials for promoting ART expansion, as well as for future programming meant to target these areas as they can help understand how or why PLWH in care perceive certain benefits, especially those that are accrued in the long-term. This is especially germane for those PLWH in care who face adherence problems such as our study population. Our study findings can be used to better promote the expansion of ART and help donors understand the broader benefits of ART (especially the non-health related factors for PLWH in care). We provide contextualized evidence on broader social and economic evidence pertaining to ART. As described by participants, improvements in health via ART can affect future health and income by making individuals more productive (e.g., being able to attend school and get the requisite skills, attain better social networks etc.). Interventions can be designed with these benefits in mind for individuals who don’t specifically recognize such benefits (e.g., treatment initiators who may benefit from knowing about additional reasons to continue to take their medication). Such interventions can specifically use short and long-term individual-level factors to drive improvements in uptake (e.g., by focusing on how at the individual and household levels, ART helps PLWH encourage healthier habits, or helps to increase income, which can ultimately benefit their families).</p>
              <p id="Par97">Findings at the household and structural levels can be useful to clinic staff such as providers or counselors who are encouraging PLWH to sustain ART use. Evidence from other parts of SSA such as in South Africa suggests the need to incorporate this kind of evidence for treatment adherence—in that context, individuals discontinued ART because they were uncertain about its value and overall benefit in their lives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Having benefits that focus on structural factors – such as counseling for their future or resources on ways to get involved helping their communities – directly integrated into the design of interventions can be useful especially in a context when PLWH face so many competing interests to increase medication adherence. These benefits can ultimately help providers and policymakers improve ART-related outcomes. Further research is warranted to determine how these benefits differ across groups of PLWH, especially those with varying levels of access to ART, retention, or linkage to care in HIV care programs, or other sociodemographic factors. Additional research can also examine whether these ART benefits can result in changes in behavior such as increased human capital investments.</p>
