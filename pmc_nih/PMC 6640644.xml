              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="P5">West Nile virus (WNV) is a neurotropic flavivirus that cycles between mosquitoes and birds but can also infect humans and other vertebrate animals. WNV was first identified in the Western hemisphere in 1999 as a cluster of viral encephalitis cases in New York City [ <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> ]. Since then, WNV has spread rapidly west across the continental United States [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Among persons infected with WNV, the majority have subclinical infection, approximately 25% develop West Nile fever, and about 1 in 200 develops neuroinvasive disease, with manifestations including encephalitis, meningitis, and flaccid paralysis [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Neuroinvasive disease, more common among older adults, is associated with a case-fatality rate of approximately 10% [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Survivors often experience long-term neurological dysfunction [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and may be at additional risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. From 1999 through 2017, a total of 48,183 cases of WNV disease have been reported in the United States, including 22,999 cases of neuroinvasive disease and 2163 deaths [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p>
              <p id="P6">At present, there is no human vaccine available for WNV infection. However, since the introduction of WNV into the United States in 1999, significant research efforts have been expended to create a viable vaccine for disease prevention in humans [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. These efforts include live, attenuated chimeric vaccines [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], DNA vectored vaccines [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], recombinant subunit vaccines [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], and a variety of protein vaccines including chemically inactivated whole virus [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>–<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and virus-like particles [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p>
              <p id="P7">As an alternative to traditional formaldehyde-based vaccines, a novel hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) inactivation approach has been developed to produce a first-generation whole-virus vaccine against WNV that was tested at concentrations ranging from 1 to 40 mcg/dose [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>–<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Preliminary studies explored the use of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-based inactivation of wild-type NY99 WNV for vaccine development, with vaccine antigen able to elicit robust neutralizing antibody responses in amice and protect against lethal challenge [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Further studies using WNV-Kunjin virus (WNV-KV), a naturally attenuated Lineage 1 WNV strain, expanded on these preliminary results [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Both young and aged mice immunized with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-inactivated WNV-KV, formulated with aluminum hydroxide, demonstrated robust antiviral B and T cell immunity and protection in a stringent intracranial challenge model using a heterologous North American WNV strain [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. A scaled manufacturing approach for production was established and clinical-grade vaccine, termed HydroVax-001 WNV, was produced and found to be stable, safe and immunogenic in three animal species [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In light of these promising results, HydroVax-001 WNV, a 3% hydrogen peroxide-inactivated, whole virion (WNV-Kunjin strain) vaccine, was administered as a two-dose intramuscular (IM) vaccine scheduled at a 28-day interval to assess safety and immunogenicity in humans. Based on pre-clinical data described above and studies of other inactivated alum-adsorbed flavivirus vaccines, the antigen doses evaluated were 1 mcg and 4 mcg.</p>

                <p id="P8">We enrolled healthy men and non-pregnant women aged 18 through 49 years in this prospective, placebo-controlled, observer-blind, dose-escalating, Phase 1 clinical vaccine trial. The study was conducted at Duke University after review and approval by the Duke University Health System Institutional Review Board. Included subjects were required to be seronegative to West Nile virus. Subjects of childbearing potential were also required to have a negative pregnancy test on the date of screening and prior to each dose administration. For a complete listing of subject inclusion and exclusion criteria refer to <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov">clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>: <ext-link ext-link-type="ClinicalTrials.gov" xlink:href="NCT02337868">NCT02337868</ext-link>.</p>
                <p id="P9">Following a dose escalation design, the vaccine dose increased between groups from 1 mcg HydroVax-001 (group 1) to 4 mcg HydroVax-001 (group 2). In each group, 20 subjects received vaccine and a total of 10 subjects received placebo. Within each dosing group subjects were randomized 4:1 to receive either HydroVax-001 or placebo as a two dose series delivered intramuscularly on days 1 and 29. Subjects were followed to day 365 for safety and to assess vaccine immunogenicity.</p>

                <p id="P10">The HydroVax-001 vaccine is a West Nile virus-Kunjin strain, Vero cell tissue culture-derived, purified whole virion vaccine inactivated with 3% hydrogen peroxide. HydroVax-001 drug product contains 4 mcg purified whole virion WNV formulated in a volume of 0.5 mL/dose with 0.1% aluminum hydroxide and 2% sorbitol in phosphate-buffered saline [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Sodium Chloride Injection USP 0.9% as a sterile, nonpyrogenic, isotonic solution was used as the vaccine diluent and the placebo. The vaccine and the normal saline placebo/diluent were shipped and stored refrigerated at 2–8 °C. During storage, HydroVax-001 vials were kept in a lightproof container.</p>

At the time the preclinical toxicology study was performed, a 6 mcg/0.5 mL “high dose” and a 1 mcg/0.5 mL “low dose” vaccine formulation was planned for this Phase I clinical trial. However, based on further preclinical tests [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], a lower dose of the vaccine test article (4 mcg/0.5 mL) was selected as the “high dose”, to be compared with a 1 mcg/0.5 mL “low” dose.</p>

However, within dose groups, subjects, investigators, and study staff other than unblinded site research pharmacists and unblinded research nurse vaccinators were blinded as to the subject’s treatment assignment (vaccine vs. placebo). An unblinded site research pharmacist prepared the study product and an unblinded research nurse performed an IM injection of the study product into the deltoid per the randomization assignment. The pharmacist concealed the contents of the syringe by wrapping the syringe barrel with an opaque tape or other equivalent material. In addition, the subject was instructed to look away when the vaccine was administered. The unblinded site research pharmacist and unblinded research nurse were not involved in study-related assessments nor did they have subject contact for data collection following study vaccine administration. Laboratory personnel performing antibody assays were blinded to dose group and treatment assignment.</p>

                  <p id="P14">Safety outcomes included both solicited and unsolicited adverse events (AEs) experienced by healthy adult volunteers after vaccination with HydroVax-001 vaccine or administration of normal saline placebo.</p>
                  <p id="P15">Solicited reactogenicity events were those adverse events known to typically occur following the administration of an inactivated vaccine. To be conservative, the reactogenicity adverse events were collected on participant-completed memory aids for 14 days following each vaccination visit. Participants were also requested to measure their temperature at the same time each day or if they felt feverish and record the highest temperature for that day for 14 days following each vaccination. In addition, oral temperature, pulse and blood pressure were measured at screening, prior to each vaccination, and on day 4 and day 15 post each vaccination and performed at other study visits if clinically indicated. These events were collected in a standard, systematic format using a graded scale based on functional assessment or magnitude of reaction.</p>
                  <p id="P16">All unsolicited, non-serious AEs were documented from Study Visit 01 (day 1) through Study Visit 08 (day 57 post second vaccination). Serious AEs (SAEs) were documented from Study Visit 01 (day 1) through Study Visit 10 (day 365 post second vaccination). All SAEs were followed until resolution even if this extended beyond the study-reporting period. Resolution of an adverse event was defined as the return to pre-treatment status or stabilization of the condition with the expectation that it will remain chronic. Unsolicited AEs were assessed for relationship to study product (not related, related).</p>

Serum samples were aspirated and monolayers overlaid with 3 mL of 0.5% agar in 1X EMEM supplemented with 2.5% FBS, 2 mM L -glutamine and 1 × penicillin/streptomycin, returned to 37 °C/5%CO<sub>2</sub> and incubated for 2 days. Wells were overlaid with 1 mL of 0.015% neutral red in 1% agar, with plaques enumerated the following day. Each experiment included a medium-only plate, as well as a virus-only plate with approximately 50 plaque forming units (PFU) per well.

                    <p id="P20">The <italic>a priori</italic> immunogenicity objectives included assessing WNV-specific plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT<sub>50</sub>) responses 29 days after a first dose and 57 days after a second dose of HydroVax-001 WNV vaccine given at doses of 1 mcg and 4 mcg. A complement-enhanced PRNT<sub>50</sub> was later included in the study. PRNT<sub>50</sub> assays were conducted as previously described [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Complement-enhanced PRNT50 assays were performed similar to prior descriptions [<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] using human C1q (50 mcg/mL, Complement Technology, Inc, Tyler, TX). Seroconversion was defined as a 4-fold or greater increase in neutralizing antibody titer from baseline (prior to first vaccination). Geometric mean PRNT<sub>50</sub> titers were determined at days 15 and 29 after first vaccination and at days 15, 29, 57, 180, and 365 days after the second vaccination. The limit of detection in the neutralizing assay is a titer of &lt;10. For the purposes of determining seroconversion rates and GMT, antibody titers of &lt;10 have been assumed to be 5 (one dilution step below the assay limit of detection). Therefore, seroconversion is defined as a postvaccination titer of ≥20.</p>

                    <p id="P21">The protocol was amended to include an exploratory immunogenicity objective to assess WNV-specific ELISA responses. For the ELISA analyses, this assay is performed by testing serial dilutions of serum for reactivity against WNV in an ELISA format as previously described [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The values reported represent the reciprocal of the last serum dilution in which a sample scored positive in the assay. The exact values are calculated via regression analysis (serum dilution vs. ELISA signal). All serum dilutions were started at a 1:30 serum dilution.</p>
                    <p id="P22">Based on previous experience with the assay and human serum samples, a conservative “limit of detection” cut-off of 200 ELISA units was utilized. This cut-off has been used in previous studies for a range of other viruses [<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. If a subject’s baseline ELISA value was &lt;200 and their follow-up visit ELISA value was &gt;200, this was considered seroconversion. Alternatively, for subjects with a baseline ELISA value &gt;200, the subject needed to demonstrate a fourfold rise at follow-up for seroconversion.</p>

                  <p id="P36">All subjects enrolled were seronegative at baseline as determined by the PRNT<sub>50</sub> assay. At the 1 mcg dose, Hydrovax-001 did not elicit PRNT50 seroconversion following either the first or the second dose of Hydrovax-001 (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> for PP and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Table 5</xref> for modified ITT Population). As expected, none of the participants in the placebo group seroconverted to WNV during the course of the study (data not shown). At the 4 mcg dose, Hydrovax-001 did not induce neutralizing antibody titers following a single dose, but reached 31% seroconversion within 15 days after a second dose of vaccine in the PP population with antibody responses waning at days 180 and 365 post Dose 2 (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Results in the modified ITT analysis were similar with a slightly lower seroconversion rate of 28% reported at days 15 and 29 post Dose 2 (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Table 5</xref>).</p>
                  <p id="P37">The complement-enhanced PRNT<sub>50</sub> seroresponses paralleled the PRNT<sub>50</sub>. For the 1 mcg dose of Hydrovax-001, neutralizing antibody responses were below the limit of detection (<xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) and seroconversion was not observed among any placebo recipients (data not shown). Following a single 4 mcg dose in the PP population, one subject (6%) seroconverted at days 15 and 29 and 15 days following a second dose of vaccine, seroconversion rates increased to 50% before declining thereafter (<xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Results from the modified ITT analysis were slightly lower, reaching a peak seroconversion rate of 44% at 15 days following the second dose and declining to 12–19% at later time points (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Table 6</xref>).</p>
                  <p id="P38">As expected, baseline GMTs as assessed by both the PRNT<sub>50</sub> and complement-enhanced PRNT<sub>50</sub> were negative. Though limited in magnitude, a non-significant rise in GMT in the HydroVax-001 1 mcg group was observed at day 29 post Dose 2, but only with the PRNT50 assay and not the complement-enhanced PRNT<sub>50</sub> assay. Significant increases in GMTs in the HydroVax-001 4 mcg group, as detected by both assays, occurred at days 15 and 29 post Dose 2 but returned close to baseline by day 57 post Dose 2 (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Tables 2</xref> and <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">3</xref>).

At the 1 mcg dose, Hydro-Vax-001 induced seroconversion in 18% of subjects at day 15 following a first dose increasing to 41% of the subjects responding by 15 days following a second dose. At the 4 mcg dose, Hydro- Vax-001 induced seroconversion in 13% of subjects at day 29 following a first dose and this increased to 75% of subjects seroconverting by day 29 following a second dose before declining thereafter with kinetics similar to the PRNT<sub>50</sub> assays.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="P40">This Phase 1 dose escalation study of HydroVax-001 demonstrated that HydroVax-001 was safe and well tolerated as there were no concerning safety signals. At the 1 mcg dose, HydroVax- 001 was not immunogenic by PRNT<sub>50</sub> seroconversion but we observed up to 41% seroconversion based on WNV-specific ELISA. At the 4 mcg dose, HydroVax-001 was modestly immunogenic following a second dose of vaccine with 31% to 50% seroconversion identified by standard PRNT<sub>50</sub> or by a complement-enhanced PRNT50, respectively. Seroconversion at the 4 mcg dose reached a peak of 75% among the per-protocol population by WNV-specific ELISA before declining substantially at later time points.</p>
              <p id="P41">Previous studies have demonstrated the role of complement in the development of protective WNV antibody responses and demonstrated that addition of complement enhances neutralization activity [<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Overall, the complement-enhanced PRNT<sub>50</sub> seroresponses paralleled the PRNT<sub>50</sub> responses and at the 4 mcg dose, HydroVax-001 WNV vaccination was more immunogenic by complement-enhanced PRNT<sub>50</sub> ( 50% seroconversion) compared to standard PRNT<sub>50</sub> assays (31% seroconversion) among the PP population.</p>
              <p id="P42">In additional exploratory analyses, seroresponses were assessed using a WNV-specific ELISA assay. Exploratory immunogenicity results assessed by ELISA were more robust than those as assessed by PRNT<sub>50</sub> and the complement-enhanced PRNT<sub>50</sub> assays. At the 1 mcg dose, HydroVax-001 induced a seroresponse in 18% of PP subjects at day 15 following a first dose with up to 41% responding by day 15 following a second dose. At the 4 mcg dose, HydroVax-001 induced a seroresponse in 13% of subjects at day 29 following a first dose with up to 75% of subjects seroconverting by day 29 following a second dose before declining thereafter.</p>
              <p id="P43">Although a number of preclinical WNV vaccine approaches have been developed, few have proceeded to human clinical trials [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. A 3-dose WNV DNA vaccine, administered at 4 mg per dose, resulted in an average PRNT<sub>50</sub> = 50 (range 16–128) one month after the third immunization [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Two chimeric live-attenuated vaccines, based on either dengue serotype 4 (rWN/DEN4Δ30) or YFV-17D (ChimeriVax-WN) backbones expressing WNV prM/Env proteins, have been tested in humans [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The rWN/DEN4Δ30 vaccine demonstrated primary seroconversion rates of 55–75% depending on the vaccine dosage and geometric mean neutralizing antibody titers that peaked between 28 and 42 days after vaccination before declining to PRNT<sub>60</sub> = 15–76 by 180 days after vaccination [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Booster vaccination at day 180 increased seroconversion rates to 89%, although geometric mean PRNT<sub>60</sub> levels reached a peak of only 57 (range, 17–134). The live-attenuated ChimeriVax-WN vaccine induced a robust antiviral antibody response with &gt;96% seroconversion, but by 12 months postvaccination the PRNT50 levels had declined to 58 for subjects between 41 and 64 years of age (PRNT<sub>50</sub>= 116 for all subjects). It is unclear how long antiviral immunity after ChimeriVax-WN might be maintained [<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p>
              <p id="P44">Inactivated whole virus vaccines remain an important class of vaccine candidates for WNV prevention. The first licensed veterinary WNV vaccine was based on this approach, using a formalin-inactivated crude viral harvest of WNV-NY99, formulated with a squalene-based adjuvant, to induce protective immunity in horses as well as other animal models [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], and additional studies have provided evidence of efficacy for formalin-inactivation as a potential WNV vaccine [<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. From a clinical perspective, one concern for these formalin-inactivated WNV vaccine candidates is that they are based on pathogenic strains of WNV. The use of highly pathogenic strains of virus for inactivated vaccines creates logistical issues associated with the as a potential WNV vaccine [<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. From a clinical perspective, one concern for these formalin-inactivated WNV vaccine candidates is that they are handling of BSL3 pathogens during large-scale cGMP manufacturing, in addition to safety concerns if complete inactivation is not achieved. As an alternative to traditional formaldehyde-based vaccines, this novel hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) inactivation approach has been developed to produce a first-generation whole-virus vaccine against WNV [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>–<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] using a naturally attenuated (BSL2) Kunjin strain of West Nile virus (WNV-KV). Hence, there are potential advantages with respect to vaccine manufacturing and vaccine safety.</p>
              <p id="P45">Similar to our clinical study, other groups using inactivated whole virus vaccines have found it challenging to elicit durable neutralizing antibody responses against WNV [<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In a Phase I/II dose escalation study involving 320 subjects, WNV-specific neutralizing antibody titers were low after primary vaccination but appeared to increase to geometric mean titers of between 50 and 75 by day 56 (i.e., 28 days after 2nd dose) before declining to near baseline levels by day 180 post-vaccination [<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. A range of vaccine doses (1.25, 2.5, 5, and 10 mcg/dose) was tested and no major improvement in antibody persistence was observed even after vaccination with a maximum dose of 10 mcg of vaccine. At day 180, the investigators performed a third vaccination and this resulted in antibody titers that were greatly improved over the first or second dose of vaccine and suggests that our vaccine approach could likewise be improved if a third dose of vaccine was administered on a similar vaccination schedule. In addition, a recent advance in peroxide-based inactivation technology represents another approach to improving future WNV vaccine design [<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The first published use of 3% peroxide for virus inactivation/vaccine development was described in 2012 [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and several improvements in oxidation-based virus inactivation have been developed since that time. In a recent study [<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], Quintel et al., have developed a site-directed, Fenton-type oxidation approach that leads to more efficient virus inactivation with improved retention of neutralizing epitopes and a greater than 100-fold improvement in vaccine-mediated WNV-specific neutralizing antibody responses in mice. If a similar improvement in immunogenicity is observed in human subjects, then it is possible that higher and potentially more durable antibody responses may be attained. This represents an exciting area for further investigation and may be applicable to not only improved vaccine development against WNV, but may also be suitable for improving vaccines against other clinically important flaviviruses including yellow fever, dengue, and Zika viruses.</p>
