              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="P5">Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) are the most commonly performed bariatric surgery procedures in the United States and worldwide (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Both procedures cause considerable weight loss and a marked improvement in glycemic control in patients who have type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, the results from two recent randomized controlled trials found RYGB surgery was more effective than SG in treating T2D, manifested by a higher rate of diabetes remission (defined as glycated hemoglobin &lt;6.5% or ≤6% without diabetes medications) at 1 year after surgery (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). The mechanism(s) responsible for this observed difference in therapeutic efficacy between procedures is unclear, because weight loss was greater after RYGB than SG, which could have been responsible for the differences in diabetes remission between groups. In addition, it is not clear whether weight loss induced by RYGB and SG has the same or different effects on metabolic function, because of conflicting results from different studies, which found the improvement in insulin sensitivity after surgery-induced weight loss was greater after RYGB than SG (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), greater after SG than RYGB (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), or the same after both procedures (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p>
              <p id="P6">The primary aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that RYGB surgery causes a greater improvement in skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity than does SG after the same amount of marked weight loss. The secondary aim was to evaluate the effect of RYGB and SG on β-cell function and the metabolic response to the ingestion of a mixed meal. Obese, insulin-resistant subjects were studied before RYGB or SG surgery and after they lost the same large amount (∼20%) of their body weight to avoid the confounding effect of differences in weight loss between surgical procedures on our metabolic outcome measures.</p>

                <title>Study subjects</title>
                <p id="P7">Fourteen consecutive eligible patients who were scheduled to undergo SG (n=7; 1 man, 6 women, 37±10 yrs old) or RYGB (n=7; 2 men, 5 women; 40±7 yrs old) procedures at Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St. Louis, MO participated in this study, after they provided written informed consent. Some of the subjects in the RYGB group also participated in a study that was published previously (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). All subjects were required to have evidence of insulin resistance, based on the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) score &gt;3.0 (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), but those who had diabetes were excluded to avoid the confounding effects of differences in baseline glycemic control, glucose toxicity, and post-surgical changes in diabetes medications on our outcome measures. The study was approved by the Washington University Institutional Review Board.</p>

                  <p id="P9">Subjects were admitted to the Clinical Research Unit (CRU) and consumed a standard evening meal (12 kcal/kg FFM; 50% of calories as carbohydrate, 30% as fat and 20% as protein). The following morning, a catheter was inserted into a forearm vein for infusion and a second catheter was inserted into a radial artery to obtain blood samples. At 0600 h, a primed-continuous infusion of [6,6-<sup>2</sup>H<sub>2</sub>]glucose (priming dose: 22 μmol/kg; infusion rate: 0.22 μmol/kg/min) was started and maintained until the end of the study. At 0930 h, insulin was infused at a rate of 50 mU·m<sup>2</sup>·min<sup>-1</sup> for 4 hours. Euglycemia (plasma glucose ∼100 mg/dl) was maintained by infusing 20% dextrose enriched to 2.5% with [6,6-<sup>2</sup>H<sub>2</sub>]glucose. Blood samples were obtained immediately before starting the tracer infusion and during the final 30 minutes of the basal period and the clamp procedure to determine plasma substrate and insulin concentrations and glucose tracer-to-tracee ratio (TTR).</p>

After 3.5 h of tracer infusion, subjects ingested a liquid meal (containing 46 g of glucose mixed with 0.9 g of [U-<sup>13</sup>C]glucose, 9 g of fat, and 9 g of protein) which was provided in 7 equally divided aliquots given every 5 minutes over 30 minutes. Blood samples were obtained immediately before starting the glucose tracer infusion, every 10 minutes for 30 minutes just before starting the meal ingestion, and then every 15 minutes for the first hour and every 20 minutes for the subsequent 5 hours after starting the meal, to determine plasma substrate and hormone concentrations, and glucose TTRs.</p>

                  <p id="P11">Bariatric surgeries were performed by using standard laparoscopic approaches. The RYGB procedure involved creating a small (∼20 ml) proximal gastric pouch, a 30 cm biliopancreatic limb and a 100 cm Roux limb. The SG procedure involved dividing the gastrocolic ligament, initiating the gastrectomy 6 cm proximal to the pylorus along the greater curve, and creating the sleeve along the lesser curve over a 40 French Bougie.</p>

                  <p id="P12">A supervised dietary weight loss program was instituted to help subjects in both groups consume a similar energy-deficit diet and achieve a 20% weight loss within 4-6 months after surgery. All subjects were instructed to consume a no-added-sugar liquid diet (400-600 kcal/day) for the first week after surgery, a pureed diet (2-3 oz/meal providing 700-800 kcal/day) for weeks 2-3, a soft diet (3-4 oz/meal providing 800-1000 cal/day) for weeks 4-5, followed by a regular-food diet containing 1000-1200 kcal/day and 1.0 g of protein/kg body weight per day. After subjects achieved a 20% weight loss, a balanced weight maintenance diet was prescribed, and subjects maintained a stable body weight (&lt;2% change) for at least 2 weeks before repeat studies were performed.</p>

Endogenous glucose production (EGP) was determined by subtracting exogenous glucose infusion rate (from 20% dextrose) from total Ra. Glucose rate of disappearance (Rd) from plasma was equal to endogenous glucose Ra plus the rate of exogenously infused dextrose and glucose tracer. Insulin-stimulated glucose disposal, primarily in skeletal muscle, was used as an index of insulin sensitivity.</p>

                <p id="P16">Data were examined for normality according to the Shapiro-Wilks criteria. A two-way repeated measures analysis of variance with Tukey's post-hoc test was used to compare the effects of SG and RYGB surgeries on study outcome measures (except for postprandial metabolic outcomes). A mixed model repeated measures analysis of variance was used to evaluate differences between SG and RYGB groups in weight loss-induced changes in postprandial metabolic outcomes. A p-value of ≤0.05 was considered statistically significant. All data are presented as means±SD for normally distributed data or means and 95% confidence intervals for log-transformed data, unless otherwise noted.</p>

This proposed difference between groups is a conservative estimate based on the results from the only previous study that compared the effect of SG versus RYGB on glucose Rd by using the HEC procedure, which found more than a 250% greater increase in insulin-stimulated glucose Rd after SG than after RYGB (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p>

Meal ingestion caused a marked suppression of EGP, so that EGP accounted for less than 10%, while ingested glucose accounted for more than 90%, of postprandial total glucose Ra (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="P23">This study was conducted to evaluate whether marked (∼20%) weight loss induced by RYGB has greater therapeutic effects on metabolic function than the same weight loss induced by SG in obese people without T2D. Our findings indicate that RYGB and SG cause similar improvements in both whole body (primarily skeletal muscle) insulin sensitivity, assessed by using the HEC procedure and stable isotopically labeled tracer infusion, and β-cell function, assessed as the relationship between insulin sensitivity and the insulin response to mixed meal ingestion. Both RYGB and SG caused similar changes in postprandial glucose metabolism, manifested by a more rapid delivery of ingested glucose into the systemic circulation, and greater early postprandial suppression of EGP with a more rapid return of EGP toward baseline. These results demonstrate that despite the anatomical differences between RYGB and SG, weight loss induced by both procedures results in rapid glucose absorption and similar improvements in the two major factors involved in regulating glucose homeostasis, namely insulin sensitivity and β-cell function.</p>
              <p id="P24">The results from our study do not help explain the potential mechanism(s) responsible for the greater rate of diabetes remission observed after RYGB than SG (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). In our subjects, weight loss induced by either RYGB or SG caused the same improvement in two of the major factors involved in the pathogenesis of T2D, i.e. insulin sensitivity and β-cell function. Our results are consistent with those from a previous study, conducted in both diabetic and non-diabetic obese subjects, which found similar improvements in HOMA-IR score after either RYGB or SG (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). In contrast, two other studies conducted in subjects with T2D found conflicting results; insulin sensitivity assessed by applying a mathematical model (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) to data from a mixed meal tolerance test improved more after RYGB than SG in one study (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), whereas insulin sensitivity assessed by using the HEC procedure improved more after SG than RYGB in the other (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). In the former study, Kashyap and colleagues found β-cell function, assessed by the response to a mixed meal, increased to a much greater extent after RYGB than SG despite similar weight loss in both groups (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). The reason for the differences in results among studies is not clear, but could be related to differences in study population and experimental techniques used to assess metabolic function. These discrepant results underscore the need for additional mechanistic studies in patients with T2D.</p>
              <p id="P25">Our study has several important limitations. First, we might have missed statistically significant differences between groups in some of our outcome measures, because of the small number of subjects who participated in our study. However, the marked improvement in insulin sensitivity, our primary study outcome, was nearly identical after both RYGB and SG, making it unlikely that that we missed a clinically important effect. Second, our study was conducted in subjects who did not have T2D, so our results might not necessarily apply to patients with T2D. Nonetheless, our data have important physiological implications in understanding the effect of RYGB and SG surgeries on metabolic outcomes.</p>
              <p id="P26">In conclusion, the results from the present study provide additional insights into the effects of marked weight loss induced by RYGB and SG-induced weight loss on insulin sensitivity and the metabolic response to a mixed meal in obese, insulin-resistant people. Our data demonstrate potent, but similar, beneficial effects of weight loss, induced by either surgical procedure, on whole-body insulin sensitivity, β-cell function, and the metabolic response to a mixed meal. Additional studies conducted in patients with T2D are needed to determine whether the observations made in non-diabetic subjects in this study can be extrapolated to people with T2D.</p>

                  <p>The mechanism(s) responsible for the observed difference in therapeutic efficacy between RYGB and SG procedures is not known. This is the first study to evaluate the major mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes, namely insulin sensitivity, β-cell function, and the metabolic response to a mixed meal, in obese subjects after the same, marked RYGB and SG induced weight loss.</p>

                  <p>Our data demonstrate potent, but similar, beneficial effects after both RYGB and SG procedures on whole-body insulin sensitivity (assessed by using the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp procedure in conjunction with stable isotopically labeled tracer infusion), β-cell function, and the metabolic response to a mixed meal in subjects matched for weight loss.</p>

                  <p>The results from the present study provide new insights into the effects of RYGB and SG induced weight loss on insulin sensitivity, β-cell function beta and the metabolic response to meal ingestion in obese, insulin-resistant people.</p>
