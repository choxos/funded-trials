                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Once antibiotic-resistant bacteria become established within the gut microbiota, they can cause infections in the host and be transmitted to other people and the environment. Currently, there are no effective modalities for decreasing or preventing colonization by antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Intestinal microbiota restoration can prevent <italic>Clostridioides difficile</italic> infection (CDI) recurrences. Another potential application of microbiota restoration is suppression of non-<italic>C. difficile</italic> multidrug-resistant bacteria and overall decrease in the abundance of antibiotic resistance genes (the resistome) within the gut microbiota. This study characterizes the effects of RBX2660, a microbiota-based investigational therapeutic, on the composition and abundance of the gut microbiota and resistome, as well as multidrug-resistant organism carriage, after delivery to patients suffering from recurrent CDI.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">An open-label, multi-center clinical trial in 11 centers in the USA for the safety and efficacy of RBX2660 on recurrent CDI was conducted. Fecal specimens from 29 of these subjects with recurrent CDI who received either one (<italic>N</italic> = 16) or two doses of RBX2660 (<italic>N</italic> = 13) were analyzed secondarily. Stool samples were collected prior to and at intervals up to 6 months post-therapy and analyzed in three ways: (1) 16S rRNA gene sequencing for microbiota taxonomic composition, (2) whole metagenome shotgun sequencing for functional pathways and antibiotic resistome content, and (3) selective and differential bacterial culturing followed by isolate genome sequencing to longitudinally track multidrug-resistant organisms.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">Successful prevention of CDI recurrence with RBX2660 correlated with taxonomic convergence of patient microbiota to the donor microbiota as measured by weighted UniFrac distance. RBX2660 dramatically reduced the abundance of antibiotic-resistant Enterobacteriaceae in the 2 months after administration. Fecal antibiotic resistance gene carriage decreased in direct relationship to the degree to which donor microbiota engrafted.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p id="Par4">Microbiota-based therapeutics reduce resistance gene abundance and resistant organisms in the recipient gut microbiome. This approach could potentially reduce the risk of infections caused by resistant organisms within the patient and the transfer of resistance genes or pathogens to others.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par19">Antibiotic-resistant (AR) infections account for billions of dollars in healthcare costs and tens of thousands of deaths every year in the USA alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Infections caused by antibiotic-resistant organisms (AROs) are even more devastating because of dwindling therapeutic options. Increasing global usage of antibiotics raises the abundance and prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and AROs both within an individual and the environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Even when appropriately delivered, antibiotics disrupt the commensal gut microbiota, select for antibiotic resistance, and decrease colonization resistance to AROs and opportunistic pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Therefore, development and implementation of antibiotic-sparing alternatives is imperative to limit the sequelae of increased AR worldwide.</p>
              <p id="Par20">Antibiotic treatment increases the risk of <italic>Clostridioides difficile</italic> infection (CDI) by decreasing colonization resistance mediated by commensal organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Currently, CDI is primarily treated with orally bioavailable antibiotics such as vancomycin or metronidazole, which further contributes to microbiome disruption, AR infections, and risk for recurrent CDI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Furthermore, antibiotic treatment with metronidazole and vancomycin increases the carriage of AROs such as vancomycin-resistant <italic>Enterococci</italic> (VRE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Increased gastrointestinal carriage of VRE in the context of <italic>C. difficile</italic> colitis can predispose patients to VRE bacteremia with 2.5-fold increased mortality relative to vancomycin-sensitive <italic>Enterococci</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Thus, development of antibiotic-sparing treatments to restore gut microbiota composition, enhance colonization resistance, and limit increasing antibiotic resistance is warranted.</p>
              <p id="Par21">Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a technique whereby donor stool from healthy individuals is delivered into the gastrointestinal tract of a recipient patient. FMT is rapidly gaining recognition as a mostly safe and highly effective treatment for preventing recurrent CDI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], and analogous investigational microbiota-based therapeutics are under evaluation in controlled clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Additionally, these approaches have the potential to restore other aspects of a disrupted gut microbiome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Indeed, previous studies have demonstrated taxonomic changes to the gut microbiota via 16S rRNA gene sequencing after FMT for recurrent CDI commensurate with an increase in gut microbial diversity, a marker of microbiota health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. While some patients respond well to a single FMT, some require repeat FMTs to prevent CDI recurrence, and it is accordingly important to be able to predict engraftment success [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. It was recently shown that probability of bacterial species engraftment after FMT was related to the taxonomic abundance of each species in the donor and in the recipient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Some studies also suggest that there may be a reduction in carriage of ARGs and selected AROs such as VRE after FMT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. It is therefore theoretically possible to utilize FMT or similar investigational treatments with a high abundance of non-resistant species to displace AROs from the recipient’s microbiome. Accordingly, we sought to investigate the abundance of AROs and ARGs in patients treated with RBX2660—a microbiota-based investigational therapeutic for alleviation of recurrent CDI.</p>
              <p id="Par22">RBX2660, a liquid suspension of donor microbiota screened for bacterial, viral, and parasitic pathogens, including methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant <italic>Enterococci</italic> (VRE), and extended-spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL) -expressing <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic>, has recently been deployed to treat recurrent CDI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Here we examine the effects of this treatment on the recipient’s microbiome, ARG prevalence within the gut, and the fates of patient-derived ARO isolates over the course of a 12-week phase II clinical trial, and up to 180 days post-therapy. We found that patients who adopt a more donor-like microbiota composition, determined by weighted UniFrac distance 7 days after RBX2660, were more likely to be CDI recurrence-free during the 180-day observation period. We tracked ARO abundance in the recipient’s stool after initial therapy via longitudinal strain tracking of amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) based on the 16S rRNA gene sequences of cultured isolates. We utilized whole metagenome shotgun sequencing and ARG prediction using ShortBRED to quantify ARGs in the recipient, which we find is correlated with weighted UniFrac distance from the donor. Taken together, these data show that in addition to CDI treatment, RBX2660, and potentially FMT in general, can be used to reduce overall ARG abundance and ARO carriage in a recipient’s microbiome.</p>

                <p id="Par23">Fecal samples in this study were derived from a phase 2 prospective open-label cohort study administering the microbiota-based restoration therapeutic RBX2660 to patients with recurrent CDI (NCT01925417). Safety and efficacy analysis of this trial has been published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], and the study protocol is detailed there and reproduced here (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S1). The first patient was enrolled on August 15, 2013, and the last was enrolled on December 16, 2013. Forty patients were recruited at 11 study sites within the USA. For inclusion, patients 18 years or older had at least two rounds of standard-of-care oral antibiotic therapy with at least two recurrences or hospitalizations for CDI. They also had to take or start oral antibiotics for CDI symptoms including at least 7 days of oral vancomycin. Exclusion criteria included medical diagnoses and procedures that could rationally impact the gut microbiome including uncontrolled diarrhea after CDI treatment, concurrent antibiotic therapy for an illness other than CDI, or history of inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, chronic diarrhea, or celiac disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Patients with compromised immune systems including steroid use, neutropenia, chemotherapy, or a life expectancy less than 12 months were also excluded. The primary outcome was incidence of serious adverse events through 56 days after the last treatment. Secondary outcomes included incidence of serious adverse events 6 months after the last treatment, absence of CDI 56 days after the last dose, quality of life score, and hospitalization data after RBX2660. Prior to administration of the study drug, all patients were given at least 7 days of oral vancomycin (125 mg four times per day) followed by RBX2660 via enema from one of 21 samples from four healthy donors. Of the 34 patients that passed screening, 29 succeeded in submitting longitudinal fecal samples suitable for microbiome analysis. If a patient had a recurrence of CDI symptoms, they were offered a second dose of RBX2660. The study population was 97% white and 67.6% female and had a mean age of 68 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p>

Samples were collected at home by patients and immediately shipped on ice (4 °C) in dedicated sterile, airtight containers via FedEx. The stool samples were divided into 500-mg aliquots that were placed at − 80 °C immediately upon receipt by Rebiotix, Inc. Samples were shipped from Rebiotix, Inc. on dry ice (− 20 °C) to Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri.

                <title>DNA extraction and sequencing</title>
                <p id="Par26">Fecal DNA was extracted from 0.25 g of stool via phenol-chloroform extraction as follows. Stool was combined with 250 μL of 0.1 mm zirconium beads, 500 μL of 200 mM NaCl/200 mM Tris/20 mM EDTA solution, 210 μL of 20% SDS buffer, and 500 μL 24:25:1 phenol to chloroform to IAA (pH 7.9) while on ice. This mixture was homogenized via bead beating for 4 min and then centrifuged at 4 °C for 3 min at 6800rcf. The aqueous supernatant was transferred to pre-spun lock-phase PLG columns (5Prime, #2302820), an equivalent volume of phenol to chloroform to IAA was added, and the tube was inverted and then centrifuged at max speed (20,800 rcf) for 5 min. The aqueous phase was transferred to a clean tube with 600 μL of cold isopropanol and 60 μL of 3 M NaOAc (pH 5.5), mixed, and incubated at − 20 °C overnight. The resultant precipitate was pelleted by centrifugation at 20,800 rcf at 4 °C for 20 min. The supernatant was decanted, and the pellet was washed by adding 500 μL of 100% EtOH at 25 °C, centrifuging at 20,800 rcf at 4 °C for 3 min. The ethanol was pipetted off, and the pellet was air-dried for 15 min in dark, sterile conditions. Finally, the pellet was resuspended in 50 μL of TE buffer (Ambien #9861) while incubating at 30 °C for 5 to 15 min. The resulting DNA was processed with QIAQuick PCR purification column (QIAGEN #28106) with 4 μL of 100 mg/mL RNase added to 300 μL of Buffer PB at step 1 and incubated with the resuspended DNA for 2 min at room temperature.</p>
                <p id="Par27">The 16S rRNA gene was amplified from fecal DNA as follows: 1.5 ng of fecal DNA was used as template for PCR reactions using 5PRIME HotMasterMix (Quantabio #22000401) with universal 16S rRNA gene primers 515F (5′-GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA) and 806R (5′-GGACTACHVHHHTWTCTAAT). An 8-bp barcode unique to each sample was designated, and each reaction was run in triplicate with a negative (no template) control. The amplicons were run on a 1% TAE agarose gel with SYBRsafe DNA stain and gel-purified with Qiagen Gel Purification Kit (#28115). Eluted amplicons were quantified with PicoGreen dsDNA (ThermoFisher #P7581), pooled, and purified with Agencourt AMPure XP bead purification protocol per the manufacturer’s instructions (Beckman Coulter #A63881). The pool was loaded at 8 pM concentration with 25% PhiX and sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq platform with 2 × 150 bp paired end reads.</p>
                <p id="Par28">For whole metagenome shotgun sequencing, 130 μL containing at least 500 ng of genomic DNA was sonicated (Covaris E220 model) into 500–600-bp fragments at 4 °C for 75 s, at intensity 4, duty cycle 10%, and 200 cycles per burst. Fragmented DNA was concentrated into 63 μL volume using the QIAQuick PCR Purification kit (Qiagen). End repair was performed using 0.5 μL of three enzymes: T4 ligase (NEB #M0203S), Taq polymerase (NEB #M0267S), and T4 PNK (NEB #M0201S), with 1 μL of 1 mM dNTPs and 2.5 μL of T4 buffer with 10 mM ATP (NEB #B0202S). The end-repaired genomic fragments were barcoded by incubating the DNA mixture with 0.8 μL of T4 DNA ligase and a unique sequencing barcode at 25 °C for 10 min. Samples were then pooled by column of the 96-well plate, purified by QiaQuick PCR purification kit, and eluted in 15 μL of EB. Gel purification was similar to 16S rRNA gene sequencing but for all fragments from 400 to 900 bp in length, and final elution volume was 12 μL. Finally, 2 μL of each of the shotgun fragment pools was amplified using 1 μL of 10 μM Illumina nonspecific primers using 2X Phusion HF Master Mix and water up to 25 μL total reaction volume with the following cycling conditions: 17× for 30 s each of 98 °C, 65 °C, and 72 °C with a 5 min 72 °C final extension and hold at 4 °C. The product was then quantified by QuBit and pooled at equal concentrations. Purified libraries were then prepared for sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq platform with paired end reads of 2 × 150 bp. Metagenomic shotgun sequencing samples were re-sequenced if the associated barcodes appeared in fewer than 1M reads [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].

                <p id="Par29">In order to determine the fates of specific AR bacterial strains, each fecal sample was plated on selective and differential media as described below. Frozen samples were thawed once before DNA extraction in order to aliquot 1 mL for culture. Stool was incubated for 2 h in Tryptic Soy Broth at 35 °C, and two drops of the stool/broth mixture were streaked onto each of the following plates: Sheep’s Blood Agar (SBA) (BD 22161), VRE ChromeID (Biomerieux 43851), MacConkey with Cefotaxime (Hardy G121), CHROME ESBL (Hardy G321), Hardy Cetrimide Agar (Hardy G18), and MRSA Spectra Agar (Remel 01822).

                <p id="Par35">A multi-center trial of RBX2660 for recurrent CDI was conducted in 2013. Forty individuals were consented, and 31 patients completed the 6-month trial (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Two patients had insufficient sampling frequency and were therefore excluded from our analysis leaving 29 individuals whose time courses of CDI symptoms, RBX2660 administration, and antibiotic receipt are shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. Twelve patients did not experience a CDI recurrence after a single dose of the study drug (single intervention or SI group) while 17 experienced a recurrence between day 7 and day 60. The 17 patients with recurrent CDI received a repeat intervention with antibiotics and/or repeat RBX2660 (RI group; Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> Patient ID red text; median 15 days post initial RBX2660). Participants who received a second dose of RBX2660 were not necessarily pre-treated with antibiotics before as per study protocol (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. We first longitudinally determined the taxonomic composition of the gut microbiota after the first dose of RBX2660 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, left panel). We used 16S rRNA gene sequencing analyzed via DADA2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] and computed weighted UniFrac distance from donor (DFD), which serves as a metric of engraftment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. After the first study treatment, the microbiota DFD shows a decreasing trend over time after treatment indicative of increased similarity with donor microbiota composition, but this differed by eventual treatment outcome (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). At time 0, there was no difference in median DFD between patients who responded to a single dose (SI) and those who received a repeat intervention (RI) for recurrent CDI (<italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05, Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test). However, at day 7 after the first study treatment, microbiota DFD was significantly higher for individuals who eventually received repeat intervention after day 7 for recurrent CDI (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b, median 0.31 vs. 0.22, Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). The adoption of similar microbiota profiles to the donors by day 7 after the first study treatment is therefore significantly predictive of engraftment success of the initial therapy during the observation period. Although DFD appears to decrease for the RI group at day 60 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a), this observation is only based on the 4/17 individuals yet to experience CDI recurrence. These data demonstrate that in successful first treatments, the overall patient microbiota profile shifts quickly to resemble the donors after the study treatment. However, convergence is never absolute for these patients during the length of the study, with a mean DFD of 0.179 at 180 days after the first study treatment (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). This degree of engraftment is consistent with what has been reported previously for FMTs in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par36">We further investigated the impact of the microbiota-derived restoration therapy on the patient fecal microbiota using whole metagenomic shotgun sequencing with both taxonomic and functional profiling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Each of the four donors contributed 2–8 samples for a total of 21 individual donor samples (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S2). The donor microbiota was dominated by Firmicutes, which is expected in healthy US adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], whereas the recipient microbiota prior to RBX2660 had increased abundance of Proteobacteria, which is a hallmark of antibiotic-disrupted microbiota [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S2). To explore this data, principle component analysis was performed. The PCAs in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a and b were visualized for successful engraftments only (SI group), which revealed distinct microbiota communities between the donors and recipients at day 0 (as notated by nonoverlapping 95% confidence ellipses; Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a), but not thereafter. We next determined microbiome-wide functional pathways for the SI group as inferred using HUMAnN2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b). Similar to taxonomic composition, PCA of the diverse functional pathways found in these patients with successful treatments were significantly different (nonoverlapping 95% confidence ellipses; Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b) from those of the healthy donors only at the baseline timepoint. We also utilized Linear Discriminant Analysis with LEfSe to identify discriminatory features at 7 days indicative of receiving further intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>] (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S3). This analysis identified microbial pathways for membrane and biosynthetic processes were enriched in responders after the first dose. Individuals requiring re-intervention (RI group) had microbial functions enriched for flagella, pathogenesis, and ion binding. For a clearer picture of the changing trajectories over time, each of the HUMAnN2 pathways was plotted separately with each of the day 0 and day 7 pairs (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S4). These have been grouped by direction of change after treatment (i.e., whether a particular treatment group was enriched or depleted for a specific pathway after treatment). It is thus possible that certain microbial functions are restored after initial treatment (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S4), but patients still suffer CDI recurrence. Therefore, likelihood of successful treatment by RBX2660 is correlated with taxonomic and functional convergence to a more donor-like conformation.

                <p id="Par37">To identify the specific microbial taxa correlated with treatment outcome, we utilized PCA to visualize differences in 16S rRNA gene-based taxonomic composition, as inferred by DADA2, between recipient day 7 samples stratified by eventual outcome as well as donor samples for comparison (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c). The output from DADA2 is amplicon sequence variants (ASVs), which may differ by as few as 1 nucleotide and have been shown to improve specificity and sensitivity of organism identification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. The ASVs were numbered in order of overall prevalence within all samples for clarity. At day 7, patients who subsequently received a repeat intervention of either antibiotics or repeat RBX2660 therapy, the RI group, showed a significantly different taxonomic composition compared to either the SI group (Adonis, <italic>p</italic> = 0.028) or the donors (Adonis, <italic>p</italic> = 0.001) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c). The taxa identified by PCA driving the difference between the centroid positions included 25 ASVs above 5% importance and 11 above 10% importance (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d). The taxonomy-labeled vectors influence the samples on Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c away from the origin in the direction indicated, so vectors pointing in the direction of the centroid of the donor represent important donor taxa, vectors in the direction of the SI group identify important features of success after initial therapy, and vectors pointing towards the centroid of the RI group identify features correlated with requiring additional treatment. In this PCA analysis of taxa at 7 days, the genera <italic>Blautia</italic> and <italic>Roseburia</italic> were most representative of the donors and success after initial therapy (SI), and ASVs representing members of the genera <italic>Escherichia</italic>/<italic>Shigella</italic>, <italic>Klebsiella</italic>, and <italic>Pluralibacter</italic> were most associated with likelihood of requiring repeat intervention (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d). Three separate ASVs from the <italic>Akkermansia</italic> genus provided a large portion of the variation, and in some severely perturbed samples at day 0 and 7, <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> ASV 2 exceeded 40% of the entire microbial composition (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S5). After day 30, however, <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> ASV 2 often maintained a stable abundance of &lt; 25% in the SI group, while abundance in the RI group was highly variable after re-intervention (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S5B). Replication of the PCA through phyloseq’s dpcoa function again showed <italic>Akkermansia</italic> contributing variation but not correlating with treatment outcome (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S6). Of note, <italic>C. difficile</italic> was not among the top indicators. Its corresponding ASV as well as <italic>C. difficile</italic> toxin genes, detected through custom ShortBRED markers (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S7A), were &lt; 2% relative abundance in any sample and did not correlate with treatment outcome (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S7B).</p>
                <p id="Par38">Based on the findings from our PCA analysis, we temporally characterized the relative abundance of these 11 most discriminatory ASVs over time after the first treatment for the SI group (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). For subjects who did not have CDI recurrence (the SI group), donor ASVs including <italic>Roseburia</italic> ASV7, <italic>Blautia</italic> ASVs 1 and 3, and <italic>Anaerostipes</italic> ASV8 were notably absent in day 0 specimens (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). By day 7, these taxa increased in relative abundance, and by the end of the trial at day 180, their abundance was similar to the donor microbiome. Conversely, ASVs corresponding to Enterobacteriaceae, <italic>Escherichia</italic>, <italic>Akkermansia</italic>, and <italic>Klebsiella</italic> were abundant at time 0 for the recipients with their abundance declining over time. Thus, the taxa associated with a successful first RBX2660 treatment (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d) begin to change relative abundance at 7 days after the first dose with continued adoption of a more donor-like conformation over the subsequent 180 days. At 30 days after the first study drug, 14/17 of the RI group had already suffered a CDI recurrence and received either a second FMT or antibiotics (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Thus, we cannot investigate whether the relative abundance differences at timepoints later than 7 days would also be associated with success. However, given the trends in relative abundance changes, it is likely that further adoption of a donor-like conformation would also be associated with success (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). We have identified several taxa at 7 days after RBX2660 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d) whose presence and relative abundance changes during the first 180 days are associated with limiting CDI recurrence.

ASVs corresponding to each cultured ARO (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a–e) were tracked over time after first study drug (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>f–j). The relative abundance of the ASVs plotted in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>f–j represent multiple related strains with identical 16S rRNA sequences, which demonstrably contain all of the cultured AROs but can also represent susceptible sub-populations. However, with one exception, all of these ASVs were absent in the donors by both culture and metagenomics, allowing them to reliably measure the trajectory of the patient-associated ASVs. The ASV corresponding to the cultured <italic>E. coli</italic> isolates was found in one donor, and it was identified metagenomically in one donor (donor 1-1-DP) at 0.1% abundance. Accordingly, the two patients (patient IDs A2 and A26) receiving that product were not considered for eradication analysis for that ASV because we cannot distinguish between donor-derived <italic>E. coli</italic> and recipient-derived <italic>E. coli</italic>. Given the recent FDA alert of resistant <italic>E. coli</italic> infections after receipt of FMT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>], we confirmed that neither of these patients developed invasive infections from this organism. Excluding the donor-origin ARO and matched recipients, each other recipient sample that cultured an ARO was also positive by metagenomic sequencing, validating this mapping technique. Culture, however, detected AROs from these species in only 26/111 (23.4%) of the instances where that ASV was identified in the metagenomes. This may reflect differences in isolate viability in the stored fecal samples since dead cells will yield positive DNA-based detection. Alternatively, this may also reflect that ASVs for these species include both AROs and antibiotic susceptible forms of these bacteria. Thus, with this approach, the identified ASVs represent an upper-bound for detection of these potential AROs in the metagenomes.</p>
                <p id="Par42">After the first dose of RBX2660, the relative abundance of each isolate-based ASV diminished sharply (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>f–j). For each of these ASVs found in an individual’s earliest sample (<italic>n</italic> = 61 positive/130 total), if that ASV was undetectable in the patient’s last sample, it was considered eradicated. By this metric, 41/61 or 67% of these species were eradicated (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>). During the course of this study, 5 ASVs that were negative in both donors and in the patient’s earliest timepoints later became positive (3 <italic>Enterobacter</italic> ASV 15, 2 <italic>Escherichia</italic> ASV 4). These were considered either undetectably low abundance by metagenomic sequencing or environmentally acquired.</p>
                <p id="Par43">Despite the early decrease that we observed for ASVs corresponding to <italic>Enterococcus</italic>, <italic>Escherichia</italic>, and <italic>Enterobacter</italic>, some patients showed later variable increases in their abundance over time (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>f, g, j). Their respective eradication rates were 7/8 (87%), 9/22 (40%), and 7/10 (70%). However, <italic>Pluralibacter</italic> and <italic>Citrobacte</italic>r both remained at extremely low abundances (&lt; 1% and .02%, respectively) following the initial depletion (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>h, i), with eradication rates of 5/6 (83%) and 7/7 (100%), respectively. Interestingly, despite the trend towards ARO decrease regardless of the outcome of first treatment, we found a significant difference in the relative abundance of both <italic>Escherichia</italic> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>g, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) and <italic>Pluralibacter</italic> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>i, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) ASVs between SI and RI groups at 7 days post-treatment. This finding corroborates the above analyses that sharp decreases in these genera may be associated with success whereas increased abundance at 7 days correlates with likelihood of failure of RBX2660. After 2nd study drug in the RI group, ASVs corresponding to <italic>Escherichia</italic>, <italic>Citrobacter</italic>, and <italic>Enterococcus</italic> did not decrease as dramatically with variable levels thereafter especially for <italic>Escherichia</italic> (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Fig. S8). ASV tracking in metagenomic samples allowed us to quantitatively assess the maximum possible abundance of these potential healthcare-associated infection-causing organisms. Importantly, this method of ASV tracking does not simultaneously measure phenotypic antibiotic resistance. As aforementioned, if patients carried closely related susceptible strains that were not found in the healthy donors, these could inflate the ASV totals. Nevertheless, this apparent rebound effect in ARO abundance that we identified via deeply sequencing isolates is especially important to consider when attempting to eradicate AROs completely from patient microbiomes via donor microbiota transfer. Furthermore, this method of tracking ASVs of predicted AROs in metagenomic samples is sensitive and robust to false negatives, and so it identifies frequent eradication and an overall decrease in AROs after microbiota-restoration therapy. We next proceeded to assess whether overall ARG content and identity decreased concomitantly with decreasing ARO abundance.</p>

                <title>Antibiotic resistance gene abundance decreases over time commensurate with adoption of donor microbiota</title>
                <p id="Par44">We annotated and quantified ARGs in each shotgun metagenome using ShortBRED with ARG markers built from the CARD database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. The most abundant ARG families (as determined by marker count per million reads) corresponding to major antibiotic classes were chosen for representation in Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a. For each gene family, the normalized gene abundance of all samples at timepoint 0 was compared to all samples from successful treatments (SI group) at timepoint 180 and to all donor samples (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a, b). We chose to examine 180 days after intervention because prior research has shown microbiome recovery for healthy adults after antibiotic exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. For vancomycin, where multiple genes are required for functional resistance, the minimal complete cluster had to be present to be counted in this analysis. In every gene family, the abundance at timepoint 0 in patients was significantly different than in donors; and by timepoint 180, the abundance of that gene family in the patient had more closely approached that in the donor (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a, b; pairwise Wilcoxon with Benjamini-Hochberg correction, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). This was not always a decrease over time. Tetracycline resistance genes were most abundant within the donors and were gradually adopted by the recipients (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a). Tetracycline resistance is commonly observed among healthy individuals given the inherent resistance of the most common microbial taxa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. Within the β-lactamases, opposite effects were seen based on the origin of those genes, where AmpC-type β-lactamases were depleted while CblA genes were acquired and enriched (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>b). Altogether, the overall mean abundance of ARGs decreased over time (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>c), but not significantly in those patients requiring a repeated intervention nor after 2nd study drug (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Fig. S9). However, the best predictor of ARG carriage was not time from intervention but microbiota DFD. We observed a negative linear correlation between adoption of donor microbiota conformation as measured by 1-DFD closest to 1 (indicating increased donor similarity) and ARG carriage (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>d). The ARG burden therefore parallels the progress of RBX2660 engraftment as measured by 16S rRNA gene-based distance from donor (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), showing a significant correlation in a linear mixed effects model (LR 17.68587, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001). This overarching correlation holds true regardless of treatment status or origin of the ARGs. However, the strongest decrease was seen in patient-origin ARGs. There was no relationship between donor distance and the ARGs not present in baseline samples or donor (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Fig. S10). The rapidly changing patient microbiota samples had approximately 1 to 2 orders of magnitude greater variation than donor samples taken over the same time frame (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>). We therefore observed a strong ability of the donor microbiota to displace ARGs in the recipient, with the strength of this effect contingent on engraftment of the donor microbiota. Therefore, we have documented the ability of donor microbiota to reduce ARO species and ARG abundance as a collateral benefit of RBX2660 when successfully administered for prevention of recurrent CDI.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par45">Microbiota transplantation has been utilized with great success to prevent recurrent CDI in many different trials and population subsets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>], albeit placebo-controlled clinical trial data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>] are still limited. However, suppression of blooms of <italic>C. difficile</italic> that cause CDI symptoms is not the same as pathogen eradication, nor does it necessarily operate by the same mechanism as would successful eradication or even suppression of ARO abundance. To characterize the effects and influences of this procedure on ARGs and carrier microbes, we have tracked bacterial taxonomic composition, microbial functional pathways, ARO colonization, and ARG abundance within the human gut microbiome for 6 months after the procedure. To aid in discerning directionality of association, we analyzed a cohort with variable engraftment, which can be leveraged as a dose-response relationship between treatment and effects from the gut microbiota. Engraftment of the donor microbiota was determined via 16S rRNA gene sequencing of the patient and donor, and calculation of weighted UniFrac distance from donor (DFD) 7 days after product delivery. Patients with successful RBX2660 treatment were distinguishable from those who required further treatment based on their microbiome taxonomic and functional composition 1 week after treatment (Figs. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, and <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Furthermore, we have identified key taxa associated with CDI treatment outcomes. Specifically, members of the Lachnospiraciae family (<italic>Blautia</italic> spp., <italic>Roseburia</italic>, and <italic>Anaerostipes</italic>) were correlated with success whereas high abundance of Proteobacteria (<italic>Escherichia</italic>, <italic>Klebsiella</italic>, and <italic>Pluralibacter</italic>) at day 7 was associated with the necessity of additional treatment in this cohort (Figs. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).</p>
              <p id="Par46">The taxonomic restructuring was dominated by reduction of <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> initially after therapy (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). These species are known to bloom after use of antibiotics, and their presence in high numbers at baseline is expected in this cohort. Our observation that increased pathways dedicated to flagellin and motility are associated with treatment failure is consistent with the knowledge that Proteobacteria such as <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>Klebsiella</italic> are often flagellated and motile (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S3). In treatment of this dysbiosis, the Enterobacterales give way to Firmicutes, particularly <italic>Lachnospiraciae</italic>. It has been previously demonstrated that <italic>Blautia obeum</italic> expresses bile salt hydrolases that have been shown to suppress <italic>C. difficile</italic> germination in animal models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. Another important player is <italic>Akkermansia muciniphila</italic>, which has been inversely associated with mucosal membrane pathology in multiple gastrointestinal disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. Specifically, <italic>Akkermansia</italic> spp. are important for mucin degradation, and their relative absence is associated with insulin resistance, diabetes, and inflammatory bowel disease in both human cohorts and animal models (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]). In this cohort, healthy donors and patients with successful donor engraftments contain stable lower levels of <italic>Akkermansia muciniphila</italic>, while pre-treatment samples and potentially dysbiotic microbiomes (high microbiota DFD) have widely varying levels. We speculate that in this instance, <italic>Akkermansia</italic> is a surrogate for microbiome health, a hypothesis that would require further validation in other cohorts and models. <italic>C. difficile</italic> itself was not among the microbial taxa with strong associations to CDI symptoms. This could be because sampling often occurred days or weeks apart from reported CDI symptoms (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Restoration of the microbiome to a healthy configuration as quantified by low microbiota DFD is the best microbiome correlate with symptom reduction that we identified. That sporulation was a positive predictor of success is intriguing because it may suggest that colonization resistance to <italic>C. difficile</italic> may be enhanced by other sporulating bacteria, as has been speculated in development of more defined probiotic cocktails for treatment of CDI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. In this sample set of 29 patients, those whose microbiota DFD reduced by less than 20% by day 7 were more likely to require further treatment (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). In support of this, increased abundance of Bacteroidia and Clostridia 7 days after RBX2660 correlated with a recurrence-free interval in a prior study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Thus, our study identifies several taxa correlated with FMT success or failure that can be evaluated in larger, placebo-controlled studies.</p>
              <p id="Par47">The overall convergence of patient microbiomes with donors in both taxonomy and microbial functional pathways was concordant with a competitive mechanism of donor microbial engraftment similar to that identified by Smillie et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Previous literature has demonstrated that the efficacy of FMT on CDI symptoms depends on engraftment efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], and we corroborate that here with this investigational microbiota therapeutic. Another intriguing finding supported by this study is that over the follow-up period after treatment, patients can and do acquire both taxa and ARGs that were not present at baseline or in the donor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In our study, those taxa and ARGs (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Fig. S10) did not show any engraftment completion-related trends, so they behaved differently than either patient or donor origin. These taxa and genes could either be undetectably low at baseline and in the donor, or they could come from the environment. This highlights the potential importance of the patient’s environment after FMT for determining and maintaining a healthy gut microbiota composition.</p>
              <p id="Par48">We hypothesized that microbiota restoration would be accompanied by a decrease in ARO and ARG carriage. This hypothesis was indeed true with greatest impact when the recipient’s microbiota adopted a conformation similar to the donor at 7 days after therapy (Figs. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). This observation underscores the dramatic and immediate restructuring of the microbial ecology of the gut following a successful FMT in all three levels of taxonomy, microbial metabolism, and ARG carriage. In order to better address the impact of the FMT intervention and fates of ARO and ARG thereafter, a placebo group should be included in future studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. Post-FMT microbiota composition is dictated largely by abundance in the donor and recipient. ARG abundance was higher before treatment, and after RBX2660 was directly correlated with DFD. That is, better engraftment of the FMT leads to a more donor-like conformation and reduced ARG abundance. For AROs, we did not observe this universally. We instead found that for VRE and ARO Enterobacteriaceae, relative abundances as high as 40% were reduced by donor product. Thus, outcome of FMT is not exclusively based on taxonomic abundance of either the donor or recipient prior to administration.</p>
              <p id="Par49">The effects of microbiota restoration on AROs is a topic of hope and contention in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. We add to that body of literature ASV tracking of potential AR pathogens and longitudinal relative abundance from well-sampled 16S rRNA gene sequencing, which is among the most sensitive detection methods available. The eradication rate from all cultured ARO taxa (67%) was within the wide range of 37.5–87.5% expected based on FMT for any condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. Between genera of AROs in this study, eradication rates varied from 40% in <italic>Escherichia</italic> to 100% in <italic>Citrobacter.</italic> The slight rebound of relative abundance found in 3/5 of tracked ASVs at 180 days would potentially be undetectable by culture. Yet this rebound could be clinically important, as further antibiotic selection on a patient with incomplete eradication could be riskier than on a patient who has been successfully decolonized. Importantly, while we only cultured ARO <italic>E. coli</italic> from one donor product (compared to 40 other ARO isolates from patients), we did metagenomically detect this ASV in both of the recipients of this donor product. This finding is especially important after two individuals suffered bacteremia from ESBL producing <italic>E. coli</italic> present in donor FMT resulting in the FDA requiring donor screening questionnaires and MDRO testing of donor stool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. This finding highlights the importance of screening donor products for ARO isolates to reduce their risk of acquisition by recipients. Establishing appropriate detection thresholds for bacteria targeted for donation, eradication, and replacement is therefore critically important in these studies.</p>
              <p id="Par50">This study presents taxa and microbial functional pathways that require larger datasets and further validation prior to incorporation into clinical practice. Furthermore, sample storage conditions and freeze-thaw cycles have been shown to decrease certain taxa, especially Bacteroidetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>], which is an inherent limitation of performing microbiome analyses on archived fecal samples. Additionally, this study did not include a placebo group that did not receive FMT in order to characterize the natural history of ARG and ARO decrease after finishing a course of antibiotics. The abundance of ARGs in the gut microbiome was even more clearly responsive to treatment in a strong inverse relationship to engraftment, as measured by DFD. It is reasonable that both shedding and transmission of microbes reduce when they are present at lower abundance in the gut, but the epidemiology of this remains unquantified. The high initial burden of ARGs and AROs in CDI patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], along with growing incidence (and/or reporting) of CDI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>], is an important additional motivation for global surveillance of AR and development of methods to combat its spread. Finally, most microbiome analyses to date have focused on metagenomic sequencing of bacteria in stool samples, but emerging research suggests that viruses, prokaryotes, and small molecules can also meaningfully impact health and disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. Therefore, future studies should consider a multi-omics and multi-kingdom approach to better predict outcomes after FMT to both restore microbiome health and limit ARG and ARO carriage.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p id="Par51">We have demonstrated here that in addition to the important prevention of recurrent CDI, when the donor microbiome optimally engrafts after microbiota-restoration therapy, ARG and ARO abundance in the recipient gut microbiomes substantially decrease. Abundance of ASVs corresponding to species that are potentially multidrug resistant in baseline samples was immediately reduced and often to undetectable levels, but a late rebound for some patients indicates incomplete eradication. Further studies are needed to quantify epidemiological benefits such as decreased transmission to other people and the environment. Thus, RBX2660 and microbial therapeutics in general represent an effective method to alter the gut community composition together with all its metabolic and potentially pathologic attributes. The abundance of ARGs and AROs can potentially be lastingly reduced with this method, making it a promising tool in combating the global threat of antibiotic resistance.</p>

If the first sample (notated as Patient ID – Dose number – Days from previous dose) was positive according to the ASV quantified by DADA2 and the last sample from the same patient was negative, the status for that ASV is shown as negative. Acquired means it was first negative (in both patient and donor) and later positive, absent means all samples were negative, masked means the donor was positive, and insufficient samples means the first and last sample were the same.</p>
