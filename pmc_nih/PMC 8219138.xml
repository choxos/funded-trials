Modifiable risk factors offer an opportunity to intervene, and targeting hypertension is a key actionable target for stroke risk reduction in sub-Saharan Africa. This 3-site planned randomized controlled trial builds on promising preliminary data.</p>

                  <p>A total of 246 Ugandan adults will be recruited randomized to experimental intervention vs. enhanced treatment control. Intervention participants will receive six weekly group-format stroke risk reduction self-management training sessions, and the controls will receive information on cardiovascular risk. The primary study outcome is systolic B.P. measured at baseline, 13-week, 24 weeks (6 months). Secondary outcomes include other biological and behavioral stroke risk factors.</p>

              <p>Chronic non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are increasing globally, with a disproportionate burden on low-middle income countries (LMICs). Approximately 80% of NCD deaths occur in developing countries, with nearly a third of the deaths occurring in those aged less than 60 years compared to 13% in high-income countries [<xref rid="pone.0251662.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Stroke contributes substantially to NCD-related disability and is attributed to 16.8% of deaths in LMICs, compared with 13.2% of deaths in high-income countries [<xref rid="pone.0251662.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p>
              <p>In Uganda, stroke burden is growing and affecting relatively young individuals where it is a severely neglected condition [<xref rid="pone.0251662.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0251662.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], despite accounting for 15% of hospital admissions and is a major contributor to mortality [<xref rid="pone.0251662.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0251662.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Risk factors for stroke, which were once rare in traditional African societies, are becoming a major public health problem [<xref rid="pone.0251662.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The adaptation of western cultural behaviors such as sedentary lifestyle, tobacco and alcohol use, high fatty, and salty diets all contribute to stroke risk [<xref rid="pone.0251662.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. A rapidly increasing aging population and urban migration are also associated with stroke risk. The overall prevalence of hypertension in Uganda is relatively high at 26.4% of adult Ugandans [<xref rid="pone.0251662.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, many risk factors are potentially modifiable, which presents an opportunity to reduce the stroke burden. Hypertension is a key actionable target for stroke risk reduction in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), as are other potentially modifiable lifestyle factors such as obesity and smoking.</p>
              <p>An approach that engages people at risk for stroke and includes key social and cultural elements may be particularly salient for future generalizability and scale-up. Building upon promising pilot work, this 3-site, prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT) will test a curriculum-guided self-management TargetEd MAnageMent Intervention (TEAM) program [<xref rid="pone.0251662.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] designed to help reduce stroke burden in Ugandan adults vs. an Enhanced Treatment As Usual (ETAU) control comparison. We hypothesize that individuals in TEAM will have significantly reduced systolic B.P., serum cholesterol, and improved glycemic control among diabetic participants compared to individuals randomized to ETAU.</p>

                <p>This study’s 3-enrolling sites are Kiruddu and Nsambya hospitals in Kampala and Mbarara Hospital in Western Uganda. Kiruddu hospital has a neurology unit with a 40-bed inpatient section and receives approximately 60 stroke patients a month. Nsambya Hospital, with a capacity of 361 beds, receives about 15 new stroke patients every month and will offer a suburban population for the study. Mbarara hospital in Western Uganda provides neurology care for about 10 patients per month. All hospitals provide outpatient neurology clinics where stroke survivors attend for their long-term rehabilitation and care.</p>

There will be three meetings with video-conference call services available for those who cannot be physically present during the first six months of the project (using Zoom or a similar video conferencing platform). In the first call, SAB members will review the TEAM curriculum and identify content areas they may need to edit or add. The study team members will then make these modifications to the TEAM intervention manual. It is expected that at least some of the added content will be appropriate to compile a supplemental content "toolkit" that can be used as needed based on patient needs. In the 2<sup>nd</sup> meeting, SAB members will review the revised TEAM content and make any additional /final suggestions. In the 3<sup>rd</sup> meeting, the SAB will be asked to identify strategies that will help integrate TEAM into clinic workflow. SAB meetings will be audio-recorded and assessed qualitatively. After Phase 1 is concluded, the SAB will continue to meet annually for years 2–4 and twice annually in year 5.</p>

Participants will be offered the opportunity to bring a family member to this visit who may also ask questions and assist them with understanding written materials for those with limited literacy. To control for the same number of patient contacts as TEAM, the nurse in ETAU will then follow-up with participants with a series of 9 brief phone calls spaced out over 6 months (approximately every two weeks during months 1 and 2, then approximately monthly thereafter). Content will reinforce materials provided in the orientation visit, and the nurse will be available to answer questions that may arise.

                <title>Quantitative data analysis</title>
                <p>Preliminary descriptive analyses will examine change over time in systolic B.P., serum cholesterol, and serum HbA1c as well as secondary (biologic and behavioral) outcomes, including include other biomarker variables, stroke knowledge and attitudes, medication adherence, and health resource use. Primary and secondary outcome measurements will be assessed at baseline before randomization to either TEAM or ETAU and at the 13 week and 6-month time-points. Of primary interest is the treatment by time interaction in systolic B.P., measured from baseline to 6 months after randomization between TEAM and ETAU. Explanatory variables will include age, gender, stroke history, and rural vs. urban status.</p>
                <p>The 13-week systolic B.P. measurement will reflect the period following baseline (when individuals participating in TEAM Uganda will have just completed the "intensive" group sessions), and it will be used to assess for within-subject differences from baseline to 13 weeks and 13 weeks to 6-month periods. This will allow for a greater understanding of the time course for when the expected reductions occur in the TEAM Uganda group, which we expect to mostly occur after the "intensive’ group sessions have ended. We will analyze the change from baseline to 13 weeks and analyze contrasts within the mixed model framework.</p>
                <p>These analyses will compare two groups (TEAM intervention vs. enhanced treatment as usual (ETAU)) across three-time waves of systolic B.P., serum cholesterol, and serum HbA1c. When using a repeated measures analysis of variance (RMANOVA), we not only assess mean differences across time but also group differences, as well as the interaction of time X group, which will allow us to test the trend of the means over time between the two groups. The RMNOVA, not only can be used to determine if there are mean differences across the three time periods, it can also utilize orthogonal polynomial contrasts to determine linear and quadratic trends of the means across time. A linear trend is indicated if there is a steady increase or decline in scores from the first-time wave to the third time wave. A quadratic trend is indicated if there is a change in direction based on scores across the time waves.</p>
                <p>We will also conduct exploratory analyses testing for the moderation of the explanatory variables in the primary mixed model. Mediation analyses also will be explored. Potential mediators will include the dose of TEAM session exposure, medication prescription/access, and adherence to a heart-healthy diet. Variables with (change) values that appear to be associated with a change in systolic B.P. levels and that appear to differ by treatment will be considered further as mediator variables, single mediator analyses, as well as multiple mediator models will be explored. These analyses will involve the treatment variable as the predictor of interest, potential mediators, and change in systolic B.P. values as the outcome of interest. If mediation is identified, bootstrapping will be used to identify the estimated indirect effects’ standard errors.</p>

                  <title>Missing data</title>
                  <p>Strategies to minimize loss to follow-up are outlined in Form E, specifically the description of our Recruitment and Retention Plan. Data that remain missing despite our retention efforts will be accommodated in our analyses and their impact evaluated through sensitivity analyses. The models we propose can be estimated without bias under the missing at random (MAR) assumption and provide valid analysis as long as covariates associated with missingness (If any) are included in the mixed model. To assess which covariates may be associated with missing outcome data, we will create binary indicators of whether the outcome was missing (= 1) or not (= 0). If a covariate is correlated with missingness at r &gt;0.40 and is correlated at r &gt;0.40 with the original response variable, it will be included in the analysis as an auxiliary correlate. We will conduct assessment of the missing at random (MAR) assumption by pattern mixture models that relax the missing at random assumption, while analyzing the sensitivity of treatment by time interaction effects. We will also consider using Full Information Maximum Likelihood models in presence of incomplete data.</p>

                  <p>Based on our preliminary mixed model preliminary data, we observed a difference in systolic blood pressure (BP) from baseline to 24 weeks of 13.22 (SD±25.84) mmHg and within a subject correlation parameter value of 0.57. We conservatively estimate our sample size, based upon a difference of 10 mmHg, the magnitude of change in B.P. across a large sample with varying baseline blood pressure levels and comorbidities [<xref rid="pone.0251662.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Our projected sample size is n = 246, with 123 participants per arm, assuming a 25% attrition and a type I error level of 0.05 and a power of 0.80.</p>

                  <p>Two qualitative researchers will be used to ensure standardization of qualitative analysis. The qualitative team will first independently review each transcript and highlight significant statements, sentences, or quotes. Based on the review of the independently derived statements, the team will develop consensus-based <italic toggle="yes">"clusters of meaning" [<xref rid="pone.0251662.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</italic> or relevant <italic toggle="yes">"themes and categories"</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0251662.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Each researcher will further code each document independently and iteratively until no new insights emerge. Initial codes will be recorded using <italic toggle="yes">NVivo</italic>. These entries will be elaborated on as coding progress. The qualitative researchers will then construct a consensus-based coding dictionary that includes mutually exclusive definitions for each code. This coding structure will be reviewed after a preliminary analysis of a sub-sample of transcripts, and the dictionary will be refined through comparison, categorization, and discussion [<xref rid="pone.0251662.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0251662.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The refined codes will then be applied to the transcripts, with coding decisions recorded electronically using NVivo. Both qualitative researchers will code all transcripts. In our previous research, checks for inter-rater consistency using Cohen’s Kappa [<xref rid="pone.0251662.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] yielded Kappa ≥ .90, which was considered excellent agreement.</p>

                <p>Experts, who are not members of the study team, will review and evaluate the accumulated data for participant safety, adverse events, study conduct and progress, at minimum, every 12 months. Ad-hoc meetings might be called to evaluate unanticipated serious adverse events or any other urgent issues that are relevant and which might occur during the course of the study. The DSMB will be comprised of two clinicians with stroke expertise at the Uganda site; a faculty member/clinician with stroke expertise at the US site, and a biostatistician at the US site who are all not part of the study team, but have extensive experience with federally funded research. The DSMB communication and oversight will be accomplished via telephone, SKYPE, or email communication for issues that need more immediate attention.</p>
                <p>As noted above, progress reports, including patient recruitment, retention/attrition, and adverse events will be provided to the DSMB at least annually for independent review. There are no specific study stopping rules as the intervention arm will receive self-management information that will help teach and support individuals who are at high risk for stroke in better managing their health. There will be an interim analysis conducted once half of all trial participants have completed the 6 -month outcome evaluation point. The DSMB will review the annual plan on all 5 points outlined above, as well as the interim analysis, and make recommendations to the appropriate regulatory agencies (IRB, NIH) concerning continuation, modification or termination of the study. The PI will provide a copy of all DSMB reports to the appropriate IRB and NIH on an annual basis.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Despite the tremendous need, there are few practical and widely implemented care approaches that target the stroke burden in Uganda and other SSA countries [<xref rid="pone.0251662.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. While some individuals at high risk for stroke know their risk factors, they may not know how to address risk given their circumstances [<xref rid="pone.0251662.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Sarfo and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0251662.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] are testing whether an m-Health technology-enabled, nurse-led, multilevel integrated approach effectively improves blood pressure among Ghanaian stroke patients. Kamwesiga and colleagues conducted a qualitative evaluation to characterize mobile phone communication’s potential utility to facilitate stroke patient recovery in Uganda [<xref rid="pone.0251662.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p>
              <p>While there are strengths to the approaches that exist in the limited literature, including use of mobile technology and a focus on the individuals at risk for recurrence, these approaches do not tap into the power of patients to become engaged as peers and educators, use family support networks, or substantively address other lifestyle factors for stroke risk. The Stroke Minimization through Additive Anti-atherosclerotic Agents in Routine Treatment (SMAART) trial conducted in SSA seeks to assess whether a polypill containing three antihypertensive agents can impact a stroke vascular biomarker (carotid intimal thickness) [<xref rid="pone.0251662.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0251662.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. However, medications are likely to work best if individuals understand the role of medications and take them in the context of a whole-person approach to risk reduction. An approach that engages people at risk for stroke and includes key social and cultural elements may be particularly salient for future generalizability and scale-up. The results of this randomized controlled trial should provide further evidence regarding TEAM self-management interventions and their ability to reduce the stroke risk.</p>
