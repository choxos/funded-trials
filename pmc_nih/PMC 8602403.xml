While a subset of patients derive benefit from PD-1 blockade, there is a critically unmet need for predictive biomarkers of response. Herein, we perform CODEX multiplexed tissue imaging and RNA sequencing on 70 tumor regions from 14 advanced CTCL patients enrolled in a pembrolizumab clinical trial (NCT02243579). We find no differences in the frequencies of immune or tumor cells between responders and non-responders.

The <italic>SpatialScore</italic> coincides with differences in the functional immune state of the tumor microenvironment, T cell function, and tumor cell-specific chemokine recruitment and is validated using a simplified, clinically accessible tissue imaging platform. Collectively, these results provide a paradigm for investigating the spatial balance of effector and suppressive T cell activity and broadly leveraging this biomarker approach to inform the clinical use of immunotherapies.</p>

              <p id="Par3">Cutaneous T cell lymphomas (CTCL) are a heterogeneous group of rare but potentially lethal lymphomas that originate from mature, skin-tropic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Approximately one-third of CTCL patients present with advanced-stage disease, which has a 5-year survival rate of 28%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. With the exception of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, there are no effective or sustainable therapies for advanced CTCL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par4">Immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as antibodies against PD-1, restore T cell effector function at the tumor site<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> and promote robust and durable responses in a number of advanced cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. In CTCL, PD-1 and its ligands can be simultaneously expressed on tumor cells, making this pathway an attractive therapeutic target for PD-1 blockade<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par5">A recent Cancer Immunotherapy Trials Network (CITN) multicenter phase II clinical trial (NCT02243579) of the anti-PD-1 immunotherapy, pembrolizumab, in advanced cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL) showed that 38% of patients achieved a sustained clinical response, whereas 25% experienced disease progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Despite these outcome discrepancies, biomarker studies with traditional immunohistochemistry (IHC), gene expression profiling, and mass cytometry did not predict pembrolizumab response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. New assays and associated computational tools are critically needed to interrogate the tumor microenvironment (TME) and better predict the clinical response to anti-PD-1 therapies.</p>
              <p id="Par6">Since the immune system acts via coordinated cell-cell associations, it is expected that spatial cellular attributes within the TME prognosticate clinical outcomes. Indeed, recent studies show that immune cells are not randomly distributed within the TME, but rather purposefully organized into cellular neighborhoods and niches that facilitate anti- or pro-tumor functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. This raises the question of how PD-1 blockade alters spatial cellular context, and in turn, whether such changes can predict clinical response to pembrolizumab therapy in CTCL. To this end, we interrogate the spatial organization of the CTCL microenvironment in the same cohort of patients enrolled in the previously published pembrolizumab clinical trial, which failed to identify a predictive biomarker of response.</p>
              <p id="Par7">We combine CO-Detection by indEXing (CODEX) multiplexed tissue imaging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> with transcriptomic analysis using RNA-seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> to investigate, in unprecedented detail, 70 tumor regions from 14 advanced CTCL patients sampled before and after pembrolizumab treatment. Characterizing the higher-order tissue structure of the CTCL TME reveal topographical differences in effector PD-1<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, tumor cells, and immunosuppressive Tregs. From this, we derive the <italic>SpatialScore</italic>: a spatial biomarker that correlates strongly with pembrolizumab response and is accurately recapitulated using a clinically accessible multiplexed IHC (mIHC) platform. These results highlight the importance of spatial cellular organization—namely a distancing balance of effector and immunosuppressive T cell activity—for predicting anti-PD-1 immunotherapy response in CTCL. Additionally, this biomarker discovery approach can be readily applied to guide the clinical use of cancer immunotherapies in CTCL and a range of other tumor types.</p>

                <p id="Par8">To deeply characterize and interrogate the CTCL TME in its native context, we analyzed pre- and post-treatment biopsies from 14 heavily pre-treated patients with advanced-stage CTCL (i.e., mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome) enrolled in the CITN-10 clinical trial cohort (NCT02243579), who received pembrolizumab every 3 weeks for up to 2 years (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1a–b</xref>, Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1a</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. The post-treatment biopsies were collected at several timepoints, as detailed per patient in Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1c</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1a–b</xref>. For this study, 10 patients from the original 24 patient cohort were excluded due to insufficient formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) sample material.</p>
                <p id="Par9">An FFPE tissue microarray was created from the 14 patient samples (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a.1</xref>), which comprised 70 patient-matched pre- and post-treatment skin tumors (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a.2</xref>). The tissue microarray spots were selected from the most infiltrated regions of the skin biopsies to preclude sampling areas that were void of tumor and immune cell types. The reproducibility of the CODEX approach, as shown for cell densities (# of cells/mm<sup>2</sup>) per tissue microarray spot, is demonstrated across three experiments (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1d</xref>). CODEX multiplexed protein imaging identified 117,170 cells in the tissue microarray (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a.3</xref>, Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">1</xref>). These results were integrated with 64 tissue transcriptomes obtained from serial sections using laser capture microdissection and Smart-3Seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> (i.e., RNA-seq) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a.3</xref>, Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">2</xref>, Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Integrative computational analyses, including cellular neighborhood assessment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> and CIBERSORTx (CSx)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, were then used to profile the molecular dynamics of the CTCL microenvironment and identify a predictive biomarker of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a.4</xref>).

                <p id="Par10">Therapeutic response to pembrolizumab was assessed by consensus global response criteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. No significant differences were observed at baseline between responders and nonresponders for patient demographics, cancer type/stage, or treatment history (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1b</xref>). Clinical outcomes were significantly different between patient groups.

                <title>Discrimination of malignant and reactive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the CTCL microenvironment</title>
                <p id="Par11">Detecting a biomarker based on the spatial context of tumor and immune cells requires that malignant and reactive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells can be distinguished. This is a major challenge in CTCL, because the cell type of origin (e.g., effector memory T cells (T<sub>EM</sub>), central memory T cells (T<sub>CM</sub>), tissue-resident memory T cells (T<sub>RM</sub>))<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, expression of T cell markers (e.g., CD2, CD3, CD4, CD5, CD7, CD25, FoxP3), and clonality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> can be shared by both cell types. Furthermore, no protein marker has yet been identified as 100% specific for CTCL tumor cells. Using a 56-marker CODEX panel (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1e</xref>, Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>), unsupervised machine learning, and manual curation based on marker expression, tissue localization, and morphology, 21 unique cell types were identified and validated (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2a, b</xref>), including reactive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and malignant CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (i.e., tumor cells). Comparing the fluorescent staining of reactive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (blue crosses) and malignant CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (red crosses) showed that in tumor cells CD7 was decreased and CD25 and Ki-67 were increased (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1g</xref>), consistent with an advanced CTCL phenotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Quantifying these expression differences for tumor cells relative to reactive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells revealed fold-changes of 0.26 for CD7, 1.40 for CD30, 3.20 for CD25, and 5.73 for Ki-67 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1h</xref>). Tumor cells were also larger than reactive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1i</xref>), in line with the previous reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. While one patient’s tumor cells had large cell transformation, the average size of those tumor cells were not significantly different from those of the other 13 patients. Additionally, we identified genes predictive of the frequency of tumor cells per tissue microarray spot by fitting an L1-regularized linear model to bulk RNA-seq data. This confirmed that higher expression of several known CTCL marker genes, including <italic>CD27</italic>, <italic>IL-32</italic>, <italic>CXCL13</italic>, <italic>BATF</italic>, and <italic>TIGIT</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, was associated with spots with higher frequencies of tumor cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1j</xref>, see yellow highlighted genes). Notably, CTCL tumor cells can also express FoxP3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, as seen for one patient in this cohort. Our clustering approach identified this population of malignant FoxP3<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, which differed significantly from Tregs, with lower CD4, CD7, CD25, and FoxP3 marker expression and larger cell size (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2d</xref>). Given the heterogeneity of CTCL, the marker expression profile of tumor cells may differ between cohorts, especially if the patients were heavily pre-treated. However, our findings show that multiplexed imaging can discriminate tumor cells from reactive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells at the single-cell level, which is supported by protein expression differences, cell size measurements, and gene expression profiling.</p>

                <p id="Par12">To delineate the complex interactions of tumor and immune cells within the TME, we next characterized the cellular composition of CTCL tumors pre- and postpembrolizumab therapy. The 21 cell types identified by CODEX were cataloged across patient groups, including 13 immune cell types, 6 auxiliary cell types, and 2 tumor cell types (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2b</xref>). Markers for T cell subsets (CD4, CD8, FoxP3), macrophages (CD68), dendritic cells (CD11c), tumor cells (CD4), vasculature (CD31), and epithelium (cytokeratin) were clearly visualized in the CODEX fluorescent images (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a, b</xref>, upper panels; Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3a</xref>).

The combined frequencies of tumor, immune and auxiliary cell types each comprised approximately one-third of all cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>, upper panel); the same trend held across patient groups (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2c</xref>).

While neither signature was predictive of pembrolizumab response in this CTCL cohort, it is important to point out that these gene signatures were derived from single-disease studies, and thus their application may be limited to similar solid tumor types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>.</p>
                <p id="Par15">Rare cancers like CTCL do not have specifically defined immune gene signatures, making it a challenge to catalog their tumor immunogenicity. Thus, gene lists of immune activation (e.g., <italic>CD27</italic>, <italic>EOMES</italic>, and <italic>ICOS</italic>) and immunosuppression (e.g., <italic>ENTPD1</italic>, <italic>TGFB1</italic>, and <italic>TIGIT</italic>) molecules (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3c, d</xref>) were used to assess the functional immune state of the TME. Genes like <italic>PDCD1</italic> and <italic>TNFRSF18</italic>, which can be immune activating and/or suppressive depending on the cellular state and microenvironmental context, were excluded from this analysis. The immune activation gene score was significantly increased in responders post-treatment compared to pretreatment (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2g</xref>), with no significant change in nonresponders. In contrast, the immunosuppression gene score was significantly increased in nonresponders compared to responders both pre- and post-treatment (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2h</xref>). These findings indicate that 1) nonresponders have an immunosuppressed phenotype relative to responders, 2) only responders develop an immune-activated TME following pembrolizumab treatment, and 3) the functional immune state of the CTCL TME depends on factors beyond raw immune cell counts.</p>

                <title>PD-1 blockade induces spatial re-organization of the CTCL TME</title>
                <p id="Par16">Anticipating that the functional immune state of the TME was mediated by its spatial cellular organization, we reasoned that specific global tissue patterns would be reflected by a pembrolizumab responsive and nonresponsive phenotype. To obtain a quantitative, high-level view of the CTCL tissue architecture, cellular neighborhood (CN) analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> was performed. CNs are analogous to urban neighborhoods—essentially geographically localized areas within a larger city that facilitate social interaction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup> (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2e</xref>). Likewise, CNs are defined by a localized enrichment of specific cell types within the tissue that mediate cellular interactions and vital tissue functions (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2f</xref>). Computationally, the CN algorithm extracts quantitative data on the composition and spatial distribution of individual cells to reveal how local cellular niches are organized within tissues (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Specifically, computational parameters like the window size and number of CNs to be computed are manually set (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a.1</xref>). Each cell in the tissue is assigned to a given CN based on the composition of cell types within the specified window (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a.2</xref>). The windows are then clustered and the correlation of CNs and cell types are represented as a heatmap (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a.3</xref>). CNs are visualized as Voronoi diagrams and analyzed to better understand cellular spatial behavior (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a.4</xref>). Importantly, these Voroni diagrams account for the spatial interactions between different cell types and as such provide a layer of information beyond the cell type maps shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a, b</xref>.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><title>Cellular neighborhoods reveal differences in the spatial TME organization in responders and nonresponders.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Cellular neighborhood (CN) analysis schematic.

                <p id="Par17">Using a window size of 10 (i.e., one center cell and its nine nearest neighbors), we identified 10 distinct CNs that were conserved across this CTCL cohort (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3c</xref>). Some CNs recapitulated structural components that were clearly discernable in the corresponding H&amp;E and fluorescent images, such as epithelium (CN-1, green region) and vasculature (CN-3, brown region) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). The other CNs were composed of previously unappreciated sub-structures within the dermal infiltrate that were not apparent in the corresponding H&amp;E or fluorescent images, including immune-infiltrated stroma (CN-2, red region), vascularized stroma (CN-4, gray region), tumor and dendritic cells (CN-5, purple region), lymphatic enriched stroma (CN-6, orange region), tumor and mixed immune cells (CN-7, cyan region), tumor and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (CN-8, yellow region), innate immune cell enriched (CN-9, blue region), and Treg enriched (CN-10, pink region) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>).</p>

This suggests that the more immune-activated TME observed in responders following pembrolizumab therapy (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3g</xref>) may be mediated by CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell activation by antigen-presenting cells. Indeed, after PD-1 blockade, responders had increased frequencies of activated ICOS<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3i</xref>) and proliferating Ki-67<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3j</xref>) compared to responders pretreatment and nonresponders post-treatment, suggesting that pembrolizumab activates CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells through upregulation of immune-activating molecules.</p>

Vectra, in conjugation with the Phenoptics workflow, is a commercially available, widely adopted clinical mIHC imaging platform, which has been used to identify biomarkers for renal cell carcinoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup> and B cell lymphoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>.

Furthermore, bootstrap-coupled estimation of the mean <italic>SpatialScore</italic> differences between responders and nonresponders across these 14 iterations of patient exclusion confirmed a large effect size between the two patient groups (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5j</xref>).

                <p id="Par31">We then analyzed a publicly available scRNA-seq dataset of CTCL skin tumors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup> to identify the main cell type overexpressing <italic>CXCL13</italic>.

Additionally, the frequency of CXCL13-expressing cells was highest among tumor cells compared to other cell types (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5f</xref>).</p>
                <p id="Par32">CIBERSORTx (CSx) is a computational framework that uses gene expression signatures to enable cell type-specific gene expression to be inferred from bulk RNA-seq data without physical cell isolation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. We used CSx to computationally resolve tumor, stromal, and immune cell subsets in bulk RNA-seq data (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5g</xref>, Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4a, b</xref>, Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">3</xref>, Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">6</xref>). Using the 10 annotated clusters shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5e, f,</xref> and Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">7</xref>, a signature matrix, consisting of cell type-specific marker genes, was generated (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6c</xref>, Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM10" ref-type="media">8</xref>, see Methods). This signature matrix was used to enumerate CSx-resolved cell type fractions and resolve gene expression profiles from CTCL bulk transcriptomes. Strong correlations were observed between the CSx-resolved cell type frequencies and CODEX-identified cell type frequencies (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5h</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8</xref>), confirming the utility of the CSx approach.</p>
                <p id="Par33">The CSx-resolved gene expression profiles of tumor cells were thoroughly characterized and compared across patient groups. Interestingly, <italic>RAB11B</italic>, a RAS superfamily member of small GTP-binding proteins, was the only tumor cell gene with significantly different expression between responders and nonresponders pretreatment (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6d</xref>), suggesting an absence of intrinsic tumor cell differences between patient groups at baseline. In contrast, numerous genes, including <italic>CXCL13</italic>, were upregulated in the tumor cells of responders post-treatment compared to pretreatment (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5i</xref>, see <italic>CXCL13</italic> in bold). This finding is consistent with an increased susceptibility of responder tumor cells to PD-1 blockade therapy and supported by the decreased tumor therapy resistance score observed in responders post- vs pretreatment (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4g</xref>). Interestingly, only three genes (<italic>BRD3</italic>, <italic>TWF2</italic>, and <italic>ZNF365</italic>) were differentially expressed in nonresponder tumor cells post-treatment compared to pretreatment (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5j</xref>), which suggests that nonresponder tumor cells are resistant to PD-1 blockade, in line with the increased tumor therapy resistance score observed in nonresponders post- vs pretreatment (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4h</xref>). Finally, co-staining the tissue section used for the Vectra mIHC experiment with an anti-CXCL13 antibody by standard IHC, followed by co-localization analysis of tumor cells and CXCL13-positive cells, provided visual confirmation that tumor cells are the primary expressors of CXCL13 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5k</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6e</xref>).</p>
                <p id="Par34">Next, we assessed <italic>CXCL13</italic> expression in tumor cells and its role in recruiting reactive lymphocytes. CSx-resolved tumor cell-specific <italic>CXCL13</italic> expression was significantly increased in responders post-treatment compared with other patient groups on a per tissue microarray spot basis (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5l</xref>). On a per-patient basis, tumor cell-resolved <italic>CXCL13</italic> expression increased in 100% of responders post- vs pretreatment (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5m</xref>) versus 29% of nonresponders (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5n</xref>). CXCL13 exclusively binds to the chemokine receptor CXCR5, which is expressed on B cells, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, and skin-derived migratory dendritic cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref></sup>. <italic>CXCR5</italic> expression was increased in bulk mRNA of responders post-treatment relative to pretreatment, but did not reach statistical significance (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6f</xref>). The data lacked significant power to unmix <italic>CXCR5</italic> on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells by CSx; however, tumor cell-specific <italic>CXCL13</italic> expression was positively correlated with bulk mRNA <italic>CXCR5</italic> expression (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5o</xref>) and a strong receptor-ligand interaction was predicted between <italic>CXCL13</italic> in tumor cells and <italic>CXCR5</italic> in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8d</xref>), suggesting a chemoattractant recruitment mechanism.</p>
                <p id="Par35">Collectively, these results indicate that PD-1 blockade distinctly alters the CTCL TME of therapeutic responders and nonresponders. Pretreatment differences in the functional immune state of responders and nonresponders likely regulate the baseline spatial organization that underlies the <italic>SpatialScore</italic> and the potential for immune cell priming. In responders, pembrolizumab therapy appears to promote T cell activation and upregulate CXCL13 in tumor cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, top panel). In turn, CXCL13 overexpression seems to attract effector/cytotoxic PD-1<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to tumor cells, which promotes CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell-mediated tumor cell inhibition and killing. As such, the overexpression of CXCL13 in tumor cells provides a potential mechanism for the sustained clinical activity seen in responders. In contrast, nonresponders have a persistently immunosuppressed TME, which appears to mediate the increased interaction between the inhibitory Tregs and PD-1<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and maintains this CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subset in an exhausted state (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, bottom panel). In the setting of pembrolizumab resistance, nonresponder tumor cells seem to remain aggressive and proliferative following treatment, accounting for the development of progressive disease. Thus, underlying differences in the functional immune state of the TME—coupled with alterations in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell effector activity versus suppression and tumor cell-specific CXCL13 expression—appear to be associated with distinct spatial cellular patterns that predict the efficacy of PD-1 blockade in CTCL.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><title>Proposed mechanisms of pembrolizumab response in CTCL.</title><p>Cartoon depicting proposed mechanisms of pembrolizumab response in therapy responders (top panel) and nonresponders (bottom panel) pre- and post-treatment.

In nonresponders, the TME is continually immunosuppressed and persistently exhausted PD-1<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are in closer proximity to potently suppressive ICOS<sup>+</sup> Tregs. Moreover, the tumor cells of nonresponders are less susceptible to pembrolizumab therapy. In contrast, responders have a neutral functional immune state pretreatment, which facilitates the baseline spatial organization that underlies a lower <italic>SpatialScore</italic> and immune cell priming and activation. This enables the transition from exhausted PD-1<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to effector/cytotoxic GZMB<sup>hi</sup> PD-1<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells following pembrolizumab therapy.

              <p id="Par36">For anti-PD-1 immunotherapies to provide maximal benefit to cancer patients, the drivers and resistors of clinical response must be identified. Traditional biomarker studies with IHC, gene expression profiling, and tumor mutational burden assays do not fully account for spatial cellular context and have an imperfect correlation with immunotherapy outcomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref></sup>. This was true for our CTCL cohort: No pretreatment differences were observed in immune composition, expression of PD-1/PD-L1 proteins, or IFN-γ/TGF-β gene signatures between responders and nonresponders. We therefore explored alternative approaches, including spatially-resolved multiplexed tissue imaging, which has been shown to significantly improve the accuracy of predicting response to PD-1 blockade in several tumor types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par37">CODEX analysis revealed global prognostic spatial patterns that were predictive of clinical response, including a localized enrichment of tumor and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (CN-8) in responders and of Tregs (CN-10) in nonresponders. Profiling the spatial relationships between effector PD-1<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, tumor cells, and immunosuppressive Tregs allowed us to derive the <italic>SpatialScore</italic>—a clinically useful biomarker that correlated strongly with pembrolizumab response in CTCL. While previously identified spatial biomarkers rely on pairwise distances (e.g., PD-1<sup>+</sup> T cells and PD-L1<sup>+</sup> tumor cells)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref></sup>, the <italic>SpatialScore</italic> accounts for the interactions between three functionally distinct cell types. As such, the <italic>SpatialScore</italic> represents a predictive approach and accounts for three key therapeutic determinants underlying PD-1 blockade in CTCL: 1) functional immune state of the TME, 2) T cell function, and 3) chemoattraction.</p>
              <p id="Par38">First, the <italic>SpatialScore</italic> reflects differences in the functional immune phenotypes between CTCL responders and nonresponders. Following pembrolizumab therapy, the TME of responders becomes activated, as evidenced by the increased immune activation gene score, increased frequency of ICOS<sup>+</sup> and Ki-67<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, and a local enrichment of tumor cells with dendritic cells (CN-5) and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (CN-8). These findings suggest that in responders PD-1 blockade specifically activates CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells through the expression of immunostimulatory molecules and co-stimulation by antigen-presenting cells, resulting in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell proliferation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref></sup>. In contrast, nonresponders have a persistently immunosuppressed TME. This is supported by their increased immunosuppression gene score, increased frequency of a Treg enriched neighborhood (CN-10), and the expansion of a highly suppressive ICOS<sup>+</sup> Treg subset, which has been associated with poor clinical outcomes in melanoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup> and liver cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. These results suggest that both the increased suppressive function and spatial organization of Tregs in nonresponders contribute to the lack of pembrolizumab response. We speculate that the absence of this pretreatment immunosuppression in responders promotes the 1) advantageous spatial interactions of tumor and PD-1<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells that underlies the lower <italic>SpatialScore</italic> and 2) priming and activation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells following immunotherapy.</p>
              <p id="Par39">Second, the <italic>SpatialScore</italic> captures differences in T cell function between CTCL responders and nonresponders. After PD-1 blockade, T cell effector activity is restored in responders, whereas nonresponders have a continually exhausted T cell phenotype. Consistent with studies of Hodgkin lymphoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>, bladder cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>, and glioblastoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref></sup>, our data suggest that CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, and particularly the PD-1<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subset, are crucial effectors that influence pembrolizumab response in CTCL. In responders post-treatment, PD-1<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells increase GZMB expression and move closer to tumor cells, similar to the granzyme-perforin-dependent tumor-killing mechanism used by cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. Notably, prior studies have shown that antitumor activity is enhanced by a closer proximity of cytotoxic T cells to tumor cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref></sup> and by removing inhibitory Tregs from the TME milleu<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. The <italic>SpatialScore</italic> combines these principles by measuring the physical distances between 1) PD-1<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and tumor cells (i.e., effector function) and 2) PD-1<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and Tregs (i.e., suppressive function). The <italic>SpatialScore</italic> therefore reflects the balance of T cell effector versus suppressive activity in the TME, which are key determinants of the efficacy of PD-1 blockade.</p>
              <p id="Par40">Third, increased expression of <italic>CXCL13</italic> is predictive of the lower <italic>SpatialScore</italic> and improved clinical outcomes seen in CTCL responders, consistent with prior studies in the breast<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref></sup>, colon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref></sup>, ovarian<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref></sup>, lung<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref></sup>, and urothelial cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref></sup> as well as responsiveness to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref></sup>. We speculate that the increased RNA and protein expression of CXCL13 in responder tumor cells following pembrolizumab therapy is advantageous in localizing effector PD-1<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells within the TME. Previous studies show that upregulation of <italic>CXCL13</italic> strongly attracts CXCR5<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to the tumor site<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref></sup> and PD-1<sup>+</sup> CXCR5<sup>−</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in IgG4-related disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref></sup>. Additionally, a recent bladder cancer study showed that the tumor-specific gene expression program of cytotoxic GZMB<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells treated with anti-PD-L1 therapy was marked by tumor overexpression of <italic>CXCL13</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. Furthermore, CXCL13 null mice with bladder tumors did not respond to anti-PD-1 treatment and had a lower frequency of T cell infiltration compared their wild-type counterparts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref></sup>. Collectively, these findings support a chemoattractant mechanism for the sustained clinical response to pembrolizumab therapy observed in CTCL responders: upregulation of CXCL13 in tumor cells attracts effector PD-1<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, promoting successful antitumor activity. This aspect of pembrolizumab responsiveness is captured by the lower <italic>SpatialScore</italic> seen in responders and underscores the importance of T cell topography as a spatial biomarker.</p>
              <p id="Par41">Presentation of the <italic>SpatialScore</italic> approach provides an important conceptual foundation for identifying spatial biomarkers of immunotherapy response and deeply characterizing the TME. By distilling high-dimensional pathology into a simplified spatial metric that can be routinely measured in clinical practice, the <italic>SpatialScore</italic> represents a major advancement for the clinical use of immunotherapies. However, key questions still need to be addressed: 1) Does this spatial biomarker of PD-1<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, tumor cells, and Tregs translate broadly for the prediction of pembrolizumab response in CTCL?, 2) What is the threshold value for the <italic>SpatialScore</italic> that can be used to clinically stratify CTCL patients into probabilistic responders and nonresponders?, 3) Can scRNA-seq and T cell receptor sequencing studies reveal unique features of PD-1 + CD4 + T cells in CTCL responders and ICOS + Tregs in nonresponders?, 4) Can CXCL13 expression levels—in both skin and blood—serve as surrogates of pembrolizumab activity in CTCL and guide ongoing treatment decisions?, and 5) Can the <italic>SpatialScore</italic> concept (i.e., simplified spatial metric of effector vs immunosuppressive activity in the TME) be translated to other immunotherapies and tumor types? We anticipate that the <italic>SptialScore</italic> paradigm will be adopted by users of highly multiplexed imaging technologies (e.g., CODEX, MIBI, and IMC) and clinically accessible mIHC platforms (e.g., Vectra) alike, which will advance the mechanistic insights of immunotherapy and better inform their clinical use in cancer patients.</p>

The minimal distance between each cell type and its nearest other cell types, and the averages of these minimal distances per tissue spot, were calculated in R (github.com/nolanlab/SpatialScore). Given our interest in the relationship of cell distances between three cell types (i.e., effector T cells (CT1), tumor cells (CT2) and Tregs (CT3)), we calculated the ratio of the minimal distances between CT1—CT2 (right distance) versus CT1—CT3 (left distance). This distance ratio represented the <italic>SpatialScore</italic>. To assess whether these ratios were significantly different from those of a random sample, we performed the following analysis per spot: For the number of CT1 cells in each spot, we randomly selected the same number of non-CT1 (nCT1) cells. For each of these nCT1 cells, we calculated the ratio of the minimal distances (nCT1—CT2 / nCT1—CT3) and determined the mean of this sample. We repeated this random sampling 100 times, and the average of all the means was reported. The distribution of the random values was assessed by the quant output variable, which indicates how many of the random means are smaller than the measured means. For instance, a quant of 97 indicates that 97% of the random means are smaller than the measured means. Thus, quant values closer to 100 or 0 indicate that the measured means are not random (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4k-n</xref>).</p>

These models were estimated using the LassoCV object in the scikit-learn python package v0.22. Six-fold cross validation was used to select the optimal regularization parameter. Specifically, an L1-regularized linear model was fit to predict the frequency of tumor cells from the gene expression data per tissue microarray spot. For this model, the response variable was the log-transformed per spot percentage of tumor cells. A pseudo-count of 1% was added to genes. The features utilized as predictors were the per spot log-transformed TPM counts and the log frequency of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Genes with positive nonzero coefficients were interpreted as positively associated with tumor cells. Similarly, an L1-regularized linear model was fit to predict the <italic>SpatialScore</italic> from the gene expression data on a per spot basis. For this model, the response variable was the log-transformed <italic>SpatialScore</italic> distance ratio. The features used as predictors were the per spot log-transformed TPM counts. Genes with nonzero coefficients were selected in figures as predictive.</p>
                <p id="Par61">For both models, six cross-validation folds were used to determine the regularization parameter. For the model predicting tumor cell frequency, the selected regularization parameter was 0.028 and the average validation set mean squared error (MSE) across folds was 0.31. For the model predicting distance ratio, the selected regularization parameter was 0.300 and the average validation set MSE across folds was 0.71.</p>

                <p id="Par62">To generate a CSx signature matrix, we used a publicly available scRNA-seq dataset from Gaydosik et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup> that was obtained from skin biopsies of five CTCL patients. Datasets were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (accession code GSE128531), and single-cell profiles were combined and analyzed using the Seurat R package (v3.1.4)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref></sup>. Cells with between 500 and 7500 genes detected and less than 10% mitochondrial transcripts were included in the analysis.</p>
                <p id="Par63">Data were log10normalized and clustered with the Louvain method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref></sup> based on the first 13 PCs and resolution of 1.8. Cell clusters were visualized using Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref></sup>, with the same PCs. Major cell types were assigned according to the expression of corresponding marker genes (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6a</xref>, Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4a</xref>). Fibroblasts and pericytes were merged into a stromal cluster. A full list of differentially expressed genes between the 10 annotated clusters is available in Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">7</xref>. The T cell cluster was divided into CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, Tregs, γδ T cells, and tumor cells based on the expression of certain T cell and tumor marker genes (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6b</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>, Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4b</xref>). Tumor cells from patient CTCL-5 were excluded due to extreme heterogeneity; these tumor cells were characterized by high expression of NK cell markers (e.g., <italic>NKG7</italic>, <italic>GNLY</italic>), suggesting NK T cell lineage T cell clustering was based on the first 15 PCs and resolution of 1.9. The same PCs were used to generate UMAP projections for the T cell clusters. A matrix of single cells and their assigned cell type identities were used to create a signature matrix (Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM10" ref-type="media">8</xref>) using CSx (v.1.0) with fractions mode on the CSx website (arguments used: single_cell = TRUE; code available from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cibersortx.stanford.edu/">cibersortx.stanford.edu/</ext-link>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>.

                <p id="Par66">Statistical analyses were performed with R and Prism v8 (GraphPad Software, Inc). Results with <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 were considered significant, unless otherwise stated. The significance of pretreatment differences between individual responder and nonresponder patients was tested using a two-sided Wilcoxon’s rank-sum test. Pre- to post-treatment pairwise statistical significance for individual patients was tested using a two-sided Wilcoxon’s signed-rank test. For differences across patient groups (i.e., responders versus nonresponders pretreatment, responders pre- versus post-treatment, nonresponders pre- versus post-treatment, and responders versus nonresponders post-treatment), the significance was tested using a linear mixed-effect model with Holm Bonferroni multiple hypothesis testing corrections. For <italic>SpatialScore</italic> comparisons between responders and nonresponders pretreatment (comparison 1) or post-treatment (comparison 2), the significance was tested using a linear mixed-effect model taking a patient identifier as a random effect. Multiple hypothesis testing was not employed for this analysis since the two comparisons were independent: the pretreatment comparison assessed the ability of the <italic>SpatialScore</italic> to predict therapeutic response, whereas the post-treatment comparison assessed the influence of therapy on the <italic>SpatialScore</italic>. For subsampling and exclusion analyses of the pretreatment Vectra-derived <italic>SpatialScore</italic> differences between responders and nonresponders, the significance was tested using a linear mixed-effect model taking a patient identifier as a random effect. For differential gene expression between patient groups in CSx deconvoluted expression profiles, the significance was tested using linear mixed-effect models, where <italic>p</italic> values were adjusting using Benjamini-Hochberg correction and results with <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.1 were considered significant.
