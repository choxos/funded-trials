                  <p>In a randomized clinical trial including 12 909 students attending 14 Pennsylvania public high schools, adolescents randomized to universal screening vs the usual process of targeted student referral had significantly higher odds both of being identified with MDD symptoms (5.9 times higher) and of initiating MDD treatment (2.1 times higher).</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>The prevalence of adolescents reporting major depressive disorder (MDD) symptoms has nearly doubled in the last decade, increasing from 8.3% in 2008 to 14.4% in 2018.<sup><xref rid="zoi210909r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> To better screen for and identify MDD, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) endorsed primary care screening in 2009 for all adolescents aged 12 to 18 years in settings with capacity to ensure appropriate follow-up, reaffirming this statement in 2016.<sup><xref rid="zoi210909r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> The USPSTF review supported that screening instruments can accurately identify adolescent MDD and that treatment of adolescents with screen-detected MDD is associated with beneficial reductions in symptoms.<sup><xref rid="zoi210909r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Unfortunately, MDD screening has significant disparities.<sup><xref rid="zoi210909r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="zoi210909r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Most US adolescents (&gt;60%) lack routine preventive health care, limiting the ability of primary care to address this worsening public health concern.<sup><xref rid="zoi210909r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="zoi210909r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Furthermore, primary care MDD screening is inconsistent, with inequalities by race and ethnicity and region, and potential worsening with the COVID-19 pandemic.<sup><xref rid="zoi210909r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="zoi210909r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="zoi210909r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Additional gaps identified by the USPSTF include the need for large randomized clinical trials (RCTs) to understand the effects of MDD screening and to quantify the proportion of individuals with screen-detected MDD successfully treated.<sup><xref rid="zoi210909r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Innovative approaches are needed to improve MDD screening and treatment. Schools create a more equitable setting for screening given that most adolescents attend, regardless of race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. Thus, we identified schools as an ideal setting to (1) evaluate universal adolescent MDD symptom screening, (2) compare the effectiveness of universal vs targeted MDD symptom screening, and (3) address disparities in MDD screening.<sup><xref rid="zoi210909r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Prior studies of school-based MDD screening demonstrate increased identification and referral, but limited data exist on treatment initiation.<sup><xref rid="zoi210909r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="zoi210909r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="zoi210909r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="zoi210909r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> An RCT by Huskey et al<sup><xref rid="zoi210909r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> of 4 Pennsylvania high schools demonstrated increased treatment initiation with screening. An RCT of depression screening by Guo et al<sup><xref rid="zoi210909r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> in California middle schools found no effect of universal screening on treatment initiation.</p>
              <p>Adolescents’ consistent contact with schools has been used to support physical health screenings that affect academic success.<sup><xref rid="zoi210909r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Major depressive disorder similarly affects academic success, suggesting school-based screening may be especially beneficial.<sup><xref rid="zoi210909r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="zoi210909r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="zoi210909r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> This article reports results of the Screening in High Schools to Identify, Evaluate, and Lower Depression (SHIELD) RCT, conducted in Pennsylvania public high schools from November 6, 2018, to November 20, 2020, to compare the effectiveness of universal school-based MDD screening vs targeted screening on MDD treatment initiation. Our hypothesis was that universal screening would increase treatment initiation among identified students and for specific subgroups: female students, adolescents from rural areas, and minority students (ie, students in racial and ethnic minority groups).</p>

                <title>Trial Design</title>
                <p>The SHIELD protocol (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-ZOI210909-1-s">Supplement 1</xref>) was approved by the Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine Institutional Review Board and previously published.<sup><xref rid="zoi210909r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Schools were recruited leveraging prior research team relationships.<sup><xref rid="zoi210909r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="zoi210909r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="zoi210909r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Schools were identified for recruitment to ensure a statewide sample of rural and urban schools with diverse student demographic backgrounds as outlined by the funding agencies (based on data from the Pennsylvania school performance profile<sup><xref rid="zoi210909r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>) and interest in participation. Recruitment telephone calls and emails went to 45 high schools on these criteria to initiate conversations with school personnel; 11 never responded. Contact and initial responses were received from 34 high schools, and 16 initially enrolled. However, 1 school underwent leadership changes and declined participation after randomization but before screening. Another declined participation after the first day of screening 82 students (estimated 3% of enrollment), citing demands on staff time, and did not provide further data.</p>
                <p>Schools were randomized to either (1) 9th and 11th graders assigned to universal screening, or (2) 10th and 12th graders assigned to universal screening, with the other grades assigned to targeted screening.<sup><xref rid="zoi210909r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> School students and staff were not blinded to study group. All 9th- to 12th-grade students were eligible for participation aside from those whose parents opted out or students with disabilities deemed unable to participate by the school. Letters sent to parents or guardians before screening detailed the project and screening instrument, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and offered the opportunity to opt their student out of the study.<sup><xref rid="zoi210909r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="zoi210909r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Students in the universal screening group either gave their assent by completion of the PHQ-9 or their refusal by declining to complete it at the time of screening.</p>
                <p>Targeted screening followed current school practice. If a student exhibited behaviors raising consideration for MDD, a referral was made to the Student Assistance Program (SAP). In Pennsylvania public schools, SAP is the primary process to address the needs of students who display any barrier to learning.<sup><xref rid="zoi210909r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> The SAP is a professionally trained team including school staff and liaisons from mental health agencies. The SAP uses a team process to gather and review data on observable behaviors or symptoms prompting the referral. The SAP does not diagnose, but after review, students confirmed to require intervention are referred for follow-up school-based and/or community-based services, which may be based on screening or assessment by a SAP liaison from a community behavioral health agency.<sup><xref rid="zoi210909r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup></p>
                <p>Students in universal screening were administered a PHQ-9 electronically (via 10 study-purchased iPads [Apple Inc]) during school hours by the study team. This screening occurred in classrooms (eg, all ninth-grade English classes) or in a designated space, eg, school library or auditorium, with direct entry into REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture), a secure, web-based application designed to support research studies.<sup><xref rid="zoi210909r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> The PHQ-9 is a well-established, validated screening tool; a score greater than 10 has a sensitivity of 89.5%, a specificity of 77.5%, and a positive predictive value of 15.2% for the diagnosis of MDD among adolescents.<sup><xref rid="zoi210909r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Students with a positive result (PHQ-9 score &gt;10) were referred to SAP using the same process as in the targeted screening arm. Those with suicidality, based on a score of 1 or greater for PHQ-9 item No. 9, were reported to designated school staff on the day of screening regardless of total score. Students in the universal screening group who exhibited behaviors concerning for MDD any time during the academic year were referred to SAP via the same process as for the targeted screening group.</p>
                <p>Three schools participated in the RCT in the 2018-2019 academic year and 11 in the 2019-2020 academic year. The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in Pennsylvania school closure on March 15, 2020,<sup><xref rid="zoi210909r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> affecting screening completion at 2 schools. The SAP team functions were variably affected; online meeting platforms and telehealth were used to support continued services.<sup><xref rid="zoi210909r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> This study followed the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/consort/">CONSORT</ext-link>) reporting guideline.</p>

                <title>Outcome Measures</title>
                <p>The primary outcome was the percentage of students confirmed by SAP with MDD symptoms that warranted further evaluation who initiated recommended treatment. To meet the primary outcome including definitions for MDD symptoms and treatment, students were required to meet all of the following criteria: (1) identified (MDD symptoms): positive PHQ-9 (score &gt;10 or response ≥1 on question 9) or behavior prompting referral to SAP for MDD; (2) confirmed: SAP does not diagnose, but to meet criteria, SAP must confirm that identified behavior or symptoms warrant further evaluation; (3) initiated: participated in at least 1 SAP-recommended treatment or service for MDD, eg, follow-up mental health supports. Confirmation by school staff (criteria 2) is similar to implementation as described in the USPSTF statement, whereby initial screening is followed by a second phase in which the student’s individual situation is considered in making further recommendations.<sup><xref rid="zoi210909r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="zoi210909r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> Students already in treatment did not meet criteria for initiation. If students accidentally completed the PHQ-9 more than once because of school error, a student was identified based on a positive score on any of these completions. Additional details about how the criteria were operationalized are described in eTable 1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-ZOI210909-1-s">Supplement 2</xref>. Secondary outcomes were the first and second criteria (identified and confirmed).</p>

                <title>Statistical Analysis</title>
                <p>Based on Pennsylvania SAP data, we planned to enroll at least 8 schools (n = 9650 students), which yielded greater than 99% power to detect a difference of 5% vs 2% in the universal and targeted screening groups, respectively, for the primary outcome.<sup><xref rid="zoi210909r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> The sample size had greater than 80% power for planned subgroup analyses by sex and race and ethnicity to understand the effectiveness of screening on disparities in MDD identification and treatment initiation.<sup><xref rid="zoi210909r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Demographic data were based on school records.</p>
                <p>Statistical analysis was conducted using the intent-to-treat principle. The analysis for primary and secondary outcomes that compared universal to targeted screening was conducted using mixed-effects logistic regression.<sup><xref rid="zoi210909r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> Models contained a fixed effect for randomized group and a random effect for school. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs were reported. For the planned subgroup analyses of sex, race and ethnicity, and school location, the same models were used but were extended by adding fixed effects for subgroup and interaction effects for subgroup by randomized group. We reported the <italic>P</italic> value for the joint test of all interaction terms and reported ORs (95% CIs) for the interactions when the joint test was significant (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). All <italic>P</italic> values were 2-sided. Statistical analyses were performed using R software, version 4.0.2 (R Foundation) and SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc).</p>
                <p>Under the intent-to-treat principle, all randomized students were included in the analysis. Two students with a missing value for the primary outcome were imputed as not receiving services for the analysis. Students who withdrew or unenrolled from school might be considered to have a missing outcome because they were followed up for only part of the school year. We retained these students in the primary analysis but conducted 2 sensitivity analyses. In the first sensitivity analysis, we excluded these students entirely, which is appropriate under an assumption of missing data completely at random.<sup><xref rid="zoi210909r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> In the second sensitivity analysis, we included students who unenrolled but added demographic variables to the model, which is appropriate under an assumption of missing at random.<sup><xref rid="zoi210909r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup></p>

                <p>Among students in the universal screening group, 1941 (30.0%) did not receive the PHQ-9. The main reasons included COVID-19–related school closure for 883 students (45.5%) and absences or tardiness for 653 students (33.6%). Among students in the targeted screening arm, 459 (7.1%) were erroneously offered PHQ-9 screening. This often occurred when screening was done over multiple days, because of tracking errors or grade confusion (students between grades owing to failing classes or missing credits may have been confused on their actual grade), or when students in a grade assigned to the targeted group were in a class filled primarily with students in the universal group. A total of 172 students (1.3%) did not assent to the PHQ-9 on the screening day, and 36 students (0.3%) completed the PHQ-9 twice (on separate days).</p>

                <p>Of 1226 students who screened positive, 929 (75.8%) lacked SAP confirmation that referral was warranted. In more than 80% of cases, although direct referral to outside services or meetings with school staff were recorded, no further information was documented by the school SAP, so students did not meet criteria for the primary outcome (eTable 2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-ZOI210909-1-s">Supplement 2</xref>). Among 297 students confirmed with MDD symptoms in need of follow-up, 180 (60.6%) failed to engage in services or treatment. The primary reasons were inability to obtain parental permission (81 [45.0%]), the student already being in treatment (61 [33.9%]), and student refusal (20 [11.1%]) (eTable 3 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-ZOI210909-1-s">Supplement 2</xref>).</p>
                <p>A total of 337 students unenrolled during the school year, 121 (1.9%) from the targeted screening group and 216 (3.3%) from the universal screening group. Students who unenrolled were more likely to be male, non-Hispanic Black, in urban schools, and in the universal screening group. A sensitivity analysis excluding students who unenrolled during the school year did not appreciably change the estimates, nor did a sensitivity analysis in which demographic variables were added to the model.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>In a large, statewide RCT of schools with a diverse student body, universal school-based depression screening successfully doubled student initiation of MDD treatments and services, providing clear evidence of the benefit to addressing USPSTF screening beyond the clinic walls. These estimates are likely conservative owing to COVID-19–related school closures limiting screening completion (7% of students). Additionally, some positively screened students were directly referred to treatment, bypassing SAP, or were already in treatment, which precluded SAP referral. We conservatively counted these students as not meeting our primary outcome. For these reasons, the actual number of students successfully identified and treated for MDD is likely higher than recognized by our results.</p>
              <p>Subgroup analysis by sex identified more positively screened female students, consistent with national data.<sup><xref rid="zoi210909r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> However, finding no difference in treatment initiation by sex is inconsistent with national data.<sup><xref rid="zoi210909r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> The previously noted data limitations may have influenced these findings. Subgroup analysis by race and ethnicity similarly found no differences in treatment initiation, different from national data,<sup><xref rid="zoi210909r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="zoi210909r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="zoi210909r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> suggesting universal screening may increase treatment initiation for populations less likely to engage with behavioral health services. Non-Hispanic Black students had higher rates of identification by targeted screening that equalized with universal screening, suggesting that universal screening may reduce racial and ethnic bias in behavior-based referrals and support equity efforts in schools.<sup><xref rid="zoi210909r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup></p>
              <p>In more than 40% of cases with SAP-recommended services, the primary reason for failure of treatment initiation was lack of parent or student consent. Parents may be less likely to consent to treatment unless student school functioning is jeopardized. This finding identifies a need to increase parent and adolescent mental health literacy, address stigma, and streamline parental consent processes. The results have significant policy implications for state legislation regarding adolescent mental health screenings, consent, and follow-up services.<sup><xref rid="zoi210909r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="zoi210909r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="zoi210909r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Prior studies of PHQ screening among Pittsburgh-area middle and high school students<sup><xref rid="zoi210909r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> and in a southwestern US school-based clinic<sup><xref rid="zoi210909r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> increased identification and referral. The Developmental Pathways Screening Program identified emotional difficulties at the middle school transition; 15% were positive.<sup><xref rid="zoi210909r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> However, none of these studies assessed treatment initiation, a critical component of program effectiveness.</p>
              <p>Columbia University’s Teen Screen identified mental health needs with screen-positive rates of 17%.<sup><xref rid="zoi210909r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="zoi210909r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> Husky et al<sup><xref rid="zoi210909r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> used Teen Screen's model in a mental health screening RCT of 656 students at 4 Pennsylvania schools with SAP referral for identified students. Similar to SHIELD’s findings, screened students were more likely to be referred to mental health services and access services, although disparities in treatment were not addressed.<sup><xref rid="zoi210909r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Our results differ from the RCT by Guo et al<sup><xref rid="zoi210909r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> that found no effect of universal screening on treatment initiation. However, that study had a smaller sample size and younger students. Screenings were done with the PHQ-Adolescent version, which includes 2 additional items regarding suicidal thoughts.<sup><xref rid="zoi210909r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="zoi210909r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="zoi210909r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> A positive result was defined as the top 20% of results for the school (vs using individual student scores).<sup><xref rid="zoi210909r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Schools also had a large percentage of Asian students, who are less likely to engage in mental health treatment.<sup><xref rid="zoi210909r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="zoi210909r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="zoi210909r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="zoi210909r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup></p>

                <title>Strengths and Limitations</title>
                <p>To our knowledge, this was the first large-scale RCT to focus exclusively on the USPSTF recommendation for MDD screening among high school students within the school setting and to evaluate the effect on treatment initiation. Additional strengths include a diverse student population and use of existing school resources and team-based processes for referral and follow-up, supporting the reproducibility of this model.</p>
                <p>The data are limited by what information schools provided. The team clarified missing or discrepant information, but outside referrals are not routinely logged by SAP, so this information was unavailable. The COVID-19 pandemic affected universal screening completion, which biased results toward the null. Study staff involvement may have improved the number of students successfully screened. Though trained, SAP staff are not mental health professionals and were not blinded to study group, so it is possible that biases affected the management of students identified in universal vs targeted screening. Participating schools represented a diverse group of students but were contacted based on prior relationships, responded to initial inquiries, and felt their SAP teams were well equipped to handle increased referrals. The effect of screening in schools with less confidence in their SAP teams may be different. However, this self-selection is consistent with USPSTF guidelines indicating screening should be done in the context of adequate capacity to ensure follow-up.<sup><xref rid="zoi210909r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>The results of this RCT support that universal adolescent MDD screening conducted in a school system can successfully identify students who would not otherwise be detected, with increased odds of treatment initiation among identified students. Schools with strong SAP teams or comparable infrastructure are arguably the appropriate target for this screening. Future work should identify the barriers to school participation in universal screening and the means to overcome them, including an economic and resource analysis in partnership with policy makers, schools, and parents to consider the most effective means for implementation nationally.</p>
