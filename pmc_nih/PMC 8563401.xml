                <sec>
                  <title>Purpose:</title>
                  <p>In metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) low serum androgens prior to starting abiraterone acetate (AA) is associated with more rapid progression. We evaluated the effect of AA on androgens in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) metastases and associations of intratumoral androgens with response.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Experimental Design:</title>
                  <p>We performed a phase II study of AA plus prednisone in mCRPC. The primary outcome was tissue testosterone at 4 weeks. Exploratory outcomes were association of steroid levels and genomic alterations with response, and escalating AA to 2,000 mg at progression.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results:</title>
                  <p>Twenty-nine of 30 men were evaluable. Testosterone in metastatic biopsies became undetectable at 4 weeks (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.001). Serum and tissue dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) remained detectable in many patients and was not increased at progression. Serum and tissue DHEAS in the lowest quartile (pretreatment), serum DHEAS in the lowest quartile (4 weeks), and undetectable tissue DHEAS (on-therapy) associated with rapid progression (20 vs. 48 weeks, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.0018; 20 vs. 52 weeks, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.0003; 14 vs. 40 weeks, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.0001; 20 vs. 56 weeks, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.02, respectively). One of 16 men escalating to 2,000 mg had a 30% PSA decline; 13 developed radiographic progression by 12 weeks. Among patients with high serum DHEAS at baseline, wild-type (WT) PTEN status associated with longer response (61 vs. 33 weeks, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.02).</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions:</title>
                  <p>Low-circulating adrenal androgen levels are strongly associated with an androgen-poor tumor microenvironment and with poor response to AA. Patients with CRPC with higher serum DHEAS levels may benefit from dual androgen receptor (AR)-pathway inhibition, while those in the lowest quartile may require combinations with non–AR-directed therapy.</p>

              <p>In men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), low-circulating adrenal androgens levels are strongly associated with an androgen-poor tumor microenvironment, with lower androgen levels while on-therapy, and with poor response to abiraterone acetate (AA) plus prednisone. While response to AA is clearly linked with its ability to suppress circulating and intratumor androgen levels, the paradoxical association of lower adrenal androgen levels while on-therapy with more rapid radiographic progression suggests an intrinsic resistance to androgen receptor (AR)-pathway therapy related to tumor outgrowth in a low androgen microenvironment. These data suggest that clinical benefit from dual-AR pathway inhibition is likely to be observed in patients with higher serum adrenal androgen levels, but will be limited in those with low/undetectable levels in whom treatment combinations with non–AR-directed therapy are likely to be required. Assessment of baseline and on-treatment androgen levels can inform the stratification and interpretation of trials evaluating the efficacy of AR pathway–directed therapy.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>While initially effective, treatment of prostate cancer with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is uniformly characterized by progression to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Despite castrate-serum testosterone (T) levels, levels of T and DHT in CRPC metastases and patient-derived xenografts (PDX) are sufficient for androgen receptor (AR) activation (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1, 2</xref>). Residual androgens in CRPC tumors may reflect <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> androgen synthesis or intratumoral uptake and conversion of adrenally derived steroid precursors to T and DHT (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3, 4</xref>). In particular, serum levels of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), the primary circulating form of the adrenal androgen DHEA, are extremely high and are not suppressed by ADT (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5, 6</xref>).</p>
              <p>CYP17A, expressed in the adrenal gland, testes, and ovary, catalyzes sequential reactions converting pregnenolone and progesterone to the adrenal androgens DHEA and androstenedione (AED). The role of adrenal androgens in promoting CRPC is supported by the efficacy of the CYP17A inhibitor abiraterone acetate (AA) in decreasing circulating adrenal androgens and improving overall survival (OS) in CRPC (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7–10</xref>). The proposed mechanism is suppression of androgen levels in tumor tissue as a result of suppressing testicular, adrenal, and tumoral CYP17A activity. This regimen markedly decreases prostate androgens below that achieved by standard ADT in the neoadjuvant setting (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) and studies using CRPC xenografts similarly demonstrate suppression of tissue androgens below castration alone (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). However, the efficacy of AA and prednisone in reducing intratumoral androgens in CRPC metastases has not been reported. Moreover, lower serum androgen levels prior to starting this regimen have been associated with worse outcomes in patients with CRPC (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12, 13</xref>). Whether a similar association exists with intratumoral androgen levels prior to starting therapy, or with on-treatment androgen levels in serum or tissue is unknown.</p>
              <p>We carried out a phase II study to evaluate the efficacy of AA plus prednisone in reducing androgen levels in CRPC metastases. The primary outcome was tissue T levels at 4 weeks. Exploratory outcomes were the association of steroid levels and genomic alterations with response, and the impact of escalating AA to 2,000 mg at progression.</p>

                <p>This was an investigator-initiated open-label single-center three-arm study of AA (1,000 mg daily) and prednisone (5 mg twice daily) followed by escalation of AA to 2,000 mg daily at disease progression in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Eligible patients had metastatic prostate cancer resistant to ADT comprised of medical or surgical castration ± standard antiandrogen (bicalutamide, flutamide, or nilutamide) and were not previously treated with AA or enzalutamide. Prior ketoconazole and docetaxel were allowed.</p>

                <p>Patients underwent pretreatment biopsy of a bone, node, or soft-tissue metastasis and were then alternately enrolled in cohorts undergoing repeat biopsy at 4 weeks (cohort 1) or 12 weeks (cohort 2) until 10 patients were enrolled in each cohort (Study Schema provided in Supplementary Fig. S1). Patients with radiographic or clinical progression prior to planned biopsy were reassigned to cohort 3 (biopsy at progression) and another patient placed in cohort 1 or 2. After cohorts 1 and 2 were filled, patients were sequentially assigned to cohort 3 with biopsy at progression, until a total of 10 patients were enrolled in cohort 3 (of these, 2 had been reassigned from cohort 1 or 2 for clinical progression at 4 and 8 weeks). Patients remained on ADT and received AA 1,000 mg orally daily with prednisone 5 mg orally twice daily until development of radiographic or clinical progression. CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, and bone scan were obtained before enrollment and every 12 weeks while on study treatment. Radiographic progression was determined based on Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 (PCWG2) criteria. Serum for PSA was drawn monthly. At radiographic progression asymptomatic patients were offered dose escalation of AA to 2,000 mg daily. Therapy with standard or dose-escalated AA was continued until radiographic or clinical progression or for a maximum of 2 years (104 weeks).</p>

Twenty of 29 (69%) achieved a PSA decline of ≥30% (PSA30) after 12 weeks of standard-dose AA plus prednisone (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>), with 22 (75%) eventually doing so. The median time-to-progression was longer in those achieving PSA30 decline at 12 weeks (40 vs. 34 weeks; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.05; with a similar but nonsignificant trend in those achieving a PSA50 decline; Supplementary Fig. S3A and S3B; ref. <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Notably, 4 of the 9 patients without PSA30 at 12 weeks had responses lasting 36, 40, 41, and 104 months, underscoring the importance of radiographic progression versus PSA decline as a primary endpoint. Three patients withdrew while responding to therapy (1 each to pursue alternative therapy, for religious reasons, and due to diagnosis of an unrelated malignancy) and were censored at the time of study withdrawal (at 28, 24, and 20 months). Three patients did not progress on standard-dose therapy by the end of the 2-year treatment period and were censored at 104 months.</p>

                <p>At radiographic progression, 16 of 29 patients underwent dose escalation of AA to 2,000 mg per day (with continuation of prednisone). There was no decrease in the median PSA (Supplementary Fig. S3C), with only 1 patient achieving a PSA30 decline (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). Thirteen patients had clinical or radiographic progression and discontinued therapy by week 12 after dose escalation. Two patients remained on dose-escalated therapy for 56 weeks and 36 weeks, respectively, prior to second radiographic progression, while 1 patient remained on dose-escalated therapy for 20 weeks at which time he reached the end of the 2-year treatment period and was censored at 104 months. No consistent findings with regards to PSA, steroid, or abiraterone levels, or tumor genomic alterations were observed in these 3 patients.</p>

                <title>Steroid and abiraterone levels during standard and dose-escalated AA therapy</title>
                <p>Steroid levels in serum and tissue prior to and during AA and prednisone therapy are summarized in Supplementary Tables S1 and S2. Serum levels showed a significant increase in steroids upstream of CYP17A (pregnenolone) and decreases in downstream steroids (DHEAS, DHEA, AED, T, and DHT) at all timepoints (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>; see steroid metabolism schema, Supplementary Fig. S4), consistent with prior observations in serum and urine (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). While median levels of DHEAS and DHEA decreased by over two orders of magnitude in response to therapy in all patients, there appeared to be two modes of response. In one, levels became undetectable by week 4 and remained undetectable, while in the other subset, levels were still detectable at week 4 and remained detectable at all time points of treatment. AED, T, and DHT in serum were largely undetectable at all time points after starting therapy. Serum steroids were not increased at progression compared with earlier time points.</p>
                <p>In tissue as in serum, steroids upstream of CYP17A (pregnenolone) were increased in the on-treatment tissue biopsies, while downstream steroids [DHEAS, AED, T, androsterone (ASD)] were significantly decreased (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). Levels of AED, T, and ASD in tissue fell below the limit of detection by week 4 and remained essentially undetectable. DHEAS in tissue remained detectable in the majority of biopsies obtained at 4 and 12 weeks (6 of 9 and 6 of 7, respectively), but was undetectable in 6 of 9 samples at progression. DHT levels were below the limit of detection in 24 of 29 tissue samples at baseline and undetectable in all tissues after therapy. These observations suggest that an increase in tissue levels of androgens is not responsible for resistance to AA and prednisone and explains the lack of response to AA dose escalation.</p>
                <p>AA is a prodrug that rapidly dissociates to abiraterone once ingested, therefore, all serum and tissue measurements are of abiraterone, not AA (summarized in Supplementary Table S3). Abiraterone is converted by 3βHSD1 to D4-abiraterone, and then by SRD5A to 3-keto-5α-abiraterone, metabolites with AR antagonist and AR-agonist activity, respectively (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Levels of abiraterone metabolites in serum and tissue were similar at all time points and were not decreased at progression compared with earlier time points (Supplementary Fig. S5A and S5B). These observations suggest that resistance to AA is not associated with an increase in serum steroid levels or decrease in serum or tissue drug levels at the time of progression.</p>
                <p>Dose escalation of AA from 1,000 mg to 2,000 mg resulted in the expected pharmacokinetic changes with a nonsignificant increase in the median level of abiraterone (22.4 to 78.2 ng/mL), and a significant increase in D4-abiraterone (1.48 to 4.0; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.012) and 3-keto-5α-abiraterone (10.6 to 14.3 ng/mL; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.005) at 4 weeks (Supplementary Fig. S5C). Accordingly, serum levels of DHEAS and DHEA decreased in 9 of 16 patients, and AED levels remained or became undetectable in 15 of 16 (Supplementary Fig. S5D), although the overall decrease in median levels was nonsignificant for DHEAS and DHEA, and of borderline significance for AED (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.21, 0.36, and 0.06, respectively). These observations suggest that the lack of clinical response to AA dose escalation is not accounted for by a failure of pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic responses in serum. Moreover, in the 3 patients that experienced prolonged responses, serum abiraterone and androgen levels after dose escalation were variably altered (decreased in 2 and increased in 1), although changes in tissue levels before and after dose escalation were not assayed.</p>

                <p>Serum levels of DHEAS, DHEA, AED, ASD, T, and DHT, were highly correlated with each other and with levels of DHEAS, AED, and ASD in pretreatment biopsies (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>).

These treatment-related correlations were present by 4 weeks and became notably more pronounced at 8 and 12 weeks.

                <p>These baseline and on-treatment steroid correlations are further illustrated by the observation that subjects with baseline serum DHEAS levels above versus below the median also had higher baseline levels of DHEA, AED, T, DHT, and ASD (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>) and maintained significantly higher serum levels of DHEAS (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>) and DHEA (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>) at all time points [including, for DHEAS, at the end-of-study (EOS) measurement taken at progression]. Moreover, strong correlations between baseline and on-treatment serum levels were observed at all time points for DHEAS (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>), and at 4 and 8 weeks for DHEA (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). Likewise, subjects with baseline serum DHEAS above versus below the median had higher tissue levels of DHEAS, AED, and ASD at baseline (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>), as well as higher DHEAS in on-treatment tissue biopsies (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref>). These observations demonstrate that serum DHEAS levels prior to AA therapy can identify patients with CRPC with concomitantly higher levels of all androgens in serum and tissue, and that this subset of patients with high baseline androgen levels maintains persistently higher serum and tissue DHEAS levels after treatment with AA and prednisone.</p>

Median serum levels of DHEAS and DHEA at baseline were also numerically lower in patients with <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> loss versus WT <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.053 and 0.047, respectively; Supplementary Fig. S7C). These observations suggest that while specific AR-independent tumor drivers such as <italic toggle="yes">PTEN</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> may be selected to emerge in a low-androgen environment, a low-androgen environment is likely to promotes a more aggressive tumor biology by multiple mechanisms not limited to specific pathway alterations.</p>

                <title>Association of <italic toggle="yes">HSD3B1</italic> genotype with steroid and abiraterone levels and radiographic PFS</title>
                <p>The 1245C variant of <italic toggle="yes">HSD3B1</italic> produces a more stable enzyme, increasing conversion of DHEA to AED, a precursor of T and DHT (Supplementary Fig. S4), as well as increasing conversion of abiraterone to D4-abiraterone (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Germline DNA testing identified 14 men who were homozygous WT (48%), 10 men who were heterozygous (34%), and 6 who were homozygous for the allelic variant (21%). Consistent with the impact of the variant on enhancing conversion of abiraterone to D4-abiraterone, serum levels of this metabolite were highest in subjects with two variant alleles (median 2.7 ng/mL) versus one variant allele (2.1 ng/mL) versus two WT alleles (1.2 ng/mL; ANOVA <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.02; Supplementary Fig. S8A). Serum levels of 3-keto-5α-abiraterone did not differ by <italic toggle="yes">HSDB1</italic> genotype, nor did levels of abiraterone metabolite in tissue (Supplementary Fig. S8A). There was no difference in serum or tissue-androgen levels based on <italic toggle="yes">HSD3B1</italic> status (including the five tissue samples with detectable levels of DHT; Supplementary Fig. S8B), nor in time-to-progression (Supplementary Fig. S8C).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>In this phase II study we demonstrate that in mCRPC AA plus prednisone decreases T levels in metastatic tissue biopsies to undetectable by 4 and 12 weeks of therapy, consistent with the predicted mechanism of activity. Steroid and abiraterone levels in serum and tissue remained stable at progression compared with earlier time points, consistent with prior reports regarding serum adrenal androgens (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), but demonstrating for the first time that tissue-androgen levels also remain unchanged at progression. Overall, these findings suggest that the development of resistance to AA plus prednisone is not accounted for by a decrease in serum or tissue drug levels below the levels originally achieved in response to therapy. Nor is it accounted for by an increase in serum or intratumoral androgens above the levels originally achieved in response to AA plus prednisone. The observations that tumor steroid levels do not become reelevated at progression and that persistent serum DHEAS levels do not become undetectable after dose escalation of AA to 2,000 mg likely accounts for the lack of clinical response to high-dose AA at progression, now reported in two studies (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>).</p>
              <p>At baseline, serum levels of DHEAS and DHEA varied by over an order of magnitude (range 36–2,659 ng/mL) and demonstrated two patterns of response to treatment. While median levels of steroids downstream of CYP17A decreased by a similar order of magnitude in all patients, the subset of patients defined by higher serum DHEAS levels prior to therapy also had higher serum levels of other steroids at baseline; higher levels of DHEAS, AED, and ASD in pretreatment tissue biopsies; and maintained higher DHEAS levels in on-treatment serum samples and tissue biopsies. These observations demonstrate that serum DHEAS levels prior to therapy can distinguish patients with correspondingly lower or higher serum and tissue levels of all androgens and can identify those likely to maintain persistent serum and tissue DHEAS levels while on treatment with AA plus prednisone.</p>
              <p>The correlation of low baseline with low on-treatment adrenal-androgen levels is of particular interest as lower adrenal androgens prior to therapy have been consistently associated with worse response to AA plus prednisone (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13, 23–25</xref>). We show for the first time that this association with worse outcomes extends to low on-treatment level of DHEAS in serum and tissue, and with low adrenal androgens in pretreatment metastasis biopsies. At baseline, the association of worse response with lower levels was highly significant for DHEAS in serum (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.0018) and for DHEAS and AED in pretreatment tissue biopsies (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.0003 and <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.0002, respectively). On therapy, serum DHEAS in the lowest quartile at 4 and 8 weeks (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.0001 and 0.024, respectively), as well as undetectable versus detectable DHEAS levels in metastatic biopsies taken at 4 and 12 weeks (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.023 and <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.04, respectively) all associated with more rapid progression on AA therapy. These specific associations with DHEAS are consistent with the fact that DHEAS is the predominant steroid in serum and tissue prior to therapy, and remains the only steroid consistently present at measurable levels in metastatic tissue after AA therapy.</p>
              <p>While response to AA is clearly linked with suppression of circulating and intratumor androgens, the paradoxical association of better outcomes with higher on-treatment androgen levels suggests that response to AA is not dictated solely by a pharmacodynamic effect on serum or tissue androgens, but may reflect an intrinsic resistance to AR-pathway therapy associated with tumor outgrowth in a low androgen microenvironment (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). These observations suggest that baseline serum androgen levels, by identifying patients with a more aggressive tumor biology that is less androgen dependent, may be prognostic as well as predictive of response to AR-pathway–directed therapy. As such, patients with higher androgens may have better survival independent of an effect of AA. This is consistent with the association of lower serum androgen levels with decreased survival in both the placebo and AA arms of the phase III study of AA plus prednisone in men with mCRPC (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), and with a recent meta-analysis demonstrating that PFS and OS were lower in patients with CRPC with lower versus higher T levels (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>).</p>
              <p>Importantly, the observation that lower androgen levels in CRPC associate with worse outcomes is not incompatible with data linking the achievement of lower T levels with improved time-to-progression in men with CSPC treated with ADT (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28, 29</xref>). While time-to-development of CRPC may be delayed, CRPC tumors that emerge in patients with lower T levels (due to low adrenal contribution and/or optimally suppressed T levels while on ADT) are likely to represent a more aggressive, less androgen-dependent phenotype compared with tumors that emerge with more rapid kinetics in context of higher androgen levels (due to more robust adrenal contribution and/or suboptimally suppressed T levels). While this may not influence response to subsequent non–AR-specific agents such as docetaxel, it is likely to adversely influence response to next-generation AR-targeted therapy. This is consistent with findings in the meta-analysis discussed above, in which lower T levels were a consistently poor prognostic factor for OS in patients with CRPC treated with AR-targeting agents, but not in those treated with chemotherapy (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>).</p>
              <p>The significant variation in adrenal androgen levels is not well understood. Functional polymorphisms in genes encoding critical steroidogenic enzymes such as CYP17A, HSD3B1, SULT2A1, AKR1C3, SRD5A, and UGT2B17 influence enzyme activity and/or production of downstream steroids (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21, 30–32</xref>). Population-based studies will be required to determine whether a composite haplotype of genes involved in adrenal androgen production exists that may account for the observed spectrum of serum androgen levels. Alternatively, the variability might reflect genetic variation in regulatory factors such as <italic toggle="yes">CYB5A1, NR5A1</italic> (also known as SF-1 or steroidogenic factor 1), or <italic toggle="yes">MC2R</italic> [the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) receptor] that are upstream of adrenal steroid synthesis (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33–35</xref>).</p>
              <p>We found no association of abiraterone levels with PSA decline or with time-to–radiographic progression, with nearly all patients having serum levels above the 8.4 ng/mL value previously proposed as a cutoff for PSA response (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). This contrasts with the observation of Friedlander and colleagues who found in a study of 41 men with mCRPC that patients who failed to show a PSA response to AA had lower abiraterone levels after 4 weeks and at progression (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). This difference may reflect variability in timing of the blood draws, which, while mandated before the daily dose, were not specifically recorded precluding correction for differences based on pharmacokinetics (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). However, our findings are consistent with the work of Smulewitz and colleagues, who also found no correlation between abiraterone levels and change in PSA in a study of 72 men with mCRPC randomized to standard or low-dose AA (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>), as well as with an analysis performed by the FDA in which no association was found between trough abiraterone levels and OS (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>).</p>
              <p>The adrenal-permissive variant of <italic toggle="yes">HSD3B1</italic> (promotes conversion of AED and T to downstream androgens, and of abiraterone to D4-abiraterone and 3-keto-5α-abiraterone) has been consistently associated with more rapid progression on ADT (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>), and potentially with worse outcomes in response to AA and enzalutamide in some but not all studies (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40–43</xref>). Although we did find an association of <italic toggle="yes">HSD3B1</italic> status with D4-abiraterone (the immediate downstream product of <italic toggle="yes">HSD3B1)</italic>, we did not observe an association of <italic toggle="yes">HSD3B1</italic> genotype with response to abiraterone, nor the previously reported association with 3-keto-5α-abiraterone, potentially reflecting that serum levels were not corrected for differences based on pharmacokinetics. (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) However, we did observe that serum levels of 3-keto-5α-abiraterone above the median at weeks 4 and 8 were associated with a more rapid time-to-progression. These observations are consistent with the ability of this metabolite to act as an AR agonist, and suggest that dose escalation of AA may in fact be detrimental to patient outcomes. These findings provide support for the low-dose AA strategy proposed by Smulewitz (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>), and provide impetus for clinical trials combining AA therapy with an SRD5A inhibitor to prevent conversion of D4-abiraterone to 5α-keto metabolite (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44, 45</xref>).</p>
              <p>NGS of CRPC tumors has identified aberrations in multiple genes including <italic toggle="yes">AR, TP53, PTEN</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">SPOP</italic> which have been explored as predictive biomarkers of response to AR-pathway inhibition. In this small study we found no association of AR, TP53, or SPOP status with response to AA (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">46–48</xref>). In our cohort, WT PTEN was weakly associated with longer time-to-progression on AA plus prednisone, consistent with Ferraldeschi and colleagues who reported a retrospective study of 144 patients in which PTEN loss was associated with shorter OS (14 vs. 21 months; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.004) and shorter duration of abiraterone treatment (24 vs. 28 weeks; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.009; ref. <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). Moreover, whereas poor response to AA in men with the lowest serum DHEAS levels was not additionally influenced by PTEN status, in those with higher androgen levels WT PTEN versus PTEN loss conferred a significantly longer time-to-progression (61 vs. 33 weeks; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.02). While our study is too small to meaningfully predict genomic alterations associated with response to AR-pathway inhibition, these data suggest that interpretation of tumor sequencing data may be more informative if analyzed in context of the risk conferred by low versus high serum androgen levels.</p>
              <p>This study has several important limitations, including small sample size, that abiraterone and metabolite levels were not corrected for pharmacokinetic differences based on timing of trough blood draws, and that analyses were exploratory with no attempt to correct for multiple testing. As such, our observations must be considered hypothesis generating and require validation in larger data sets.</p>
              <p>Our data show that higher circulating adrenal androgens in patients with CRPC are strongly associated with an androgen-rich tumor microenvironment before and during therapy with AA and prednisone, and suggest that ambient androgen levels in the castrate tumor microenvironment are an important determinant of prostate-tumor biology and response to therapy (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Baseline and on-treatment androgen levels are likely to be important in the stratification and interpretation of trials evaluating AR-pathway–directed therapy. In particular, while addition of AA to enzalutamide did not prolong survival in metastatic CRPC (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>), higher baseline DHEAS levels may distinguish a subset of patients who do benefit from dual-AR therapy. Conversely, patients with CRPC in the lowest quartile of serum DHEAS levels may warrant stratification to regimens that include non–AR-directed therapy. Whether adrenal androgens associate with response to AA in metastatic CSPC is unknown but requires exploration. Prospective studies evaluating baseline and on-treatment androgen levels as predictive biomarkers of response to AR-directed therapy are required to test these hypotheses.</p>
