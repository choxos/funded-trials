                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Despite current resuscitation strategies, circulatory shock and organ injury after cardiac surgery occur in 25–40% of patients. Goal-directed resuscitation after cardiac surgery has generated significant interest, but clinical practice to normalize hemodynamic variables including mean arterial pressure, cardiac filling pressures, and cardiac output may not reverse microcirculation abnormalities and do not address cellular dysoxia. Recent advances in technology have made it possible to measure critical components of oxygen delivery and oxygen utilization systems in live human tissues and blood cells. The MicroRESUS study will be the first study to measure microcirculatory and mitochondrial function in patients with circulatory shock and link these findings with clinical outcomes.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>This will be a prospective, observational study that includes patients undergoing elective cardiovascular surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Microcirculation will be quantified with sublingual incident dark field videomicroscopy. Mitochondrial respiration will be measured by performing a substrate–uncoupler–inhibitor titration protocol with high resolution respirometry on peripheral blood mononuclear cells at baseline and serial timepoints during resuscitation and at recovery as a possible liquid biomarker. Plasma samples will be preserved for future analysis to examine endothelial injury and other mechanisms of microcirculatory dysfunction. Thirty-day ventilator and vasopressor-free days (VVFDs) will be measured as a primary outcome, along with sequential organ failure assessment scores, and other clinical parameters to determine if changes in microcirculation and mitochondrial respiration are more strongly associated with clinical outcomes compared to traditional resuscitation targets.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p>This will be the first prospective study to examine both microcirculatory and mitochondrial function in human patients with circulatory shock undergoing cardiac bypass and address a key mechanistic knowledge gap in the cardiovascular literature. The results of this study will direct future research efforts and therapeutic development for patients with shock.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Despite current resuscitation practices, circulatory shock and perioperative organ injury after cardiac surgery occur in 25–40% of patients [<xref rid="pone.0273349.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0273349.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Traditionally, causes of shock after cardiovascular surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass are classified by macrocirculatory derangements (e.g. low cardiac output, vasoplegia, hypovolemia) [<xref rid="pone.0273349.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Interventions to normalize hemodynamic variables, including mean arterial pressure, cardiac filling pressures, and cardiac output restore the large vessel (macrocirculatory) pressure and flow targets but may not reverse underrecognized disruptions in microcirculatory blood flow and oxygen utilization. Current methods to estimate the balance of oxygen delivery (DO<sub>2</sub>) relative to demand (VO<sub>2</sub>) include blood gas-derived calculations and the measurement of downstream biomarkers of anaerobic metabolism such as blood lactate. Using these methods, previous literature has concluded that lactic acidosis after cardiac surgery is unlikely related to inadequate oxygen delivery [<xref rid="pone.0273349.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Unfortunately these inferences fail to consider the presence of regional blood flow derangements caused by pathologic microcirculatory heterogeneity, which are also associated with severity of postoperative lactic acidosis and organ injury [<xref rid="pone.0273349.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0273349.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. To resolve this important clinical discrepancy, a deeper understanding of the determinants of oxygen transport pathways and oxygen utilization during health, shock, and resuscitation are needed.</p>
              <p>The microcirculation is composed of a network of vessels including arterioles, capillaries, and venules &lt;100 μm in diameter where red blood cells (RBCs), leukocytes, and plasma components interface with the vascular endothelium to allow metabolic substrate exchange. Changes in microcirculatory blood flow can be caused by inflammatory-mediated vascular endothelial injury, microthrombosis, or an inadequate balance between vasoconstrictive and vasodilating agents leading to a global or heterogeneous reduction in capillary blood flow [<xref rid="pone.0273349.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0273349.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Incident dark field (IDF) videomicroscopy is a novel, handheld method that can directly image the human microcirculation in real time. Current generation IDF videomicroscopy has improved imaging resolution compared to previous generation devices, and can detect up to 30% more capillaries compared to side stream imaging [<xref rid="pone.0273349.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0273349.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. As a result, important determinants of tissue oxygenation, such as microcirculatory diffusive and convective properties, can now be more accurately quantified.</p>
              <p>Blood gas derived calculations of VO<sub>2</sub>/DO<sub>2</sub> balance may provide false clinical reassurance as they cannot identify microvascular injury, microvascular shunting, and other mechanisms of dysoxia which may contribute to cell injury and organ dysfunction in patients with shock [<xref rid="pone.0273349.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Advancements in high resolution respirometry now make it possible to quantify mitochondrial respiration rapidly and reliably in live tissues [<xref rid="pone.0273349.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Nucleated blood cells (platelets and peripheral blood mononuclear cells) are readily accessible and can be used as surrogates to study cellular respiration in acute care illnesses such as acute heart failure, hemorrhagic shock, sepsis, and patients with ischemic reperfusion injury [<xref rid="pone.0273349.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0273349.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. It is unclear if deficiencies in oxygen delivery and utilization occur independently or concomitantly in patients with shock. Studies that simultaneously examine mitochondrial respiration and microcirculatory function, which are also tied to clinical outcomes, are vitally important to guide future research efforts in therapeutic development and perform effective interventional trials.</p>

                <title>Incident dark field microscopy</title>
                <p>Sublingual microcirculation imaging will be performed using handheld incident dark field (IDF) videomicroscopy (CytoCam, Braedius Medical BV, the Netherlands) at four time points during the enrollment period. Imaging will be performed by the Principal Investigator or trained research personnel. Video sequences are obtained by placing the CytoCam device should sublingual space and maneuvered so that pressure and motion do not result in image artifact (<xref rid="pone.0273349.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). A series of successive video clips (3–5 clips of at least 120 frames or 6 seconds in length) should be captured in distinct areas of the sublingual space to account for vessel heterogeneity. Focus and lighting during video capture may be adjusted to optimize image acquisition. Baseline (T<sub>0h</sub>) imaging will be obtained in the preoperative area prior to surgery on the day of the scheduled operation. Repeated measurements will be obtained upon arrival to the ICU (0–2 hours after surgery, T<sub>2h</sub>), during ongoing resuscitation (2–4 hours post-op, T<sub>4h</sub>), and on post-operative day one after recovery (T<sub>24h</sub>).</p>

                <p>Prior to analysis, video quality will be assessed using the 6-factor Massey quality score, which uses a semiquantitative assessment of each video for appropriate illumination, duration, focus, content, stability, and pressure. Only videos with Massey scores of &lt;10 will be included for further analysis [<xref rid="pone.0273349.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Three videos with the best quality score will be selected for further processing. All IDF images will be coded then analyzed using an offline, dedicated software (Automated Vascular Analysis v3.02, Microvision Medical, The Netherlands). Microvascular flow index (MFI), microcirculatory heterogeneity index (MHI), total vessel density (TVD), proportion of perfused vessels (PPV), and perfused vessel density (PVD). Individual microvessel flow will be scored as 0 = no flow, 1 = intermittent flow, 2 = sluggish flow, or 3 = continuous flow. Vessels will be considered perfused if they are scored as either sluggish or continuous flow. To ensure only vessels contributing to tissue gas exchange and metabolism are included, only vessels &lt; 20 μm in diameter will be analyzed. This process follows the current standard for microcirculation measurement and analysis [<xref rid="pone.0273349.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Interobserver variation will be tested periodically in at least 10% of the subject videos to ensure minimal scoring heterogeneity between investigators.</p>

Arterial blood gas samples will be obtained by clinical staff every 1–2 hours for the first 6 hours after ICU admission based on current clinical practice. Central venous blood gas measurements will also be obtained by the study team at the time of microcirculation measurement. Hemoglobin, hematocrit, pH, PaO<sub>2</sub>, PaCO<sub>2</sub>, and glucose are also reported on each blood gas analysis. After 6 hours, blood gas analysis will be performed as needed by the clinical team. For biomarker and mitochondrial function analysis, enrolled patients will undergo phlebotomy with volumes of 15 mL drawn into K<sub>2</sub>EDTA tubes. Blood samples will then be centrifuged at room temperature using Ficoll-Paque<sup>TM</sup> PLUS (GE) and Leucosep tubes (Greiner Bio-one). Plasma specimens will be stored at -80°C for later evaluation of the mechanisms of microcirculatory dysfunction. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) will undergo further analysis and processing as detailed below.</p>

                <title>Mitochondrial respiration</title>
                <p>A population of PBMCs will be obtained and analyzed from the plasma buffy coat within 1 hour of blood draw. A cell count and viability will be calculated using the Cell Countess II (Invitrogen) with trypan blue exclusion. Between 4–5 x 10<sup>6</sup> PBMCs will be used for respiration analysis and residual PBMCs will be processed and stored at-80°C for future quantitative PCR. Unless otherwise specified, all reagents will be obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and Invitrogen.</p>
                <p>Mitochondrial respiration will be analyzed using an Oroboros O2k-FluoRespirometer (Oroboros Instruments, Innsbruck, Austria) with a substrate–uncoupler–inhibitor titration (SUIT) protocol and MiR05 buffer [<xref rid="pone.0273349.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The SUIT protocol measures oxidative phosphorylation capacity with electron flow through complex I (CI) and complex II (CI + CII) using malate, pyruvate, glutamate, and flavin adenine dinucleotide-linked substrate succinate in the presence of adenosine diphosphate. The addition of digitonin allows for the measurement of specific complex-linked activity. Oligomycin, an inhibitor of the ATP synthase, uncouples respiration from ATP-synthase activity to measure respiration where the O<sub>2</sub> consumption is dependent on the leakiness the mitochondrial membrane and back-flux of protons into the mitochondrial matrix independent of ATP synthase (LEAK<sub>CI+CII</sub>). Maximal convergent non-phosphorylating respiration of ETS<sub>CI+CII</sub> is evaluated by titrating the protonophore, carbonyl cyanide p-(trifluoromethoxy) phenylhydrazone. ETS<sub>CI+CII</sub> is considered a stress test for mitochondria, a marker of mitochondrial respiratory reserve. Non-phosphorylating respiration specifically through CII (ETS<sub>CII</sub>) is achieved through the addition of rotenone, an inhibitor of CI. The complex III (CIII) inhibitor antimycin-A is added to measure the residual non-mitochondrial oxygen consumption, and this value is subtracted from each of the measured respiratory states to provide only mitochondrial respiration. Complex IV (CIV)-linked respiration will be measured by the addition of ascorbate with N,N,N,N-tetramethyl-phenylenediamine. The CIV inhibitor sodium azide will be added to reveal the chemical background that is subtracted from the N,N,N,N-tetramethyl-phenylenediamine-induced oxygen consumption rate. Mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production will be measured using the Amplex UltraRed method [<xref rid="pone.0273349.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. All data will be acquired using DatLab 7 (Oroboros Instruments, Innsbruck, Austria) and respiration value will be normalized to cell count.</p>

                <title>Outcome measures</title>
                <p>Our hypothesis is that patients with poor post-operative sublingual functional capillary density (defined as a PVD &lt; 22 mm/mm<sup>2</sup> and MHI &gt; 0.4) will have a higher degree of postoperative cardiovascular and pulmonary organ injury compared to patients with normal postoperative microcirculation. The primary outcome for this study will be VVFDs during the first 30 days after surgery. This outcome was chosen because our elective cardiac surgery patients are managed using early recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols, with a goal to be extubated and weaned off vasopressors within 24 hours after surgery [<xref rid="pone.0273349.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0273349.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. VVFDs will be calculated as a reverse count of consecutive days without requiring ICU-level respiratory or vasopressor support (<xref rid="pone.0273349.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). Our research group has used a similar primary outcome in a previous clinical trial [<xref rid="pone.0273349.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The day of operation (day zero) will not be included as all patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery with CPB require mechanical ventilation and vasoactive medications on the day of surgery. Ventilator days will include mechanical ventilation via endotracheal tube or tracheostomy, high-flow nasal cannula ≥ 40 liters/minute with an FiO2 &gt; 40%, or non-invasive positive pressure ventilation not prescribed at home. Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation and HFNC will be included as these both require the patient to remain in our ICU. Vasoactives include epinephrine, norepinephrine, vasopressin, phenylephrine, dobutamine, or milrinone at any dose. Subjects in need of respiratory or vasopressor support on day 30, or die before day 30 will be assigned zero VVFDs. If the patient is discharged prior to hospital day 30 a “last status carried forward” approach will be used. Secondary outcomes will include sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score on day 1, day 3, diagnosis of acute kidney injury (defined as an increse in serum creatinine ≥ 0.3 mg/dL within 2 days), and hospital length of stay.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Goal-directed resuscitation strategies have improved postoperative clinical outcomes over the past two decades, but many patients continue to experience significant morbidity including multiorgan dysfunction after cardiac surgery [<xref rid="pone.0273349.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The evolution of previous technologies has made it possible to evaluate real-time microcirculatory function and perform rapid analysis of mitochondrial respiration in critically ill adults, which make it possible to explore alternative mechanisms of organ injury not addressed by current resuscitation practices.</p>
              <p>It is not fully known if there is a discordance between macrocirculatory hemodynamic targets and microcirculatory blood flow, as this has only been shown in studies with a generally small sample size. Of particular interest will be early differences in microcirculatory and mitochondrial function in patients with and without post-operative shock. In order to improve outcomes of these critically ill patients and prevent unnecessary perioperative morbidity, examination of mechanisms not addressed by standard resuscitation practices must be explored.</p>
              <p>We recognize that there may be some limitations to using the sublingual site to estimate global microcirculatory function and PBMCs to estimate of global mitochondrial function in a diverse, clinical patient population. To minimize differences between patients, we plan to match patient groups for comorbidities such as diabetes, coronary artery disease, and medications that could depress mitochondrial function. The sublingual microcirculation is embryologically related to the gastrointestinal tract, and has been correlated with splanchnic circulation which is one of the most significant lactate producers during shock [<xref rid="pone.0273349.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Additionally, PBMCs have been found to correlate with renal and cardiac mitochondrial function in hemorrhagic shock [<xref rid="pone.0273349.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Our team has shown that PBMC mitochondrial ROS (mROS) track closely with brain tissue mROS in an ischemia-reperfusion model) [<xref rid="pone.0273349.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This supports the concept of using sublingual microcirculation and PBMCs to reflect global injury.</p>
              <p>The MicroRESUS study will be the first to simultaneously examine two underrecognized, discrete causes of cellular hypoxia in human subjects with shock with consideration of important clinical outcomes. This study will address a critical gap in the literature, by simultaneously measuring microcirculatory and mitochondrial function in patients with shock and tying our findings to important clinical outcomes. Results from this study will guide future research efforts to identify, develop, and design novel therapies and interventional trials to reverse unrecognized physiologic derangements after cardiovascular surgery.</p>

              <p>1. Does the manuscript provide a valid rationale for the proposed study, with clearly identified and justified research questions?</p>
              <p>The research question outlined is expected to address a valid academic problem or topic and contribute to the base of knowledge in the field.<!-- </font> --></p>

              <p><!-- <font color="black"> -->2. Is the protocol technically sound and planned in a manner that will lead to a meaningful outcome and allow testing the stated hypotheses?</p>
              <p>The manuscript should describe the methods in sufficient detail to prevent undisclosed flexibility in the experimental procedure or analysis pipeline, including sufficient outcome-neutral conditions (e.g. necessary controls, absence of floor or ceiling effects) to test the proposed hypotheses and a statistical power analysis where applicable. As there may be aspects of the methodology and analysis which can only be refined once the work is undertaken, authors should outline potential assumptions and explicitly describe what aspects of the proposed analyses, if any, are exploratory.<!-- </font> --></p>

              <p><!-- <font color="black"> -->3. Is the methodology feasible and described in sufficient detail to allow the work to be replicable?</p>
              <p>Descriptions of methods and materials in the protocol should be reported in sufficient detail for another researcher to reproduce all experiments and analyses. The protocol should describe the appropriate controls, sample size calculations, and replication needed to ensure that the data are robust and reproducible.<!-- </font> --></p>

              <p>The <ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/materials-and-software-sharing" ext-link-type="uri">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception, at the time of publication. The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data—e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party—those must be specified.<!-- </font> --></p>

              <p>PLOS ONE does not copyedit accepted manuscripts, so the language in submitted articles must be clear, correct, and unambiguous. Any typographical or grammatical errors should be corrected at revision, so please note any specific errors here.<!-- </font> --></p>

              <p>Reviewer #1: Thank you for this great study protocol article. I only wonder if measurements are also to be done during the operation since predominantly the start of CPB may be associated with microcirculatory derangement (Den Uil et al, J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 2008). Good luck!</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: The authors provided a study protocol for microcirculatory assessment in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. As the restoration of tissue perfusion is the primary goal of hemodynamic therapy, the study is of high interest. However, I have some questions and concerns about the manuscript and the study design:</p>
              <p>1) The title of the study implies that you will investigate patients with shock. However, the inclusion criteria used do not include a marker for shock or hemodynamic instability. I think, only the minority of the included patients will suffer from shock. Please provide how shock will be defined in the study. What percentage of patients in your hospital develop shock during elective cardiac surgery procedures?</p>
              <p>2) As primary endpoint you plan to use ventilator and vasopressor-free days. Further, you state the hypothesis that patients with poor post-operative microcirculatory function will have a higher degree of postoperative organ injury compared to patients with normal postoperative microcirculation. If you want to test this hypothesis, why do you not use a score for organ failure as the primary endpoint? Which parameters and cut-off values do you use to differentiate between normal and poor microcirculation?</p>
              <p>3) In the statistics section you write "Continuous variables characterizing each study group will be reported as means with standard deviations or medians with interquartile ranges.". Which groups?</p>
              <p>4) You used a 2-day difference in ventilator and vasopressor-free days for sample size calculation. Which groups and what group sizes did you assume for this?</p>
              <p>**********</p>

              </p>
              <p>1. Does the manuscript provide a valid rationale for the proposed study, with clearly identified and justified research questions?</p>
              <p>The research question outlined is expected to address a valid academic problem or topic and contribute to the base of knowledge in the field.<!-- </font> --></p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
              <p>**********</p>
              <p><!-- <font color="black"> -->2. Is the protocol technically sound and planned in a manner that will lead to a meaningful outcome and allow testing the stated hypotheses?</p>
              <p>The manuscript should describe the methods in sufficient detail to prevent undisclosed flexibility in the experimental procedure or analysis pipeline, including sufficient outcome-neutral conditions (e.g. necessary controls, absence of floor or ceiling effects) to test the proposed hypotheses and a statistical power analysis where applicable. As there may be aspects of the methodology and analysis which can only be refined once the work is undertaken, authors should outline potential assumptions and explicitly describe what aspects of the proposed analyses, if any, are exploratory.<!-- </font> --></p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>

              <p><!-- <font color="black"> -->3. Is the methodology feasible and described in sufficient detail to allow the work to be replicable?</p>
              <p>Descriptions of methods and materials in the protocol should be reported in sufficient detail for another researcher to reproduce all experiments and analyses. The protocol should describe the appropriate controls, sample size calculations, and replication needed to ensure that the data are robust and reproducible.<!-- </font> --></p>

              <p><!-- <font color="black"> -->4. Have the authors described where all data underlying the findings will be made available when the study is complete?</p>
              <p>The <ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/materials-and-software-sharing" ext-link-type="uri">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception, at the time of publication. The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data—e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party—those must be specified.<!-- </font> --></p>

              <p>**********</p>
              <p><!-- <font color="black"> -->5. Is the manuscript presented in an intelligible fashion and written in standard English?</p>
              <p>PLOS ONE does not copyedit accepted manuscripts, so the language in submitted articles must be clear, correct, and unambiguous. Any typographical or grammatical errors should be corrected at revision, so please note any specific errors here.<!-- </font> --></p>

              <p>Please use the space provided to explain your answers to the questions above and, if applicable, provide comments about issues authors must address before this protocol can be accepted for publication. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about research or publication ethics.</p>
              <p>You may also provide optional suggestions and comments to authors that they might find helpful in planning their study.</p>

              <p>Reviewer #1: Thank you for your answer to my comment.</p>
              <p>In my opinion, the authors satisfactorily answered my question.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Microcirculatory monitoring is not available in clinical routine so far. Therefore the study is of high interest. The methody have been sufficiently described to replicate the investigation. The revision improved the manuscript, so the objectives of the study are now comprehensible and achievable with the methods used. Thank you my questions have been answered adequately.</p>
