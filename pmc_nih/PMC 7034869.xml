                <p>We have previously reported radiation-induced sensitization of canine osteosarcoma (OSA) to natural killer (NK) therapy, including results from a first-in-dog clinical trial. Here, we report correlative analyses of blood and tissue specimens for signals of immune activation in trial subjects. Among 10 dogs treated with palliative radiotherapy (RT) and intra-tumoral adoptive NK transfer, we performed ELISA on serum cytokines, flow cytometry for immune phenotype of PBMCs, and PCR on tumor tissue for immune-related gene expression. We then queried The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to evaluate the association of cytotoxic/immune-related gene expression with human sarcoma survival. Updated survival analysis revealed five 6-month survivors, including one dog who lived 17.9 months. Using feeder line co-culture for NK expansion, we observed maximal activation of dog NK cells on day 17–19 post isolation with near 100% expression of granzyme B and NKp46 and high cytotoxic function in the injected NK product. Among dogs on trial, we observed a trend for higher baseline serum IL-6 to predict worse lung metastasis-free and overall survival (P = 0.08). PCR analysis revealed low absolute gene expression of CD3, CD8, and NKG2D in untreated OSA. Among treated dogs, there was marked heterogeneity in the expression of immune-related genes pre- and post-treatment, but increases in CD3 and CD8 gene expression were higher among dogs that lived &gt; 6 months compared to those who did not. Analysis of the TCGA confirmed significant differences in survival among human sarcoma patients with high and low expression of genes associated with greater immune activation and cytotoxicity (CD3e, CD8a, IFN-γ, perforin, and CD122/IL-2 receptor beta). Updated results from a first-in-dog clinical trial of palliative RT and autologous NK cell immunotherapy for OSA illustrate the translational relevance of companion dogs for novel cancer therapies. Similar to human studies, analyses of immune markers from canine serum, PBMCs, and tumor tissue are feasible and provide insight into potential biomarkers of response and resistance.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Although approximately 60–70% of human patients with osteosarcoma (OSA) treated with standard of care multimodality therapy experience long-term survival, these numbers have remained static for the past three decades, and the survival of patients with relapsed and/or metastatic OSA is dismal [<xref rid="pone.0224775.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0224775.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Despite evidence that OSA can be recognized by the immune system [<xref rid="pone.0224775.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0224775.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], the clinical experience with immunotherapy for OSA has been disappointing. Moreover, evaluating and optimizing immunotherapy for an orphan disease where up to 70% of patients experience long-term survival is challenging. Indeed, poor compliance and retention in this patient population has been reported in the recently completed worldwide EURAMOS trial [<xref rid="pone.0224775.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], clearly demonstrating the challenges of evaluating immunotherapy in a disease with overall favorable, but variable outcomes.</p>
              <p>Companion dog OSA demonstrates remarkable similarity to the complexity and heterogeneity of human OSA [<xref rid="pone.0224775.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0224775.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Importantly, unlike murine models of cancer based on tumor injections and/or genetic-engineering, dogs develop spontaneous cancers in the setting of an intact immune system, and naturally-occurring cancers in dogs recapitulate the important host/tumor principles of immune equilibrium, immune evasion, and immune escape [<xref rid="pone.0224775.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0224775.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0224775.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In addition, the burden of dog cancer, including OSA, is significant, and some investigators have estimated that the prevalence of cancer in companion dogs is higher than that of humans [<xref rid="pone.0224775.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Since there is a less established standard of care in veterinary medicine, investigational treatments, such as immunotherapy, can be considered earlier in the course of therapy, thereby allowing for testing of novel therapies that can speed translation of innovative therapies to both dogs and humans [<xref rid="pone.0224775.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Taken together, dogs with naturally occurring cancer represent an ideal model to evaluate novel immunotherapy approaches. Trials in companion animals are an important bridge between pre-clinical testing in murine models and clinical trials in people and allow for important proof-in-concept studies of innovative new strategies. Concurrently, dog clinical trials provide key preliminary data on efficacy and toxicity in a large animal model with notable similarity to people [<xref rid="pone.0224775.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, canine trials remain nascent, and more studies are needed to underscore the generalizability of the findings, the similarities of the immune readouts, and the validation of key reagents.</p>
              <p>Given our preliminary data showing that radiotherapy (RT) sensitizes tumors, including sarcomas, to NK cytotoxicity as well as the unmet need for effective immunotherapy in OSA [<xref rid="pone.0224775.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], we previously conducted a clinical trial in dogs of palliative RT plus intra-tumoral autologous NK transfer in dogs with non-metastatic OSA whose owners elected not to pursue amputation or cytotoxic chemotherapy [<xref rid="pone.0224775.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. As part of this clinical trial, we collected serial blood and tumor specimens pre- and post-treatment to assess serum cytokines, to evaluate immune phenotype of circulating PBMCs, and to analyze gene expression in tumor tissue. Our objective was to analyze blood and tissue specimens as correlates of clinical response to NK/RT immunotherapy, and we hypothesized that analysis of blood and tumor tissue would further validate the dog model for canine immunotherapy studies and would provide preliminary evidence of local or systemic immune response to treatment for testing in a larger trial. As our clinical trial enrollment in dogs was small, we also queried The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to analyze the association of intra-tumoral immune gene expression with survival in human sarcomas to further inform the relevance of dog sarcomas in the evaluation of novel immunotherapy approaches on the path to human clinical testing.</p>

In brief, dogs were considered eligible if they were diagnosed with locally advanced, non-metastatic OSA, had adequate end organ function, and were not pursuing amputation or chemotherapy. Our study enrollment was designed to accrue 10 patients in order to evaluate the primary endpoint of lung metastasis formation at 6 months. The clinical trial was approved by the UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine Clinical Trials Review Board and the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol #18857).</p>
                <p>The clinical protocol consisted of 4 fractions of palliative RT at a dose of 9 Gy weekly followed by two intra-tumoral injections of <italic>ex vivo</italic> expanded autologous canine NK cells (7.5 x 10<sup>6</sup> NK cells/kg) in 1–2 mL aliquots in sterile PBS during weeks 5 and 6 [<xref rid="pone.0224775.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Ex vivo expanded canine NK cells are obtained similar to the method previously described [<xref rid="pone.0224775.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0224775.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], utilizing co-culture of canine peripheral blood with irradiated human erythroleukemia K562 cell line engineered to express membrane bound IL-21 and 4-1bb ligand, supplemented with 100 IU/mL rhIL-2. Recombinant human IL-2 was co-injected with the NK cells at a dose of 250,000 IU/kg (Roche, NCI, Frederick). Resting dog NK cells were isolated from a CD5<sup>dim</sup> population [<xref rid="pone.0224775.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], but when activated and mature were phenotyped as CD5-/CD3-/NKp46+ [<xref rid="pone.0224775.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. We assessed for lung metastasis using thoracic computed tomography every three months for the first six months of follow-up followed by thoracic radiographs every three months thereafter.</p>

Among the 10 treated dogs, the mean age was 8.0 ± 3.3 years, and four were female (40%). The median body condition score was 6 (range 3–8), and the mean weight was 50 ± 21 kg. In all, the trial included three St. Bernards, three mixed breed dogs, and one each of the following: Labrador Retriever, Doberman pinscher, Pyrenees, and Rhodesian Ridgeback. The majority of OSA were located at the distal radius (60%), with other sites being the ilium (20%) and humerus (20%). With a median follow up of 5.7 months (9.7 months for survivors), six patients died for an overall mortality of 60%. Four dogs were euthanized secondary to progressive OSA, while 2 patients died from causes unrelated to cancer (1 from a perforated ulcer presumably from non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and 1 from euthanasia after suffering a pathologic fracture post RT and local recurrence). The updated event-free overall and progression-free survival for the cohort are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0224775.g001">Fig 1</xref>.</p>

Immunohistochemical staining for CD3+ cells revealed high infiltration in normal lymph node (left) versus rare to absent lymphocyte presence in soft tissue sarcoma (middle) or osteosarcoma (right) tumors. Scale bar = 200 μm. RNA analysis by PCR of PBMCs from healthy dogs (A–bottom left) demonstrated greatest expression of CD3 compared to CD8 or NK marker NKG2D. Expression of these genes in PBMCs was approximately 100-fold greater than expression in osteosarcoma tumor tissue (A–bottom right), and intra-tumoral expression of NKG2D was significantly lower than both CD3 and CD8. Technical replicates from one of 3 experiments are shown. * P&lt;0.05, *** P&lt;0.001 via one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post-test.

Interestingly, the patient who lived the longest (17.9 months) showed the greatest fold-change in the expression of CD3, CD8, and IDO1 genes. On univariate analysis, there was no significant difference (P&gt;0.05) in intra-tumoral changes in gene expression and survival for CD3 (C), CD8 (D), IDO1 (E), IL-10 (F), IL-6 (G), or TGF-β (H).

For example, two patients (patient 1 and patient 8) showed notable increases in the expression of CD3 and CD8, while two different patients showed greater than 10-fold increases in IL-6 expression. Patient 8 also showed an approximately 40-fold increase in the expression of IDO1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0224775.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). We then assessed whether there was any correlation between the changes in gene expression of these immune genes and patient survival.

                    <p>The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) was queried for gene expression data with immunoregulatory function from human sarcoma patients with non-metastatic disease. Patients were categorized into high and low expression by quartiles, and survival differences were analyzed between low expression (quartile 1) and high expression (quartile 4). Significant survival differences were identified between high and low gene expression for (A) CD3e, (B) CD8a, (C) IFN-γ (E) PRF1 (perforin), (F) CD122/ interleukin 2 (and interleukin 15) receptor subunit beta, (G) IL-6, and (H) IL-6R. Notably, and somewhat paradoxically, greater intra-tumoral expression of IL-6 and IL-6R were associated with superior survival in human sarcomas. Sarcoma patients with higher intra-tumoral GZMB (granzyme B) expression (D) had longer survival, but this difference was not statistically significant (HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.37–1.13, P = 0.13).</p>

                <p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0224775.g006">Fig 6</xref>, we then analyzed survival differences. Notably, we observed that elevated expression in the highest quartile of CD3e (HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.29–0.91, P = 0.02), CD8a (HR 0.45, 95% CI 0.25–0.80, P = 0.006), IFN-γ (HR 0.50, 95% CI 0.28–0.89, P = 0.02), and perforin (PRF1, HR 0.42, 95% CI 0.22–0.80, P = 0.006) in human sarcomas were associated with greater OS. In contrast, although there was a trend for improved survival with greater expression of granzyme B (GZMB) and therefore a lower risk of death with a HR of 0.65, this survival difference was not significantly different (P = 0.13). Interestingly, and somewhat paradoxically given our serum ELISA and tumor tissue PCR results, we observed that higher expression of IL-6 (HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.26–0.82, P = 0.007) and the IL-6 receptor/CD126 (HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.27–0.79, P = 0.004) were both associated with greater OS in human sarcomas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0224775.g006">Fig 6G and 6H</xref>).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Immunotherapy is rapidly becoming the 4<sup>th</sup> arm of cancer therapy. Breakthrough advances using inhibitors of PD-1, PD-L1, and CTLA-4 and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have clearly identified immunotherapy as the future of clinical oncology. However, despite these exciting advances, more basic and translational research is needed to extend the promise of cancer immunotherapy to greater numbers of patients since significant subsets of patients either do not respond to treatment or develop resistance [<xref rid="pone.0224775.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. A key step in advancing cancer immunotherapy will be the identification of more robust biomarkers of response and resistance [<xref rid="pone.0224775.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and studies in dogs with spontaneous cancers are ideal for this purpose as dogs represent an important link in translating immunotherapy from pre-clinical mouse studies to clinical trials in humans [<xref rid="pone.0224775.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p>
              <p>Dogs with spontaneous tumors have a number of advantages over mice as therapeutic models, including extensive homology between canine and human genomes, comparable genetic complexity and tumor heterogeneity, and similar host-tumor interactions in the TME. Therefore, dog clinical trials are an important mechanism to evaluate novel immunotherapy approaches, especially for NK cellular therapy which has proven challenging to effectively implement in human solid tumors [<xref rid="pone.0224775.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. We have previously reported the feasibility of our first-in-dog clinical trial of intra-tumoral NK in dogs with OSA [<xref rid="pone.0224775.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In this follow up analysis, we describe the utility of monitoring serum and tumor biomarkers and their correlations with outcome.</p>
              <p>Though limited in patient number, our results suggest that there may be a predictive role for pre-treatment serum cytokines and intra-tumoral gene expression. Specifically, this appears most prominent for pre-treatment serum IL-6, in which low expression may correlate with improved survival and/or response to therapy. This correlation with IL-6 is consistent with a large body of literature from human studies suggesting that IL-6 adversely impacts cancer extent of disease and prognosis [<xref rid="pone.0224775.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Interestingly, however, analysis of TCGA data suggests that IL-6 and IL-6R expression in the sarcoma TME may favorably impact OS, though we are unable to differentiate soluble IL-6R on our analysis, which may result in these somewhat paradoxical effects While our study does not answer these critical questions regarding which immune genes and signatures reliably predict prognosis and response to therapy, it does lends support to the validity of using the canine model for more detailed immune dissection. As individual biomarkers often have limited predictive value in larger data sets given the heterogeneity of human and dog patients, immune signatures and gene clusters may prove to be more robust prognostic and predictive tools, as was suggested by a recent multispecies analysis by Scott et al [<xref rid="pone.0224775.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p>
              <p>The search for putative prognostic or predictive biomarkers has been intensely investigated in cancer therapy, particularly immunotherapy, where only a subset of patients will respond to treatment. Currently, the most useful immune biomarkers for efficacy of immunotherapy have been intra-tumoral PD-L1 expression, magnitude of tumor mutational burden [<xref rid="pone.0224775.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0224775.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], as well as the quantity of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) pre- and post-therapy [<xref rid="pone.0224775.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0224775.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. These biomarkers are the subject of much investigation in human trials for their ability to predict response to immunotherapy. Although no such correlation has yet been made in the canine population, PD-L1 expression and tumor mutation burden are unlikely to be related to outcome or response to therapy in non-T-cell based therapies such as NK cellular therapy. Of note, our limited data do suggest that dog OSA has relatively limited T cell infiltration at baseline consistent with immunologically “cold” tumors and that intra-tumoral NK transfer can stimulate infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes [<xref rid="pone.0224775.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Although additional studies are needed to validate TILs as a prognostic biomarker in dog OSA, our data demonstrate that both IHC and PCR can reliably detect these markers in future studies [<xref rid="pone.0224775.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Similarly, although studies have identified robust immune infiltrates in dog OSA by next-generation sequencing, the number of immune cells detectable by IHC is low [<xref rid="pone.0224775.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0224775.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p>
              <p>The intra-tumoral immune phenotype also provides important insight into the TME and illustrates the correlation between peripheral and intra-tumoral expression. Our data highlight the difference between the peripheral and intra-tumoral T cell subpopulations, lending further evidence to the growing body of research on the critical role of TILs in diverse cancer types [<xref rid="pone.0224775.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0224775.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Analysis of untreated tumors in our study highlight the relative paucity of immune infiltration within canine sarcomas, and it is this lack of immune infiltration that promotes the rationale for immunomodulatory RT with NK adoptive transfer to increase immune infiltration. The canine patients in this study recapitulate the human finding that subsets of intra-tumoral immune infiltrates differ from the proportions found in peripheral blood. More so, changes in these subpopulations indicate that immunotherapy can transform a lymphocyte negative (“cold”) tumor to a lymphocyte positive (“hot”) tumor. This is particularly relevant in the context of tumor MHC-I expression where MHC-I+ tumor cells elicit greater antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses and MHC-I loss is a well-established mechanism of tumor immune evasion [<xref rid="pone.0224775.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Our study did not address tumor MHC-I expression, but prior research has shown loss of MHC-I in human sarcomas [<xref rid="pone.0224775.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Although this study utilized a single RT regimen consisting of 4 fractions of 9 Gy weekly, evidence suggests that different regimens can alter the immunomodulation elicited. [<xref rid="pone.0224775.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0224775.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Further studies moving forward could utilize increased radiation dose and decreased fractionation in an attempt to better augment immune infiltration.</p>
              <p>Our study is primarily limited by the small number of patients in our trial. However, although limited in number, the rich immunologic and biochemical data generated provides evidence that immune readouts hold promise as potential biomarkers that can be further studied in follow up dog NK trials and validated for use in human NK clinical trials. Future canine immunotherapy trials should incorporate this level of biochemical and tumor monitoring to aid in identifying novel biomarkers with the goal of improving care across species.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>Follow up blood and tissue specimen analysis from our first-in-dog clinical trial of RT and ex vivo expanded autologous NK cell immunotherapy illustrates the feasibility and applicability of utilizing companion dogs for novel cancer therapies. Similar to human studies, analysis of immune markers from canine serum, PBMCs, and tumor tissue is possible and provides valuable immune monitoring data for biomarker analysis. These results reinforce the value of canine immunotherapy trials to speed translation of novel immunotherapy approaches with particular emphasis on identifying novel predictive and prognostic biomarkers that may be beneficial to both dog and human patients.</p>

              <p>Reviewer #1: Robert Cantor and colleagues have previously shown that radiation therapy sensitizes tumor cells, including osteosarcoma to NK cell-mediated cytoctoxicity. As a follow-up to this discovery, they conducted a clinical trial of palliative RT plus intra-tumoral autologous NK transfer in dogs with non-metastatic osteosacrcoma, whose owners elected not to pursue amputation or cytotoxic chemotherapy. As part of the trial, the investigators collected serial blood specimens and tumor tissue pre- and post-therapy. This samples have been analyzed for serum levels of cytokines, immunophenotyping of the peripheral blood mononuclear cells and gene expression in the tumor tissue for this report. Ten dogs were treated, of which only four are alive. Four died from tumor progression, one died from duodenal perforation (secondary to NSAID use) and another was euthanized with pathological fracture post-RT and local recurrence. Key observations include:</p>
              <p>NK cells could be isolated after depleting CD5+ cells and expanded ex vivo from PBMC of trial subjects. Functional cytotoxity was demonstrated in these CD3-NKp46+ cells using canine thyroid adenocarcinoma cells as a target.</p>
              <p>Serum cytokines (IL-2, TNFa and IL-6) were not statistically different amongst study subjects. However, compared to subjects with disease progression, serum IL-6 was mostly undetectable amongst survivors without tumor progression.</p>
              <p>Granzyme B and IFNg-positive cells were not statistically increased in the peripheral blood amongst subjects that were alive at 6 months versus those who died within 6 months.</p>
              <p>CD3+, CD8+ and NKG2D-expressing cells were minimal to absent in tumor tissues from sarcoma and osteosarcoma tissues. Intra-tumoral NKG2D-expressing cells were significantly lower than CD3-expressing or CD8-expressing cells in tumor tissues. On univariate analysis, there was no significant difference in CD3, CD8, IDO1, IL-10, IL-6 or TGFß gene expression. However, the subject that lived the longest (17.9 m) showed the greatest increase in expression of CD3, CD8 and IDO1 RNA.</p>
              <p>TCGA analysis showed a significant survival difference between patients with high and low gene expression of CD3e, CD8a, IFNg, PRF1 and CD122. In contrast to data from canine trial, patients with higher IL6 and IL6R had a better survival in humans.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, although this study is limited by the number of patients, it suggests that pre-treatment cytokine (IL6) and intra-tumoral gene expression of cytotoxic cells may be predictive of survival and tumor response in canine patients with osteosarcoma. The authors should be congratulated to conduct immunological studies in canine patients.</p>
              <p>However, a few points need to be discussed before publication.</p>
              <p>Limitation of the study design. The weekly 9 Gy x 4 fraction regimen may not be ideal for an immunogenic activation. Please discuss how the next studies would be done so as to harness the power of immunogenic RT fractionation and dose.</p>
              <p>Did the OSA tumors express HLA?</p>
              <p>If NKG2D-expressing cells were minimal to absent, please discuss how NK cell therapy would be effective.</p>
              <p>In the TCGA analysis, the authors could examine the expression of soluble IL6R, if possible. Because that might be confounding towards the paradoxical results in TCGA versus canine patients.</p>

              <p> Radiation and Intra-Tumoral Autologous Natural Killer Cell Transfer</p>
              <p>Dear Dr. Gangopadhyay and PLOS ONE reviewers,</p>
              <p>Thank you for your comprehensive review of our manuscript. We appreciate the editor’s and reviewer’s comments, and we have attempted to address these comments with a revised version of our manuscript. We hope that you will now consider our manuscript suitable for publication. Please see the following point-by-point responses to the individual comments of the editor and reviewers.</p>
              <p>Comments to the Editor</p>
              <p>Could you please explain if any form of allogeneic transplantation influences experimental outcomes? </p>
              <p>This is an important question as allogeneic immune interactions can have significant effects on the outcomes of cellular therapies both in terms of anti-tumor effects as well as toxicities. In human clinical trials, a strong trend in the field is to pursue allogeneic NK transfer as graft-versus-host disease has not been associated with pure NK cell populations (GVHD is primarily mediated by T cells and significant pre-clinical evidence implicates a protective effect of NK cells in GVHD), while allogeneic NK cells have been associated with improved anti-tumor effects (so-called graft-versus-tumor [GVT] or graft-versus-leukemia [GVL]) in human studies. In our study, since it was a first-in-dog clinical trial and since dog NK cells are not as well characterized as human or mouse NK cells, we intentionally decided to use autologous canine NK cells as an extra precaution to mitigate toxicity given the potential for unexpected toxicities to occur in clinical trials (e.g., if our NK product was not as T-cell depleted as our background data suggested). Therefore, in the dog clinical trial patients we are reporting in this study, we can conclude that there is no effect of allogeneic interactions on the results. However, given that our data suggest that NK transfer in dogs appears to be safe (based on the data available to date) and given our ongoing studies improving the characterization of dog NK cells, we are pursuing allogeneic NK transfer in our follow-up studies since it is reasonable to hypothesize superior anti-tumor effects in these cases. However, key questions will be how allogeneic NK transfer impacts engraftment, activation status, longevity on the transferred NK cells (as well as how much conditioning is necessary to prevent rejection by the host’s immune cells). These are all important comments which relate to the editor’s question, and we intend to address them in follow-up studies. </p>
              <p>A final point is that our current technique to expand and activate autologous canine NK cells is completed through co-culture with a human (and xenogeneic) K562.Cl9 cell line that has been engineered to expressed human membrane bound IL-21 and 4-1BB ligand. This cell line has been well validated for the expansion of human (and now canine) NK cells and undergoes irradiation prior to culturing to prevent expansion and engraftment following adoptive cell transfer. As human and canine NK cells respond similarly to the transfected K562.Cl9 feeder cell line, there does not appear to be any demonstrable xenogeneic effects identified in the canine NK cells as compared to human NK cells. These points have been expanded in the methods section where we describe the clinical trial (page 4) as well as the discussion section, and we thank the editor for this question. </p>
              <p>Comments to the Author</p>
              <p>5. Review Comments to the Author</p>
              <p>Limitation of the study design. The weekly 9 Gy x 4 fraction regimen may not be ideal for an immunogenic activation. Please discuss how the next studies would be done so as to harness the power of immunogenic RT fractionation and dose.</p>
              <p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comment and attention to our study design. This is an important area of investigation in the intersecting fields of radiotherapy and immunotherapy. The immunomodulatory effects of radiotherapy, particularly local immune effects on the tumor microenvironment, have been established in preclinical models and include induction of immunogenic cell death, release of antigens for T cell priming, increased T cell homing to tumor sites, shift in the polarization of tumor associated macrophages, and reduction of immunosuppressive stromal cells in the tumor microenvironment, among others. However, radiotherapy can also augment immunosuppressive pathways, including induction of TGF-B and PD-L1, among others. More recent studies in humans suggest that hypo-fractionated radiation schedules produce very different biologic effects than traditional conventionally fractionated radiation, and few studies have addressed these variables in dogs undergoing RT. Especially in dogs, limited preclinical or clinical data are available to guide the selection of radiation dose, fractionation and site in order to optimally synergize with immunotherapy. Therefore, we completely agree with the reviewer that this is a key question for follow-up studies. Since palliative RT protocols are fairly fixed in clinical medicine (human as well as veterinary), and since studies in dogs with cancer nevertheless maintain a focus on the clinical care of the animals, we do not anticipate that it will be feasible to rigorously vary RT doses and fractionation schedules to comprehensively assess the optimal RT strategy for immunogenic activation (which may nevertheless vary by tumor type and target organ like lungs, liver, or soft tissue (McGee et al., 2018. PMID: 29891204). However, moving forward, we are prospectively collecting immune cells and serum from blood and tumor tissue at multiple time points from dog cancer patients undergoing RT with and without immunotherapy (follow up dog NK clinical trials) to more comprehensively assess the effects of RT on immune phenotype and function as the reviewer suggest. Ultimately, we agree that this will be an important area of research in dogs as it is in humans. However, we also anticipate significant heterogeneity in the immune effects of RT which will vary by irradiated site (e.g. brain and bone are more immunosuppressive micro-environments than the lungs) as well as breed, RT dose, schedule, etc…in which case, this concern may remain an ongoing limitation of radio-immunotherapy studies. These points have been added to our discussion section (page 13-14) and additional references have been added to our discussion section (Ref 44-46: Immunobiology of Radiotherapy: New Paradigms; Unlocking the combination: potential of radiation-induced antitumor responses with immunotherapy; Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy induces systemic difference sin peripheral blood immunophenotype dependent on irradiated site). </p>
              <p>Did the OSA tumors express HLA?</p>
              <p>Our analysis of the OSA clinical samples did not include expression of canine MHC-I or II, in part because dog leukocyte antigen (DLA) is highly polymorphic (as it is in humans) and also because robust reagents to evaluate DLA phenotype are limited at this time (JL Wagner, 2003. PMID: 12692158). However, we completely agree with the reviewer that this is an important area for future study in dog immunotherapy as these haplotypes have clearly been shown to influence CD8 T cell and NK cell effector function in human immunotherapy studies. As we discuss above in our response to the editor’s comment, this is a significant focus of our ongoing investigations into methods to optimize dog NK characterization as well as dog NK adoptive transfer. These points have been added to our discussion section on page 13. </p>
              <p>If NKG2D-expressing cells were minimal to absent, please discuss how NK cell therapy would be effective.</p>
              <p>We agree with the reviewer that this is an important to emphasize, and these results suggest that strategies to stimulate endogenous anti-tumor immunity from cytotoxic NKG2D-expressing cells like NK cells and bystander T cells may be less likely to succeed. However, we hypothesize that this is where improving NK adoptive transfer techniques could be promising since exogenous delivery of cytotoxic NKG2D-expressing NK and T cells can overcome some of the limitations of “cold” tumor with low baseline immune infiltrate. In our data, the bone and soft tissue sarcoma tumors of untreated dogs showed low expression of NKG2D, in addition to other markers of immune effector cells (CD3, CD8). This highlights the relative paucity of immune cell within canine sarcomas and underlies the rationale for a therapy that induces immunomodulation (RT) and aims to increase infiltration of an effector cell population (NK cells). We have modified the manuscript to clarify these points. </p>
              <p>In the TCGA analysis, the authors could examine the expression of soluble IL6R, if possible. Because that might be confounding towards the paradoxical results in TCGA versus canine patients.</p>
              <p>We appreciate this additional insight and suggestion from the reviewer, as he or she has identified a notable paradox of our data which also intrigued us. The implication from our primary dog data is that over-expression of IL-6 is a negative prognostic factor in dog osteosarcoma while in the TCGA data overexpression of both IL-6 and the IL-6 receptor was associated with superior survival in soft tissue sarcoma patients. Therefore, we certainly agree that further analysis of these results is warranted to reconcile the differences between dog and human which may be species specific, tumor specific, or related to other factors like immune responses and/or therapy (e.g. use of RT in our dog patients). Unfortunately, the TCGA does not delineate membrane-bound versus soluble IL-6R expression in the dataset, although this clearly would be a relevant area to start to address this paradox. The IL-6R can be produced from an alternative splicing event or via proteolytic cleavage at the protein level. To detect RNA level differences from the TCGA, a unique identifier is needed to detect the soluble form of the transcript, and this is not currently available through the TCGA system. Although IL-6 is considered a proto-typical pro-inflammatory cytokine that directs and amplifies the acute phase response to tissue damage and inflammation, IL-6 is also viewed as an immunosuppressive cytokine because of its association with multiple regulatory or suppressive immune-cell populations, such as myeloid-derived suppressive cells, tolerogenic dendritic cells, and tumor-associated macrophages. Further evidence has been drawn from studies correlating circulating IL-6 levels with poor prognosis of various cancers, especially breast cancer. However, data have also demonstrated a role for IL-6 in boosting T cell trafficking to tumors, where they can become activated and cytotoxic (Romano et al, 1997. PMID: 9075932). These points, including discussion on soluble IL-6R, has been added to our revised manuscript on page 12. </p>
