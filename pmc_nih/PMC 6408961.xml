                <p id="P4">Glioblastoma is the most common primary malignant brain tumor in adults and associated with poor survival. The Ivy Foundation Early Phase Clinical Trials Consortium conducted a randomized, multi-institution clinical trial to evaluate immune responses and survival following neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant therapy with pembrolizumab in 35 patients with recurrent, surgically resectable glioblastoma. Patients who were randomized to receive neoadjuvant pembrolizumab, with continued adjuvant therapy following surgery, had significantly extended overall survival compared to patients that were randomized to receive adjuvant, post-surgical PD-1 blockade alone. Neoadjuvant PD-1 blockade was associated with upregulation of T cell and interferon-γ-related gene expression, but downregulation of cell cycle-related gene expression within the tumor, which was not seen in patients that received adjuvant therapy alone. Focal induction of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) in the tumor microenvironment, enhanced clonal expansion of T cells, decreased PD-1 expression on peripheral blood T cells, and a decreasing monocytic population was observed more frequently in the neoadjuvant group than patients treated only in the adjuvant setting. These findings suggest that the neoadjuvant administration of PD-1 blockade enhances the local and systemic anti-tumor immune response and may represent a more efficacious approach to the treatment of this uniformly lethal brain tumor.</p>

                <p id="P8">A total of 35 patients were enrolled and randomized between October 2016 and September 2017 at seven institutions and comprise the intention-to-treat population (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Figure 1</xref>). Sixteen patients were randomized into the neoadjuvant pembrolizumab group and nineteen into the adjuvant-only group. Three patients in the adjuvant-only group withdrew consent prior to surgery and two patients (one in the neoadjuvant group and one in the adjuvant-only group) were replaced following surgery according to the study protocol based on insufficient histological evidence of glioblastoma. These five patients were excluded from tissue studies but were included in the intention-to-treat efficacy analysis. The baseline patient characteristics are dichotomized by treatment group in <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. There were no statistically significant differences in age, sex, Karnofsky performance status, isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation status, O<sup>6</sup>-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) methylation status, pre- or post-surgery tumor volume or steroid administration at registration. Furthermore, the extent of resection or the fraction of patients who received a gross total resection was not different between groups. As of the July 2, 2018 analysis cutoff date, 31 of 32 patients had discontinued pembrolizumab (two for unacceptable toxicity, 1 by investigator decision, 1 by withdrawal of consent, and 27 due to progressive disease). Of the 27 patients with progressive disease, 24 went on to receive a bevacizumab-containing regimen. Dexamethasone was also administered to individual patients at varying times at the site investigator’s discretion (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref>). The Kaplan-Meier estimated median follow-up time was 476 days (15.6 months; interquartile range 414 to 522 days [13.6 to 17.2 months]).</p>

                <p id="P9">Pembrolizumab was generally well tolerated (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>); the neoadjuvant administration of the antibody was not associated with any new, unreported toxicities in this patient population. As of the analysis cutoff date, 10 patients (67%) in the neoadjuvant group experienced grade 3-4 adverse events that were deemed unlikely, possible, probable or likely attributable to the study drug; this occurred in 7 patients (47%; two-sided P = 0.46, Fisher exact test, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.42 to 12.95) in the adjuvant cohort. No patients in the neoadjuvant group had surgery delayed due to adverse events prior to tumor resection. Two patients, both in the neoadjuvant group, experienced toxicities leading to discontinuation of pembrolizumab; one patient developed grade 3 pneumonitis and the other a grade 4 elevation in alanine aminotransferase (ALT). The most common treatment-related toxicities were muscle weakness (50%), headache (47%), and hyperglycemia (37%). Such treatment-related adverse events are commonly seen in patients with central nervous system tumors and/or those who have received corticosteroids; indeed, several of these adverse events were deemed unlikely to be related to the study drug by the site investigator but were included for completeness of data reporting.</p>

                <p id="P11">To evaluate whether neoadjuvant PD-1 blockade altered the gene expression profile of recurrent glioblastoma, we first analyzed transcriptional changes within patient tumors utilizing direct multiplexed mRNA quantification. We analyzed the differential gene expression between treatment groups, which revealed several statistically significant differences in tumor samples (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) gene set enrichment analysis identified gene products associated with cytokine-cytokine interaction, the chemokine signaling pathway and toll-like receptor signaling pathway. To quantify the T cell-inflamed microenvironment, we compared an immune-related gene expression signature score (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 3</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> between the treatment groups. There was a significant transcriptional increase in genes related to interferon-γ responsiveness (P = 0.03, U = 49; Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test; <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>, <xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Figure 3</xref>). We also sought to determine whether neoadjuvant PD-1 blockade induced other transcriptional changes in these tumors. As such, we performed RNA sequencing on patient tumor samples and applied an unbiased screen for differentially expressed gene signatures with an interquartile range greater than 1. Our data demonstrated interferon- and T cell-pathway induction in 9 of 14 tumors in the neoadjuvant group and 5 of 15 in the adjuvant-only group, corroborating our mRNA quantification data. In addition, 3 out of 14 tumors in the neoadjuvant group demonstrated positive enrichment of cell cycle / cancer proliferation signatures, whereas this occurred in 11 of 15 tumors in the adjuvant group (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref>; two-sided P = 0.01, Fisher exact test, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.70). We found no statistically significant correlation between the steroid dose at registration and representative interferon, T cell or cell cycle gene expression signature scores. The proportion of cell cycle signatures in our study as a whole was similar to that of publicly available RNA sequencing datasets from patients with recurrent glioblastoma<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> (11 of 20 pre-treatment tumors; <xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Figure 4</xref>; two-sided P = 0.8, Fisher exact test, 95% CI 0.21 to 2.77) and The Cancer Genome Atlas<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> (73 of 166 samples; two-sided P = 0.7, Fisher exact test, 95% CI 0.50 to 2.83; <xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Figure 5</xref>). Notably, only one of the samples with interferon pathway and T cell gene set enrichment in the neoadjuvant group demonstrated cell cycle pathway activation (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref>), suggesting that neoadjuvant PD-1 blockade induced relevant immune cell activation within the tumor microenvironment that subsequently repressed the cell cycle-related transcriptional activity of tumor cells.</p>

                <p id="P12">To address whether neoadjuvant PD-1 blockade increased the infiltration of T cells, we quantified the immune cell infiltrate in each patient’s tumor tissue utilizing multiplex immunofluorescence. The density of tumor infiltrating CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells was not different between groups but demonstrated significant variability in the neoadjuvant cohort. Because PD-L1 is known to be upregulated in response to interferon-γ produced by infiltrating T cells,<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>-<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> we evaluated whether PD-L1 was increased with neoadjuvant PD-1 blockade. Samples were classified as having either a constitutive, focal or negative PD-L1 expression pattern with varying degrees of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell infiltration. Seven neoadjuvant patients and 3 adjuvant patients exhibited a focal phenotype with a high CD8 infiltrate (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>; <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 4</xref>), suggesting that neoadjuvant treatment was associated with focal induction of PD-L1 expression. Qualitatively, the focal upregulation of PD-L1 in these adjuvant cases was not as striking, suggesting that the endogenous functional T cell response was not as dramatic.</p>

                <title>Neoadjuvant PD-1 blockade alters correlative relationships between blood and tumor repertoire features</title>
                <p id="P13">We hypothesized that the clinical effectiveness of neoadjuvant PD-1 blockade may occur because this specific timing resulted in a detectable local and systemic T cell response. To test this, we performed αβ T cell receptor sequencing on all patients’ peripheral blood mononuclear cells at baseline, the time of surgery, and approximately 6 weeks after surgery, as well as on all evaluable tumor samples. We statistically identified T cell receptor rearrangements that were differentially abundant in each patient’s peripheral blood mononuclear cells at on-treatment time points relative to baseline and quantified the number of clones that significantly increased in frequency (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a</xref>) as well as the proportion of T cell receptors shared between tumor and blood (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4b</xref>). There was a trend toward an increased number of expanded clones between baseline and surgery in the neoadjuvant compared to the adjuvant group (two-sided P = 0.07, unpaired t test). We did not observe significant differences in the tumor infiltrating lymphocyte content, T cell receptor diversity or proportion of T cell receptors shared between tumor and blood by treatment group or clinical time point. However, in neoadjuvant patients, we noted commensurate increases in the fraction of expanded T cell clones following the post-surgery PD-1 blockade cycle and T cell receptor overlap between tumor and blood across all three collected time points (<italic>r</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub> = 0.86, 0.84, 0.89; P = 0.0002, 0.0003, 0.00004, respectively, asymptotic t approximation, <italic>n</italic> = 25 patients). Similarly, the amount of T cell receptor overlap at the time of surgery was also significantly associated with the tumor infiltrating lymphocyte fraction, but only in the neoadjuvant treatment group (<italic>r</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub> = 0.83; P = 0.0005, asymptotic t approximation, <italic>n</italic> = 25 patients; <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4c</xref>). These correlations were not found in the adjuvant only group, suggesting that neoadjuvant PD-1 blockade uniquely initiated a coordinated local and systemic T cell response.</p>

                <title>Neoadjuvant PD-1 blockade is associated with monocytic and T cell phenotypic changes</title>
                <p id="P14">To evaluate whether neoadjuvant PD-1 blockade altered the phenotype of systemic immune cell populations, we performed time-of-flight mass cytometry on peripheral blood samples collected from study subjects at baseline, prior to surgery and after receiving at least 1 adjuvant treatment cycle, enabling use of the adjuvant group as a concurrent control. After staining and sample acquisition, we concatenated a total of 84 samples. We utilized unsupervised clustering to conduct cell population identification (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Figure 6</xref>) and evaluated the characteristics of the identified clusters. There was a statistically significant decrease in an intermediate monocyte population in the neoadjuvant group between baseline and after at least 1 cycle of adjuvant PD-1 blockade, which was not observed in the adjuvant-only group (baseline mean proportion 1.35 ± 0.31% versus on-treatment mean proportion 0.56 ± 0.12%; Benjamini-Hochberg-corrected, two-sided P value = 0.007, general linear hypothesis test, <italic>n</italic> = 28]; <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4d</xref>). We then compared the expression of functional markers within clustered cell populations and noted statistically significant decreases in PD-1 and increases in CTLA4 (Benjamini-Hochberg-corrected, two-sided P values 0.025 and 0.0015, respectively, general linear hypothesis test, <italic>n</italic> = 28) on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell clusters (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4e</xref>) solely in the neoadjuvant group between baseline and post-surgery.

                <title>Cell cycle gene signature, baseline T cell receptor clonality and tumor infiltrating lymphocyte density may be associated with clinical response to neoadjuvant PD-1 blockade</title>
                <p id="P15">Finally, we sought to determine which clinical and laboratory factors were directly associated with survival, utilizing an elastic net regularized Cox regression for variable selection. In the 30 patients with evaluable tumor, neoadjuvant PD-1 blockade therapy, IDH mutation status, lower baseline peripheral T cell receptor clonality and increased tumor infiltrating lymphocyte density were associated with increased overall survival. We then fit these variables, combined with age and sex, into a Cox proportional hazards regression, and confirmed that neoadjuvant treatment was associated with improved survival (hazard ratio 0.33, P = 0.045; <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 5</xref>). Standardized baseline peripheral T cell receptor clonality trended toward a survival association, with a hazard ratio of 1.48 for each one standard deviation increase (P = 0.12). Given the significant treatment effect on the cell cycle signature in neoadjuvant patients, we sought to determine if a representative gene set<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> could be utilized as a biomarker for overall survival, calculating the R<sup>2</sup> statistic to evaluate the potential predictive power.<sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> We found that the cell cycle-related gene set variation analysis (GSVA) enrichment score explained 57% of the variance in overall survival (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.57). When added to the previous Cox model, the R<sup>2</sup> value increased from 0.36 to 0.62, suggesting that the cell cycle GSVA enrichment score may be one of the most significant predictors of overall survival.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="P16">In this study, PD-1 monoclonal antibody blockade was associated with statistically significant improvements in overall survival and progression-free survival when administered in the neoadjuvant setting to patients with recurrent glioblastoma. We leveraged T cell receptor sequencing, mRNA expression profiling, quantitative multiplex immunofluorescence and mass cytometry on patient blood and tumor samples to understand the distinct biological effects induced by this neoadjuvant timing. Our data suggest that neoadjuvant PD-1 monoclonal antibody blockade induces functional activation of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, producing an interferon response within the tumor microenvironment. Tumor infiltration with interferon-γ-producing, PD-1/PD-L1-suppressed T cells is likely essential for the systemic priming of tumor-specific T lymphocytes after neoadjuvant pembrolizumab. Indeed, tumor infiltrating lymphocyte density was one of the variables selected in our elastic net regression as being possibly related to survival; conversely, presurgical tumor volume, postsurgical tumor volume, percent resection, gross total resection (as a dichotomous variable) and dexamethasone dosage at time of registration were not. This suggests that the survival benefit derived from neoadjuvant PD-1 blockade is largely driven by the immune response. After neoadjuvant PD-1 blockade and resection, tumor-specific T cell clones maintain functionality with repeated anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody administration in the adjuvant setting (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). We believe that the T cell-mediated interferon response induces downregulation of cell cycle-related gene expression within the tumor cells, enabling a therapeutic window and resulting in a survival benefit. It is already known that many interferon-regulated gene products block cell cycle activities and tumor cell proliferation,<sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>-<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> suggesting that the transcriptional suppression of such cell cycle-related genes is a key feature of the efficacy for PD-1 blockade. Of note, a single-arm phase II clinical trial by Melero and colleagues in this same issue, utilizing neoadjuvant nivolumab in newly diagnosed or relapsed glioblastoma (NCT02550249) demonstrated similar intratumoral and systemic immune changes as found by us.</p>
              <p id="P17">In our gene expression analysis of tumor samples, we noted an upregulation of interferon-γ-related gene products in patients who received neoadjuvant PD-1 blockade, whereas patients without this upregulation demonstrated enrichment of cell cycle pathway gene sets. In fact, in a murine neoadjuvant immunotherapy model for breast cancer, the neutralization of interferon-γ nullified the efficacy of neoadjuvant anti-PD-1 plus anti-CD137 antibody therapy, indicating a vital role in promoting anti-tumor activity.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> This, together with our data, strongly suggests that increased interferon-γ signaling is a consequence of anti-PD-1 therapy and mediator of the functional immunologic response. Our study indicates that, although increased interferon signaling occasionally occurs in the presence of recurrent glioblastoma (as demonstrated by patients in the adjuvant-only group with upregulated interferon-γ-related gene expression), checkpoint release in the presence of tumor (i.e., in the neoadjuvant setting) may be a crucial component of enhancing tumor-specific T cell effector function, a finding consistent with what Liu et al. observed in a murine model. In addition, mice that received no treatment and no surgery demonstrated increased tumor-specific T cells, but poor effector function compared to groups that received neoadjuvant therapy and tumor resection, suggesting that both timing and surgery may play a role in tumor-specific T cell expansion. A similar mechanism may account for the failure of anti-PD-1 therapy in recurrent, unresected glioblastoma.<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup></p>
              <p id="P18">Quantitative multiplex immunohistochemistry revealed an increased proportion of patients in the neoadjuvant group that exhibited focal upregulation of PD-L1. However, 3 patients in the adjuvant-only group also demonstrated this finding, albeit with qualitatively limited PD-L1 intensity. Two of these three patients also demonstrated upregulation of cell cycle-related genes, suggesting that their endogenous T cell response was insufficient to disrupt tumor cell proliferation. The third patient with focal PD-L1 upregulation on multiplex immunofluorescence exhibited some CD8 T cell infiltration but did not have an elevated cell cycle signature. Additionally, the T cell- and interferon-related genes also were not increased, suggesting an aberrant mixture of low level activity. The overall survival of these three patients was below the median for all patients.</p>
              <p id="P19">After analyzing the T cell receptor data, we found that expansion of tumor-associated T cell receptor clones in the neoadjuvant group after treatment was correlated with high overlap between tumor and blood. While the overall number of expanded clones did increase after the initial pembrolizumab dose in the adjuvant-only group, these additional correlations were not seen. This suggests that PD-1 blockade can lead to increases in T cell clones regardless of timing; however, pre-surgical checkpoint inhibition enables a selective, primary tumor-specific T-cell clonal modulation, driving systemic expansion of tumor-specific T lymphocytes.</p>
              <p id="P20">Neoadjuvant pembrolizumab was not associated with a significant change in T cell receptor diversity, supporting previous findings that diversification of the T cell repertoire is not mediated via the PD-1 axis.<sup><xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> However, as our data indicate that increased baseline T cell receptor clonality may be associated with reduced survival, it appears that greater initial T cell diversity may portend improved responsiveness to PD-1 blockade. Our data suggest a role for combination immunotherapy with CTLA-4 blockade, which was shown to increase the number and complexity of T cell receptor variants in patients with melanoma<sup><xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> and has been demonstrated to be efficacious in other tumor types.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Although this combination was evaluated in a small cohort of recurrent glioblastoma patients without an obvious survival signal,<sup><xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> it has yet to be explored in a neoadjuvant investigation.</p>
              <p id="P21">In our single cell peripheral blood analysis, no specific cell population appeared to consistently predict survival, contrasting with previous studies in other cancer types.<sup><xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>-<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup> In our evaluation of differentially expressed functional markers on various cell populations, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells demonstrated statistically significant increases in CD152 and CD127 and a decrease in PD-1, suggesting that the degree of phenotypic shift toward activation and memory may play a significant role in the post-surgical antitumor immune response.</p>
              <p id="P22">Due to the established role of corticosteroid usage in the treatment of both CNS malignancies and immune-related adverse events, we evaluated the correlation between dexamethasone dosage at the time of registration as continuous and dichotomous variables and expression scores of interferon-, T cell- and cell cycle-related gene sets as well as overall survival. We found no statistically significant correlations, differing from published findings in patients with non-small cell lung cancer that received PD-1/PD-L1 blockade on high-dose baseline corticosteroids.<sup><xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup> This may be due to the fact that the protocol for this study excluded patients receiving high-dose dexamethasone at baseline greater than 4 milligrams per day. Many patients continued to receive or were started on low doses of dexamethasone during their treatment course. Our analyses corroborate previous findings that systemic corticosteroids can be utilized as management for adverse events without affecting objective response rates in patients receiving nivolumab for advanced melanoma.<sup><xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup></p>
              <p id="P23">Given the noted improvement in survival, we intend to expand the current study and pursue further clinical trials with neoadjuvant combination immunotherapeutics. Although this was a randomized clinical study, it was powered for tissue analyses. As such, interpretation of efficacy outcomes is limited by small sample size. Similarly, the observed immune effects may be influenced by an imbalance in the number of pembrolizumab doses received by patients in each group; the nature of this clinical trial design as a multi-center study also limited tissue availability for in-depth biologic analyses. We also did not find statistically significant correlations between patients that exhibited large numbers of expanded T cell clones, focal upregulation of PD-L1 expression and the above gene expression signature score. This may be due to the small sample size and/or the heterogeneity in tumor sampling for quantitative multiplex immunofluorescence analysis. Notably, almost all patients in this study went on to receive bevacizumab. The precise role of bevacizumab is unclear, given the inter-patient heterogeneity in post-progression therapies and timing. Data suggest that bevacizumab in this setting is not associated with poorer survival outcomes.<sup><xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup> Overall, the consistency of the data from this study indicates an observable tissue-based and clinical treatment effect. As such, the neoadjuvant approach to immunotherapy and brain cancer may provide a unique clinical development path, while also providing a therapeutic window to study the immunobiology of malignant brain tumors.</p>

Utilizing the immunoSEQ® Assay (Adaptive Biotechnologies, Seattle, WA) for PBMC samples and the immunoSEQ Assay for FFPE tumor samples, T cell receptor β (TCRβ) complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3) regions were amplified and sequenced from 2 μg of gDNA (or all available extracted DNA if less than 2 μg were available).

                <p id="P46">To evaluate differences between the neoadjuvant and adjuvant-only groups in mass cytometry data, we employed the generalized linear hypothesis function with the R function <italic>glht</italic> to test for the difference in marker expression, fitting fixed and mixed models using the <italic>stats</italic> and <italic>lme4</italic> packages in R. To compare cell population proportions between groups, we employed a generalized linear mixed model, using the sample identification and anonymized patient identifiers as random effects.<sup><xref rid="R72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref></sup> For differential analysis of marker expression by cell population, we calculated the median expression of 12 signaling markers in each cell population and sample, using these as the response variable in the linear mixed model.</p>
                <p id="P47">Progression-free survival (time from registration to disease progression per iRANO criteria or death) and overall survival (time from registration to death) were estimated using the PROC PHREG procedure in SAS. Multiple imputation with chained equations was utilized to account for missing biomarker data with 5 imputations of 50 iterations performed. Given the relatively low number of patients and large number of possible parameters with high correlation, we used an elastic net regularized regression for variable selection. Both clinical (including IDH mutation status, age, sex, MGMT methylation status, number of prior relapses, Karnofsky performance status, steroid dose in milligrams at time of registration) and laboratory data (including mass cytometry cluster percentages, T cell receptor overlap, tumor T cell density, expanded tumor-associated T cell clones, interferon-γ-related signature scores, presence or absence of inducible PD-L1 expression on multiplex immunofluorescence) were considered potential covariates. We used 5-fold cross-validation to obtain the value of λ that gave the minimum mean cross-validated error and determined the corresponding coefficients for each covariate. Variables with nonzero coefficients were then checked for collinearity and subsequently fitted into a Cox proportional hazards model, forcing in age and sex. Peripheral blood T cell receptor clonality and tumor infiltrating lymphocyte fractions were standardized before fitting into the Cox regression due to their wide ranges. As the tumor infiltrating T cell fraction was a measurement taken at the time of surgery, we ran both a two-sample <italic>t</italic>-test (P = 0.52, t = 0.65, df = 27.6) and Wilcoxon rank sum test (P = 0.41, W = 133, <italic>n</italic> = 30 patients) to ensure that there was no significant imbalance between the two groups at alpha = 0.05 that could potentially introduce confounding into the model. We performed a Cox-Snell residual plot, which did not suggest any lack-of-fit for the multivariate Cox model. We then analyzed a representative cell cycle signature-associated GSVA enrichment score (FARMER_BREAST_CANCER_CLUSTER_2) as a potential predictive biomarker. There was a clear imbalance between treatment groups (P = 0.02, t = −2.48, df = 27.8, two-sample t-test), indicating a correlation with the treatment variable; as such, it was not included on the initial multivariate Cox model to avoid confounding the treatment effect. We used a method previously described,<sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> which extends the R<sup>2</sup> statistic to survival models with the R package <italic>PAmeasures</italic>, This R<sup>2</sup> value can then be utilized as an estimate that measures the prediction function’s ability to capture the variability of the response, even if the model is possibly mis-specified.</p>
                <p id="P48">The primary objective of the trial was to evaluate whether administration of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) would induce statistically significant increases in tumor infiltrating T lymphocyte density in recurrent/progressive GBM patients compared to an untreated concurrent control. The adjuvant-only group was considered an independent concurrent control to evaluate the tumor infiltrating lymphocyte density in the neoadjuvant group due to the infeasibility of multiple resections within a short time period for patients with recurrent glioblastoma. Based on our preliminary data, the mean tumor infiltrating lymphocyte density was estimated to be 0.4 T cells per nucleated cell (standard deviation = 0.5) in the control group. Fifteen patients per group was deemed sufficient to achieve 85% power to detect an increase of 0.5 in tumor infiltrating lymphocyte density comparing the neoadjuvant group against the adjuvant-only group at an alpha of 0.05 (one sided) using a two-sample t test. The three patients who withdrew consent prior to treatment and the two whose tumors were deemed non-evaluable based on pathology protocol were replaced with randomized subjects to achieve a total of 15 patients per group to power our primary objective. To test for imbalance in patient characteristics between the two groups in age, sex, Karnofsky performance status, IDH mutation status and MGMT methylation status, we performed the Fisher exact test for categorical variables and Student t-test for continuous variables. Statistical analysis was performed with SAS version 9.2, GraphPad Prism version 6.01 or R version 3.4.3 or higher. All P values are two-tailed unless otherwise specified. The false discovery rate was controlled at 5% with the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure unless otherwise specified.</p>

We applied appropriate batch correction on log transformed, normalized mRNA expression values using the removeBatchEffect function in the R package limma to estimate the fraction of glioblastoma patients with positive enrichment of the cell cycle/cancer proliferation signatures (GSVA score ≤ 0.2). The proportion of positive enrichment of the cell cycle/cancer proliferation signatures in our dataset as a whole is similar to GSE79671 (14 out of 29 (48%) vs. 11 out of 20 (55%)). The number of samples with positive enrichment in the TCGA GBM is lower at 41%. We observed that neoadjuvant PD-1 monoclonal antibody therapy group is associated with lower fraction of tumors with the cell cycle signatures. There were only 3 out of 14 tumors in the neoadjuvant group demonstrating positive enrichment while there were 11 of 15 tumors in the adjuvant group and 11 of 20 tumors in the GSE79671 set (one-sided Fisher exact test P = 0.01 and P = 0.05, respectively).

                <p id="P66">Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, if present, are rendered ineffective through the PD-1/PD-L1 axis. Neoadjuvant PD-1 blockade releases this checkpoint, enabling modulation of the T cell receptor (TCR) clonotypes with systemic activation and clonal selection of tumor-specific T cells. Such T cell activation in turn upregulates interferon-γ-related signaling, while downregulating tumor cell cycle related genes. After surgery, and with continued adjuvant anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody administration, tumor-specific T cells continue to eliminate residual tumor cells and begin transitioning toward a T memory phenotype. In the adjuvant-only group, surgery occurs before checkpoint blockade release. Because of the reduced residual antigenic burden, TCR modulation is less robust and fewer tumor-specific T cells are activated. With fewer tumor-specific T cells, the remaining tumor cells are able to proliferate at a more rapid pace.</p>
