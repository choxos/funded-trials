                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Hmong men in Minnesota exhibit a high prevalence of gout and hyperuricemia. Although evidence of vitamin C’s effectiveness as a treatment for gout is mixed, analysis of therapeutic benefit based on an individual’s multiomic signature may identify predictive markers of treatment success.</p>

The secondary objectives were to assess if 1) vitamin C impacts the taxonomic and functional patterns of microbiota; 2) taxonomic and functional patterns of microbiota impact vitamin C’s urate-lowering effects; 3) genetic variations impact vitamin C’s urate-lowering effects; 4) differential microbial biomarkers exist for patients with or without gout; and 5) there is an association between obesity, gut microbiota and gout/hyperuricemia.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>This prospective open-labelled clinical trial was guided by community-based participatory research principles and conducted under research safety restrictions for SARS-CoV-2. We aimed to enroll a convenient sample of 180 Hmong adults (120 with gout/hyperuricemia and 60 without gout/hyperuricemia) who provided medical, demographic, dietary and anthropometric information. Participants took vitamin C 500mg twice daily for 8 weeks and provided pre-and post- samples of blood and urine for urate measurements as well as stool samples for gut microbiome. Salivary DNA was also collected for genetic markers relevant to uric acid disposition.</p>

                  <title>Expected results</title>
                  <p>We expected to quantify the impact of vitamin C on serum urate in Hmong adults with and without gout/hyperuricemia. The outcome will enhance our understanding of how gut microbiome and genomic variants impact the urate-lowering of vitamin C and associations between obesity, gut microbiota and gout/hyperuricemia. Ultimately, findings may improve our understanding of the causes and potential interventions that could be used to address health disparities in the prevalence and management of gout in this underserved population.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Gout, often caused by chronic elevation of serum urate (SU) as hyperuricemia (HU), is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis, affecting 0.1% to 10% of the worldwide population [<xref rid="pone.0279830.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. About 3.9% of adults in the United States (U.S.) suffer from gout and prevalence is even higher in certain ethnicities [<xref rid="pone.0279830.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Patients with gout have higher rates of cardiometabolic diseases, such as obesity, hypertension, renal disease, type 2 diabetes (T2DM), which significantly impact morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs [<xref rid="pone.0279830.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0279830.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The Hmong community in Minnesota is a high-risk population, exhibiting a 2-fold higher prevalence of gout [<xref rid="pone.0279830.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], 4-fold increase in tophaceous gouty arthritis [<xref rid="pone.0279830.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], and a 5-fold higher prevalence of uric acid renal stones [<xref rid="pone.0279830.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], as compared to non-Hmong in Minnesota. Finding a potential low-cost, safe, readily available, and effective agent to reduce serum urate in a high-risk population, even when they have not manifested with gout or hyperuricemia, could be of interest to the community as well as the clinicians who are taking care of this population.</p>
              <p>To prevent acute gout attacks and reduce complications associated with gout and/or HU, it is critical to maintain UA below 6 mg/dL [<xref rid="pone.0279830.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0279830.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, despite the availability of numerous urate-lowering therapies (ULT), up to 70% of patients fail to achieve target SU [<xref rid="pone.0279830.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and even higher treatment failure rates in select populations including the Hmong [<xref rid="pone.0279830.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Dietary supplements such as vitamin C (ascorbic acid) [<xref rid="pone.0279830.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0279830.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], cherry juice [<xref rid="pone.0279830.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0279830.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] or other supplements [<xref rid="pone.0279830.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], represent attractive treatment options for those patients who resist taking prescription medications on a chronic basis [<xref rid="pone.0279830.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p>
              <p>Among the dietary supplements investigated to lower SU, vitamin C represents a promising option. Studies have demonstrated that vitamin C causes significant uricosuria by inhibiting reabsorption of renal urate in renal tubule in patients with gout [<xref rid="pone.0279830.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0279830.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Its mechanism is likely through the inhibition of transporters on proximal renal tubule such as URAT1 [<xref rid="pone.0279830.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and/or SLC5A8 and SLC5A12 [<xref rid="pone.0279830.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. A meta-analysis of 13 randomized controlled trials with 556 healthy adults found that the median dose of vitamin C 500mg daily for a median of 30 days was effective in lowering SU (0.35 mg/dL, 95%CI: 0.66–0.03, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-value = 0.032) compared to placebo [<xref rid="pone.0279830.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. A similar result was reported in a separate meta-analysis with a pooled sample size of 1,013 participants [<xref rid="pone.0279830.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Furthermore, an epidemiology study with 46,994 male participants found individuals consuming 1000 to 1499 mg/day had a 45% (95%CI: 20%-62%) decreased risk of gout in comparison to those consuming less than 250 mg/day [<xref rid="pone.0279830.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. However, a study in patients with gout receiving vitamin C 500mg once daily for 8 weeks failed to find a significant reduction in SU compared to the known effective prescription medicine allopurinol (0.23 mg/dL versus 1.9 mg/dL, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-value &lt;0.001) despite a significant increase in plasma ascorbic acid level [<xref rid="pone.0279830.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Collectively, these observations of relative effectiveness of vitamin C to lower SU, raise the prospect of identifying characteristics of individuals who are optimal responders to this intervention.</p>
              <p>Vitamin C appears to exhibit linear kinetics at a lower dose and becomes non-linear at a higher dose to the saturable active transport mechanism in the absorption, distribution, and excretion. The maximum steady-state plasma concentration of ascorbic acid reaches about 70–80 uM [<xref rid="pone.0279830.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The selection of vitamin C 500mg twice daily was to maintain steady-state concentration of ascorbic acid below the maximum concentration. Based on the pharmacokinetics of vitamin C (clearance of 6.02 L/hr and assuming the oral bioavailability of 1) [<xref rid="pone.0279830.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], the estimated steady-state concentration of vitamin C 500mg is about 40 uM. Therefore, we choose a dose that was twice of the previous tested dose as the interventional dose but also one that is consistent with other previously conducted studies.</p>
              <p>Given recent advancements in bioinformatic tools that enable the identification of taxonomic and functional patterns of gut microbiota and genetic variants, we may be able to identify appropriate medications and doses for various diseases, including metabolic diseases. Two examples include using individual’s personal microbiome to predict glucose response to specific foods [<xref rid="pone.0279830.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] or using genetic variants such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to predict SU-lowering response of allopurinol [<xref rid="pone.0279830.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0279830.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. For example, Chinese participants with gout had higher abundances of intestinal microbiota in <italic toggle="yes">Prevotella</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Fusobacterium</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">Bacteroides</italic> yet lower in <italic toggle="yes">Enterobacteriaceae</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">butyrate</italic>-producing species compared to healthy adults [<xref rid="pone.0279830.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0279830.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The functional analysis also showed participants with gout were enriched in genes for fructose, mannose metabolism and lipid A biosynthesis but low in genes for urate degradation and short chain fatty acid production [<xref rid="pone.0279830.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In patients with gout, urate-lowering therapies such as allopurinol treatment for more than 30 days were found to reduce <italic toggle="yes">Bacteroidaceae</italic> and enhance <italic toggle="yes">Ruminococcacea-Prevotellaceae</italic> compared to those without allopurinol treatment [<xref rid="pone.0279830.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In addition, vitamin C 1000mg daily for 2 weeks have shown a positive bacterial shift in healthy volunteers [<xref rid="pone.0279830.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Based on these studies, we selected a 500mg twice daily dose of vitamin C for our study having several sources of evidence for efficacy for individuals with hyperuricemia/gout, while displaying a favorable tolerance or safety profile for those without hyperuricemia or gout.</p>
              <p>We conducted the <underline><bold>M</bold></underline>icrobiome <underline><bold>AN</bold></underline>d <underline><bold>G</bold></underline>out, <underline><bold>O</bold></underline>besity, Vitamin <underline><bold>C</bold></underline> (HMANGO-C) study as a prospective open-labelled clinical trial whose primary objective was to evaluate the SU-lowering effect of vitamin C 500mg twice daily for 8 weeks in a high-risk Hmong adults. The secondary objectives were to assess if 1) vitamin C administration impacts the taxonomic and functional patterns of gut microbiota; 2) taxonomic and functional patterns of gut microbiota impact vitamin C’s urate-lowering effects; 3) genetic variations in select genes impact vitamin C’s urate-lowering effects; 4) differential microbial biomarkers exist for patients with or without gout and 5) there is an association between obesity, gut microbiota and gout. We utilized a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach given the study’s focus on an underserved unique population at risk.</p>

                  <p>Individuals with gout completed a gout symptom online assessment tool using an established swollen joint count tool: <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.carearthritis.com/tools/tools_html.anonlaunch?toolid=8&amp;refid=/physicians.php%23tab2" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.carearthritis.com/tools/tools_html.anonlaunch?toolid=8&amp;refid=/physicians.php%23tab2</ext-link>.</p>
                  <p>In addition, participants with gout also completed a modified Gout Assessment Questionnaire version 2.0 (GAQ 2.0) [<xref rid="pone.0279830.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The GAQ 2.0 is a patient-reported outcome measurement tool with 24 items that assesses overall gout concerns, gout medication side effects, unmet treatment goals, wellbeing during gout attacks, and concerns during gout attacks. Since validation of this tool was conducted in a population with low ethnic diversity, we conducted a “cross-cultural adaptation of scales” process [<xref rid="pone.0279830.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0279830.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] to evaluate the relevance of questionnaire’s items for the Hmong community. The process yielded some changes in wording in order to retain the intent of the question, given cultural and linguistic context. For example, we expanded the inquiring into people’s well-being during gout attacks, from focusing on work and recreational activities already assessed by the survey to asking about social obligations since the Hmong community values social obligations as equally important as other aspects of life. Also, we rephrased “gout symptoms” to “gout attack” because Hmong patients recognize the phrase “gout attack” but not necessarily “gout symptoms”. The resulting product was translated into Hmong. The English version of the modified and translated Hmong GAQ 2.0 tools are available as supplementary material.</p>

                  <p>We held in-person visits to locations (e.g., healthcare clinics) known to the community; at the beginning of the pandemic, we met inside a UMN community research van; as restrictions loosened, we met inside buildings. Our use of a mobile clinical van created a “safer” environment limiting in-person interactions by avoiding the participants from having to enter a physical clinic setting during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

Once collected, blood samples were stored at 4°C (for less than 24 hours) until processing and testing at laboratory. Upon receipt of participants completed samples, participants obtained vitamin C 500mg capsules sufficient for 8 weeks of treatment and a $75 gift card.</p>

We instructed participants to take vitamin C 500mg twice daily by mouth for 8 weeks, along with their usual prescribed medications (including ULT), supplements and nutraceuticals during the study period. To facilitate adherence, we asked participants to record their vitamin C taking history in a study medication diary sheet (See Supplemental Material), and we sent follow-up reminder phone/text/emails at weeks 1, 4 and 7, at these timepoints, we also documented study medication adverse effects as well as document any gout attacks which may have occurred during vitamin C treatment period. To assess study medication adherence, we used the medication diary sheet recorded by participants at Visit 2. The assessment of blood levels of ascorbic acid after treatment to verify the medication adherence is not planned because ascorbic acid is rapidly degraded [<xref rid="pone.0279830.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] and current study design did not allow a reliable measurement of ascorbic acid.</p>

                <p>Baseline characteristics, including participants’ demographics, anthropometrics, medical/medication history, and vital signs, were collected remotely via REDCap survey or in-person at respective clinical visits. Blood and urine samples were sent to Advanced Research and Diagnostic Laboratory (ARDL), University of Minnesota for analysis. Saliva and stool samples were sent to UMGC for analysis.</p>
                <p>The study consent process provided participants the option to have samples saved and analyzed for future research questions. For those participants who agreed, their DNA and any stool, urine, or blood samples remaining after completed primary analysis will be stored in secured UMN -80 freezers for future studies.</p>
                <p>Participants’ identifiers were available only to members of the research team throughout the data collection period to contact participants for safety and study medication protocol adherence. At the end of the data collection period, participants’ key identifiers and their unique study ID will be maintained on a full disk encrypted secure server behind the UMN firewall, with access only by the Principal Investigator (PI) and co-PIs. We will access participants’ identifiers to invite them to a future dissemination event.</p>
                <p>The digital data was entered into a REDCap database, which uses a MySQL database via a secure web interface with data checks used during data entry to ensure data quality. Participant accrual data was entered into OnCore as required by the University of Minnesota’s Academic Health Center.

Aggregated genetics and microbiome results will also be shared with participants and the Hmong community at several venues and through several media. These may include locations, such as recruitment sites, community conferences, community events, community organizations and media including Hmong radio and television, and the Hmong Gout Coalition website. In addition, we will share results with local physicians and pharmacists who have partnered with recruitment, and we will disseminate our results with broader audiences by presenting at local, national, and international conferences, and by publishing peer-reviewed articles in scientific journals.</p>
                <p>Individual participant results will also be shared at the conclusion of the study. We will mail relevant individual results to the participants. Since the genetic results will not affect routine clinical care, credentialed genetic professionals will not be used to explain study results in-person. However, we will stress that analysis of biological samples is for research purposes only and are not necessary for participants’ clinical care.</p>

                <title>Study adjustments due to the impact of COVID-19</title>
                <p>The pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), commonly referred to as COVID-19, required adjusting the initial planned research approaches and practices. Shortly after the onset of the pandemic (around January 2020), studies involving in-person visits were required to adopt protocol modifications to minimize the physical contact with study participants to avoid the spread of SARS-CoV-2. As a result, our study protocol, which was designed to consider the unique challenges of working in an underserved population, required further adaptations to comply with COVID-19 guidance for research. We planned to recruit and enroll participants remotely by telephone and video, complete questionnaires on the internet, accept patient-reported anthropometry, and have participants self-collect blood, urine, spit, and stool in the safety of their own homes.</p>
                <p>With the nationwide implementation of COVID-19 vaccination plan (Spring 2021), it was anticipated that the COVID-19 restrictions regarding scientific research could be relaxed, such that in-person group screening, consenting and sample collecting events could occur. Throughout most of our data collection, we operated under an intermediate phase whereby we limited in-person visits were permitted to enable blood draws, anthropometry, and vital sign collection, while the majority of the recruitment processes, data collection of questionnaires, and biological sample collection occurred remotely.</p>
                <p>Due to COVID-19 restrictions, participation engagement occurred remotely. Study participants’ consent was obtained via an individual Zoom meeting or a direct conversation via a phone call, and demographic assessments were conducted remotely with virtual assistance provided by the study researchers. Stool, saliva, and urine samples were successfully collected at home. Early in the process (April 2021 through May 2021), at home blood collection using capillary blood collection tubes (200 uL and 500 uL) was attempted. However, obtaining enough blood for analysis from our first few participants failed, and had to be reconsidered. As vaccines became more widely available (Summer 2021), blood collection was changed to in-person visit as the restrictions for person interactions with participants were lifted. Biometric measurements were also conducted in person at a pre-determined convenient location by use of a study van. This was pursued to enhance enrollment by providing a convenient location for members of this community to engage.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>This study protocol documents a number of unique and diverse approaches to conducting a clinical trial. First, we designed the study based on the community-based participatory research principles that focus on engaging, identifying, and proposing a plan to address an issue of concern that is important to members of the community and utilizing an academic-community partnership to design and conduct a study aimed at solving a community’s health challenge. Second, we explored the effects of vitamin C as an intervention, analyzing its effect on the microbiome and omic-based markers which may predict its response. Third, we modified study procedures and approaches to meet the COVID-19 restrictions concerning limited in-person interactions at various times during the pandemic. We expect these results will provide insight as to the clinical utility of using microbiome and genetic information for patients with hyperuricemia and gout who could benefit from vitamin C supplementation. These results could provide guidance to clinicians who want to offer an accessible, acceptable, and low-cost treatment option for high-risk study population of Hmong. Conducting clinical research involving special populations—even during a pandemic—is necessary to advance knowledge about therapies for important clinical community problems. Several aspects of this study can assist academic-community research partnerships who conduct research on problems important to underserved communities.</p>

              <p>Dear Dr. Straka,</p>
              <p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE’s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.</p>
              <p>Please submit your revised manuscript by Sep 18 2022 11:59PM. If you will need more time than this to complete your revisions, please reply to this message or contact the journal office at <email>plosone@plos.org</email>. When you're ready to submit your revision, log on to <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/</ext-link> and select the 'Submissions Needing Revision' folder to locate your manuscript file.</p>
              <p>Please include the following items when submitting your revised manuscript:</p>
              <p>
                <list list-type="bullet">
                  <list-item>
                    <p>A rebuttal letter that responds to each point raised by the academic editor and reviewer(s). You should upload this letter as a separate file labeled 'Response to Reviewers'.</p>
                  </list-item>
                  <list-item>
                    <p>A marked-up copy of your manuscript that highlights changes made to the original version. You should upload this as a separate file labeled 'Revised Manuscript with Track Changes'.</p>
                  </list-item>
                  <list-item>
                    <p>An unmarked version of your revised paper without tracked changes. You should upload this as a separate file labeled 'Manuscript'.</p>

              </p>
              <p>If you would like to make changes to your financial disclosure, please include your updated statement in your cover letter. Guidelines for resubmitting your figure files are available below the reviewer comments at the end of this letter.</p>
              <p>If applicable, we recommend that you deposit your laboratory protocols in protocols.io to enhance the reproducibility of your results. Protocols.io assigns your protocol its own identifier (DOI) so that it can be cited independently in the future. For instructions see: <ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-laboratory-protocols" ext-link-type="uri">https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-laboratory-protocols</ext-link>. Additionally, PLOS ONE offers an option for publishing peer-reviewed Lab Protocol articles, which describe protocols hosted on protocols.io. Read more information on sharing protocols at <ext-link xlink:href="https://plos.org/protocols?utm_medium=editorial-email&amp;utm_source=authorletters&amp;utm_campaign=protocols" ext-link-type="uri">https://plos.org/protocols?utm_medium=editorial-email&amp;utm_source=authorletters&amp;utm_campaign=protocols</ext-link>.</p>
              <p>We look forward to receiving your revised manuscript.</p>
              <p>Kind regards,</p>
              <p>Cristina Vassalle</p>
              <p>Academic Editor</p>
              <p>PLOS ONE</p>
              <p>Journal requirements:</p>
              <p>When submitting your revision, we need you to address these additional requirements.</p>
              <p>1. Please ensure that your manuscript meets PLOS ONE's style requirements, including those for file naming. The PLOS ONE style templates can be found at</p>
              <p><ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/file?id=wjVg/PLOSOne_formatting_sample_main_body.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/file?id=wjVg/PLOSOne_formatting_sample_main_body.pdf</ext-link> and</p>
              <p><ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/file?id=ba62/PLOSOne_formatting_sample_title_authors_affiliations.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/file?id=ba62/PLOSOne_formatting_sample_title_authors_affiliations.pdf</ext-link>".</p>
              <p>2. Thank you for stating the following in the Funding Section of your manuscript:</p>
              <p>“Minnesota Partnership for Biotechnology and Medical Genomics grant #18.08, Targeting the gut microbiome to prevent the increasing incidence of obesity in immigrant populations. This funding source had no role in the design of this study and will not have any role during its execution, analyses, interpretation of the data or decision to submit results.”</p>
              <p>We note that you have provided funding information that is not currently declared in your Funding Statement. However, funding information should not appear in the Acknowledgments section or other areas of your manuscript. We will only publish funding information present in the Funding Statement section of the online submission form.</p>
              <p>Please remove any funding-related text from the manuscript and let us know how you would like to update your Funding Statement. Currently, your Funding Statement reads as follows:</p>
              <p> “D.K received funding from  Minnesota Partnership for Biotechnology and Medical Genomics grant #18.08, Targeting the gut microbiome to prevent the increasing incidence of obesity in immigrant populations. This funding source had no role in the design of this study and will not have any role during its execution, analyses, interpretation of the data or decision to submit results.”</p>
              <p>Please include your amended statements within your cover letter; we will change the online submission form on your behalf.</p>
              <p>3. Thank you for stating the following in the Competing Interests section:</p>
              <p>“D.K. serves as CEO and holds equity in CoreBiome, a company involved in the commercialization of microbiome analysis. The University of Minnesota also has financial interests in CoreBiome under the terms of a license agreement with CoreBiome. These interests have been reviewed and managed by the University of Minnesota in accordance with its Conflict-of-Interest policies.”</p>
              <p>Please confirm that this does not alter your adherence to all PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials, by including the following statement: ""This does not alter our adherence to  PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.” (as detailed online in our guide for authors <ext-link xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/competing-interests" ext-link-type="uri">http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/competing-interests</ext-link>).  If there are restrictions on sharing of data and/or materials, please state these. Please note that we cannot proceed with consideration of your article until this information has been declared.</p>
              <p>Please include your updated Competing Interests statement in your cover letter; we will change the online submission form on your behalf.</p>
              <p>4. In your Data Availability statement, you have not specified where the minimal data set underlying the results described in your manuscript can be found. PLOS defines a study's minimal data set as the underlying data used to reach the conclusions drawn in the manuscript and any additional data required to replicate the reported study findings in their entirety. All PLOS journals require that the minimal data set be made fully available. For more information about our data policy, please see <ext-link xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability" ext-link-type="uri">http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability</ext-link>.</p>
              <p>Upon re-submitting your revised manuscript, please upload your study’s minimal underlying data set as either Supporting Information files or to a stable, public repository and include the relevant URLs, DOIs, or accession numbers within your revised cover letter. For a list of acceptable repositories, please see <ext-link xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability#loc-recommended-repositories" ext-link-type="uri">http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability#loc-recommended-repositories</ext-link>. Any potentially identifying patient information must be fully anonymized.</p>
              <p>Important: If there are ethical or legal restrictions to sharing your data publicly, please explain these restrictions in detail. Please see our guidelines for more information on what we consider unacceptable restrictions to publicly sharing data: <ext-link xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability#loc-unacceptable-data-access-restrictions" ext-link-type="uri">http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability#loc-unacceptable-data-access-restrictions</ext-link>. Note that it is not acceptable for the authors to be the sole named individuals responsible for ensuring data access.</p>
              <p>We will update your Data Availability statement to reflect the information you provide in your cover letter.</p>
              <p>5. We note that the original protocol file you uploaded contains a confidentiality notice indicating that the protocol may not be shared publicly or be published. Please note, however, that the PLOS Editorial Policy requires that the original protocol be published alongside your manuscript in the event of acceptance. Please note that should your paper be accepted, all content including the protocol will be published under the Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) 4.0 license, which means that it will be freely available online, and any third party is permitted to access, download, copy, distribute, and use these materials in any way, even commercially, with proper attribution.</p>

              <p>Reviewer #1: This is an interesting and well written paper; the protocol is carefully described.</p>
              <p>Some comments.</p>
              <p>In the introduction the possible role of Vit C on gut microbiota should be shortly added to better define point 1 of the secondary objective, e.g. in a healthy population high doses of Vit C have shown a positive shift of bacteria populations in the gut (Otten 2021).</p>
              <p>Similarly, in the introduction when dealing with metabolic diseases, published data on the presence of dysbiosis in gout patients and the role of specific urate-reducing drugs in modifying gut microbiota should be provided.</p>
              <p>Are pts under diuretic treatment allowed in the study?</p>
              <p>"To assess study medication adherence, we used the medication diary sheet recorded by participants at Visit 2". It should be discussed that the assessment of blood levels of ascorbic acid after treatment is not planned.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: This study protocol is well structured and well elaborated., although there are some critical points that the authors should remedy.</p>
              <p>The authors should better explain the rationale for the administration of vitamin C to subjects without gout/hyperuricaemia.</p>
              <p>How were the doses of vitamin C to be administered chosen?</p>
              <p>Among the primary objectives, the authors should also introduce placebo especially in the patient group.</p>
              <p>In my opinion, when analysing the data, the authors should also take gender into account.</p>
              <p>Fig. 1 is actually a table</p>
              <p>As far as blood and urine tests are concerned, the authors want to study the urate-creatinine trend.</p>
              <p>It would also be good to analyse markers of oxidative stress, such as ROS, or indices of biological oxidative damage such as malondialdehyde and isoprostanes.</p>
              <p>Vitamin C at high plasma concentrations may act as a pro-oxidant (1) Have the authors ever tested this effect or is there any data for the treatment they want to perform? Any treatment with vitamin C in patients genetically predisposed to high uric acid levels should be performed for life. According to the authors, would this not lead to an increased oxidative risk in these subjects? (2)</p>

                <named-content content-type="author-response-date">23 Nov 2022</named-content>
              </p>
              <p>Thank you for your feedback concerning our comprehensive response to the initial review. We are pleased that each of the reviewers took time to evaluate our responses and for the most part appreciated our responses as honest attempts to address their valued feedback. We are also happy to respond to additional comments made by the Reviewer 2. </p>
              <p>Specific to Reviewer 2, we respectfully disagree with reviewer’s feedback on “most of the comments made were not taken into account”. Instead, we believe that most of the comments from Reviewer 2 (see Comments 1-6 in the section of Reviewer 2 Comment from First Revision) had been adequately addressed and incorporated into manuscript since Reviewer 2 did not have further suggestions on these comments. </p>
              <p>Regarding reviewer 2’s suggestion on testing biomarkers of oxidative stress or DNA damage such as 8-oxoguanine and 8-oxoadenine (Kaźmierczak-Barańska et al. and Podmore et al.) due to increased oxidative risk from high dose vitamin C (500 mg twice daily), we have the following rebuttal. As previously described in the paper, the aim of our study is to evaluate the efficacy (by measuring serum urate change) and safety (by collecting patient reported adverse events) of vitamin C over the course of 8 weeks (not chronically) on the microbiome within and between individuals with and without gout and/or hyperuricemia. </p>
              <p>The two key points here are (1) that we are looking for a signal from 8 weeks of vitamin C exposure (not chronic therapy as the reviewer suggested) and that (2) the dose chosen (1g/day) was by no means excessive, based on a variety of studies conducted in a variety of subjects using, in some cases much higher doses over similar, and in some cases, longer timeframes than our 8 weeks. Clinical studies have demonstrated the safety profile of a wide dose ranges of vitamin C in various populations (Yanase et al. Pediatr Crit Care Med. 2021;22(6):561-571; Andrés et al. Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2021;11(11):CD010156.). Therefore, we are confident that the dose tested in the study is safe for the study participants in our setting. In addition, as for the suggestion to incorporate testing of biomarkers of oxidative stress or DNA damage in our study, we feel as stated before that the need for this is outside the scope of our study’s objectives. Including additional biomarkers would require a protocol change, revisions of informed consent, and the need to re-contact study participants which is not feasible given the study timeline of this study and resources. To reiterate our previous response, if we identify a favorable effect of Vitamin C on serum urate in our study population for our (8 week) short course of treatment, and a link between the microbiome and urate as well, we would naturally pursue more carefully designed dose ranging studies which would specifically test for the “optimal” dosages for the positive effects of vitamin C and any possible untoward effects (including pro-oxidative effects for example) especially if we pursued longer term (&gt;8 week) use. It would also evaluate whether indeed, chronic dosing of vitamin C would be necessary or episodic (non-chronic use) of vitamin C would be more favorable. Since these are all possibilities it seems as if we should await a signal before planning the next series of studies. </p>
              <p>We do note that Reviewer 2’s comments represent a statement of “In my opinion” and generally agree with the potential value in further study, but simply do not feel that Reviewer 2’s opinion justifies a change in our protocol at this stage, in order to investigate the possibility of a signal for the objective we are seeking. I will note that this is simply a pilot study seeking preliminary data in support of future more extensively designed investigations.</p>
              <p>Reviewer 2 Comment from Second Revision</p>
              <p>Most of the comments made were not taken into account. The authors state that they have difficulties in introducing other markers or the placebo due to their limited budget.</p>
              <p>In my opinion, there are aspects not to be underestimated in this study, such as the production of oxygen free radicals in patients subjected to high doses of vitamin C for long periods.</p>
              <p>As a result of our careful consideration of “Reviewer 2’s Comments” we believe we have addressed them as above in a manner that does not require changes to the current version of the manuscript posted. This is why you will not see an updated version of the manuscript but simply our rebuttal to Reviewer 2’s comments as above.</p>
