                <p id="Par1">The airway microbiome has an important role in asthma pathophysiology. However, little is known on the relationships between the airway microbiome of asthmatic children, loss of asthma control, and severe exacerbations. Here we report that the microbiotaâ€™s dynamic patterns and compositions are related to asthma exacerbations. We collected nasal blow samples (nâ€‰=â€‰319) longitudinally during a clinical trial at 2 time-points within one year: randomization when asthma is under control, and at time of early loss of asthma control (yellow zone (YZ)). We report that participants whose microbiota wasÂ dominated by the commensal <italic>Corynebacterium</italic>â€‰<italic>+</italic>â€‰<italic>Dolosigranulum</italic> cluster at RD experience the lowest rates of YZs (pâ€‰=â€‰0.005) and have longer time to develop at least 2 episodes of YZ (pâ€‰=â€‰0.03). The airway microbiota have changed from randomization to YZ. A switch from the <italic>Corynebacterium</italic>â€‰<italic>+</italic>â€‰<italic>Dolosigranulum</italic> cluster at randomization to the <italic>Moraxella-</italic> cluster at YZ poses the highest risk of severe asthma exacerbation (pâ€‰=â€‰0.04). <italic>Corynebacteriumâ€™s</italic> relative abundance at YZ is inversely associated with severe exacerbation (pâ€‰=â€‰0.002).</p>

              <p id="Par3">Asthma exacerbations have high impact on children, their families, the health care system, and may lead to subsequent decline in lung function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Early signs of loss of asthma control, often referred to as the Yellow Zone (YZ), is a period during which the patient is at risk of symptom progression to severe exacerbation.</p>
              <p id="Par4">Among preschool children, the airway microbiome is associated with respiratory illness severity, future wheezing, and childhood asthma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. However, it is unknown if the airway microbiome is related to asthma control and risk of exacerbations among school-age children with mild asthma.</p>
              <p id="Par5">To investigate this question, we utilize a well-characterized cohort of school-age children with mild-moderate persistent asthma treated with daily ICS in a clinical trial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. We prospectively investigate whether the upper-airway microbiota at the time of respiratory health (randomization) is related to the development of future YZ episodes, and whether the microbiome at YZ are related to the likelihood of progression to severe asthma exacerbation requiring oral corticosteroids (OCS).</p>
              <p id="Par6">We report that the airway microbiota colonization patterns are differentially associated with risk of loss of asthma control and severe exacerbations. Specifically, airway microbiota dominated by <italic>Corynebacterium</italic>â€‰<italic>+</italic>â€‰<italic>Dolosigranulum</italic> genera are associated with favorable clinical outcomes compared to microbiota dominated by more pathogenic bacteria: <italic>Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and Moraxella</italic>.</p>

                <title>Characterization of the airway microbiota at randomization</title>
                <p id="Par7">To first identify any cohort characteristics that affects airway microbiota, we performed Permutational multivariate ANOVA (PERMANOVA) using nasal blow samples collected at time of randomization (RD) from 214 children participating in a clinicalÂ trialÂ (mean age 8.0 +/âˆ’ 1.8 years, 59% were males, and 57% were Caucasian). The 214 children are a well representation of the total clinical trial cohort (<italic>n</italic>â€‰=â€‰254) as demographics and clinical characteristics were not statistically different between the 254 children participated in the clinical trial and this subset of 214 children.</p>
                <p id="Par8">The overall microbial composition and abundances were significantly different in age groups (<italic>p</italic>â€‰=â€‰0.02, PERMANOVA). Differential abundance analysis by DESeq showed that older children (8â€“11-year-old) had higher randomization abundance of <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> (<italic>p</italic>â€‰=â€‰0.04), while younger children (5â€“7-year-old) had higher abundances of <italic>Moraxella</italic> (<italic>p</italic>â€‰=â€‰0.05) and <italic>Streptococcus</italic> (<italic>p</italic>â€‰=â€‰0.03) (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). Younger participants (5â€“7-year-old) were more likely to develop YZ (ORâ€‰=â€‰3.2, 95% CI 1.7â€“6.8, <italic>p</italic>â€‰=â€‰0.003) compared to older participants. The presence of a pet in the house was associated with an increased risk of developing YZ (ORâ€‰=â€‰2.8, 95% CI 1.5â€“5.4, <italic>p</italic>â€‰=â€‰0.006; (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>)). 22.9% of the participants were treated with antibiotics during the 6 months prior to randomization, but this covariate did not affect the composition of the microbiota at time of randomization (<italic>p</italic>â€‰=â€‰0.52, PERMANOVA). Other than age or the presence of pets, no other clinical variables (gender, ethnicity, BMI, total IgE level, number of asthma-related hospitalizations in the past year, peripheral eosinophil count, and lung function values (FEV1 percent, FEV1/FVC ratio) were found to be associated with risk of developing YZ. Based on these findings, all subsequent analyses that included randomization samples were adjusted for age and the presence of pets at home.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Top 25 major taxa identified at randomization.</title><p>Top 25 most abundant taxa in different age groups (<bold>a</bold>) and by the presence of respiratory virus in the sample (<bold>b</bold>)Â are shown by barplots.

                <p id="Par9">As it is well known that viral respiratory infections contribute to asthma exacerbations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, we investigated the effect of respiratory viruses in our cohort. Respiratory viruses were detected in 33% of the randomization samples: 64% of these viruses were rhinovirus. The proportion of virus positive samples was numerically higher in younger age group (39.3% in young vs. 28.0% in old groups), but was not significantly different (<italic>p</italic>â€‰=â€‰0.11, Chi-squared test). Comparing to viral negative samples, the relative abundance of <italic>Moraxella</italic> (<italic>p</italic>â€‰=â€‰0.04, by DESeq) were higher while the relative abundances of <italic>Bacillus</italic> (<italic>p</italic>â€‰=â€‰0.03, by DESeq) and <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> (<italic>p</italic>â€‰=â€‰0.04, by DESeq) were significantly lower in the viral positive samples, suggesting a possible interaction between viruses and these bacterial genera (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). However, the presence of respiratory virus at randomization (while the children did not have respiratory symptoms) was not associated with the risk of future YZ development (ORâ€‰=â€‰1.4, 95% CI 0.72â€“2.90, <italic>p</italic>â€‰=â€‰0.33), or the risk of future exacerbations (ORâ€‰=â€‰1, 95% CI 0.39â€“2.44, <italic>p</italic>â€‰=â€‰0.9). The finding that respiratory viruses were not predictive at baseline for subsequent loss of control and exacerbations may in part be attributable to the lack of differentiation of rhinovirus types as in children Rhinovirus C has been shown to be most strongly associated with asthma exacerbations compared to Rhinovirus A or B<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, all subsequent analyses that included randomization samples were adjusted for the presence of respiratory viruses at randomization.</p>

                <p id="Par10">To first evaluate whether the microbiota at time of well-controlled asthma (randomization) is related to loss of asthma control at YZ, we perform unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis using 214 nasal samples from randomization. We identified four clusters dominated by the following genera: <italic>Corynebacterium</italic>â€‰+â€‰<italic>Dolosigranulum</italic>, <italic>Staphylococcus</italic>, <italic>Streptococcus</italic>, and <italic>Moraxella</italic> (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). During the follow up period (320 days), 75.7% and 43.4% of the participants experienced at least one and two episodes of YZ, respectively. The median annualized rate of YZ was significantly lower in participants who had the <italic>Corynebacterium</italic>â€‰+â€‰<italic>Dolosigranulum</italic> dominated cluster at randomization compared to the aggregate of the 3 other clusters combined together, or any other cluster (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a, b; <italic>p</italic>â€‰=â€‰0.005; Wilcoxon rank-sum test). In addition, Cox Proportional-Hazards analysis showed that participants in the <italic>Corynebacterium</italic>â€‰<italic>+</italic>â€‰<italic>Dolosigranulum</italic> cluster had significantly longer time to develop at least 2 episodes of YZ compared to participants in the combined 3 other clusters (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>, <italic>p</italic>â€‰=â€‰0.03, ward test) and compared to any other cluster (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>, <italic>p</italic>â€‰=â€‰0.05, ward test).

                <title>Changes in airway microbiota from randomization to YZ</title>
                <p id="Par11">We next determined the dynamics of nasal bacterial microbiota from randomization to YZ utilizing samples from the 102 participants who contributed samples both at randomizing and at YZ (102 paired samples (total 204 samples)). The bacterial compositions and their relative abundance in individual patients demonstrated profound alteration from randomization to YZ (Figs.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>, <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Strikingly, more than half of the patients switched to a different dominant cluster between these 2 time points, most commonly to the <italic>Streptococcus</italic> cluster (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Resultantly, <italic>Streptococcus</italic> cluster became the most prevalent cluster at YZ (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). The changes of microbiota are also evident in bacterial alpha diversity and total bacterial load. At YZ, total bacterial load (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>) and bacterial richness (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>) were significantly higher (<italic>p</italic>â€‰&lt;â€‰0.01 for both, Wilcoxon rank-sum test) than those at randomization.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><title>Bacterial microbiome comparison between randomization (RD) and yellow zone (YZ).</title><p><bold>a</bold> Five bacterial clusters were identified using the paired randomization (<italic>n</italic>â€‰=â€‰102) and YZ data (<italic>n</italic>â€‰=â€‰102).

                <title>Airway microbiota at YZ and asthma exacerbations</title>
                <p id="Par12">To test whether the microbiome at the time of YZ is associated with severe exacerbation, we compared the microbiota difference in participants who progressed to severe exacerbation requiring OCS therapy (30/105â€‰=â€‰28.6%) and those who did not (75/105â€‰=â€‰71.4%) (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). We found a numerically lower, but not statistically significant, proportion of patients who required OCS from the <italic>Corynebacterium</italic>â€‰<italic>+</italic>â€‰<italic>Dolosigranulum</italic> cluster at the time of YZ compared to the other three clusters (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a</xref>, <italic>p</italic>â€‰=â€‰0.35, Chiseq-test). Furthermore, analysis of specific bacterial genera revealed that <italic>Corynebacterium</italic> was more abundant at YZ in samples obtained from episodes that did not progress to severe exacerbation (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7b</xref>, <italic>P</italic>â€‰=â€‰0.002, DeSeq). In addition, higher relative abundance of <italic>Corynebacterium</italic> was associated with a modest reduction in the risk of progressing to exacerbation (ORâ€‰=â€‰0.92, 95%CI 0.89â€“0.94, <italic>P</italic>â€‰=â€‰0.04). The reason that this effect was not very strong, may be related to the relatively low rate of participants who progressed to severe exacerbation, leading to reduced power for the YZ analyses. We did not find any association between that microbiome at randomization and severe exacerbations, likely due to the profound changes in the microbiome between RD and YZ. Finally, bacterial richness (<italic>p</italic>â€‰=â€‰0.64, Wilcoxon rank-sum test) or load (<italic>p</italic>â€‰=â€‰0.16, Wilcoxon rank-sum test) at yellow zone were not associated with asthma exacerbations.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><title>Bacterial clusters identified from 105 nasal samples at yellow zone (YZ).</title><p>Five clusters, <italic>Corynebacterium</italic>â€‰+â€‰<italic>Dolosigranulum</italic> (cyan), <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> (black), <italic>Streptococcus</italic> (pink), <italic>Moraxella</italic> (blue), and <italic>Haemophilus</italic> (gray) were identified by hierarchical clustering and complete linkage approach.

Respiratory viruses were detected in 78 (74.3%) of the YZ samples, of these 48 samples were enterovirus/human rhinovirus (EV/RV) positive.

              <p id="Par15">In this prospective, longitudinal study we characterized the upper-airway bacterial microbiota of school-age children receiving daily low-dose ICS at time of well-controlled asthma (randomization) and during loss of asthma control (YZ). We found that the airway microbiota colonization patterns were differentially associated with risk of loss of asthma control and severe exacerbation. Specifically, the airway microbiota of children classified as dominated by <italic>Corynebacterium</italic>â€‰<italic>+</italic>â€‰<italic>Dolosigranulum</italic> genera during randomization was associated with a lower risk of developing loss of asthma control compared to those with microbiota being dominated by more pathogenic bacteria, specifically <italic>Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and Moraxella</italic>. Furthermore, at the time of YZ, <italic>Corynebacteriumâ€™s</italic> relative abundance was inversely associated with the likelihood of progressing from YZ to severe exacerbation.</p>
              <p id="Par16">Previous studies found that colonization of the upper airways with opportunistic bacterial pathogens including <italic>Streptococcus, Moraxella, and Haemophilus</italic> is more common among asthmatics than healthy individuals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Our findings, that still needs to be validated in independent cohorts, suggest the potential pathogenic role of these bacteria in asthma. These finding is in one line with a recent study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, in children with moderate-severe asthma, which revealed that a <italic>Moraxella</italic> dominated upper airway microbiome was associated with increased exacerbation risk. Our findings extend the potential pathogenic role of <italic>Moraxella</italic> to the large population of children with mild asthma, which are the vast majority of childhood asthma patients. Further, our study revealed that <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> was not protective, but rather, was associated with highest YZ episodes, which is different from previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. This difference may be related to different age groups, different disease severity, or different <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. While uncharacterized previously, the vast majority of <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> genera in our study were comprised of <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, which was previously reported to be associated with wheeze and asthma among children and young adults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par17">Our findings highlight the association between commensal bacteria such as <italic>Corynebacterium</italic> and <italic>Dolosigranulum</italic> and asthma control<italic>. Corynebacterium</italic> is the most abundant genus identified in the nose by the Human Microbiome Project that characterized the normal microbial composition in healthy adults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, and was found less frequently as a dominant member of the nasal microbiome in asthmatic adults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> suggesting that this bacteria may have a protective effect. Since bacteria colonizing the upper airways, as those colonizing other niches within the human body, exist in a competitive state and it is plausible that competitive colonization may be one of the factors by which commensal bacterial provide protection against pathogen colonization and overgrowth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Indeed, <italic>Corynebacterium</italic> and <italic>Dolosigranulum</italic> can inhibit the growth of <italic>Streptococcus</italic> by releasing antibacterial products that may prevent nasal colonization with <italic>Streptococcus</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Collectively these observations indicate that from an ecological perspective, a microbiome at equilibrium may resist colonization with pathogenic bacteria and is important for the maintenance of a healthy airway. This hypothesis is supported by the finding of our study as the composition of airway microbiota at time of respiratory health was associated with loss of asthma control during the following year. Validation this finding by an independent cohort may lead to identification of potential microbiome markers at respiratory health to predict loss of asthma control in future.</p>
              <p id="Par18">The finding of the current study in school-aged children expand the findings of previous work by Teo et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> who showed that among young preschool children, detection of <italic>Streptococcus, Moraxella</italic>, and <italic>Haemophilus</italic>, as a dominant members of the upper airway microbiota, was more common during viral upper-respiratory infections compared to times of respiratory health, and predicted progression to lower respiratory symptoms. In addition, microbiota characterized by dominant <italic>Corynebacterium, Staphylococcus</italic>, and <italic>Alloiococcus</italic> (<italic>Dolosigranulum</italic> in some databases) were more common during well-visits supporting the potentially protective role of <italic>Corynebacterium</italic>, and <italic>Dolosigranulum</italic> identified in our study.</p>
              <p id="Par19">The airway microbiota composition dramatically changed between randomization and YZ visits. The directionality of switch was found to be important, since switching from the microbiota dominated by <italic>Corynebacterium</italic>/<italic>Dolosigranulum</italic> to <italic>Moraxella</italic> cluster was associated with higher risk of asthma exacerbation. This observation indicates that commensal nasal microbiota in asthmatic children does not appear to prevent overgrowth by all pathogenic bacteria, in particular <italic>Moraxella</italic>, suggesting distinct intricate microbial interactions between specific members of the airway microbiota, which remain to be elucidated. In addition, respiratory viruses, mainly rhinovirus, were detected in most YZ samples. Although limited by small sample size, an interesting observation is that samples belonging to the <italic>Moraxella</italic> or <italic>Haemophilus</italic> dominated microbiota during YZ were all positive for respiratory viruses. This finding is consistent with the high rate of virus-positive samples in children with these microbiota signatures at randomization, and with previous reports linking rhinovirus infection with the detection of these bacterial genera in the airway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par20">This study highlights some bacteria that were associated with favorable asthma outcomes, while other bacteria were associated with asthma morbidity. However, the design of this current study does not allow to determine causality. It is still unknown if the microbiome changes drive asthma activity, are consequence or the trigger of viral infection, or are result of bidirectional cross-talk between the microbiome and host mucosal and systemic immune response during YZ development and acute exacerbations. It may also be that the microbiota changes reflect lack of asthma control and airway inflammation. More frequent sampling, together with simultaneous host immune studies, may allow insight into these interactions. In addition, studies in mice infected with these bacteria may allow to determine causality.</p>
              <p id="Par21">The advantages of this study are mainly related to its conduct as a study coupled to a well-designed clinical trial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Patients were carefully characterized resulting in a homogenous population of school-aged children all requiring step 2 asthma care, treated with an identical dose of ICS. Therefore, we minimized microbiota differences that may be related to disease severity and/or effects of different ICS dosing, which are factors known to affect the airway microbiome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Prospective data and sample collection as part of a clinical trial together with tight follow-up visits and calls have minimized recall and measurement biases. Finally, YZ samples were collected before applying study intervention (high-dose ICS) eliminating the effect of high-dose ICS on the microbiome.</p>
              <p id="Par22">This study has some limitations. The parent STICS clinical trial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> had a relatively low rate of YZ episodes, and as expected only 30% of YZ episodes progressed to severe exacerbation, leading to reduced power for the YZ analyses. In addition, a follow-up nasal sample after the YZ was not obtained, and this could have provided important information related to the microbiota composition at the time of resolution of the episode. One additional factor that may be related to the microbiome composition is allergen exposure in atopic children. As we do not have allergen exposure data, we cannot comment on this relationship in our study.</p>
              <p id="Par23">In this study, we investigated associations between bacterial clusters, defined by the relative abundance of the bacteria, and clinical outcomes. Determining the absolute density of different bacteria in a metagenomic sample is an emerging concept in microbiome research, which has showed interesting results in a stool microbiome study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. We view the relative and absolute abundances of the microbiome as complementary to each other. As a low biomass material, bacterial density from nasal wash warrants thorough investigation in future regarding methodology including efficiency and robustness and data normalization for microbiome analysis. In addition, functional level characterization of the bacterial microbiome by transcriptome analysis or IgA-Seq are likely to improve our understanding of the role of airway microbiome in asthma and its exacerbation.</p>
              <p id="Par24">This study revealed that changes in the upper respiratory tract are associated with events in the lower respiratory tract. Although there are similarities between the lung and upper-airway microbiota compositions, studies have shown that these different compartments have different microbiome composition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> Therefore, we must acknowledge that changes in the nasal microbiota may represent a secondary phenomenon and are not necessarily related to asthma control. However, some key bacterial taxa co-exist in the nasal and bronchial airways, especially in asthmatics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. In addition, multiple studies have highlighted the relevance of the upper airway microbiota as a surrogate for the lung microbiota, and have shown that the upper-airway is a relevant compartment that provides valuable data on asthma inception<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, asthma diagnosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, and asthma exacerbations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par25">In summary, we demonstrate a relationship between upper-airway microbiota composition and the risk of both loss of asthma control and severe exacerbations, among school-aged children with asthma. A randomization upper airway microbiota dominated by <italic>Corynebacterium</italic>â€‰<italic>+</italic>â€‰<italic>Dolosigranulum</italic> was associated with a significantly lower rate of YZ development. In addition, upper-airway microbiota composition was not static, and a shift to a <italic>Moraxella</italic>-dominant microbiome at YZ and/or a lower <italic>Corynebacterium</italic> abundance at YZ were both associated with increased risk of severe exacerbations during the following year. These findings still need to be validated in independent cohorts. Then, there is a need to perform animal studies to further investigate the role of the bacteria identified in this study in asthma exacerbations. If their role are confirmed, investigation of more advanced strategies that modulate microbiota composition would be indicated, in an effort to reduce the risk of asthma exacerbations.</p>

In brief, to characterize the bacterial microbiota, the V1 to V3 regions of 16S rRNA gene were amplified (primers 27F and 534R (27F:5â€²-AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3â€² and 534R: 5â€²-ATTACCGCGGCTGCTGG-3â€²), barcoded, and sequenced on the Illumina Miseq (2â€‰Ã—â€‰300â€‰bp) platform. Paired-end reads were assembled using Flash V1.2.7. Assembled reads were assigned to taxonomies using Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) software with classification confidence at &gt;=0.8. The processed reads were subsampled to 10,000 reads/sample for 16S rRNA gene sequences. We included extraction control, PCR negative control for DNA extraction and sequencing. Less than five hundred reads were found in these negative controls, suggesting background noise is less likely to have significant impact on the data analysis.

Exploratory multivariable analysis was done through hierarchical clustering to identify microbiome distribution patterns. Taxa with the relative abundances &gt;0.1% was included in hierarchical clustering. Complete linkage was used for assigning samples to clusters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. R package ComplexHeatmap was used for cluster visualization and annotation of clinical variables. The names of clusters are defined based on the dominant bacteria genus in for that cluster. Permutational multivariate ANOVA (PERMANOVA) was used for formal statistical testing to investigate whether the bacterial community structure varied between different clinical parameters. DESeq2 was used to identify differential taxa between samples at randomization (RD) and YZ. Clinical variables including age, viral infection, gender and having a pet were first tested individually using PERMANOVA or DESeq2. The confounding variables were included along with variable of interest (RD and YZ) in the final model of PERMANOVA or DESeq2. The results from DESeq2 were further speculated by plotting the raw and relative abundance data. Results that are likely driven by outliers were removed from final reporting. Bacterial diversity including Richness and Shannon Diversity was computed using R package Vegan and statistical significance between groups was determined using Wilcoxon-rank test. Comparison of patient numbers between clusters was performed by chi-square or Fisherâ€™s exact test. Exacerbation data was treated as categorical data (0 and 1), and was applied to a generalized logistic regression model with binomial distribution to determine whether a given taxon is associated with exacerbation outcome. Odd-Ratios (ORs) were evaluated using generalized logistic regression. Multivariate models of Cox Proportional-Hazards analysis was performed to assess the association between the microbiome clusters at randomization and the development of &gt;=2 episodes of YZ after adjustment for age and the presence of pets. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was also performed to view the results from Cox Proportional-Hazards analysis.
