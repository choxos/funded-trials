                <p>Using standard techniques during mechanical thrombectomy, the Blood and Clot
Thrombectomy Registry and Collaboration (BACTRAC) protocol (NCT03153683)
isolates intracranial arterial blood distal to the thrombus and proximal
systemic blood in the carotid artery. We augmented the current protocol to study
leukocyte subpopulations both distal and proximal to the thrombus during human
stroke (n = 16 patients), and from patients with cerebrovascular disease (CVD)
undergoing angiography for unrelated conditions (e.g. carotid artery stenosis;
n = 12 patients). We isolated leukocytes for flow cytometry from small volume
(&lt;1 mL) intracranial blood and systemic blood (5–10 mL) to identify adaptive
and innate leukocyte populations, in addition to platelets and endothelial cells
(ECs). Intracranial blood exhibited significant increases in T cell
representation and decreases in myeloid/macrophage representation compared to
within-patient carotid artery samples. CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and classical
dendritic cells were significantly lower than CVD controls and correlated to
within-patient edema volume and last known normal. This novel protocol
successfully isolates leukocytes from small volume intracranial blood samples of
stroke patients at time of mechanical thrombectomy and can be used to confirm
preclinical results, as well as identify novel targets for immunotherapies.</p>

              <p>Since 2015, mechanical thrombectomy has become the standard treatment for emergent

acute blockages of cerebral vessels and can represent 30–40% of ischemic strokes.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-0271678X211028496" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Randomized clinical trials demonstrate the superiority of mechanical
thrombectomy over fibrinolytic medical management alone, and continue to expand the
inclusion criteria for this treatment. Since mechanical thrombectomy has become a

              <p>Our institution began translationally utilizing thrombectomy as an opportunity to
learn more about acute ischemic stroke pathology. The Blood and Clot Thrombectomy
Registry and Collaboration (BACTRAC) protocol (clinicaltrials.gov NCT03153683) now
represents one of the only prospective, continually enrolling tissue banks of its kind.<sup><xref rid="bibr16-0271678X211028496" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Using the standard techniques entailed in mechanical thrombectomy, BACTRAC
isolates intracranial blood within the artery immediately downstream from the
thrombus, systemic carotid arterial blood proximal to the thrombus, and the thrombus
itself. These samples provide novel insight into the molecular and cellular changes
that occur within the area of infarction. To date, BACTRAC samples identified
within-patient acid-base changes, electrolyte chemistry, and changes in gene and
protein expression in intracranial blood with systemic blood as internal comparative
controls.<sup><xref rid="bibr17-0271678X211028496" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="bibr18-0271678X211028496" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr19-0271678X211028496" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="bibr20-0271678X211028496" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup></p>
              <p>In this study, we set out to investigate how neuroinflammatory responses relate to
these previous findings. We started with the established BACTRAC protocol and
further developed this protocol to isolate leukocytes for flow cytometry. In
addition to leukocyte isolation, this revised protocol allowed for banking of
thrombus and plasma for subsequent histopathological and proteomic analyses. We
developed a flow cytometry panel that identifies B cells, T cells, dendritic cells,
NK cells, macrophages, monocytes, granulocytes, platelets, and endothelial cells.
Based on our preliminary results, standard-of-care interventional techniques at any
institution may be used to collect intracranial blood to facilitate studies
investigating the pathophysiology of acute ischemic neuroinflammatory
mechanisms.</p>

(11.5 ± 6.6 hrs). Intracranial blood is always taken immediately after the
microcatheter is navigated distal to the thrombus and before first pass. Therefore,
the thrombectomy device used does not affect intracranial sampling as the sample is
taken prior to initiation of thrombectomy. Subjects were screened <italic toggle="yes">post
hoc</italic> for medical or pharmacological confounds and relevant
comorbidities. Four patients were excluded from analysis <italic toggle="yes">post hoc</italic>
due to aberrant autofluorescence in samples, and two samples were too small in
volume and cell count for analysis, resulting in sixteen patients included in the
final analysis. Twelve patients undergoing angiography for conditions other than
stroke (i.e. carotid artery stenosis) also consented to provide cerebral arterial
blood samples which were used as the control population (aged 28–76 years). Twelve
healthy volunteer donors ranging from 25 to 63 years (6 male, 8 female) provided
venous blood samples for comparison by antecubital venipuncture.</p>

              <p><italic toggle="yes">Optimization of leukocyte isolation protocol for intracranial blood:</italic>
Our isolation protocols were optimized first using volunteer peripheral venous blood
samples. From their samples, 1 ml of blood was treated as a mock ‘intracranial’
sample of a stroke patient and 9 ml was treated as the systemic sample from a stroke
patient. The viability and yield of 1 mL and 9 mL samples were assessed after
processing to ensure comparable survival and yield per volume.</p>
              <p><italic toggle="yes">Blood collection and cryopreservation:</italic> Workflow of sample collection
and processing can be found in Supplemental Figure 1. Tissue samples are obtained
from the angiography suite at the time of thrombectomy for each subject. Blood
samples are transported at room temperature and then placed on a rocker until
processing. Both intracranial and systemic blood samples were spun down at 515 × g
for 10 minutes at 27°C. One 200 µL aliquot of intracranial blood plasma and eleven
200 µL aliquots of systemic blood plasma are cooled to −80°C at 1°C/min and banked.
The intracranial blood pellet was resuspended to a final volume of 4 mL with PBS,
and the systemic blood pellet was resuspended to a final volume of 20 mL with PBS.
Both samples were then layered over an equal volume of Ficoll and spun at 400 g for
30 minutes at room temperature. After centrifugation, the buffy coats were removed
and samples resuspended in PBS (systemic to 45 mL, intracranial to 14 mL). Tubes
were then spun at 450×g for 10 minutes at 4°C. After centrifugation, samples were
decanted, resuspended in either 0.5 (intracranial) or 5.0 mL (systemic) PBS, and
triturated for counting. The pellet is first resuspended in Cryopreservation Medium
A, and then Cryopreservation Medium B (composition found in Supplemental Table 1) is
added to approximately 20,000 cells/ml when possible. Samples were placed in
cryovials and cooled to -80°C at 1°C/min then transferred to liquid nitrogen for
long-term storage.</p>
              <p><italic toggle="yes">Recovery from Cryopreservation and Flow Cytometry</italic>: Samples were
thawed from cryopreservation media at 37°C for 2 min. Cells were counted using
Nexcelom Cellometer and ViaStain AOPI dye #CS2-0106. Samples were split for separate
panel staining, with at least 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells from healthy volunteer and
systemic blood or 2 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells for intracranial blood aliquoted for the
General Immunophenotyping Panel, and the remainder for the Supplemental Panel.
Antibody staining and preparation was performed as previously described.<sup><xref rid="bibr21-0271678X211028496" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Briefly, cells were washed once in PBS and incubated in Ghost Dye 780 (Tonbo
Biosciences) with PBS on ice in the dark for 30 minutes. Cells were then washed
twice in FACS buffer (PBS, 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.01% sodium azide) and blocked
using human FcR blocking reagent (Mitenyi Biotec #130-059-901) for 5 minutes at room
temperature. Antibodies were added without washing and incubated on ice for
30 minutes in the dark. Cells were washed twice in FACS buffer and fixed in 1%
paraformaldehyde plus 0.1% EDTA on ice for 30 minutes then analyzed on a FACSymphony
(BD Biosciences) the same day. Channel voltages were assigned with volunteer samples
and compensation calculated using UltraComp beads (Invitrogen, # 01-2222-42) and
heat killed (65°C, 1 minute) cells for viability stain. All channels were acquired,
including channels without an assigned dye, to aid compensation; FSC-H was also
acquired to gate on singlet events. Compensation calculation was performed through
FlowJo V10 (TreeStar), treated as spectral with weights for unused channels
optimized. Volunteer and systemic blood sample acquisition included 500,000 events,
while the intracranial blood sample acquisition included 10,000 events. Intracranial
samples with fewer than 10,000 cells were collected in their entirety. Antibody
clones, conjugates, vendors, and dilutions are detailed in Supplemental Table 2.
Importantly, the cryopreservation and recovery processes did not affect antigen
integrity, as there were no reductions in fluorescence intensity after thawing
(Supplemental Figure 2).</p>
              <p><italic toggle="yes">Gating Strategy:</italic> All gating and event analyses were performed in
FlowJo V10 (TreeStar). Two panels were used in the analysis: the larger General

FSC-A<sup>low</sup> events were classified as platelets using SP, and a
generalized FSC-A SSC-A gate defined to exclude these events. This platelet
exclusion gate was then applied to all GIP samples. Doublets were excluded using
FSC-A FSC-H gating, and leukocytes gated by CD45<sup>+</sup> FSC-A. Samples with at
least 2000 events were downsampled using the Downsample plugin, concatenated into a
single file, and reduced to a two dimensional plot using
<italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (tSNE). Manual gates
for lineage markers were defined using histograms and overlaid to the tSNE plot for
confirmation of gating specificity, with additional gating performed if a manual
gate encompassed at least two populations on the tSNE plot or until manual gating
did not refine the populations further. The remaining unidentified populations were
defined by considering their total expression profiles. For the SP, platelets were
defined as described above and the endothelial cell gate defined as CD31<sup>+</sup>
CD45<sup>-</sup>. Distribution profiles (i.e. linear vs. non-linear) were
analyzed to determine normality of distribution for appropriate statistical
analyses. Of the adaptive immune cell populations, CD19<sup>+</sup> B cells failed
to meet normal distribution within both healthy venous blood samples and
intracranial stroke samples, and total T cells failed in the cerebrovascular disease
(CVD) control group. Of the innate subsets, granulocytes in healthy control,
classical dendritic cells in both stroke samples, myeloid-derived dendritic cells
and monocytes in intracranial samples and NK cells failed normality tests.</p>
              <p><italic toggle="yes">Granulocyte staining and quantification:</italic> Sections of 4 µm thickness
were prepared and dried at 58°C for a minimum of 1 hour. Slides were deparaffinized
in 2 changes of xylene, hydrated stepwise through ethanol to water, stained in
Harris’ hematoxylin for 7 minutes followed by a dip in acid ethanol and bluing in
ammonia water. Slides were subsequently stained for 3 minutes in eosin before
dehydrating stepwise, clearing in xylene, and mounting with Cytoseal. Slides were
imaged at 40X, and neutrophils manually counted by a blind observer. Four fields
were counted for each thrombus and averaged.</p>
              <p><italic toggle="yes">Statistical Analyses:</italic> Statistical analyses were performed in
GraphPad Prism 8. All data sets were tested for normal distribution using D'Agostino
&amp; Pearson test. Comparisons of leukocyte populations between systemic and
intracranial blood from patients relied on a paired Student's t test, or a Wilcoxon
matched-pairs ranked sign test in the case of non-normally distributed data.
Populations between stroke patients and CVD controls were compared by one-way ANOVA.
Lymphocyte yield was compared using a two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey post-hoc
correction for multiple comparisons. Endothelial cell populations, platelet
populations, and leukocyte viability before and after cryopreservation were compared
using Residual Maximum Likelihood (REML) linear mixed model with Tukey post-hoc
correction for multiple comparisons. Finally, intracranial and systemic populations
were compared to patient demographics (BMI, NIHSS, time from LKN, infarct volume,
and edema volume) by Spearman non-parametric correlation.</p>

however, significant loss of cell viability after recovery among all groups (95.8%

viability and were not significantly different from each other (<xref rid="fig1-0271678X211028496" ref-type="fig">Figure 1(b)</xref>). Finally, the length of time

major critique of previous work which established the BACTRAC protocol was the
possibility of vessel damage during sample collection, though drawback of blood is
standard-of-care to ensure the stent retriever is introduced past the thrombus. But
to address this critique, we developed a supplemental panel to measure endothelial
cells (CD31), platelets (CD41a), and total leukocytes (CD45) as proportions of live

platelets between control, intracranial, and systemic blood samples

post-stroke neuroinflammation comes from animal models of stroke, with extensive
studies using flow cytometry to identify leukocyte subpopulations in the ischemic
parenchyma. For the first time, our modifications to the existing BACTRAC protocol
provide the opportunity to study changes in local leukocyte subpopulations residing
within the ischemic infarct of patients presenting with ELVO. We found that patients
with ischemic stroke have a significantly increased population of both helper and
cytotoxic T cells, with a concurrent decrease in macrophages within the ischemic
intracranial blood compared to within-patient systemic blood. While we do not know
the full immunophenotype of these T cell populations, it is possible they have a
significant role in stroke recovery as recent studies have shown T cells in general,
and both T regulatory cells (Tregs) and Th1-like Th17 cells, accumulate in
peri-infarct region in patients within days<sup><xref rid="bibr33-0271678X211028496" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> and may be prognostic indicators in stroke and other neurological

              <p>We also cannot confirm to where the innate cells on the ischemic side of the thrombus
move, but out current hypothesis is that these cells diapedese into the ischemic
parenchyma surrounding the collecting vessel, which would support the early work of
Gelderblom and colleagues.<sup><xref rid="bibr26-0271678X211028496" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> This seminal paper demonstrated an acute recruitment of innate cells, but not
lymphocytes, into the ischemic brain following a transient MCA occlusion in mice.<sup><xref rid="bibr26-0271678X211028496" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Obviously the timing of immune cell trafficking may differ from mice, but
methods such as these may eventually be used to understand if the temporal dynamics
of immune cell recruitment are conserved across species. Further, this is a single
snapshot of the immune milieu at the time of thrombectomy; thus, we are currently
unable to differentiate intracranial temporal dynamics. Our results do, however,
identify differential responses in immune population trafficking, as we see shifts
in both innate (decrease of myeloid cells) and adaptive (increase of T cells) immune
cells across the thrombus.</p>
              <p>Our prior work from BACTRAC identified several differences in physiologic parameters,
as well as genomic and proteomic expression, between the ischemic intracranial and
systemic blood. First, we found sex-based differences in pH, pCO<sub>2</sub>, and
K<sup>+</sup> in the intracranial vs. systemic blood.<sup><xref rid="bibr39-0271678X211028496" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> We also identified changes in base deficit and bicarbonate as predictors of
infarct time from LKN, but only in female patients. A separate study used machine
learning to identify predictors of injury based on an RNA array of genes associated
with inflammatory mechanisms and found specific chemokine and cytokine profiles
associated with infarct volume and edema in ELVO patients.<sup><xref rid="bibr40-0271678X211028496" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> Thirteen genes in the intracranial blood were identified by machine learning
as supporting proliferation of immune cells, in particular Th2 and neutrophil
responses. This chemokine/cytokine proliferative response could underlie the
elevation of T cell populations we identified within the intracranial blood. But
based on animal data,<sup><xref rid="bibr26-0271678X211028496" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> we would have expected to see a concomitant decline in neutrophil populations
(similar to macrophages) as innate cells move into the parenchyma, which we did not
find. Significant neutrophil diapedesis could be masked by emergency proliferation,
as can occur in bacterial infections in the periphery.<sup><xref rid="bibr41-0271678X211028496" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> Further, the disproportionately high loss of neutrophil viability in both
blood samples limits our ability to compare these populations. Therefore, future
studies should use proliferation markers, chemokine, and cytokine analyses in
thrombectomy samples to confirm potential immune cell proliferation and
activation.</p>
              <p>While we did not see significant changes in neutrophil populations in the
intracranial blood, a recent study of intracranial blood collected during
thrombectomy found a significant increase in leukocyte counts, driven primarily by
neutrophils as identified by standard staining of blood smears.<sup><xref rid="bibr42-0271678X211028496" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> This discrepancy is likely explained by the short half-life of neutrophils as
our collection, isolation, and cryopreservation protocols take 8–12 hours to
complete. We did, however, observe a significant inverse correlation between the
proportions of neutrophils in the systemic blood to neutrophils in the thrombi.
These data suggest that neutrophils may be either invading or becoming trapped in
the thrombus. An alternative explanation is that neutrophils are involved in
initiating the thrombotic event as has been recently reported in lung thrombi of
COVID-19 patients.<sup><xref rid="bibr43-0271678X211028496" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> Nonetheless, higher neutrophil counts and lower lymphocyte counts defined
patients with poor recovery at 3 months,<sup><xref rid="bibr44-0271678X211028496" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> highlighting the relevance of identifying leukocyte subpopulations in both
the intracranial and systemic blood as potential prognosis of long-term recovery.
While our pan-leukocyte panel is limited by poor granulocyte viability, we note that
there remain striking differences in the disease-state representation of these
cells, a within-patient difference across the thrombus, and significant association
between systemic granulocyte proportion and intra-thrombotic neutrophil counts.</p>
              <p>We also identified a seemingly true population of live CD31<sup>+</sup> endothelial
cells in the intracranial sample of one patient who later converted to a massive
hemorrhagic stroke in the days following thrombectomy. These cells were present only
in the intracranial blood, and presumably live based on viability dye. While live
endothelial cells can be harvested and cultured from the stent retriever in a swine
model of thrombectomy,<sup><xref rid="bibr45-0271678X211028496" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> we collected the intracranial blood prior to stent placement. Circulating
endothelial cells are associated with small vessel vasculitis<sup><xref rid="bibr46-0271678X211028496" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> and may have been an underlying, albeit undiagnosed, condition in this
patient that increased the propensity toward or severity of hemorrhagic transformation.<sup><xref rid="bibr47-0271678X211028496" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup> This would suggest a population already within the circulation and not
secondary to either stent-related vascular injury or from within the clot that may
be used as a biomarker for risk of hemorrhagic transformation.</p>
              <p>In establishing this method, we show that efficient isolation of leukocytes from
intracranial blood using the BACTRAC protocol is feasible though limitations remain.
We processed volumes as low as 50 µL with success. These intracranial samples are
also of comparable viability to systemic blood processed, even with times from LKN
greater than 24 hours. There are, however, significant limitations in the
cryopreservation method used, though all within-patient comparisons remain valid as
paired samples were frozen and thawed alongside each other. Two phenotypic markers,
CXCR3 and CD138, were included in this panel to further identify effector T cells
and antibody secreting B cells but we were not able to separate CXCR3<sup>+</sup>
vs. CXCR3<sup>−</sup> cells clearly and did not identify CD138<sup>+</sup> events.
Further development of this panel using either spectral flow cytometers, additional
markers for immune cell subset quantification, and appropriate dyes or mass
cytometry (i.e. CyTOF) would improve the sensitivity and increase the
immunophenotyping power.</p>
              <p>In summary, this is the first use of flow cytometry in small volume intracranial
arterial blood samples of ELVO patients undergoing mechanical thrombectomy. Further,
this is also the first demonstration of the BACTRAC protocol to collect and analyze
intracranial arterial blood samples from CVD patients undergoing angiography for
non-stroke conditions. This provides an unparalleled comparator with respect to the
arterial blood samples from stroke patients. While a pilot study with a small sample
size, these methods can be used to expand our understanding of acute inflammatory
mechanisms activated within the infarcted brain of patients. This novel approach may
be critical to identifying immunotherapeutic targets that can be delivered either as
