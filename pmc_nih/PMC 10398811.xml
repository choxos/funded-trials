                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Therapeutic options are limited in pediatric CNS malignancies. CheckMate 908 (NCT03130959) is an open-label, sequential-arm, phase 1b/2 study investigating nivolumab (NIVO) and NIVO + ipilimumab (IPI) in pediatric patients with high-grade CNS malignancies.</p>

                <sec id="s2">
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Patients (<italic toggle="yes">N</italic> = 166) in 5 cohorts received NIVO 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks (Q2W) or NIVO 3 mg/kg + IPI 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks (4 doses) followed by NIVO 3 mg/kg Q2W. Primary endpoints included overall survival (OS; newly diagnosed diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma [DIPG]) and progression-free survival (PFS; other recurrent/progressive or relapsed/resistant CNS cohorts). Secondary endpoints included other efficacy metrics and safety. Exploratory endpoints included pharmacokinetics and biomarker analyses.</p>

                <sec id="s3">
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>As of January 13, 2021, median OS (80% CI) was 11.7 (10.3–16.5) and 10.8 (9.1–15.8) months with NIVO and NIVO + IPI, respectively, in newly diagnosed DIPG. Median PFS (80% CI) with NIVO and NIVO + IPI was 1.7 (1.4–2.7) and 1.3 (1.2–1.5) months, respectively, in recurrent/progressive high-grade glioma; 1.4 (1.2–1.4) and 2.8 (1.5–4.5) months in relapsed/resistant medulloblastoma; and 1.4 (1.4–2.6) and 4.6 (1.4–5.4) months in relapsed/resistant ependymoma. In patients with other recurrent/progressive CNS tumors, median PFS (95% CI) was 1.2 (1.1–1.3) and 1.6 (1.3–3.5) months, respectively. Grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse-event rates were 14.1% (NIVO) and 27.2% (NIVO + IPI). NIVO and IPI first-dose trough concentrations were lower in youngest and lowest-weight patients.

              <p>An urgent need exists for novel therapeutics for pediatric patients with CNS malignancies, the most common cause of cancer-related mortality in children. Immune checkpoint inhibitors were evaluated in CheckMate 908. Nivolumab (NIVO) and NIVO + ipilimumab (IPI) did not improve survival in patients with newly diagnosed diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma following upfront irradiation or with other high-grade CNS malignancies (recurrent/progressive high-grade glioma, relapsed/resistant medulloblastoma, relapsed/resistant ependymoma, and other recurrent/progressive CNS tumors), consistent with historical data. The safety profiles of NIVO ± IPI were manageable. Although use of NIVO ± IPI in pediatric CNS malignancies is not currently warranted, further investigation with combination strategies should be considered.</p>

            <p>Primary CNS tumors are heterogeneous and are collectively the most common malignancy in children and the most common cause of cancer-related mortality and morbidity (aged 0–19 years).<sup><xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Patients with CNS tumors (eg, diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma [DIPG], high-grade glioma [HGG]) have poor prognoses at diagnosis;<sup><xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> others (eg, medulloblastoma, ependymoma) have fair prognoses at diagnosis but poor long-term prognoses for recurrent disease.<sup><xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p>
            <p>Immunotherapy represents a promising option in several non-CNS solid tumors in adults. Various immunotherapy agents are under investigation in pediatric brain tumors.<sup><xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Immune cells can enter and function within the tumor microenvironment of CNS malignancies, including pediatric brain tumors.<sup><xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7–9</xref></sup> Lymphocyte infiltration has been found in pediatric glioblastoma (GBM), medulloblastoma, ependymoma, and atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors, with higher lymphocyte numbers in ependymoma tissue vs non-tumor-bearing brain tissue, GBM, and medulloblastoma samples.<sup><xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Microglia may also contribute to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment of various CNS tumors.<sup><xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12–16</xref></sup></p>
            <p>The immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) nivolumab (NIVO) and ipilimumab (IPI) are fully humanized IgG monoclonal antibodies targeting programmed death-1 (PD-1) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein (CLTA-4), respectively, and are approved to treat multiple advanced cancers both as monotherapy and in combination,<sup><xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> including for pediatric patients ≥12 years with unresectable or metastatic melanoma (IPI) and microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair–deficient metastatic colorectal cancer (NIVO ± IPI).<sup><xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup></p>
            <p>Investigation of ICIs in brain tumors has focused on adults with GBM, although none are approved. Ongoing trials of NIVO in adult GBM at the start of this trial included CheckMate 143 and 548 and the recently concluded CheckMate 498. Phase 1 exploratory cohorts of CheckMate 143 reported that NIVO ± IPI was tolerable in adults with recurrent GBM with some antitumor activity signals; however, median overall survival (OS) was consistent with historical controls.<sup><xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> NIVO was also evaluated in adults with newly diagnosed GBM in additional exploratory phase 1 cohorts from CheckMate 143 and in the phase 3 CheckMate 498 and CheckMate 548 trials.<sup><xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19–22</xref></sup> Although no new safety signals were detected with NIVO, primary endpoints of improved survival were not achieved in CheckMate 498 and Checkmate 548.<sup><xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19–22</xref></sup></p>
            <p>Good tolerability of both NIVO and IPI has been reported in pediatric patients with relapsed/refractory non-CNS solid tumors and lymphoma<sup><xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> and recurrent/progressive solid tumors.<sup><xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Clinical activity was observed in pediatric patients with unresectable melanoma treated with IPI, but the trial was terminated due to slow accrual.<sup><xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup></p>
            <p>Here, we report efficacy, safety, biomarker, and pharmacokinetic results from CheckMate 908 (NCT03130959), an open-label, sequential-arm, phase 1b/2 trial of NIVO monotherapy and NIVO + IPI in pediatric patients with high-grade recurrent/progressive or relapsed/resistant CNS malignancies, and newly diagnosed DIPG treated within 6 weeks from completion of upfront radiotherapy (RT).</p>

                <title>Patients</title>
                <p>Patients were enrolled in 5 cohorts. Cohort 1 included patients with newly diagnosed DIPG (including diffuse midline glioma with <italic toggle="yes">H3K27M</italic> mutation) confirmed by MRI or histology who were within 4 weeks from the completion of upfront RT only. Cohort 2 included patients with histologically confirmed recurrent/progressive non-brain stem HGG (including GBM) previously treated with surgical resection and RT (with or without chemotherapy). Cohort 3 included patients with histologically confirmed medulloblastoma with relapse/resistance to ≥1 line of therapy, including surgery, RT, or chemotherapy. Cohort 4 included patients with histologically confirmed ependymoma with relapse/resistance to ≥1 line of therapy including surgical resection and RT. Cohort 5 included patients agreed upon by the clinical team with a diverse array of complex and rare histologically confirmed high-grade CNS malignancies not included in cohorts 1 to 4 that were recurrent/progressive after ≥1 line of therapy (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S1</xref> details individual cases). Patients in cohorts 2 to 5 were required to submit a tumor sample (from surgery following recurrence prior to baseline or from archival tissue). Patients in cohort 1 were not required to submit tumor samples.</p>
                <p>All patients previously received standard-of-care therapy or had no available potentially curative treatment. Patients were aged ≥0.5 to &lt;22 years at enrollment with a Lansky performance score (age ≤16 years) or a Karnofsky performance score (age &gt;16 years) of ≥60 within 2 weeks of enrollment. An interval of ≥12 weeks was required after prior RT termination unless histopathologic confirmation of recurrent tumor or a new enhancement on MRI outside the RT treatment field occurred (cohorts 2–5). A 4-week interval (or 5 half-lives of a targeted therapy with short half-life) was required after last administration of other treatment for CNS malignancies (6 weeks for nitrosoureas). The interval from most recent bevacizumab infusion had to be 5 weeks, and 7 days or 5 half-lives for other biological agents, whichever was longer.</p>
                <p>Patients were requested to taper corticosteroids at a clinically appropriate pace and discontinue use, if possible, prior to study treatment. Eligible patients could receive dexamethasone ≤0.05 mg/kg daily (or equivalent) for tumor-associated intracranial mass effect at study entry. In the absence of active autoimmune disease, patients were permitted inhaled or topical steroids and adrenal replacement steroid doses of &gt;0.25 mg/kg daily prednisone equivalent for concurrent conditions other than brain tumors. Patients who had received high-dose chemotherapy must have been ≥6 months post-autologous hematopoietic cell transplant with a CD4 count of ≥200/mm<sup>3</sup>. Baseline steroid use was recorded within 5 days before first dose for consistency with prior studies; this window was not used to determine eligibility.</p>
                <p>Patients were excluded for prior allogeneic bone marrow transplant; anti-PD-1, anti-programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), anti-PD-L2, anti-CTLA-4, or other antibody or drug specifically targeting T-cell costimulation or checkpoint pathways; receiving any anti-cancer therapy, investigational therapy, or non-palliative RT; low-grade gliomas; tumors of unknown malignant potential; bulky tumors (imaging &gt;6 cm); grade &gt;1 recent CNS hemorrhage (baseline MRI); active, known, or suspected autoimmune disease; or inability to undergo contrast MRI.</p>

                <p>Patients were enrolled into 2 modules (Module A; Module B). Patients in Module A received NIVO 3 mg/kg i.v. Q2W (NIVO3), and patients in Module B received NIVO 3 mg/kg i.v. + IPI 1 mg/kg i.v. once every 3 weeks (IPI1) for 4 doses then NIVO3 Q2W (NIVO3 + IPI1; <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). This study made no direct comparisons between treatments or among cohorts.</p>
                <p>The study included safety lead-in and expansion phases. The safety lead-in population was evaluated for safety and tolerability following 3 doses and ≥6 weeks on study based on a dose-limiting toxicity assessment. Patients in the safety lead-in were included for evaluation of efficacy in the expansion phase. Module A enrolled in parallel for all cohorts. Module B opened by cohort when planned accrual to respective Module A cohort was completed or by decision of the Study Steering Committee.</p>
                <p>Primary endpoints were safety/tolerability in the safety lead-in phase, OS in cohort 1, and progression-free survival (PFS) in cohorts 2 to 5 in the expansion phase. Secondary endpoints included safety/tolerability in the expansion phase; PFS and 12-month OS rate in cohort 1; OS, 6-month PFS rate, and 12-month OS rate in cohorts 2 to 4; and OS and 6-month PFS rate in cohort 5. Exploratory endpoints included pharmacokinetics and biomarkers.</p>

                <title>Assessments</title>
                <p>Disease status (ie, best overall response) was assessed using contrast-enhanced MRI after 6 and 12 weeks (±1 week), then every 8 weeks (±1 week) (×4), then every 12 weeks (±1 week) until progressive disease (PD) according to Radiologic Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO).</p>
                <p>OS was defined as the time between diagnosis date and death or last known alive date (cohort 1) and time from date of first dose and death or last known alive date (cohorts 2–5). The cohort 1 OS definition was selected to discuss results in the context of historical studies that enrolled patients with DIPG prior to RT. Date of first dose to death was determined to be the most robust OS measure for relapsed/refractory disease groups. OS was documented continuously while on study and at 3-month intervals during the survival follow-up beginning at the second follow-up visit (≈100 days after last study treatment dose).</p>
                <p>Across all cohorts, PFS was defined as time from first dose to first documented tumor progression or death (any cause) and determined by investigators using RANO criteria.<sup><xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup></p>
                <p>In cohort 1, suspected PD within ≤12 weeks after RT completion was confirmed per RANO, when potential pseudoprogression is thought to be most prevalent.<sup><xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> PD was assessed by subsequent MRI ≈6 to 8 weeks after initial radiological assessment of progression. PD was confirmed if most of the new enhancement was outside the radiation field (beyond the high-dose region or 80% isodose line) or if pathological evidence of PD existed. To differentiate between pseudoprogression and confirmed PD, pseudoprogression was defined as absence of clinical progression and clear worsening of lesions in the first follow-up ≥3 months after the date of reported PD (including death from study disease). Patients who initially met radiologic criteria for disease progression but were tolerating NIVO ± IPI were permitted to continue until progression was confirmed. Imaging was not transmitted for centralized review.</p>
                <p>Adverse events (AEs) were assessed continually per National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4. A serious AE was defined as any treatment-emergent event that resulted in death, was life-threatening, required inpatient hospitalization or resulted in prolonged existing hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, was a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or was deemed an important medical event.</p>

                <p>Tumor PD-L1 expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissue obtained before first study dose (fresh or archival). PD-L1 expression was defined as the percentage of tumor cells with membrane staining in ≥100 evaluable tumor cells per validated Dako PD-L1 immunohistochemistry assay (Mosaic Laboratories; MOS785-APD). Analyses for tumor PD-L1 were based on baseline PD-L1-positive status (1% and 5% cutoffs).

                <p>Overall, 204 patients were enrolled, and 166 patients were treated (NIVO3, <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 85; NIVO3 + IPI1, <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 81) at 51 sites across 15 countries. Baseline characteristics were balanced between modules and were representative of the diseases studied (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Median ages in the NIVO3 and NIVO3 + IPI1 groups were 10.0 (range, 1–21) and 11.0 (range, 1–21) years, respectively. Among treated patients with baseline PD-L1 positivity, tumor PD-L1 expression was ≥1% in 33.9% (NIVO3) and 26.3% (NIVO3 + IPI1). Eighty percent and 87.7% of patients treated with NIVO3 and NIVO3 + IPI1, respectively, had no baseline corticosteroid use. Among patients treated with NIVO3 with baseline corticosteroid use (presented in dexamethasone equivalent doses) within 5 days of first treatment dose, 14 (16.5%) received ≤0.04 mg/kg/day, 2 (2.4%) received &gt;0.04 to 0.05 mg/kg/day, and 1 (1.2%) received &gt;0.05 mg/kg/day. In the NIVO3 + IPI1 group, corticosteroids were used by 5 (6.2%) patients at ≤0.04 mg/kg/day, 2 (2.5%) patients at &gt;0.04 to 0.05 mg/kg/day, and 3 (3.7%) patients at &gt;0.05 mg/kg/day.

                <p>CheckMate 908 evaluated primary endpoints of safety and efficacy, including OS with NIVO ± IPI in pediatric patients with newly diagnosed DIPG (cohort 1) and PFS with NIVO ± IPI in pediatric patients with high-grade recurrent/relapsed CNS malignancies (cohorts 2–5). Although no potentially meaningful clinical OS or PFS benefit was observed, NIVO3 and NIVO3 + IPI1 were well tolerated with no new or unexpected treatment-related safety signals.</p>
                <p>Despite NIVO and IPI showing efficacy in other cancer types,<sup><xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> and enhanced survival with the addition of neoadjuvant anti-PD-1 prior to salvage surgery followed by continued adjuvant therapy in adult patients with recurrent GBM,<sup><xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> no survival benefit was observed in pediatric patients with high-grade relapsed/resistant CNS malignancies or newly diagnosed DIPG. As this study was not designed for comparisons between modules or across cohorts, OS (cohort 1, primary endpoint; cohorts 2–5, secondary endpoint) and PFS (cohort 1, secondary endpoint; cohorts 2–5, primary endpoint) were interpreted relative to historical benchmarks. Previous studies reported median OS as 9.6 months<sup><xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> in newly diagnosed DIPG, and median PFS as 2.25 months<sup><xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> and 2.1 months<sup><xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> in recurrent/progressive pediatric HGG and relapsed/resistant ependymoma, respectively. A 4-month PFS rate of 18% was reported in relapsed/resistant medulloblastoma.<sup><xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> Primary endpoint findings of a median OS of 11.7 months (NIVO3)/10.8 months (NIVO3 + IPI1) in newly diagnosed DIPG, median PFS of 1.7 months (NIVO3)/1.3 months (NIVO3 + IPI1) in recurrent/progressive HGG, and 1.4 months (NIVO3)/4.6 months (NIVO3 + IPI1) in relapsed/resistant ependymoma suggest that NIVO ± IPI did not improve outcomes over historical data. In relapsed/resistant medulloblastoma, clinical benefit was not observed with NIVO3 (4-month PFS rate, 0%); despite small sample size and lack of statistical power, a potential survival trend was observed with NIVO3 + IPI1 (4-month PFS rate, 40%). No comparisons to historical controls could be made for the cohort of patients with other rare high-grade CNS tumors. Results align with prior reports in pediatric recurrent/refractory non-CNS solid tumors demonstrating a lack of NIVO single-agent activity in a phase 1/2 study.<sup><xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup></p>
                <p>Although increased sensitivity to anti-PD-1 therapy may result from enhanced PD-L1 expression, as suggested in supratentorial <italic toggle="yes">RELA</italic> fusion ependymoma,<sup><xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> exploratory analyses demonstrated that baseline tumor PD-L1 expression ≥1% or ≥5% was not associated with improved PFS or OS, although small subgroup sizes preclude a firm conclusion. ICIs have generally been less effective in pediatric patients, in part due to infrequent detectable PD-L1 expression in pediatric tumors,<sup><xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> which tend to have fewer infiltrating T cells and low TMB.<sup><xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> Indeed, the KEYNOTE-051 phase 1/2 trial investigated the anti-PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab in PD-L1-positive pediatric patients with relapsed/refractory lymphoma or solid tumors.<sup><xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> Low antitumor activity was reported in most tumor types.<sup><xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> Current findings corroborate these reports. Taken together, PD-L1 appears insufficient as a standalone marker to predict treatment response in most pediatric patients and tumor types.<sup><xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> In the future, tailoring combination therapies through targeted approaches may improve treatment response. For example, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or other drugs that convert pediatric tumors from immune-cold to immune-hot could be used to improve immunotherapeutic effectiveness. Novel biomarkers may identify patients who respond optimally to immunotherapy. Biological samples and data from the current study can help inform future research to assess the probability of success with targeted interventions.</p>
                <p>Despite overall negative results, 1 partial response was observed in a patient with relapsed/resistant ependymoma with MSI-H, consistent with the previously reported unconfirmed partial response in a patient with relapsed/refractory ependymoma treated with NIVO combined with metronomic cyclophosphamide.<sup><xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> Additionally, 1 patient with HGG had high TMB (based on 199 mutations/Mb cutoff<sup><xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>) and an OS of 11 months. Prior studies of PD-1 inhibitors suggest TMB as an important factor for efficacy in various tumors, including mismatch repair deficiency recurrent GBMs<sup><xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">42–45</xref></sup>. Furthermore, higher MSI has been reported in pediatric vs adult gliomas.<sup><xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> Although promising, a separate cohort for this patient population was not included in this study.</p>
                <p>Additional exploration of baseline characteristics that may be associated with OS revealed 4 patients with predisposing cancer conditions, including a constitutional mismatch repair deficiency mutation and a prior history of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia in 1 patient with recurrent/progressive HGG (cohort 2; OS 41.7 months, PFS, 40.8 months), Lynch syndrome in 1 patient with recurrent/progressive HGG (cohort 2; OS 8.5 months, PFS 1.3 months), and Li-Fraumeni syndrome in 2 patients with recurrent/progressive choroid plexus carcinoma (cohort 5; OS 36.2 months and PFS 34.5 months; OS 8.0 months and PFS 1.2 months). Notably, the cohort 2 patient with a prior history of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and constitutional mismatch repair deficiency mutation had high PD-L1 expression (&gt;40%) and was in complete remission with continued NIVO at the censored date. Taken together, these exploratory analyses provide novel insights for future trials. Expanding the definition of clinically meaningful outcomes is an important consideration in the context of high-grade and recurrent/progressive pediatric tumors. For example, improving tumor characterization could result in immunotherapy extending survival or progression-free intervals or improving quality of life despite a lack of response per RANO criteria.</p>
                <p>Safety profiles of NIVO ± IPI were manageable and consistent with previous reports in adults.<sup><xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Most TRAEs were mild and few serious TRAEs were observed. Additionally, low rates of discontinuation due to study drug toxicity were observed. While no new or unexpected treatment-related safety signals or toxicities specific to a given disease cohort were identified, TRAEs, serious TRAEs, and TRAEs leading to discontinuation appeared more frequent with NIVO3 + IPI1, as expected. One patient in the other high-grade CNS tumors cohort 5 (atypical meningioma, WHO grade 2) treated with NIVO3 + IPI1 met the criteria for a dose-limiting toxicity (grade 3 pancreatitis and grade 2 colitis in the same patient).</p>
                <p>Medulloblastoma has been subject to significant molecular analyses. The WHO classification subdivides medulloblastoma into 4 distinct subtypes: wingless/WNT; sonic hedgehog/SHH, which may be further subdivided by <italic toggle="yes">P53</italic> wild-type or mutant status; group 3 (group C); and group 4 (group D).<sup><xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> Several reviews describe the increasing number of medulloblastoma subgroups and their implications for diagnosis and treatment.<sup><xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">47–49</xref></sup> Current results confirmed similar prevalence of the 4 subgroups and revealed 5 of 19 (26%) medulloblastoma cases without any subtype-specific genetic variances.</p>
                <p>Pharmacokinetic analyses indicated that NIVO and IPI trough concentrations after first dose appeared lower in younger and lower-weight patient groups. This was consistent with the known relationship of less-than-proportional increase in NIVO and IPI clearance with body weight. Lower NIVO and IPI exposures observed in the youngest patients were likely attributable to the associated lower body weight. Of note, NIVO and IPI exposures were largely similar between adolescents (12 to &lt;18 years) and young adults (18 to &lt;21 years).</p>
                <p>This study’s limitations included that imaging and neuropathology data were not reviewed centrally, and immunotherapy (iRANO) criteria were not considered since they were not standardized at the time of the study. Given the aggressive nature of DIPG, relapsed status of other cohorts, and low incidence of confirmed pseudoprogression in this study population, these factors likely did not impact overall outcomes. Additional limitations include those associated with interpretations relative to historical data (eg, small sample sizes in single-arm studies, low precision in estimated treatment effects with small sample sizes in this study), as no meaningful conclusions could be drawn based on external benchmarks. Furthermore, after study and analysis completion, 4 patients from cohort 1 were identified as having baseline corticosteroid use &gt;0.05 mg/kg/day at study entry. Upon further investigation, it was determined that the study site(s) may not have entered the correct dose for 2 patients treated with NIVO3 + IPI1. This occurred after database lock; therefore, they were retained in the current analysis. Remaining patients (NIVO3, <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 1; NIVO3 + IPI1, <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 1) were confirmed eligible based on internal system reporting.</p>
                <p>CheckMate 908 evaluated primary and secondary endpoints including safety and efficacy associated with NIVO ± IPI in pediatric patients with high-grade primary CNS malignancies. Overall outcomes did not demonstrate clinically meaningful improvements relative to historical data. Safety profiles of NIVO ± IPI were manageable in each pediatric population evaluated. Efficacy results do not currently warrant further investigation of NIVO ± IPI in pediatric CNS malignancies. Nonetheless, these results do not signify the end of prospects for immunotherapy in pediatric neuro-oncology. Rather, the low response rate to PD-1- and CLTA-4-targeted treatments together with low TMB and immunologically “cold” tumor profiles provide insight for developing novel hypotheses unique to CNS malignancies to use in future trials. Acknowledging the obstacles to establishing appropriate translational preclinical models for CNS-specific malignancies, an urgent need remains for continued collaboration between preclinical researchers and clinicians to build on the rationale for immunotherapeutic combinations, including ICI approaches, for pediatric CNS malignancies. Such efforts will enhance the discovery and understanding of novel targets and combinational strategies with ICIs for tumors with appropriate immune, genetic, or mutational profiles, with the ultimate goal of improving patient outcomes.<sup><xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup></p>
