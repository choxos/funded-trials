                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Short bowel syndrome (SBS) is a leading cause of intestinal failure resulting in parenteral nutrition (PN) dependence and nutritional deficiencies. Long-term PN use is associated with the development of sepsis and intestinal failure-associated liver disease. Achieving enteral autonomy is the optimal way to prevent these complications. In SBS, the decreased intestinal length, bile acid deficiency, and rapid transit time contribute to fat malabsorption and continued PN dependence. We propose the use of an immobilized lipase cartridge (ILC; RELiZORB) that connects in-line with enteral feed tubing sets and is designed to breakdown the majority of fats provided in enteral nutrition (EN). Preclinical studies have demonstrated both improved fat and fat-soluble vitamin absorption with ILC use in a porcine model of SBS. To evaluate the clinical applicability of these findings, we designed a phase 3, open labeled, single center, clinical trial to determine the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of the RELiZORB enzyme cartridge when used daily with EN for 90 days.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>The patient population will include PN dependent children with SBS, aged 2–18 years. The primary outcome is the change in PN calories from baseline, assessed weekly throughout the study. Changes in growth Z-scores, 72-hour fecal fat and coefficient of fat absorption, plasma fatty acids and fat-soluble vitamins will also be evaluated. Assessment of change in continuous outcomes will be made using the area under the curve, expressed as a percent change relative to baseline, calculated over study day 7 to 90 (AUC<sub>7-90</sub>). The incidence of adverse events will be monitored and summarized by system organ class.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p>If successful, RELiZORB may offer a safe alternative to reducing PN dependence and achieving enteral autonomy in pediatric intestinal failure. These results would be clinically significant given the clear association between long-term PN use and complications in SBS.</p>

                <title>Background</title>
                <p>Short bowel syndrome (SBS) is a leading cause of intestinal failure (IF) worldwide, affecting both children and adults [<xref rid="pone.0282248.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0282248.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In children, the most common causes include necrotizing enterocolitis, intestinal atresia, and segmental volvulus [<xref rid="pone.0282248.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Regardless of the exact etiology, SBS-IF is characterized by the functional or anatomical loss of extensive segments of intestine. This ultimately compromises the digestive and absorptive processes that are necessary to support growth and development. As a result, patients frequently require extended periods of parenteral nutrition (PN) and enteral nutrition (EN) for their survival.</p>
                <p>Long-term PN use is associated with numerous life-limiting complications. PN delivery requires indwelling central venous catheters (CVCs), which can lead to central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) and sepsis. It is estimated that among patients with CVCs for PN use, there are approximately 1.6–8.9 CLABSI episodes per 1000 catheter-days [<xref rid="pone.0282248.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0282248.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0282248.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. PN-dependent SBS patients are also at risk for intestinal failure-associated liver disease (IFALD). The incidence of IFALD in children may be as high as 50% and is directly proportional to the duration of PN [<xref rid="pone.0282248.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Importantly, IFALD may ultimately progress to liver fibrosis and cirrhosis in a subset of patients on prolonged PN contributing to mortality [<xref rid="pone.0282248.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p>
                <p>The primary goal in the management of SBS is to advance enteral feeds and reduce PN dependence while maintaining a stable growth trajectory and nutritional status [<xref rid="pone.0282248.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Teduglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) analogue, is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of SBS based on studies in children and adults demonstrating efficacy in reducing parenteral support and intravenous fluid requirements [<xref rid="pone.0282248.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0282248.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Use of this medication is not without side effects, and as teduglutide enhances mucosal proliferation, regular endoscopy is necessary to screen for adenomatous polyps and malignancy. Furthermore, even after complete weaning of PN and achieving enteral autonomy, SBS patients remain at risk for micronutrient and fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies, requiring frequent biochemical monitoring [<xref rid="pone.0282248.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Novel therapeutic strategies are thus needed to address these issues and improve patient outcomes.</p>
                <p>Major limiting factors in achieving enteral autonomy and reducing PN dependence include fat malabsorption and associated nutritional deficiencies [<xref rid="pone.0282248.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Numerous biochemical reactions are required for fat absorption to occur including bile salt emulsification, pancreatic lipase-mediated triglyceride breakdown, and micelle formation. In SBS, several factors such as decreased intestinal length, relative bile acid deficiency, and increased transit time impact efficient fat absorption [<xref rid="pone.0282248.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. We hypothesized that by using an external lipase device to pre-digest fats, nutritional absorption would improve, thereby contributing to reduced PN dependence in patients with SBS. RELiZORB (Alcresta Therapeutics, Newton, MA) is a commercially available FDA-cleared immobilized lipase cartridge which connects in-line with existing enteral feeding sets and is designed to mimic the function of pancreatic lipase. As EN passes through the device, lipase enzymes which are covalently bound to microbeads, hydrolyze triglyceride fats to deliver readily absorbable fatty acids and monoglycerides [<xref rid="pone.0282248.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p>
                <p>We have recently shown in a large animal model that the use of an immobilized lipase cartridge improved both fat and fat-soluble vitamin absorption [<xref rid="pone.0282248.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. To evaluate if these findings translate clinically, we propose to conduct a phase 3, open labeled study of RELiZORB in pediatric patients with SBS who are dependent on PN. If successful, RELiZORB could be considered an important supplemental therapeutic to improve clinical outcomes and achieve enteral autonomy in pediatric intestinal failure.</p>

                <title>Objectives</title>
                <p>This protocol complies with the SPIRIT reporting guidelines (<xref rid="pone.0282248.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>). The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of the RELiZORB enzyme cartridge when used with EN daily for 90 days on the change from baseline in PN calories. The secondary objective is to evaluate the effect of RELiZORB on the change from baseline in body weight using weight adjusted for age Z-scores. Measurements will be assessed at baseline and on study days 7, 14, 28, 60, 90 for in-clinic assessments, and weekly for at-home assessments in pediatric subjects with SBS, aged 2 years– 18 years, who are dependent on PN.</p>
                <p>Safety objectives for the study include the incidence of grade 2 or higher adverse events (AEs), abnormal vital signs, and abnormalities in hematology and biochemistry parameters based on in-clinical laboratory evaluations. Several exploratory objectives will also be examined including: change (from baseline) in the coefficient of fat absorption (CFA) measured through 72-hour stool collection, plasma and stool fatty acid composition, PN volume, total enteral calories/volume, and total oral calories/volume. In addition to weight measurements, growth over the study period will be assessed through height, head circumference (in children &lt;36 months of age), and BMI measurements.</p>

                  <title>Trial design, setting, and explanation for choice of comparators</title>
                  <p>The study is a phase 3 open label, pre- and post-, single center clinical trial in pediatric subjects with SBS, aged 2–18 years who have been dependent on PN for at least six months. Treatment will be the use of the RELiZORB enzyme cartridge with the administration of EN daily for a total of 90 days. This study will be open label; all patients receive the study treatment. Allocation will be known by the subjects, Principal Investigator and their medical staff. Participants will be enrolled and followed at Boston Children’s Hospital.</p>
                  <p>Based on the study design, each subject will be compared to themselves utilizing pre-treatment baseline measurements; effectively each patient serves as their own control. This type of study design is beneficial in rare diseases, such as pediatric SBS, characterized by extensive heterogeneity between patients [<xref rid="pone.0282248.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Given this approach and to reduce bias, patients need to demonstrate stability on key outcomes prior to enrollment, including PN dependence and EN requirements, as outlined below.</p>

                  <title>Interventions</title>
                  <p>Subjects are initially evaluated in a screening visit (Day -3) during which they will be screened for eligibility, including baseline clinical and physical assessments (<xref rid="pone.0282248.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). At screening, the investigator or designee will review the subject’s medical history to determine eligibility, explain the study to the subject and the subject’s parent or legal guardian, and if eligible, obtain informed consent (<xref rid="pone.0282248.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 File</xref>). Informed consent and assent will be obtained from study investigators and authorized personnel and the discussion will be documented in the patient’s electronic medical record. If consent is given and the subject is deemed eligible based on the results of the screening visit, they will be enrolled in the study and pre-baseline assessments will be performed, which will include physical examination, nutritional assessment, vital signs, and laboratory evaluations (<xref rid="pone.0282248.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). The subject’s parent or guardian will also receive education from a registered dietitian on recording caloric intake and composition in oral and enteral feeds, and PN. As part of this education, the dietitian will review how to record daily oral and enteral intake via paper dairy or with a HIPAA-compliant nutrition/food tracking phone application. If the latter, the subject’s parent or guardian will receive access to a nutrition/food tracking phone application.</p>

Record known bowel length/type from last surgical resection or other measurement. b. Blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate and temperature. c. Includes height or length, head circumference (for subjects &lt; 36 months), and weight. If a physical examination or nutrition assessment was performed during the 3-day screening period, it will be used for the baseline assessment when available. d. Includes chemistry (including fat-soluble Vitamins A, D, E, and K), hematology, coagulation and C-reactive protein (CRP). Clinical laboratory evaluations obtained at time of screening will serve as the baseline assessment. e. 72-hour fecal collection will occur in the 72 hours preceding treatment day 1 and the final clinic visit day 90. f. Samples of the lipid profile will include cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Results of samples obtained at time of screening will be analyzed during enrollment period, prior to participant receiving device. g. Samples of total plasma fatty acids will include total saturated, total monosaturated, total polyunsaturated, total Omega-3, total Omega 6, total fatty acids, a-linolenic Acid, linoleic acid, oleic acid, EPA, arachidonic acid, mead acid, DHA, and triene:tetraene ratio. h. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and serum gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT). i. 24-hour nutritional intake/composition (PO and enteral dietary intake and PN volume) will be recorded using a phone-based application or paper diary. This will be especially important during the 72-hour stool collection periods for calculation of the coefficient of fat absorption. j. Adverse events will be recorded daily in an electronic or paper format by the subject’s parent or guardian, and by study staff during clinic visits. Monitoring of these events will also occur through a daily phone call from a study coordinator. If any AEs or concerns are noted by the family, the study coordinator will alert the study team by email. PI or other delegated investigators will determine next steps.</p>

                  <p>Treatment will be administered on study Day 1, followed by daily use of the RELiZORB enzyme cartridge whenever EN is administered, for a total of 90 days. During the treatment period, all EN will be administered through the RELiZORB enzyme cartridge. Nutritional intake (24-hour enteral dietary and PN volume intake), stool consistency/amount/frequency (if applicable) or ostomy (if applicable) output, study device use, and incidence of symptom changes will be recorded daily, in an electronic or paper diary, by the subject’s parent or guardian. Access to the nutrition/food tracking phone application along with a daily phone call from a study coordinator will be used to ensure accurate recording and completion of these tasks.</p>
                  <p>Subjects will return to the clinic on Days 7, 14, 28, 60, and 90 of the treatment period (<xref rid="pone.0282248.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). The final clinic visit will be preceded by a repeat 72-hour stool collection and measurement of CFA to determine the change (if any) in intestinal fat absorption. During the clinic visits, staff will review the information in the subject’s diary, review compliance with the use of the study device and discuss relevant observations with the subject during the visit. Upon review, information contained in the diary will be entered in the electronic database. In addition to a daily study coordinator phone call, the study staff will have weekly telephone contact with families during interim weeks after the day 14 visit. Prior to these visits, subjects will be weighed at home by their parent or guardian using a standardized weight scale. At the in-person clinic and weekly telephone visits, study staff will monitor safety, diaries, weight data, stool composition (Bristol scale) and output, changes in caloric intake, changes in urine output, and will make adjustments to PN and enteral feeding accordingly (<xref rid="pone.0282248.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). Adjustments will be based on the subject’s nutritional needs, weekly weights, height, hydration status and investigator’s medical judgement. If necessary, unscheduled visits can be arranged in place of the telephone contacts.</p>

                  <p>Precision-based power calculations were determined using nQuery Advisor 7.0 (GraphPad Software DBA Statistical Solutions, San Diego, CA). The primary outcome is the change in PN calories from baseline, assessed weekly at 13 assessments (study days 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70, 77, 84, and 90) using a baseline-adjusted time-weighted average (AUC<sub>7-90</sub>). In adults receiving teduglutide intended to improve enteral absorption in PN dependent patients with intestinal failure, an aim of 20% reduction was used to assess efficacy [<xref rid="pone.0282248.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. When adapted for a pediatric intestinal failure population, a ≥10% reduction was considered a valid pharmacodynamics (PD) marker of increased intestinal absorptive capacity. Based on the design of the teduglutide studies it was felt that the data provide similar support for a ≥10% reduction at Day 90 as a predictor of pharmacodynamic effect with the use of the RELiZORB device.</p>
                  <p>A reliable estimate for the standard deviation (SD) of AUC<sub>7-90</sub> for the primary outcome in this patient population is unavailable. Unpublished data for seven patients are available, but at least four of these would not meet the eligibility criteria for this study (ages 1–10; one had a STEP procedure; three have pancreatic involvement). Nevertheless, the mean ± SD reduction (AUC<sub>7-90</sub>) for these seven patients was 0.81±0.14, representing a 19% decrease over 90 days. Using this SD with a sample size of n = 32, a 20% observed reduction in outcome would provide a 95% confidence interval (CI) = (0.75, 0.85), ruling out a true mean population reduction smaller than 15%. Conservatively, if the SD was doubled (SD = 0.28), the 95% CI = (0.7, 0.9), excluding a true mean population reduction smaller than 10%, our target threshold. In general, for any continuous outcome, a sample size of n = 32 with two-side alpha = 0.05 will provide 80% power to detect an effect size (mean/SD) as small as 0.51, considered a medium-sized effect [<xref rid="pone.0282248.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p>

                  <p>Historical review of patients followed by the CAIR program suggests that an average of eight patients per year can be expected to meet the eligibility criteria, for a total of 32 subjects over four years. Patients who follow with the CAIR program will be screened for initial eligibility. Subjects who meet the eligibility criteria will then be approached during their regular short bowel clinic visits which typically occur every two months. If interested, the study coordinators will then schedule the initial screening and enrollment study visits. All study subjects will receive all of their care through CAIR so retention is expected to be high with minimal loss to follow up.</p>

Sensitivity of the area under the curve to unknown data will be investigated using a best- and worse-case scenario method, as detailed in the study protocol (<xref rid="pone.0282248.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 File</xref>).</p>

                  <p>The DSMB will be a board comprised of three clinicians who are subject experts, and one biostatistician not participating in this study–all independent of the study investigators and sponsors. One of the clinicians will be appointed as chairman of the DSMB. The DSMB is responsible for safeguarding the interests of study participants, assessing the safety and efficacy of study procedures, and for monitoring the overall conduct of the study. The first meeting will occur prior to the first participant’s enrollment. The DSMB will then convene once the first participant has enrolled into the study, followed by every six months to review limited cohort safety data with additional meetings scheduled as needed. Specific details about the DSMB composition, responsibilities, organization and meeting frequency can be found in the DSMB Charter (<xref rid="pone.0282248.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 File</xref>).</p>
                  <p>No interim analysis or early stopping rules are planned given the sample size and protocol design. However, the DSMB will have the right to recommend stopping the trial early if safety concerns arise. Additionally, an independent site monitor will perform periodic visits to review consent, eligibility and unanticipated adverse device effects (UADEs) for all enrolled subjects, as well as device accountability documents.</p>

                  <p>This study will be monitored through an independent monitoring program at our institution. This monitoring program follows established auditing procedures as outlined in the FDA Guidelines for the Monitoring of Clinical Investigations, as well as the International Council for Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) Good Clinical Practices. After enrollment of the first subject, an in-person monitoring visit will occur every three months for the duration of the study. During these visits, patient records specifically related to consent, eligibility, device accountability, and unanticipated adverse device effects will be reviewed for accuracy and completeness. Based on these reviews, reports will document the findings, if any, and any actions that need to be taken to correct any issues. The study team will be responsible for reviewing each report and ensuring that the proper follow-up actions occur as deemed necessary. A final monitoring visit will occur at the end of the study to ensure that all study-related documentation is present and complete.</p>

                <p>Substantive changes in the protocol include changes that affect the safety of subjects or changes that alter the scope of the investigation, the scientific quality of the study, the experimental design, dosages, assessment variable(s), the number of subjects treated, or the subject-selection criteria. Such changes will be prepared as a protocol amendment. A protocol amendment must receive IRB approval before implementation. In parallel with the IRB approval process, the protocol amendment will be submitted to the appropriate regulatory authority as an amendment to the regulatory submission under which the study is being conducted. If a protocol amendment requires changes in the informed consent form, the revised informed consent form prepared by the investigator must also be approved by the IRB before implementation.</p>
                <p>Departures from the protocol are allowed only in situations that eliminate an immediate risk to a subject and that are deemed crucial for the safety and well-being of that subject. The investigator or the attending physician also will contact the IRB as soon as possible in the case of such a departure. These departures do not require preapproval by the IRB; however, the IRB must be notified in writing as soon as possible after the departure has been made. In addition, the investigator will document in the subject’s CRF the reasons for the protocol deviation and the ensuing events.</p>

                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p>This study is designed as an open-label, pre- and post-, single center clinical trial where each subject serves as their own control in comparison to an established baseline. Prior to enrollment, subjects need to demonstrate stability on their EN and PN regimens with no significant changes within one month of screening. Due to the rarity of SBS, two parallel arms (e.g., as in a randomized control trial) are not feasible in the design of this single-center study. In general, the small participant numbers, often seen in rare diseases, make conventional parallel-arm studies prone to bias because of chance imbalance between groups [<xref rid="pone.0282248.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0282248.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. An important consideration specific to SBS is also the extensive heterogeneity of the patient population [<xref rid="pone.0282248.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], which further limits a two-arm approach given the potential for additional confounding. We considered use of a crossover study design, but this was also deemed not feasible given the potential for disease-modifying treatment to occur with bowel adaptation while receiving the RELiZORB cartridge, which would preclude a ‘wash-out’ period, and the ethical concern of removing a potential disease-modifying therapy that may reduce highly morbid complications such as IFALD and CLABSIs through reduction of parenteral nutrition requirement.</p>
                <p>An important limitation of our protocol is the small sample size which may limit the power to detect changes in several of the study’s outcomes. The <italic toggle="yes">a priori</italic> power calculation was based upon detection of a clinically relevant decrease (10%) in PN requirements from baseline, but the sample size may be underpowered for the exploratory outcomes. Furthermore, the open label study design can be a limitation due to the potential for bias in the study outcomes. To minimize and safeguard against this, we have incorporated a previously validated advancement protocol (<xref rid="pone.0282248.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>) that will be strictly followed, per protocol design. In addition, all decisions regarding PN/EN changes will be made by the primary treating gastroenterologist and dietitian at the CAIR program, independent of study investigators.</p>
