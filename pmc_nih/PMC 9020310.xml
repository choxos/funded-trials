                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>This protocol describes a study testing the efficacy of interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) for major depressive disorder following perinatal loss (early and late fetal death and early neonatal death). Perinatal loss is associated with elevated risk of major depressive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Perinatal loss conveys specific treatment needs. The trial will be the first fully powered randomised trial of treatment for any psychiatric disorder following perinatal loss.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>A sample of 274 women in Flint and Detroit areas in Michigan who experience a major depressive episode following a perinatal loss will be randomised to group IPT for perinatal loss or to group coping with depression. We anticipate that 50% of the sample will have co-occurring PTSD. Assessments occur at baseline, mid-treatment (8 weeks), post-treatment (16 weeks) and follow-up (28 weeks). Clinical outcomes include time to recovery from major depressive episode (primary), depressive symptoms, PTSD symptoms and time to recovery from PTSD. Additional outcomes include social support, social role functioning (including parental functioning for those with living children), well-being, grief (including complicated grief and fault beliefs) and fear of subsequent pregnancies. Social support and grief are hypothesised mediators of IPT effects on time to recovery from major depressive episode.</p>

                  <title>Ethics and dissemination</title>
                  <p>The trial was approved by Michigan State University’s Biomedical Institutional Review Board. It has a data and safety monitoring board and has been submitted to the community-based organisation partners community ethics review board. Written operating procedures outline methods for protecting confidentiality, monitoring and recording adverse events, and safeguarding participants. We will share study results with research and clinical communities, community organisations through which we recruited, and will offer results to study participants. Deidentified datasets will be available through the National Institute of Mental Health Data Archive and to qualified investigators on request.</p>

              <p>About 650 000 women in the USA experience perinatal loss each year (including early and late fetal death and the death of a liveborn neonate within the first 28 days).<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> Rates of major depressive disorder (MDD) after perinatal loss are higher than after giving birth to a living infant, and are three times the rates among matched samples of community women.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3–20</xref> Rates of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after perinatal loss are up to seven times the rates of PTSD among mothers of living infants,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> and elevated PTSD symptoms can occur for years after the loss.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Fetal or neonatal death triples rates of suicide and of hospitalisation for suicide attempts.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22 23</xref></p>
              <p>Not only do women with perinatal loss have higher rates of MDD and PTSD than mothers of living infants, their needs also differ from needs following many other kinds of bereavement. In perinatal loss, the fact of bereavement is compounded by the physical experience of miscarriage or of delivering a baby that has already died.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Many women experiencing perinatal loss grieve in secret, as others may not know about the loss. Even if others do know, there are few social norms that guide how others can or should support the bereaved, making support less likely and often less helpful (eg, ‘you can just have another one’).<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12 25</xref> Reasons for loss are often unclear and many women blame themselves.</p>
              <p>Despite recognition that MDD (with or without co-occurring PTSD) following perinatal loss causes impairment and that treatment as usual is often inadequate,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26–30</xref> our previous pilot work<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> created and tested the first manual for treating any psychiatric disorder after perinatal loss. The manual is structured and applies interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) principles to MDD following perinatal loss in a group format. Previous IPT and other treatment manuals for perinatal depression<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32–35</xref> focus on helping women adjust their relationships, identity, roles and routines to the demands of a new baby. This is inappropriate in the context of perinatal loss. Our manual applies IPT social support and communication principles to issues such as resolving conflicts over how to respond to the loss, grieving and requesting support in the absence of social norms about how to do so, and resolving questions of fault and role competence. It can be used by providers who do not know IPT. A randomised pilot trial of women experiencing MDD following perinatal loss established acceptability of proposed study procedures and identified high rates of co-occurring PTSD (54%) among study participants.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Results favoured the new IPT manual for PTSD recovery, treatment satisfaction, depressive symptoms, grief and social support relative to coping with depression (CWD), a cognitive-behavioural-based intervention that does not focus on perinatal loss, interpersonal issues or social support.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></p>
              <p>Based on those promising results, this study will be the first fully powered randomised trial of treatment for any psychiatric disorder following perinatal loss. We will compare our group IPT manual to a general group depression treatment (CWD) in a sample of 274 women experiencing MDD in the context of perinatal loss. The trial will test the hypotheses that:</p>

                  <p>IPT for perinatal loss will result in reduced time to recovery from MDD (primary), depressive symptoms and PTSD symptoms, relative to CWD. Among women meeting criteria for PTSD, IPT will result in reduced time to recovery from PTSD relative to CWD.</p>

                <list-item>
                  <p>IPT for perinatal loss will result in increased social support, social role functioning (including parental functioning for women with living children) and well-being, and decreased grief and fear of subsequent pregnancies, relative to CWD.</p>

                  <p>Social support and grief will mediate the effects of IPT on time to MDD recovery.</p>

              <p>This trial will provide an evidence base for treating a vulnerable and understudied population whose distress has historically been minimised.

                <title>Rationale for design</title>
                <p>Given that no other treatment exists for women who experience perinatal-loss related MDD that could be used as a comparator condition, we chose to use a general depression treatment, the CWD course, as a control condition. We chose CWD because it is the group treatment with the most empirical support for treating MDD<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51 52</xref> and because it is distinct from IPT. IPT addresses MDD through emotional exploration, work on relationships, communication, grief and social support. CWD addresses MDD by changing thinking and behaviour; it focuses on skills for reducing depression in general and does not have perinatal-loss specific components. Our IPT treatment differs from CWD in its focus on exploring reactions to the loss, addressing loss-related interpersonal challenges and improving loss-related social support and grief-specific coping. The trial’s secondary outcomes (social support, social functioning, grief) assess hypothesised differences between treatments. As desired, our pilot study found differences between conditions in the hypothesised mechanisms of social support and grief and in terms of in-session activities.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></p>

Consistent with standard CWD, we focused on addressing depression rather than discussing grief or perinatal loss. We expanded other CWD material (eg, relaxation practice) to replace sessions on social skills. In our studies, the 12 CWD sessions covered: an introduction to social learning rationale of depression; learning to relax; relaxation in everyday situations; pleasant activities and depression; formulating a pleasant activities plan; constructive thinking; planning for constructive thinking; and maintaining gains (see published manual<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref> and pilot trial<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> for additional details).</p>

Exclusion criteria are: (1) onset of current major depressive episode prior to news of difficulties with the pregnancy or health risk to the infant (women with prior episodes are included); (2) current or past diagnosis of bipolar disorder, schizophrenia or other psychotic disorder; (3) primary diagnosis of current substance use disorder; (4) acute suicidal or homicidal risk; (5) beginning or changing dose of antidepressant medication or psychotherapy in the previous 12 weeks) and (6) any IPT or cognitive-behavioural treatment in the previous 12 weeks. Women in stable concurrent psychotherapy who are included are asked to suspend this treatment during the active study treatment phase. PTSD is not an inclusion criterion.

                  <p>The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref> is used to establish study eligibility. During the follow-up, the Longitudinal Interval Follow-up Examination (LIFE),<xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60 61</xref> a standardised retrospective calendar-based interview, is used to assess MDD and PTSD recovery. The LIFE uses Psychiatric Status Ratings to categorise DSM-5 symptoms on a scale of 1 (asymptomatic) to 6 (incapacitated) for each week. A PSR of 5 or 6 indicates the participant meets full diagnostic criteria, 3 or 4 indicates subthreshold disorder, and 1 or 2 indicates the participant is not in episode. For survival analyses, recovery is defined as eight consecutive weeks of a PSR of 1–2<xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref> at any time between baseline and the 28-week follow-up. Women who do not have at least eight consecutive weeks of PSR of 1–2 during this time are considered ‘not recovered’. The LIFE is the gold-standard way of determining onset and offset of psychiatric disorder.<xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref> We also use the LIFE to track participation in psychotherapeutic and psychopharmacologic treatment at baseline and follow-up.

Given that many women present with unwarranted beliefs about what caused the loss, we assess deservingness and guilt as grief outcomes using a 7-item scale about loss beliefs (the Loss Beliefs Scale). This scale includes items such as ‘I think what happened was my fault’ and ‘The miscarriage, stillbirth, or baby’s death was caused by something about me’. This perinatal loss specific scale was created after reviewing the literature on beliefs about deserved bad outcomes.<xref rid="R75" ref-type="bibr">75–77</xref></p>

                  <title>Recovery outcomes</title>
                  <p>For the primary outcome of time to MDD recovery (censored at 28 weeks), assuming 1:1 allocation, power 0.80, two-sided tests at p=0.05, and observed estimated HR=1.79, the required number of events is 94 (number of MDEs resolved). By week 28, there were 17 events in the preliminary data (17 women had MDD resolved, 11 in the IPT condition and 6 in the CWD condition) out of 45 participants, so the rate of events was 0.38. Thus to have 94 events, total N=246 is required. Given that 90% of pilot trial participants completed at least one follow-up assessment,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> we increased the sample size to 274. Given the observed HR of 5.85 for PTSD in the pilot trial, power for PTSD recovery should be greater than 80%. Tests of mediation in aim 3 will have greater power than the primary outcome because of reduction in error variance when controlling for the mediator.</p>

                <p>Confidentiality is protected by research staff trained to manage sensitive clinical issues. Participants are informed about the limits of confidentiality concerning suicidal intent, homicidal intent and suspected child or elder abuse. Computer files are available only to authorised personnel, with no names or obvious identifying information stored in data files. Confidentiality of recordings of study assessments and treatment sessions is protected through: (1) use of encrypted audiorecorders and HIPAA-compliant videoconferencing; (2) labelling recordings with study IDs rather than names; (3) storing recordings on a secured computer server designed to hold and protect research data and (4) limiting access to recordings.</p>
