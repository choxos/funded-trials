                <p id="Par1">TAK-653 is a novel Î±-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR)-positive allosteric modulator being developed as a potential therapeutic for major depressive disorder (MDD). Currently, there are no translational biomarkers that evaluate physiological responses to the activation of glutamatergic brain circuits available. Here, we tested whether noninvasive neurostimulation, specifically single-pulse or paired-pulse motor cortex transcranial magnetic stimulation (spTMS and ppTMS, respectively), coupled with measures of evoked motor response captures the pharmacodynamic effects of TAK-653 in rats and healthy humans. In the rat study, five escalating TAK-653 doses (0.1â€“50â€‰mg/kg) or vehicle were administered to 31 adult male rats, while measures of cortical excitability were obtained by spTMS coupled with mechanomyography. Twenty additional rats were used to measure brain and plasma TAK-653 concentrations. The human study was conducted in 24 healthy volunteers (23 males, 1 female) to assess the impact on cortical excitability of 0.5 and 6â€‰mg TAK-653 compared with placebo, measured by spTMS and ppTMS coupled with electromyography in a double-blind crossover design. Plasma TAK-653 levels were also measured. TAK-653 increased both the mechanomyographic response to spTMS in rats and the amplitude of motor-evoked potentials in humans at doses yielding similar plasma concentrations. TAK-653 did not affect resting motor threshold or paired-pulse responses in humans. This is the first report of a translational functional biomarker for AMPA receptor potentiation and indicates that TMS may be a useful translational platform to assess the pharmacodynamic profile of glutamate receptor modulators.</p>

Furthermore, depressive disorders are associated with an increased risk of mortality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Pharmacological treatments targeting monoaminergic neurotransmission are available, but these fail to achieve an adequate response in up to 50% of MDD patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. This illustrates the need for the development of novel pharmacological therapeutics for the treatment of MDD.</p>
              <p id="Par3">In 2000 it was demonstrated that subanesthetic doses of ketamine, an <italic>N</italic>-methyl-D-aspartate-receptor (NMDAR) antagonist, had antidepressant effects in patients with depression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Since then, many studies have replicated these findings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Although the mechanisms by which ketamine exerts its antidepressant effects are not yet fully understood, it has been demonstrated that NMDAR blockade leads to a selective reduction in Î³-aminobutyric acid (GABA) interneuron function that enhances glutamate function and increases Î±-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR)-mediated signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. This leads to a release of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and stimulation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, which are both hypothesized to play a role in the pathophysiology of depressive disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. The importance of AMPA receptors for the antidepressant effects of ketamine was further demonstrated by the finding that pretreatment with an AMPA antagonist completely blocked the antidepressant effects of ketamine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. It is therefore hypothesized that direct AMPA receptor potentiation might lead to similar antidepressant efficacy as ketamine, without causing the psychotomimetic side effects commonly observed after ketamine administration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par4">TAK-653, also known as NBI-1065845, is a central nervous system (CNS)-penetrant, selective AMPA receptor-positive allosteric modulator that is being developed as a potential adjunctive therapeutic agent for patients with MDD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. It is intended to enhance or reproduce ketamine-driven AMPAR potentiation. In cognitive and depression-related behavioral assays, TAK-653 exhibited antidepressant-like effects at low exposures in rodents (Haruride Kimura, Takeda Pharmaceuticals, 2019, unpublished data), but evidence of immediate pharmacodynamic (PD) effects that could be translated to human studies was missing. A first-in-human dose-escalating study in healthy volunteers established the safety and tolerability of TAK-653, but there was no established methodology to assess CNS-target engagement or PD effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. To continue TAK-653 development with confidence, we needed a neurocircuit-based translational PD biomarker that captures the modulation of glutamatergic synapses.</p>
              <p id="Par5">The paucity of reliable translational biomarkers that capture functional modulation of brain circuitry is a key challenge in the field of neuropsychiatric drug development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. With the exception of evoked potentials sensitive to <italic>N</italic>-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor function, such as mismatch negativity and auditory steady-state responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, there has been little progress toward translatable glutamate-sensitive circuitry function biomarkers. Reliable PD biomarkers are needed to evaluate the functional impact of novel glutamatergic drugs on defined neurocircuits in order to guide dose selection in clinical studies and to support go/no-go decisions during drug development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par6">Here, we explored whether transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) could be applied to produce a translational neurocircuitry biomarker for the development of a novel glutamatergic compound. TMS is a noninvasive neurostimulation method based on the principles of electromagnetic induction, in which a fluctuating magnetic field generates a localized intracranial electric current that can be sufficient to depolarize cortical neurons and activate neuronal circuits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. When delivered over the motor cortex, TMS leads to reliable limb muscle activation that can be quantified by surface electromyography (EMG) in humans or by accelerometer-based mechanomyography (MMG) in rats. Motor cortex TMS thus enables measures of inputâ€“output relationships between the strength of the cortical electrical stimulus and the magnitude of muscle activation. Using various stimulation paradigms that include single or paired pulses (spTMS and ppTMS, respectively), cortical signals involving glutamate or GABA signaling can be isolated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. The motor responses to TMS have been well characterized and used to demonstrate that such evoked responses are sensitive to pharmacological manipulation of CNS targets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. We therefore utilized TMS to assess corticospinal and intracortical excitability, allowing determination of a functional outcome of AMPA receptor activation.</p>
              <p id="Par7">The overall aim of our study was to evaluate TMS-evoked motor responses as potential translational neurocircuitry biomarkers for AMPA receptor modulation by TAK-653. To obtain measures of cortical excitability, we coupled TMS with MMG in rats and EMG in humans. We hypothesized that TMS-evoked motor responses would be amplified by positive allosteric modulation of AMPA receptors by TAK-653. As there was no precedent of TMS use to test the effects of agents that increase glutamate function, we included an open-label ketamine period intended to establish assay sensitivity, based on a report of ketamine effects on TMS in a small sample of healthy volunteers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>; however, a subsequent report did not show the same effect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Given these mixed results of ketamine on TMS, we did not intend to compare the ketamine results with placebo or TAK-653, so ketamine pharmacokinetic (PK) and TMS results are not be included in this report. The primary goal of the study was to assess neurostimulation with TMS as a translational biomarker for the modulation of excitatory neural circuits.</p>

Because of the oral dosing required for TAK-653, no baseline TMS values were obtained.

              <p id="Par28">TMS-evoked motor responses were enhanced by TAK-653 in both rats and humans at similar plasma concentrations. In rats, we observed no effect with a dose of 0.1â€‰mg/kg and an increase in MMG amplitude with doses of 0.3â€‰mg/kg or higher, corresponding to 5.32â€‰ng/ml or higher in plasma. TAK-653 was detected in the brains after the procedures, indicating the compound crossed the bloodâ€“brain barrier. In healthy humans, a single dose of TAK-653 6â€‰mg, corresponding to a mean plasma level of 45.99â€‰ng/ml at expected <italic>t</italic><sub>max</sub>, significantly increased MEP amplitude from baseline compared to placebo. TAK-653 0.5â€‰mg, corresponding to a mean plasma level of 4.19â€‰ng/ml at expected <italic>t</italic><sub>max</sub>, did not elicit an effect on MEP amplitude. There was no change in rMT with either dose of TAK-653. In addition, the only ppTMS assay that revealed a difference in TAK-653 from placebo in humans was with LICI at ISI 300â€‰ms, but the difference was with the low dose that did not induce changes in spTMS.</p>
              <p id="Par29">These results indicate that noninvasive brain stimulation can be used to generate translational neurocircuitry biomarkers that capture subtle modulation of glutamate synaptic activity. TMS of the primary motor cortex is likely activating a cortical column and its projection to the spinal cord motoneurons that drive the response in the activated muscle. As neuromuscular junction synapses utilize acetylcholine as their neurotransmitter and TAK-653 has demonstrated in vitro selectivity for AMPA receptors, the change in MEP by TAK-653 should be driven by CNS effects. Further in support of a glutamate receptor-mediated effect, only evoked responses elicited by spTMS rather than the ppTMS metrics that capture modulation of cortical inhibition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> were altered by TAK-653. Thus, our data reveal that TAK-653 modulates corticospinal excitability in a healthy brain and indicate that neurostimulation approaches, such as TMS, can be applied as biomarkers to capture modulation of glutamate synaptic activity. Our ppTMS studies should be interpreted with caution, however. In order to minimize the duration of the procedure in the human study and driven by technical limitations in the rat study, we chose to test SICI and LICI, excluding intracortical facilitation (ICF). SICI and LICI are thought to capture intracortical inhibitory processes and ICF is related to glutamate activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, therefore we chose to focus ppTMS on inhibition-related measures.</p>
              <p id="Par30">The effect of TAK-653 on corticospinal excitability assessed with MEPs supports the use of neurostimulation as a biomarker but does not necessarily mean that this compound will restore circuitry function in depression. The motor cortex is neither anatomically nor functionally involved in the regulation of emotional behavior in humans. However, a large body of data implicates the frontal-striatal circuitry that includes the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DL-PFC), subgenual anterior cingulate cortex, amygdala, and ventral striatum in mood disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Furthermore, impaired functional connectivity of the DL-PFC with emotion-related circuits has been identified in MDD patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, and EEG signals evoked by DL-PFC TMS differ in MDD patients from controls<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. In line with these observations, devices for repeated TMS of the DL-PFC have been approved and a range of TMS protocols are rapidly expanding as therapeutic options for treatment-resistant depression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Thus, DL-PFC TMS, perhaps coupled with EEG to record TMS-evoked regional potentials, can be used to assess the effect of ketamine, TAK-653 or any novel glutamate-based antidepressant on disease-related circuitry dysfunction in MDD patients.</p>
              <p id="Par31">The study was performed with great caution as both TMS and AMPA receptor potentiation might theoretically increase the risk of seizures by potentiating glutamatergic synapses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. We did not observe any evidence of seizures or convulsions and there were no dose-related AEs and no serious AEs. TAK-653 was generally well tolerated by the participants, supporting further development of TAK-653.</p>
              <p id="Par32">Some caveats with our study are worth addressing. We tried to reproduce stimulation parameters and data collection as much as possible in rats and humans. However, in order to minimize stress and movement artifacts while allowing reliable muscle response in rats, we aimed for light anesthesia combined with a noninvasive method to record muscle responses. Thus, TMS-MMG was employed given it is a reliable surrogate for TMS-EMG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Baseline TMS-MMG could not be obtained in rats because of the need of oral dosing 2â€‰h prior to the measures of interest. Therefore, the comparisons were made between TAK-653 and vehicle, and any difference in baseline responses could not be identified. TAK-653 increased MMG amplitude, and any effect of the anesthetic was controlled by inclusion of vehicle-treated animals. Another potential concern is the high variability of human TMSâ€“EMG data; however, this variability was within the expected range. The fact that a significant difference from placebo was observed with our higher dose despite such variability reinforces the conclusion that TAK-653 increased circuitry excitability. In addition, we used baseline rMT to guide stimulation intensity for all measurements. Because adjusting the TMS intensity to compensate for post-drug changes in rMT can change the outcome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>, and because the rat TMS study used the same stimulation intensity in all treatment groups, we chose not to adjust the TMS strength. We did not observe changes in rMT with treatment, so it is unlikely that any adjustment would have revealed a different outcome. Lastly, we omitted testing ICF to minimize patient burden. This decision resulted in not having a pTMS paradigm related to intracortical glutamate function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> and MEP data being the only direct assessment of excitatory neurotransmission.</p>
              <p id="Par33">In conclusion, our data represent an important step forward because they provide evidence of a noninvasive, translational modulation of physiological outcomes of a glutamate-based neural circuit in a healthy brain. Methodologies such as quantitative EEG or magnetic resonance spectroscopy could be considered to measure subtle AMPA receptor modulation in humans, but they miss the detection of functional outcomes of brain circuit activation. Our data show that TMS-evoked motor responses can detect discrete changes in cortical excitability in a defined neural circuit, enabling pharmacological assessments of glutamatergic CNS activity in early drug development. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a circuitry biomarker sensitive to direct positive modulation of AMPA receptors being modulated in a similar manner in rodents and humans.</p>
