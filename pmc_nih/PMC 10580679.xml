Overall, 78.8% met three-parameter “no evidence of disease activity” criteria through 4 years. Switching from teriflunomide led to reduced ARR, risk of confirmed disability worsening (CDW), new/enlarging T2 lesions, Gd+ T1 lesions, and serum neurofilament light chain. In the continuous and newly switched ofatumumab groups, cumulative 3- and 6-month CDW rates remained low. In the safety set (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 1969), the most frequently reported adverse events were infections and infestations (58.35%). No new safety signals were identified.</p>

              <p>Ofatumumab is a fully human, anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (mAb) approved for relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS) in many countries.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-13524585231195346" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bibr2-13524585231195346" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> The approved regimen with three weekly and then monthly (Q4W) subcutaneous (s.c.) ofatumumab 20 mg produces a rapid, sustained B-cell depletion, with minimal repletion between doses.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-13524585231195346" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Ofatumumab approval was based on the ASCLEPIOS I (NCT02792218) and ASCLEPIOS II (NCT02792231) Phase 3 studies, which demonstrated superior efficacy versus teriflunomide and a favorable benefit–risk profile up to 2.5 years.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-13524585231195346" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bibr5-13524585231195346" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Ofatumumab achieved the primary endpoint, a reduction in annualized relapse rate (ARR); 51% in ASCLEPIOS I and 58% in ASCLEPIOS II (both <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.001), and demonstrated greater efficacy versus teriflunomide for most secondary clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) outcomes.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-13524585231195346" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p>
              <p>To further assess the benefit–risk profile of ofatumumab in RMS and its longer-term tolerability, patients from ofatumumab studies (ASCLEPIOS I/II,<sup><xref rid="bibr4-13524585231195346" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> APLIOS,<sup><xref rid="bibr6-13524585231195346" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> and APOLITOS)<sup><xref rid="bibr7-13524585231195346" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> transitioned to ALITHIOS (NCT03650114), a Phase 3b, open-label, extension, where they continued with ofatumumab or switched from placebo/teriflunomide to ofatumumab. After 3.5 years of follow-up in ALITHIOS, ofatumumab was well tolerated with no new safety signals; rates of adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs (SAEs) were consistent with previous findings.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-13524585231195346" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Emerging data indicate that early initiation of high-efficacy therapies for RMS improves longer-term outcomes compared with delayed initiation of, or escalation from lower efficacy therapies.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-13524585231195346" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="bibr10-13524585231195346" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="bibr11-13524585231195346" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> A subgroup analysis of recently diagnosed, treatment-naïve patients in ASCLEPIOS I/II concluded that ofatumumab has a favorable benefit–risk profile versus teriflunomide,<sup><xref rid="bibr12-13524585231195346" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> supporting first-line use of ofatumumab in these patients.</p>

                    <p>*The “newly switched ofatumumab group” comprised patients randomized to teriflunomide in ASCLEPIOS I/II (those who completed treatment were eligible to enter ALITHIOS and be switched to ofatumumab); the “continuous ofatumumab group” comprised patients randomized to ofatumumab in ASCLEPIOS I/II (those who completed treatment were eligible to enter ALITHIOS). All patients who completed study treatment in the core period were eligible to enter ALITHIOS but could withdraw prior to treatment. The efficacy analysis set comprised all patients randomized to ofatumumab or teriflunomide in ASCLEPIOS I/II, regardless of whether they completed/discontinued study treatment. The safety analysis set comprised patients who received ≥1 dose of ofatumumab in ASCLEPIOS I/II, APLIOS, APOLITOS, or ALITHIOS. Percentages based on the number of randomized patients. The open-label extension period was defined as following the first dose of ofatumumab in ALITHIOS (below the dashed line); the core period is prior to the open-label extension (above the dashed line).

                  <p>To explore the influence of rapid suppression of inflammatory activity on MRI with ofatumumab, NEDA-3 status in the first year of treatment was determined (see <xref rid="fig5-13524585231195346" ref-type="fig">Figure 5(b)</xref>). In the core period, the likelihood of maintaining NEDA-3 during the first year was approximately three-fold higher with ofatumumab versus teriflunomide (47.9 versus 25.1% OR 3.38 (95% CI: 2.70–4.23) <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.001), and 10-fold higher beyond that time (84.2 versus 36.9%; OR 9.98 (95% CI: 7.76–12.84), <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.001; see <xref rid="fig5-13524585231195346" ref-type="fig">Figure 5(b)</xref>).

Subsequently, NEDA-3 increased to 86.4% in the newly switched ofatumumab group and became comparable to the proportion in the continuous ofatumumab group (90.4%; OR 1.55 (95% CI: 1.07–2.22); <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.019).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>This interim analysis provides new insights into the longer-term efficacy and safety of ofatumumab in RMS, supporting a favorable benefit–risk profile. The low rate of relapses with ofatumumab, as identified in ASCLEPIOS I/II,<sup><xref rid="bibr4-13524585231195346" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> was further reduced in the extension period, and together with the almost complete suppression of MRI lesions and low risk of CDW, demonstrate the sustained efficacy of ofatumumab for up to 4 years.</p>
              <p>Early initiation of high-efficacy treatment for RMS improves longer-term outcomes compared with delayed initiation or switching from lower efficacy therapies.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-13524585231195346" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="bibr10-13524585231195346" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="bibr11-13524585231195346" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> This comparison of continuous ofatumumab versus switching to ofatumumab from teriflunomide demonstrated the cumulative benefit (up to 4 years) of early ofatumumab initiation with regard to cumulative number of relapses, and number of Gd+ T1/neT2 lesions. Moreover, the odds of maintaining NEDA-3 during the extension period were three times greater with early initiation. After the first year in the core period, a very high proportion (84.2%) of the continuous ofatumumab group retained NEDA-3 status; this beneficial effect continued throughout the extension period, supporting the sustained efficacy of ofatumumab. In contrast, only 36.9% of patients randomized to teriflunomide retained NEDA-3 status after a year. Although between-group differences for all components of NEDA-3 favored continuous ofatumumab, the greatest differences were for neT2 and Gd+ T1 lesions. Thus, patients initially randomized to teriflunomide were at higher risk of not maintaining NEDA-3 in the first year of treatment mainly due to MRI disease activity. The legacy of lower efficacy teriflunomide appeared to negatively affect the likelihood of maintaining NEDA-3 during the first year of open-label ofatumumab treatment, but with longer treatment, the odds of maintaining NEDA-3 increased to 9/10 patients and remained high for up to 4 years.</p>
              <p>The 3mCDW and 6mCDW rates at 36 and 48 months, and the cumulative number of events, indicate that early ofatumumab treatment leads to superior disability outcomes that cannot be recovered in patients initially randomized to teriflunomide. These findings are consistent with recent studies of the longer-term benefits of early initiation of high-efficacy DMTs and disability outcomes in MS.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-13524585231195346" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="bibr10-13524585231195346" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="bibr11-13524585231195346" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p>
              <p>The results also illustrate the value of switching from a low efficacy therapy to ofatumumab. In the newly switched ofatumumab group, there was a marked reduction in the ARR, together with almost complete suppression of Gd+ T1 lesion activity, a pronounced reduction of neT2 lesions, sustained reduction of neuroaxonal injury (sNfL), and increased likelihood of maintaining NEDA-3 status.</p>
              <p>Treatment with biological drugs may trigger an immune response that leads to the formation of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs).<sup><xref rid="bibr14-13524585231195346" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> The development of high titers of neutralizing ADAs may lead to suboptimal treatment exposure and thereby might limit efficacy.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-13524585231195346" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> However, it has been previously reported that very few patients receiving ofatumumab in ASCLEPIOS I/II developed ADAs (0.2%), with no treatment enhancing or neutralizing ADAs reported (0%).<sup><xref rid="bibr1-13524585231195346" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bibr15-13524585231195346" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup></p>
              <p>The cumulative safety data indicate that extended ofatumumab treatment is well tolerated in patients with RMS, with no new risks identified. Ofatumumab tolerability was reflected by a high level of adherence and a low rate of discontinuation throughout the core and extension periods. The EAIRs of AEs and SAEs were consistent with those previously reported in ASCLEPIOS I/II.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-13524585231195346" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> During extended exposure, the incidence of malignancies remained low, and both serious infections (EAIRs) and IgG levels remained stable. Although IgM levels declined, average IgM levels remained above the LLN. Neither low IgG nor low IgM were associated with increased incidence of serious infection. IgG levels fell below the LLN in only 1.6% of patients, and in most cases, did not lead to treatment interruption/discontinuation. Additional sensitivity analyses confirmed that treatment interruption/discontinuation due to low IgG/IgM did not impact overall Ig trends confirming the robustness of IgG stabilization. With longer-term use of ofatumumab, lymphocyte and neutrophil levels remained stable and above the LLN. The incidence of lymphopenia and neutropenia were comparable with previous studies and remained low, with no serious events reported.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-13524585231195346" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bibr6-13524585231195346" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bibr7-13524585231195346" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Overall, safety was in line with a previous interim analysis with up to 3.5 years of treatment.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-13524585231195346" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup></p>
              <p>The analyses of longer-term efficacy data presented here for the open-label ALITHIOS extension study (including data from the start of the blinded ASCLEPIOS I/II studies) are subject to the limitations of any open-label study, including lack of a comparator arm beyond the core studies. As such, the conclusions related to longer-term clinical efficacy outcomes may be limited due to the potential influence of regression to the mean. Also, as blinding is not maintained during an open-label extension study, the risk of rater assessment bias may increase.</p>
              <p>In addition, upon completion of the core studies, participation in ALITHIOS was voluntary and patients were free to discontinue due to any reason, creating the potential for selection bias. This seems unlikely, however, as an equal proportion of patients from the ASCLEPIOS I/II teriflunomide (72.3%) and ofatumumab (72.9%) arms enrolled into ALITHIOS; 88.8% of whom were still receiving ofatumumab at data cut-off. Furthermore, in ALITHIOS, the rate of discontinuations was identical for both the ofatumumab and teriflunomide arms (11.2%) and reasons for discontinuation were similar (for example, discontinuations due to AEs: 4.2% vs 3.8%, respectively; patient/guardian decision: 3.6% vs 4.3%, respectively), with low rates of discontinuations due to lack of efficacy (0.6% vs 0.9%, respectively; see <ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/13524585231195346" ext-link-type="uri">Supplementary Table 1</ext-link>). Thus, there was no evidence for an impact of selection bias on these data.</p>
              <p>The ongoing ALITHIOS study coincided with the global outbreak of COVID-19.

              <p>Our findings of sustained reductions in cumulative number of relapses, MRI lesion activity, and risk of CDW with ofatumumab treatment add to a growing body of evidence that supports the value of early initiation of high-efficacy therapies in RMS,<sup><xref rid="bibr4-13524585231195346" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bibr10-13524585231195346" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> and highlight the favorable benefit–risk profile of long-term (up to 4 years) ofatumumab treatment for patients with RMS.
