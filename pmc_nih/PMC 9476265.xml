                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Farmworkers are at risk of heat-related illness (HRI). We sought to: 1) evaluate the effectiveness of farmworker Spanish/English participatory heat education and a supervisor decision-support mobile application (HEAT intervention) on physiological heat strain; and 2) describe factors associated with HRI symptoms reporting.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">We conducted a parallel, comparison group intervention study from May–September of 2019 in Central/Eastern Washington State, USA. We used convenience sampling to recruit adult outdoor farmworkers and allocated participating crews to intervention (<italic>n</italic> = 37 participants) and alternative-training comparison (<italic>n</italic> = 38 participants) groups. We measured heat strain monthly using heart rate and estimated core body temperature to compute the maximum work-shift physiological strain index (PSI<sub>max</sub>) and assessed self-reported HRI symptoms using a weekly survey. Multivariable linear mixed effects models were used to assess associations of the HEAT intervention with PSI<sub>max</sub>, and bivariate mixed models were used to describe factors associated with HRI symptoms reported (0, 1, 2+ symptoms), with random effects for workers.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">We observed larger decreases in PSI<sub>max</sub> in the intervention versus comparison group for higher work exertion levels (categorized as low, low/medium-low, and high effort), after adjustment for maximum work-shift ambient Heat Index (HI<sub>max</sub>), but this was not statistically significant (interaction − 0.91 for high versus low/medium-low effort, t = − 1.60, <italic>p</italic> = 0.11). We observed a higher PSI<sub>max</sub> with high versus low/medium-low effort (main effect 1.96, t = 3.81, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) and a lower PSI<sub>max</sub> with older age (− 0.03, t = − 2.95, <italic>p</italic> = 0.004), after covariate adjustment. There was no clear relationship between PSI<sub>max</sub> and the number of HRI symptoms reported. Reporting more symptoms was associated with older age, higher HI<sub>max</sub>, 10+ years agricultural work, not being an H-2A guest worker, and walking &gt; 3 min to get to the toilet at work.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p id="Par4">Effort level should be addressed in heat management plans, for example through work/rest cycles, rotation, and pacing, in addition to education and other factors that influence heat stress. Both symptoms and indicators of physiological heat strain should be monitored, if possible, during periods of high heat stress to increase the sensitivity of early HRI detection and prevention. Structural barriers to HRI prevention must also be addressed.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par24">Heat exposure is associated with substantial occupational mortality and morbidity, including from heat-related illness (HRI), traumatic injuries, and acute kidney injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In 2015, exposure to heat caused 2830 occupational injuries and illnesses resulting in days away from work and 37 work-related deaths in the United States (US), 89% of which occurred during the summer months (June–September) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Agricultural workers have high rates of HRI and heat-related deaths. From 2000 to 2010, agricultural workers had more than 35 times the risk of heat-related death compared to other industry sectors, with a yearly average fatality rate of 3.1 per 1 million workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In the agriculturally intensive State of Washington (WA), there were a total of 918 workers’ compensation HRI claims during 2006–2017, with the agriculture, forestry, fishing, and hunting sector having the second highest third quarter (July–September) rate (102.6 claims per 100,000 full-time employees [FTE]) and the highest annual HRI claims rate (13.0 per 100,000 FTE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. HRIs are likely more prevalent than data indicate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], as less severe injuries and illnesses may be self-treated and not reported to supervisors, and agricultural workers may prioritize work over taking time off for treatment and recuperation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The risk of HRI is unlikely to diminish in the future, as the frequency and intensity of heat events is projected to increase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par25">Field evaluations of the effectiveness of interventions to reduce farmworker HRI risk are needed to support prioritization of the most promising approaches. Though there is growing evidence that farmworker education that is participatory, culturally and linguistically appropriate, and tailored to agriculture is effective in improving heat knowledge and behavioral intentions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], few studies have investigated the effectiveness of these interventions on objective measures of heat strain. Pilot evaluations of the effectiveness of different cooling strategies and hydration on core body temperature and kidney function among agricultural workers have been performed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].

A mobile application that provides users with information about predicted heat stress based on environmental conditions, activity level, clothing, and acclimatization has also been developed and evaluated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Interventions that include an emphasis on water, rest, and shade at work have shown promise, including in preventing adverse heat health effects among sugarcane workers in Central America [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. California, WA, and Oregon are the only three US states that have developed emergency or permanent occupational heat rules intended to prevent outdoor HRI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. However, research in California suggests an increased risk of HRI even when farms follow California/Occupational Safety Administration heat regulations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], suggesting that the way in which rules and practices are implemented and the effectiveness of specific provisions needs further evaluation. Risk factors for adverse heat health effects exist at multiple levels (e.g., individual, co-worker, employer, community, and policy levels), yet few studies have developed interventions using a multi-level framework tailored to agricultural settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par26">Heat stress is defined within the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) Threshold Limit Value (TLV)® as the net heat load to which a worker may be exposed from the combined contributions of metabolic heat (e.g., from physical work), environmental factors, and clothing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Heat strain refers to the overall physiological response to heat stress aimed at dissipating excess heat from the body, and the TLV aims to maintain the core body temperature within 1 °C of normal (37 °C) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. HRIs include heat rash, heat exhaustion, heat syncope (fainting), and heat stroke, which is associated with an elevated core body temperature (&gt; 40 °C, 104 °F) and can be fatal. Different HRIs manifest clinically with different groups of symptoms. Though occupational health guidelines and rules incorporate recognition and reporting of HRI symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], HRI symptoms may be non-specific (e.g., headache, fatigue), there is little consensus on how best to categorize HRI symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] or how reporting of symptoms relates to physiological heat strain, and different factors may affect reporting of HRI symptoms. Physiological monitoring of heat strain does not rely on self-report and captures individual responses to heat load, which depend on several factors, including personal factors (e.g., age, sex, fitness level, acclimatization status, health conditions, medications, hydration level), environmental conditions, workload, and clothing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par27">Agricultural workers are integral to the US food supply, and there are opportunities to improve agricultural worker safety and health. In this study, our primary objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of a multi-level HRI prevention approach that addresses individual, community, and employer level factors through worker education and a supervisor decision support mobile application among agricultural workers in WA. We hypothesize that this multi-level Heat Education and Awareness Tools (HEAT) intervention can improve HRI awareness and prevention practices and therefore reduce physiological heat strain among agricultural workers. Our secondary objective was to describe the relationship between objectively measured physiological heat strain and self-reported symptoms and to describe factors associated with HRI symptoms reporting.</p>

The study took place in 2019 in agriculturally intensive areas of Central/Eastern WA, where tree fruit, cherries, and other crops such as grapes and hops are predominant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Eastern WA is characterized by warmer and drier summers than Western WA, with average summer high temperatures in the upper 80s to mid-90s°F (27–34 °C) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].

                <p id="Par29">Study details and information about HEAT intervention development have been previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In brief, the HEAT intervention was developed in collaboration with regional agricultural stakeholders and communities through long-standing partnerships with Pacific Northwest Agricultural Safety and Health (PNASH) Center researchers. Intervention development was grounded in the social-ecological model of prevention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] and guided by two advisory groups: 1) a technical advisory group, which included agricultural industry, government, and community representatives; and 2) an expert working group, which included farmworkers and managers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Research staff included individuals who live and work in agricultural communities in WA. The HEAT intervention was designed to cover factors that affect HRI risk at multiple levels, including the individual, workplace, and community levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par30">The first intervention component, HEAT education, was developed to be culturally and linguistically appropriate and tailored to agriculture and uses a relational and engaged approach in the language of preference of the target audience (Spanish or English) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. HEAT education includes a Spanish/English train-the-trainer facilitator’s guide, uses poster visual displays, and covers: 1) types of HRI and treatments; 2) risk factors for HRI; 3) staying hydrated at work; 4) clothing for work in hot weather; 5) personal protective equipment and heat; and 6) keeping cool in the home and community [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. HEAT education was designed to comply with WA’s Outdoor Heat Rule for Agriculture worker training requirements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Feedback from advisory groups, results from focus groups and beta testing with promotores (community health workers) and agricultural workers, which involved providing early versions of the HEAT education and making adjustments based on feedback, and guidance from the University of Washington Center for Teaching and Learning were used to refine the HEAT education materials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The entire training guide takes approximately 60–90 minutes to complete but can also be broken down into 15-minute toolbox trainings for use in the field. Our prior study of HEAT education among WA farmworkers found greater improvement in worker heat knowledge scores across a summer season in the HEAT intervention group, compared to a comparison group that was offered non-HRI alternative training (<italic>p</italic> = 0.04) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par31">The second intervention component, the HEAT App, was developed in partnership with Washington State University’s AgWeatherNet (AWN) Program. AWN maintains a network of over 200 professional weather stations located mostly in agriculturally productive regions of Central/Eastern WA and is a trusted source of weather information for crop decision support in the WA agricultural community [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. The HEAT App links current and forecasted weather information with health and safety messages. HEAT App development was grounded in elements of the Technology Acceptance Model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], and the HEAT App was designed to notify agricultural supervisors about hot weather conditions and send messages through push notifications. Messages contain information about workers’ risk for adverse health effects from heat and strategies for prevention that are tailored to the agricultural industry (Fig. S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). As previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], messages are sent one and 6 days before a forecasted Heat Index of 91 °F (33 °C) or higher at nearby weather stations selected by the user. Suggested actions for heat prevention are available for conditions between a Heat Index of 80–90 °F (27–32 °C), but push notifications are not sent out below 91 °F (99 °C) to avoid information overload.</p>

There were a total of four tree fruit and vineyard companies that agreed to participate. The research team provided information sessions about the study and recruited participants from participating employers’ crews. There were approximately two to six crews per participating company from which crews were recruited. Crews were already formed by the workplace, and researchers did not have the ability to assemble crews. As described in the <xref rid="Sec6" ref-type="sec">Intervention allocation</xref> section below, crews within large and small companies were allocated to intervention and comparison groups separately, as large and small companies differ in their capacity for dedicated health and safety personnel and programs. Two of the four companies, hereafter referred to as ‘Large-1′ and ‘Large-2,’ were considered large companies, with more than 50 full-time employees during the growing season and dedicated health and safety personnel. We enrolled two crews from each large company for a total of four crews (Fig. S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). The other two companies had less than 50 full-time employees and were considered small companies. Since the two small companies were owned by brothers and had similar safety and health practices, the two small companies were considered one company, hereafter referred to as ‘Small,’ for the purposes of the analysis. We enrolled two crews from ‘Small’ for a total of two crews (Fig. S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). This recruitment strategy yielded ‘Large-1′, ‘Large-2′, and ‘Small’ enrolled companies and six enrolled crews (two per company) (Fig. S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>), with eight to 17 participants per crew. Eligible participants included seasonal workers and US H-2A guest workers, workers aged 18 years or older, workers who planned to work in agriculture during the summer season, and workers who understood Spanish and/or English.</p>

Work characteristics, including company, crew, and H-2A status, were noted by field staff on field observation sheets. Workers in the HEAT intervention group then received HEAT education from the same research staff member. Workers in the comparison group were offered education on another topic of interest to them (e.g., sexual harassment, pesticides). The HEAT App was provided in Spanish or English to intervention group supervisors who directly supervised each crew over the course of the season. Research staff assisted intervention group supervisors in downloading the application to their mobile device, selecting weather stations closest to their worksites, and viewing current heat indices and maximum daily heat indices forecasted over the following week. Approximately monthly, research staff conducted field monitoring, including field observations, surveys, and physiological monitoring at the farm (see <xref rid="Sec8" ref-type="sec">Data collection and processing</xref> below).

We measured tympanic temperatures using tympanic thermometers (Braun; Kronberg, Germany) at the beginning of the work-shift on field monitoring days. Baseline core temperature (T<sub>0</sub>) was estimated by adding 0.27 °C to the tympanic temperature to account for differences between tympanic temperature and core body temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Research staff assessed baseline heart rates (HR<sub>0</sub>) by asking participants to rest for approximately 10 minutes and taking participants’ radial pulses for 15 seconds, then multiplying by four, in the morning before work shifts. Workers’ heart rates were logged every 20 seconds throughout the work-shift using Polar® chest band monitors (Polar, Inc.; Lake Success, NY). Heart rate measurements below 40 beats per minute were removed, as these values were considered outside of the physiologically expected range. Only one participant had 39 minutes of nonzero heart rate measurements below 40 beats per minute on 1 day, and these values were excluded. No participants had heart rates above 200 beats per minute. One-minute average heart rates (HR<sub>x</sub>) were then computed. We employed a US Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine (USARIEM) method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], which uses an extended Kalman filter algorithm, to produce estimates of core body temperature every minute (T<sub>x</sub>) from one-minute heart rate measurements (HR<sub>x</sub>) and baseline core body temperature (T<sub>0</sub>). This algorithm has been validated in military settings and evaluated among WA agricultural workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].

              <p id="Par52">We conducted a parallel, comparison group intervention study of the HEAT intervention, consisting of culturally- and agriculture-tailored participatory farmworker heat education and a supervisor decision-support mobile application, in Washington State, US. We found larger decreases in physiological heat strain across a summer season in the intervention compared to comparison group for higher levels of work exertion, but this was not statistically significant. Prior studies suggest that participatory education that is culturally tailored is associated with improved farmworker heat knowledge and behavioral intentions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and that mobile heat safety and decision support applications are well-received by agricultural supervisors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. However, knowledge and behavioral intentions alone may not lead to change. According to the Health Belief Model, behavior change is achieved through targeting perceived barriers, benefits, susceptibility, and threats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. While tailored participatory education and supervisor decision support could influence these factors, findings from our study support the principle that reductions in heat strain and the risk of HRI require additional elements of heat stress management at the workplace level and systemic change to address barriers to reporting symptoms, pay structure, and access to healthcare.</p>
              <p id="Par53">The strongest predictor of physiological strain in this study was work exertion (effort level). Results from our fully adjusted model indicate that workers performing tasks requiring high effort had PSI<sub>max</sub> levels almost two points higher, on average, than those performing low/medium-low effort tasks. In our study, high effort corresponds roughly to moderate-high metabolic rate activities (300–415 W) while low/medium-low effort corresponds roughly to light-moderate tasks (180–300 W), depending on the specifics of the task [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. This is consistent with other studies among California and Florida agricultural workers that have identified work rate and physical activity level to be associated with elevated core body temperatures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Contributors to heat stress include metabolic heat (e.g., from physical work), environmental factors, and clothing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Participants in this study generally wore long-sleeved shirts underneath hooded sweatshirts or button-down shirts and long pants. PSI is a function of heart rate and core body temperature, and the PSI<sub>max</sub> for participants performing low effort work was largely in the low range (PSI 3–4), as defined by Moran et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], compared to the medium PSI range (PSI 5–6) or higher for participants performing high effort work. It is possible that in WA during the study period, when the mean HI<sub>max</sub> were in the 80s, metabolic heat was a key driver of heat stress and subsequent heat strain. This is consistent with 2006–2017 WA workers’ compensation HRI claims observations that indicate that the maximum daily temperatures on illness days were below the current WA heat rule temperature threshold of 89 °F (32 °C) for 45% of claims [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Overall, given the strong effect of exertion on PSI, further emphasis is needed to ensure adequate rest breaks, job rotation, and/or work pace reduction in the heat, along with payment for breaks and other mechanisms to reduce financial barriers to cool down and rest.</p>
              <p id="Par54">There are several potential reasons for the observed lack of a statistically significant HEAT intervention effect. First, the sample size of this study may not have been adequate to detect effects in fully adjusted models, including interactions. Second, our estimates of the intervention effect may have been an underestimate. It is possible there was sharing of information between intervention and comparison workers, which may have led to more conservative estimates of the effectiveness of the intervention, as the analysis was intention-to-treat. For example, at one of the large companies (Large-1), crews sometimes lived and worked together. Finally, though HEAT education has been shown to result in significant improvement in worker knowledge compared to comparison crew workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], worker education alone may not lead to actions to reduce heat strain and the risk of HRI. Unlike the existing US Occupational Safety &amp; Health Administration (OSHA)/National Institute for Occupational Safety &amp; Health (NIOSH) Heat Index-based mobile heat application [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>], our HEAT App provides messages tailored to agriculture, local environmental data from nearby agricultural weather stations, and longer forecasting for work planning, in response to early advisor and expert working group feedback. However, in contrast to NIOSH and ACGIH heat safety guidelines, the OSHA/NIOSH and our HEAT applications are simpler tools that don’t explicitly include work pace, clothing, and acclimatization status into risk calculations and may not fully represent risk, particularly at high workloads [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Education and decision support should be combined with other factors in heat stress management plans and policies, including behavioral thermoregulation and sufficient rest breaks, acclimatization procedures, adequate hydration, clothing, emergency response procedures, and consideration of mechanization and work pace.</p>
              <p id="Par55">We did not find a clear relationship between PSI and the number of symptoms reported. These findings are consistent with previous reports of heat stroke occurring in the absence of reported symptoms, and symptoms occurring in the absence of other signs of HRI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. We were unable to distinguish whether the number of symptoms reported was the number of actual symptoms experienced or was influenced by factors affecting willingness to report. Factors associated with PSI and factors associated with the number of symptoms reported were not the same. Participants were more likely to report symptoms if they were older in age and worked in agriculture in the US for 10+ years, which may reflect actual increased symptoms, awareness and perception of symptoms, or comfort with reporting. This is different to findings from our 2013 survey study of 97 WA tree fruit harvest workers, which indicated a lower odds of reported HRI symptoms with increasing age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. However, the present study sample included 37% H-2A workers, who, based on our observations, tended to be younger, male, and perform work requiring higher exertion levels than our 2013 study, which may have been reflected in higher PSI<sub>max</sub> values. Our fully adjusted models of heat strain indicated that PSI<sub>max</sub> scores decreased almost ½ point per decade of age, on average, in contrast with the increase in symptom reporting with older age. H-2A workers in our study were less likely to report HRI symptoms, consistent with prior studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. H-2A workers often do not have adequate access to healthcare, and barriers to reporting may include fear of reporting affecting current and future employment and well-being [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Additional work is needed to ensure adequate healthcare for H-2A and other agricultural workers and to address concerns about retaliation for reporting.</p>
              <p id="Par56">Several other factors were associated with symptoms reporting. First, in contrast to a previous study of Florida agricultural workers, women in our study were not significantly more likely to report a higher number of HRI symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In WA, between 2006 and 2017, there was a higher percentage of males with accepted HRI State Fund workers’ compensation claims, compared to all State Fund claims (82% versus 68%, respectively, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Though this may reflect employment predominance in agriculture by males, our study raises the question of whether differential reporting by men and women may also influence these results. Second, participants were more likely to report symptoms if they reported cooling opportunities outside of work or air conditioning at home. It is difficult to determine whether these participants seek cooling opportunities because they are more likely to experience symptoms or vice versa. There was no significant relationship between prior HRI training and symptoms reporting. Participants were more likely to report symptoms when exposed to hotter work conditions and having to walk more than three minutes to get to the toilet at work. A longer distance to the toilet has been previously reported to be associated with HRI symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Farmworkers, particularly those paid by the amount harvested (piece rate), may be less likely to fully hydrate and urinate regularly if it requires a longer time away from work to walk to the toilet. Piece-rate pay has been previously reported to be associated with reported HRI symptoms and with acute kidney injury among agricultural workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Well-maintained toilets that are mobile, for example, toilets attached to trucks that move with workers, and consideration of payment schemes that do not incentivize skipping breaks, but still allow workers to maintain their well-being, may support optimal hydration and HRI risk reduction.</p>

                <title>Strengths &amp; limitations</title>
                <p id="Par57">Strengths of this study include: its controlled, comparison design; recruitment and monitoring of agricultural workers and supervisors, including H-2A workers, over a harvest season; participatory design of the research and intervention; and collection of objective physiological data on heat strain, in addition to subjective symptom reporting. In addition to the small sample size and potential for cross-over previously discussed, this study has several other important limitations. First, we used convenience sampling in the selection of companies and workers. It is possible that companies and workers who chose not to participate may have had a greater potential for improvement in heat strain with the intervention, rendering our results more conservative. Second, weekly symptoms reporting may have been subject to recall bias. Third, due to time constraints and work pressures, the small farm crews were not randomized, and the crew that arrived first was allocated to the intervention. However, we do not have reason to believe that there are systematic differences in crews by their arrival time. Fourth, some participants completed weekly symptoms surveys by mobile application and some by telephone. Those that completed the surveys by mobile application versus telephone may have been more or less likely to report symptoms, but we do not expect there would be any systematic differences by intervention versus comparison group. Fifth, not all companies’ workers participated at the same time during the study period. Though it would be ideal to have participation on the exact same dates by all companies and workers, we were able to account for time-varying variability in factors such as heat exposure, and also accounted for company, in our analyses. Fifth, we used HI rather than more complex environmental metrics that also account for solar radiation and wind speed and that correlate better with heat strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. However, we were able to assess physiologic heat strain directly, using estimated core body temperature, in our analyses. Though solar radiation has been reported to affect certain heat-related body responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>], we do not expect that there was differential variability in solar radiation in the intervention and comparison groups. Sixth, we did not use a published compendium of physical activities to categorize task [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. However, we did use expert review of crop and task combinations by study team members with training in occupational safety and health and who observed tasks in the field. Seventh, we used an approach to estimate core body temperature rather than assessing gastrointestinal temperature. However, this approach has been evaluated among WA agricultural workers and demonstrated to correlate well with gastrointestinal temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Finally, our study may not be generalizable to agricultural populations in other states, as it was conducted in a US Pacific Northwest State with an occupational heat rule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p id="Par58">In this study of the HEAT intervention among Washington State, US farmworkers, we found larger decreases in physiological heat strain across a summer season in the intervention compared to comparison group for higher levels of work exertion, but this was not statistically significant. The strongest predictor of physiological strain in this study was work exertion (effort level). In addition to education and administrative controls, other factors that affect heat stress, including effort level, clothing, hydration, acclimatization, and emergency response plans, must be directly addressed in workplace heat management plans to prevent excessive physiological heat strain and its effects. Effort level can be addressed through work/rest cycles, job rotation, and adjustment of work pace.</p>
              <p id="Par59">In our study, work and worker characteristics associated with heat strain and HRI symptoms reporting did not fully overlap. Physiological strain and reported HRI symptoms should not be assumed to be overlapping outcomes for the purposes of evaluating heat prevention interventions for farmworkers. Additional work is needed to understand factors that affect farmworker HRI symptoms reporting and to establish a consensus on specific HRI symptoms for monitoring purposes. During periods of high heat stress, symptoms and indicators of physiological heat strain should both be monitored, if possible, to increase the sensitivity of early HRI detection and prevention for farmworkers. Related structural issues relevant to barriers to reporting symptoms, pay structure, restrooms, and access to healthcare are also critical to consider in reducing risk of HRI for farmworkers.</p>
              <p id="Par60">These multi-level issues should be addressed using a multi-level approach at workplace, community, and individual levels, including through policy development and through the implementation of policies and best practices tools in a manner tailored for agricultural workers. The need for further action is becoming increasingly urgent as the frequency and severity of heat events are projected to increase in the future [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>].</p>
