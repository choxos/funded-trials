                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are now a first-line treatment option for patients with pleural mesothelioma with the recent approval of ipilimumab and nivolumab. Mesothelioma has a low tumor mutation burden and no robust predictors of survival with ICI. Since ICIs enable adaptive antitumor immune responses, we investigated T-cell receptor (TCR) associations with survival in participants from two clinical trials treated with ICI.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>We included patients with pleural mesothelioma who were treated with nivolumab (NivoMes, NCT02497508) or nivolumab and ipilimumab (INITIATE, NCT03048474) after first-line therapy. TCR sequencing was performed with the ImmunoSEQ assay in 49 and 39 pretreatment and post-treatment patient peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples. These data were integrated with TCR sequences found in bulk RNAseq data by TRUST4 program in 45 and 35 pretreatment and post-treatment tumor biopsy samples and TCR sequences from over 600 healthy controls. The TCR sequences were clustered into groups of shared antigen specificity using GIANA. Associations of TCR clusters with overall survival were determined by cox proportional hazard analysis.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>We identified 4.2 million and 12 thousand complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) sequences from PBMCs and tumors, respectively, in patients treated with ICI. These CDR3 sequences were integrated with 2.1 million publically available CDR3 sequences from healthy controls and clustered. ICI-enhanced T-cell infiltration and expanded T cell diversity in tumors. Cases with TCR clones in the top tertile in the pretreatment tissue or in circulation had significantly better survival than the bottom two tertiles (p&lt;0.04). Furthermore, a high number of shared TCR clones between pretreatment tissue and in circulation was associated with improved survival (p=0.01). To potentially select antitumor clusters, we filtered for clusters that were (1) not found in healthy controls, (2) recurrent in multiple patients with mesothelioma, and (3) more prevalent in post-treatment than pretreatment samples. The detection of two-specific TCR clusters provided significant survival benefit compared with detection of 1 cluster (HR&lt;0.001, p=0.026) or the detection of no TCR clusters (HR=0.10, p=0.002). These two clusters were not found in bulk tissue RNA-seq data and have not been reported in public CDR3 databases.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>As T cells mediate antitumor responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), understanding whether any are associated with improved survival could allow the development of better predictors of response to ICI, inform our understanding of the adaptive immune response to tumors and guide development of T cell receptor (TCR)-based therapeutics. ICIs have recently been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of pleural mesothelioma based on the results of the CheckMate 743 clinical trial. In this trial, the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab was compared with platinum-based chemotherapy with pemetrexed in patients with unresectable pleural mesothelioma. There was an improvement in overall survival (OS) in patients who received ICI compared with chemotherapy (median OS 18.1 months vs 14.1 months, HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.87).<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> This benefit was more pronounced in patients with non-epithelioid mesothelioma. In a recent update, the 3-year OS rates were reported at 23% and 15% for ICI compared with chemotherapy, respectively.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Whereas expression of programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) has been described as a predictive biomarker with ICI in other tumor types,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> it did not strongly correlate with OS in Checkmate 743. In contrast, PD-L1 expression is most frequently associated with a negative prognostic significance in pleural mesothelioma.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4–6</xref> Recently, a four-gene inflammatory signature which assesses the impact of inflammation in the tumor microenvironment on clinical outcomes with nivolumab and ipilimumab has emerged as a biomarker of interest; however, it requires further validation.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Tumor mutation burden, which is a surrogate for tumor neoantigens and is associated with benefit with ICI, is reportedly low in most mesotheliomas.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 9</xref> Standard approaches to sequencing tumors might miss chromosomal rearrangements that have neoantigenic potential in pleural mesothelioma,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> which may have predictive value in the context of antigen processing and presentation gene expresion.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Therefore, there is an unmet need to identify non-invasive biomarkers which can better predict patient response to ICI and optimize patient selection.</p>
              <p>TCRs determine the antigen specificity of T cells. TCR-sequencing (TCRseq), and bioinformatics approaches to derive TCR sequences have not been widely applied to understanding survival outcomes with ICI in pleural mesothelioma. Unique TCR sequences may recognize the same antigen due to similarities in the complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) sequences. Accordingly, more recent TCR analyses group TCRs into clusters with predicted common specificity. Thus, TCRs from multiple patients can be grouped into clusters that are predicted to share antigen specificity. As the infiltration of tumor reactive T cells at the tumor site,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> expansion of programmed death-1 protein (PD-1)<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell clones after dendritic cell vaccine,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> and expansion of T cell clones on treatment with antimesothelin targeted chimeric antigen receptor T cells in combination with pembrolizumab have been correlated with improved patient outcomes,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> we hypothesized that expansion of TCR repertoire on treatment with ICI associated with improved survival in pleural mesothelioma.</p>
              <p>Here, we report our analysis of TCR clusters and their predictive significance in patients with pleural mesothelioma treated with ICI in two clinical trials.</p>

Tumor biopsies were also collected after 6 weeks of treatment from many of these patients (n=31). RNA from the tumor biopsies was purified using the AllPrep DNA/RNA/miRNA Universal kit (Qiagen, #80224) following the instructions provided by the manufacturer.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> The buffer included β-mercaptoethanol for the specimens obtained from NCT02497508, and dithiothreitol for the ones obtained from NCT03048474. Otherwise, there were no differences in the handling of the specimens or nucleic acid purification. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were drawn in EDTA tubes and frozen prior to initiation of immunotherapy, and 6 weeks after the start of therapy for a total of 49 pretreatment and 39 on-treatment PBMCs for TCRseq. The DNA was purified from the PBMCs and prepared for TCRseq per instructions from Adaptive Biotechnologies as we have done previously.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 18</xref> The clinical trials and translational studies were approved by the local institutional ethics committees. Patients consented to participate in these trials and use their specimens for research in the NivoMes and INITIATE clinical trials conducted at the Netherlands Cancer Institute.

These tissue-based TCR sequences were pooled with the TCR sequences found in PBMCs as determined by TCRseq from the trial participants, and with publically available TCR sequences identified in PBMCs from healthy controls. The TCR sequences from healthy controls without cancer (n=589) were obtained from an investigation on the effects of cytomegalovirus exposure history on the T cell repertoire<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> and were downloaded from the Adaptive Biotechnologies immuneACCESS platform (<ext-link xlink:href="https://clients.adaptivebiotech.com/immuneaccess" ext-link-type="uri">https://clients.adaptivebiotech.com/immuneaccess</ext-link>).

                <p>We aimed to determine whether any TCR cluster was significantly associated with survival on treatment with ICI. Associations were based on log rank p values determined by the ‘coxph’ function in the ‘survival’ package in R. Given our sample size, and to limit the number of hypotheses being tested, we limited our focus to TCR clusters identified in at least seven individual patients. We did not identify any pretreatment PBMCs with significant association with OS after correcting for the false discover rate (FDR). In the on-treatment samples, there were 166 clusters from at least 7 individuals (<xref rid="SP1 SP6" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental figure S4</xref>). We eliminated clusters that (1) contained identical CDR3 amino acid sequences in healthy controls even if with a different variable chain, and (2) were not more prevalent in on-treatment than pretreatment PBMCs, as we expected any TCR cluster associated with treatment response would likely expand on treatment. This search identified two clusters that were associated with OS following treatment with immunotherapy with a q-value &lt;0.056 calculated by ‘qvalue’ package. To plot multiple Kaplan-Meier (KM) plots, we used km.coxph.plot function in the ‘survcomp’ package in R.</p>

We calculated a tumor junction burden by counting the number of unique genes hit by all junctions (chromosomal rearrangements, insertions and deletions) in the samples. We subsequently demonstrated that an interaction of ‘Regulation of Antigen Processing and Presentation of Peptide Antigen’ gene set expression and the tumor junction burden was predictive of survival with ICIs in mesothelioma.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> We then added the normalized TCR cluster membership into this interaction model. Pretreatment tissue biopsies were assigned into ‘High I’ or ‘Low I’ groupings based on having interaction scores in the top tertile or bottom two tertiles, respectively. Similarly, pretreatment biopsies were assigned into ‘High T’ or ‘Low T’ groupings based on having TCR cluster membership in the top tertile or bottom two tertiles, respectively.

These TCR sequences were analyzed by the GIANA TCR clustering program which identified close to 586,000 TCR clusters with predicted shared antigen specificity and each containing an average of 4.6 individual TCR sequences. The median and the mean of unique samples in TCR clusters were 2 and 3.66, respectively (<xref rid="SP1 SP7" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental figure S5</xref>). Venn diagrams of overlapping clusters between mesothelioma tumor biopsies, mesothelioma PBMCs, and healthy controls from pretreatment or on treatment samples are shown in <xref rid="SP1 SP5" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental figure S3</xref>. In all subsequent analyses, we only examined clusters that were not identified in healthy controls to focus on mesothelioma associated TCRs.</p>

In other words, tumors with high TCR cluster counts had high CD8A and CD4 expression in tumor biopsies by RNA-seq. Additionally, in tumor biopsies the number of TCR clusters detected in on-treatment samples were significantly higher than in pretreatment samples (p=0.017, <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">figure 2C</xref>). This finding was consistent with the immune deconvolution analyses that found greater T cell accumulation in biopsy specimens following treatment with ICI compared with the pretreatment specimens (<xref rid="SP1 SP8" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental figure S8</xref>), suggesting that ICI increased T cell clonal diversity (based on the increase in T cell clusters) and trafficking to mesotheliomas. Notably, patients with pretreatment tumor biopsies with normalized TCR cluster membership in the top tertile had significantly better survival than patients with TCR clusters in the bottom two tertiles (p 0.034, HR 0.44, 95% CI 0.200 to 0.986, <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">figure 2D</xref>).</p>

We posited that shared TCR clones between tissue and PBMCs would likely represent expansion of systemic anti-tumor immunity and associate with improved survival. In the 33 individuals with both tumor biopsies and PBMC pretreatment samples (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">figure 3B</xref>), we estimated the number of shared clones based on having TCRs with identical CDR3 amino acid sequences and variable chains in tissue and PBMC. After normalizing for both tumor and PBMC sequencing, we found the presence of shared tumor and PBMC TCR clones significantly improved OS (cox proportional hazard p=0.011). Patients with the top tertile of shared tumor biopsy and PBMC TCR clones had significantly better OS than patients with shared TCR clones in the bottom tertiles (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">figure 3C</xref>, p 0.012; HR 0.33, 95% CI 0.129 to 0.837).</p>

                <p>Next, we investigated whether membership in common mesothelioma TCR clusters in PBMCs had any bearing on clinical presentation. In the pretreatment PBMCs, we identified 29 TCR clusters that were each found in at least 12 patients. With the exception of one patient, all cases had TCR clones in at least 1 of these TCR clusters. In a heat map with columns representing individual PBMCs grouped by unsupervised clustering according to the dendrogram on top and rows representing TCR clusters, we noted a group of patients that were enriched for commonly occurring TCR clusters (right side of the green dashed line; <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">figure 4A</xref>). This group that was enriched for commonly occurring TCR clusters contained a significantly higher proportion of patients with clinical responses to ICI (61% overall response rate according to modified pleural RECIST compared with 19% overall response rate, χ<sup>2</sup> p=0.003) and better OS (HR 0.47, p 0.038; 95% CI 0.226 to 0.989; <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">figure 4A, B</xref>).</p>

There were five patients in which both of these TCR clusters were detected, and five patients in which one of these TCR clusters was detected.

                <p>We next examined if there were associations between TCR clusters and the tumor microenvironment using immune deconvolution. We compared the tumor microenvironment of the pretreatment biopsies with the normalized TCR clusters also detected in the tumor by tertiles. There were significantly larger estimates of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the tumor microenvironment of patients with more TCR clusters by multiple immune deconvolution programs (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">figure 5</xref>, <xref rid="SP1 SP12" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental figure S10</xref>). Furthermore, we found increased populations of B cells and myeloid dendritic cells in the tumor microenvironments of patients with higher TCR clusters (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">figure 5B, C</xref>, <xref rid="SP1 SP12 SP14" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental figure S10</xref>).

As shown in KM plots (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">figure 6A</xref>), the HiI group had better survival outcome than LoI following immunotherapy (p=0.056). The inclusion of TCR clusters by tertile into our model improved the survival predictions further (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">figure 6A, B</xref>).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>The search for robust, predictive biomarkers for ICI has been elusive. The situation in pleural mesothelioma is even more complex. Despite the proven benefit of ICI for this malignancy, tumor mutation burden is almost universally low,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 9</xref> and its determination typically lacks the inclusion of larger structural variants that may have neoantigenic potential,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 11</xref> and it frequently is not corrected for germline variants or ancestry.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29–31</xref> In this study, we focused on the TCR clusters with predicted shared antigenicity, as T-cells within these clusters are the likely mediators of an effective ICI response. As most patients in this study had pretreatment and on-treatment biopsies paired with blood, our analysis allowed us to compare the dynamics of T cell clusters between tumor and peripheral circulation and the effects of these changes on patient outcomes. We identified significant increases in TCR clusters within tumors following treatment with ICI, suggesting that ICI promotes T cell infiltration of tumors. Patients with the higher detectable TCR clusters prior to treatment, in tumor or blood, had improved OS compared with those with lower TCR cluster counts. Similar trends were observed between TCR clusters and survival with on-treatment specimens from tumor or blood.</p>
              <p>Also, survival was improved in patients with greater concordance of TCR clusters between tumor and blood. Patients with higher TCR clusters were found to have tumor microenvironments enriched with higher number of CD8+T cells, B cells, and dendritic cells. Addition of the TCR cluster membership into an immunotherapy outcome prediction model further enhanced its predictive capabilities. Finally, we also identified two TCR clusters that were strongly predictive of OS. To our knowledge, this is the first study showing the association of specific TCR clusters with survival outcomes in patients with mesothelioma who received ICI therapy.</p>
              <p>Our findings are consistent with the immunological analysis in the phase 2 PrE0505 trial which tested chemoimmunotherapy with durvalumab in combination with chemotherapy in patients with unresectable pleural mesothelioma.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> In the PrE0505 trial, more diverse TCR repertoires were seen in the baseline tumor specimens of patients with survival of 12 or more months compared with that of patients with shorter survival. This finding suggests that a polyclonal T cell repertoire may mediate a more effective antitumor immune response. Similarly, more diverse TCR repertoires correlated with better pathological responses in patients with non-small cell lung cancer who received neoadjuvant therapy with nivolumab.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>
</p>
              <p>Another study which analyzed samples before and during anti-PD-1 therapy with pembrolizumab in patients with metastatic melanoma (n=46) found that proliferation of intratumoral CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells correlated with radiographic responses.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Higher TCR diversity has been shown to correlate with improved outcomes in bladder, colorectal, hepatocellular and uterine cancer.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> In pleural mesothelioma, it was concluded that broader immune cell repertoires are required to mount a robust anti-tumor immune response.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Our data suggest that increases in detectable TCR clusters also positively affect the outcome with ICI in pleural mesothelioma.</p>
              <p>The tumor microenvironment and presence of tertiary lymphoid structures have been shown to play an important role in response to immunotherapy in multiple cancers including mesothelioma.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36–38</xref> The presence of CD8+T cells, and B cells has been shown to correlate with better survival, while presence of tumor associated macrophages is negatively correlated with OS depending on histology.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39–41</xref> Our data demonstrated consistent findings showing improved survival in patients with tumor microenvironments enriched in CD8+T cells, B cells, and dendritic cells.</p>
              <p>Our study is limited by the sample size, although it is the largest TCR analysis available for this rare malignancy in patients treated prospectively with ICI alone on clinical trials. Since these patients received second or later line ICI, these results may not be generalizable to patients being treated in the first-line setting. Also, our study was weighted with the epithelioid variant of pleural mesothelioma which is consistent with clinical trials that offer second-line or later line treatment for pleural mesothelioma. As expected, the tumor biopsy specimens had many fewer TCRs and TCR clusters than their paired PBMCs likely because different methods were used to identify the TCRs and tumors are usually sparsely populated with T cells compared with blood. T cell infiltration of tumors is also dynamic, and a single biopsy is unlikely to fully capture the full complexity of the tumor-infiltrating T cell repertoire. Additionally, TCRseq and the bioinformatically derived TCR sequences from bulk RNA sequencing do not provide the same granularity as single cell RNA sequencing. More specifically, TCR consists of alpha and beta chains. The paired alpha and beta chains cannot be derived from bulk RNA sequencing. Regardless, CDR3s are the key determinants of T cell specificity and analysis of CDR3s provide invaluable biological insights into T cell repertoires. Finally, it is difficult to determine the antigen specificity of a T cell clone, and the antigen-specificity of TCR clusters we found to be positively associated with survival have not been reported in public databases.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, we have identified two TCR clusters that are associated with improved survival in patients with pleural mesothelioma treated with ICI. These two TCR clusters may not only have predictive significance of response to immunotherapy, if validated, but they may also inform TCR-based therapeutic approaches and guide the identification of immunogenic neoantigens in pleural mesothelioma. The analysis of TCR clusters can improve our ability to predict patients who will benefit from immunotherapy in mesothelioma. ’Finally, the presence of shared TCR clusters between tumor and blood positively impacted survival. This finding suggests that tumor reactive T cells may be identifiable in the periphery, enabling less invasive blood-based monitoring approaches for prediction of response to ICI.</p>
