              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par5">Breast cancer (BC) is a heterogeneous disease with tumours exhibiting variable morphology, molecular profiles, behaviour and response to therapy. Mounting evidence demonstrates that BC shows variable rates of growth, which has important clinical and medicolegal implications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> In vivo growth rate is not only a quantifiable trait of the tumour but can also serve as a tool to plan and evaluate screening programmes, clinical trials or epidemiologic studies. In addition, BC growth rate evaluated using tumour size from mammograms may predict tumour response to chemotherapy, and may help in determining the likely time of tumour initiation and previous tumour size in medicolegal cases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> BC growth rate is also associated with prognostic variables, such as lymph node status, stage and vascular invasion;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> however, the prognostic and predictive value of BC growth rate has not been harnessed in routine practice due to the inherent difficulty in its assessment in the short intervals between diagnosis and treatment.</p>
              <p id="Par6">Although the growth rate of BC in vivo is strictly regulated, it appears to be dependent on the balance between several variables including growth fraction (the tumour cells that are proliferating and leading directly to the addition of new tumour cells), the rate of tumour cell loss by apoptosis and/or necrosis, tumour cells’ doubling-time/kinetics, and the surrounding microenvironment including angiogenesis, blood supply and host immune response to the proliferating tumour cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> The complexity of the processes controlling BC growth and the interaction with the tumour microenvironment make assessment and prediction of BC growth rate a challenging task. Therefore, serial imaging of BC at different time points is considered as the best model available for assessing the in vivo growth rate and for determining associations between potential intrinsic growth rate determinants and BC behaviour, including response to therapy.</p>
              <p id="Par7">This study utilises a discovery cohort comprising clinically and molecularly well-characterised data from BC patients who underwent serial mammography. It is a unique and rare cohort because the second mammogram illuminated that the tumour was indeed “missed” during the first mammogram. We find that this one-of-a-kind cohort can be interrogated to (a) identify predictors of BC in vivo growth rate, (b) evaluate the impact of BC growth rate on disease outcome and (c) develop a surrogate model that robustly predicts pre-diagnosis in vivo growth rate for patients who would normally not have tumour volume data from two serial mammograms. In contrast to a matched first-presentation-only BC patients’ cohort, BC growth rate in this study is determined by the changes in tumour volume between sequential mammograms, wherein the first mammogram “mistakenly” reported the case as normal/benign, and the cancer was identified in the screening mammogram on a retrospective review subsequent to the second (diagnostic) mammogram (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Schematic depicting sequences of steps in our study leading to the calculation of <italic>SM-INVIGOR</italic> and the development of <italic>Surr-INVIGOR</italic> that predicts in vivo tumour growth rate in BC. Briefly, tumour volumes from two serial mammograms and the time interval between measurements in a unique data set of 92 patients (<bold>a</bold>) were used to develop a growth rate index <italic>SM-INVIGOR</italic> (<bold>b</bold>). The growth index significantly predicts BCSS and classifies tumours as slow growing or fast growing (<bold>c</bold>). When the tumours were resected after final diagnosis (<bold>d</bold>), tumour sections were immunohistochemically stained for a panel of BC biomarkers (<bold>e</bold>). A machine-learning algorithm was used to develop a surrogate model (termed <italic>Surr-INVIGOR</italic>) for <italic>SM-INVIGOR</italic> that uses routinely assessed BC clinical biomarkers like Ki67, mitotic index and histological size. The multivariable model non-linearly combines multiple clinicopathological variables and immunohistochemical biomarkers to predict the tumour’s in vivo growth rate prior to diagnosis (<bold>f</bold>, <bold>g</bold>). Using the same growth rate threshold as <italic>SM-INVIGOR</italic>, the <italic>Surr-INVIGOR</italic> model was able to prognostically stratify patients in study cohort (<bold>h</bold>). Finally, <italic>Surr-INVIGOR</italic> was validated using an independent BC validation cohort of 1241 patients and was found to be strongly prognostic in the validation cohort (<bold>i</bold>, <bold>j</bold>)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41416_2019_539_Fig1_HTML" id="d32e491"/></fig></p>

                <p id="Par8">The study cohort comprises 114 BC patients aged between 50 and 70 years who were presented at the Nottingham City Hospital from 1988 to 2008 with BC, and for whom review of the previous screening mammogram showed a previously undetected tumour at the same affected site. This may have been due to either a false-negative screening outcome or due to minimal visible signs of malignancy on the previous mammogram. Mammographic abnormalities included measurable soft tissue abnormality (mass, distortion or asymmetry) on screening and diagnostic films. On retrospective review of the previous mammogram after the disease diagnosis, two radiologists (blinded to each other’s observations) confirmed the “missed” cancer. We selected patients in whom a soft tissue abnormality was detected (upon retrospective review of prior screening mammograms) at the site of the subsequent cancer. Due to a misdiagnosed mammogram, this cohort uniquely comes with an earlier screening measurement with a visible tumour. Clinicopathological data including age, histological tumour type, primary tumour size, lymph node status, histological grade, Nottingham Prognostic Index (NPI), vascular invasion and patients’ outcome data were obtained. BC-specific survival (BCSS) was defined as the time interval (in months) between the primary surgeries and death from BC. The mean survival time of this cohort of patients was 120 months. Clinicopathological variables were available for 92 cases, and the BCSS was available in 90 cases; thus, we restricted our study to these cases (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>).</p>

                <p id="Par17">Since fast in vivo growth prior to diagnosis is a sign of aggressive disease and could lead to poor outcomes, we reasoned that the growth rate model of choice would be the one that is most prognostic. Thus, we evaluated various combinations of growth rate functions and assumptions regarding the tumour’s three-dimensional shape. The best-fitting model of tumour volume and growth rate was obtained using the assumption that the study cohort comprises spherical tumours growing at a power law (α = 0.5) rate; this growth rate function (<italic>SM-INVIGOR)</italic> stratified the tumours into slow-growing and fast-growing subgroups and produced a minimum cross-validated AIC of 152.621 (Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5</xref>). Using these assumptions, tumour volumes at the time of screening ranged from 53 to 56,115 mm<sup>3</sup> (mean of 2742 ± 7619 mm<sup>3</sup>). This contrasted with tumour volumes at diagnosis, which ranged from 61 to 61,562 mm<sup>3</sup> (mean = 5573 ± 8768 mm<sup>3</sup>). The mean time difference between date of first screening and that of second diagnostic screening was 18 months (range 4–37 months, median = 17.5 months).

                <title>Development of a clinically relevant surrogate model (Surr-INVIGOR) for in vivo growth rate prediction</title>
                <p id="Par19">Unlike the patients in our unique discovery cohort, most begin therapy at an initial cancer diagnosis, and are therefore unlikely to have two serial mammograms with two tumour volume measurements. Because of this difference, <italic>SM-INVIGOR</italic> is limited in its utility to derive in vivo tumour growth rate for most BC patients in routine clinical practice. Therefore, to extend the benefits of having growth rate data (or estimates) to a much larger group of patients lacking a second mammogram, we developed a machine learning-based surrogate growth rate model for <italic>SM-INVIGOR</italic> and called it <italic>Surr-INVIGOR</italic> (described in Supplementary Data). <italic>Surr-INVIGOR</italic> non-linearly combines multiple clinicopathological variables and immunohistochemical biomarkers to predict in vivo growth rate. First, we evaluated the ability of individual clinicopathological variables to serve as potential surrogate features and discriminate between the fast-growing and slow-growing tumour subgroups of our study cohort (<italic>p</italic>-values for mean difference between the subgroups is shown in Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>). Ki67 (<italic>p</italic> = 0.000265), mitotic score (MI; <italic>p</italic> = 0.002479), tumour size (<italic>p</italic> = 0.003619), NPI (<italic>p</italic> = 0.004163) and grade (<italic>p</italic> = 0.021128) differed significantly between the fast-growing and slow-growing tumours. The seven variables (Ki67, mitotic score, tumour size, NPI, grade, stage and tumour size) with <italic>p-</italic>value &lt; 0.2 were then tested in multiple machine learning-based classification algorithms via sequential selection (Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). The maximised cross-validated accuracy, which indicates the optimal <italic>Surr-INVIGOR</italic> model, was obtained when three features (Ki67, MI and histological tumour size) were used in a K-nearest neighbour algorithm or KNN (accuracy or concordance with the classification yielded by <italic>SM-INVIGOR</italic> = 0.706). The ensemble also yielded a 70% accurate classifier, but required four additional features; the more parsimonious KNN was thus selected for use in <italic>Surr-INVIGOR</italic>. Fitting an optimal regression model to predict the growth rate continuously resulted in a poor R<sup>2</sup>, peaking at 0.22, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>, perhaps owing to the small sample size. Thus, our machine learning-based <italic>Surr-INVIGOR</italic> model was a clinically relevant, superior choice compared with regression-based models.</p>

              <p id="Par23">Although several studies have investigated variables associated with pre-diagnosis in vivo BC growth rate, only clinicopathological variables and a few molecular biomarkers have been studied in this context, and the available tumour dimensions were limited due to the measurement of the tumour’s long-axis only.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> This study utilised a unique cohort of cases with tumour volume measurements (derived using tumour diameter and height data) available from a pair of serial mammograms to derive their in vivo growth rates (<italic>SM-INVIGOR</italic>). We explored the potential association of a larger number of molecular biomarkers with their in vivo BC growth rate, reaffirmed that fast tumour growth rate has a profound impact on prognosis, developed and validated a surrogate model (<italic>Surr-INVIGOR</italic>) that can predict a gross scale (fast versus slow) in vivo growth rate accurately in routine practice, and its medicolegal consequences.</p>
              <p id="Par24">The success of breast screening lies in the timely detection of cancer on mammography. False-negative mammography is among the principal reasons for delayed diagnosis of BC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> Even though some authors quote high sensitivity (&gt;90%) for diagnostic mammography, such results are not universal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> Among many factors, age appears to be one of the important factors underlying false-negative reporting, because the high-radiographic density of breast in young women makes detection difficult.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> Mammograms are generally capable of detecting tumours as small as 2 mm in diameter, which equates to a tumour of ~10<sup>7</sup> cells and about 23 tumour doublings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> In our study cohort, however, patients with tumours ranging from 4 to 55 mm received false-negative diagnoses in their screening mammograms showing the imperfection associated with this technology and inherent human limitations associated with reading radiology films. Whether the spread of a tumour is due to delays in diagnosis and initiation of treatment, or due to the inherently more aggressive nature of the tumour cells themselves (i.e., higher in vivo tumour growth rate) is another highly controversial matter. Natural fears that the delay in diagnosis has reduced their chances of survival or of avoiding the life-sapping effects of chemotherapy, or the feeling that cosmetic outcomes which would have been better had the tumour been detected earlier, are frequent causes of patients seeking legal redress. The importance of breast imaging in BC diagnosis and the use of mammography in screening has thus pushed breast radiologists into the frontline for medicolegal actions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> Cancers missed at screening but followed by a positive diagnostic mammogram are not common, yet false-negative mammography is amongst the principal reasons for delayed diagnosis of BC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> Only few population-screening programmes have reported the data on this group of cancers, which makes our study cohort uniquely valuable. This cohort allowed us to develop a model to predict pre-diagnostic in vivo tumour growth rate, and provide insights into the potential prognostic consequences of delays in BC diagnosis.</p>
              <p id="Par25">Our study has yielded several key insights into features and the prognostic significance of the rate of tumour growth in its early stages. In our study, we found that <italic>SM-INVIGOR</italic> varies considerably, and is consistent with findings by Weedon-Fekjaer et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> who reported that the time BC takes to grow from 10 mm to 20 mm in diameter varied from less than 1.2 months to more than 6.3 years. Our current study also reinforced previous findings that higher grade and larger tumours with high proliferative activity are likely to have faster <italic>SM-INVIGOR</italic>, and that faster pre-diagnosis growth rate predicted shorter survival.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup> We also found that the status of lymphovascular invasion (LVI) correlated with growth rate; with highly proliferative and fast-growing tumours more likely to develop when there is increased provision of nutrients to the tumour cells from the leaky invaded blood vessels. Our results indicated that increasing <italic>SM-INVIGOR</italic> increases the risk of mortality of the disease. However, <italic>SM-INVIGOR</italic> cannot be included as a prognostic variable in routine clinical practice because of difficulty in evaluating it in the short interval between diagnosis and treatment.</p>
              <p id="Par26">Therefore, we developed <italic>Surr-INVIGOR</italic> to predict the pre-diagnosis in vivo BC growth rate after testing multiple clinicopathological and molecular variables (individually and in combination) using diverse machine-learning algorithms. The optimal algorithm, a KNN which used Ki67, MI and size, stratified both the study and validation cohorts into two subgroups with very distinct outcomes. <italic>Surr-INVIGOR</italic> further allowed routine clinical parameters to be used in patients with slow-growing tumours to determine tumour size at various time points before the diagnosis of the tumour. For fast-growing tumours, immediate surgery is often recommended, as delays may result in upgrading of clinical T stage. <italic>Surr-INVIGOR</italic> may thus have a potential use in medicolegal cases, and may be used to guide screening and perhaps even follow-up intervals in selected groups of BC patients.</p>
              <p id="Par27">Consistent with previous studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup> the results from our validation cohort showed a significant correlation between BC molecular subtypes and pre-diagnosis tumour growth rate, wherein a higher growth rate was observed in triple-negative/basal-like BC patients. Previous studies have indicated that faster-growing tumours lead to poorer survival.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup> Our results compellingly demonstrated that high pre-diagnosis in vivo BC growth rate increases the risk of mortality from the disease regardless of potential clinicopathological cofounders. Some previous studies did not find such statistically significant associations,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> which might be because in those studies, the tumour volume was calculated using only one dimension—a method that can introduce considerable inaccuracy into growth rate calculations. In this study, we utilised a combination of power law growth rate and spherical volume, both of which were significant in a previous study using two-dimensional breast mammogram data,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> and showed the most significant prognostic relevance in our data.</p>
              <p id="Par28">Review of previous mammography is carried out as a routine practice at Nottingham Hospital, and cases that show an abnormality at the same site as the diagnosed tumours are considered as cancers potentially missed in the prior screening. Some of these tumours are only detectable in retrospect with knowledge of the diagnostic mammograms, and if all such subtle areas were recalled for further assessment, this would likely increase the false-positive rate beyond what is regarded as acceptable in the NHS breast screening programme. The impact of such delay in the diagnosis on the presentation and outcome of these tumours compared with matched population of women who presented for the first time as symptomatic or with screen-detected BC remains to be defined. Most tumours included in our study (similar to other studies looking at screen-detected tumours) by their very nature, were small, slow-growing luminal tumours and infrequently expressed basal markers or HER2 with similar nodal status.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> This can be explained by the unique nature of these slow-growing early-stage tumours in this study. By contrast, aggressive tumours are likely to present without prior mammographic abnormality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup> In line with these results, Kalager et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup> have reported that BCs presenting as interval cancers were slightly larger than symptomatic BC, but there was no difference between the two groups regarding lymph node status or patient outcome. Moreover, our results indicated that the impact of <italic>SM-INVIGOR</italic> on disease stage and development of LVI is limited. However, this study holds a few limitations: due to the unique nature of the study cohort and the lack of similar missed cancer cohorts, the <italic>SM-INVIGOR</italic> growth index could not be readily validated. In addition, this is a retrospective, single centre study and adjuvant treatment regimens were not factored in our analyses. Validation of the model in diverse cohorts is necessary before it can be applied for the prediction of in vivo growth rate and determination of the likely tumour initiation date and previous tumour size in clinico-legal cases. If validated in further studies, the model developed herein could potentially guide treatment selection, as it prognostically distinguishes fast-growing tumours from slow-growing ones. For example, for fast-growing tumours, immediate treatment in the form of primary systemic therapy (rather than surgery) may be required. Moreover, HER2 is known to be related to rapid growth of tumours, and might be a good marker to add to the <italic>Surr-INVIGOR</italic>; however, our study cohort was overwhelmingly HER2 negative and thus its impact within a prognostic model could not be properly measured. Further analysis may be required in a diverse cohort.</p>
              <p id="Par29">In conclusion, this study has demonstrated that multiple factors control BC growth; when considered together Ki67, mitotic index and tumour size produce a robust prediction model of pre-diagnostic growth rate and can be used to classify BCs as slow growing or fast growing. The impact of missing subtle cancers in screening mammography seems to depend on whether the tumour was slow growing or fast growing prior to diagnosis, as fast-growing tumours were associated with poorer outcomes and perhaps reflected more aggressive tumour biology. Independent validation of these findings in multiple and more diverse cohorts is warranted.</p>
