                <p id="Par1">Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic condition often associated with pain, affecting approximately fourteen percent of the population, and increasing in prevalence. A globally aging population have made treating OA-associated pain as well as maintaining mobility and activity a public health priority. OA affects all mammals, and the use of spontaneous animal models is one promising approach for improving translational pain research and the development of effective treatment strategies. Accelerometers are a common tool for collecting high-frequency activity data on animals to study the effects of treatment on pain related activity patterns. There has recently been increasing interest in their use to understand treatment effects in human pain conditions. However, activity patterns vary widely across subjects; furthermore, the effects of treatment may manifest in higher or lower activity counts or in subtler ways like changes in the frequency of certain types of activities. We use a zero inflated Poisson hidden semi-Markov model to characterize activity patterns and subsequently derive estimators of the treatment effect in terms of changes in activity levels or frequency of activity type. We demonstrate the application of our model, and its advance over traditional analysis methods, using data from a naturally occurring feline OA-associated pain model.</p>

              <p id="Par2">To anyone who suffers chronic and persistent musculoskeletal pain, the negative impact on their quality of life is constant. In the U.S., more than 100 million people (nearly one third of the population) suffer from persistent pain with an associated economic cost of $600 billion USD annually; this cost exceeds that of cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes combined<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. The most significant contribution to this cost comes from the impact of osteoarthritis (OA) and other musculoskeletal pain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. OA results in the deterioration of all components of joints<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> and is often associated with pain. OA-associated pain results in significant morbidity and economic costs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>; these costs, an aging population, and the growing knowledge of the health and psychological benefits of maintaining mobility and activity, have made the treatment of OA and the associated pain a public health priority<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. However, recent review papers show that the current practice of translational biomedical research is not producing new therapeutics for pain control in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. While these reviews highlight the lack of translation of basic research into new approved therapeutics for treatment of persistent pain in humans, they also discuss how the processes involved could be optimized to improve the chances of successful translation, including discussion of improved models and more relevant outcome measures. As OA and associated pain affects all mammals, the study of OA in non-human animals is both important in its own right (to increase the function and quality of life in affected animals) and for its ability to generate new knowledge about the treatment of OA in humans. Recently, the use of naturally occurring OA in pet animals has been suggested as a means of helping to improve translational research for the development of analgesic therapeutics in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. A significant advantage of naturally occurring disease in pets as a model of human conditions is the variation and complexity of the model. Measurement of spontaneous activity as an outcome measure may be particularly relevant to translational work as spontaneous activity may relate to spontaneous pain—something that has been difficult to model in animals. Just as the variability in naturally occurring disease is an advantage, the variability in clinically meaningful outcome measures such as activity is a challenge. This could be the reason for the lack of use of activity as a functional outcome measure in pain studies in humans, despite the importance of mobility and activity to quality of life<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. The work we are reporting is motivated by our involvement in studies of OA-associated pain and the treatment effects on mobility and activity in domestic cats<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. We posit that the methodology we describe presents a significant advance in how such activity data are analyzed when used as an outcome measure and has relevance to both large animal models and clinical evaluation in humans.</p>
              <p id="Par3">The current study uses data from a randomized cross-over study designed to evaluate the effectiveness of meloxicam, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), in owned, pet adult domestic cats with OA-associated pain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. In this study, cat activity patterns were measured at one-minute intervals using an omnidirectional accelerometer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Accelerometer readings are integers quantifying the intensity of change in acceleration over the preceding, pre-defined epoch. Thus, for each subject, the accelerometer produces high-frequency, integer-valued, longitudinal data. The main goal of the present study is to re-evaluate the use of and analysis of activity data to determine whether meloxicam is effective in reducing OA-associated pain. We aimed to use the objectively measured physical activity recorded via accelerometers and analyze these data using a novel zero-inflated hidden Poisson semi-Markov model. The primary hypothesis of the present study is that meloxicam reduces OA-associated pain and this manifests through increased activity during more intense activity during the treatment period relative to the placebo period. One common approach for the analyses of such data is to aggregate the observed accelerometer data within each subject and treatment condition and subsequently to use an ANOVA to compare treatment with control<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Alternatively, one could aggregate the data over a shorter time interval, e.g., a day, and model the aggregated process using methods for smooth longitudinal data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. However, such aggregation can obscure changes in behavior patterns which do not produce a large difference in mean activity. For example, an effective treatment that reduces pain may lead to higher quality rest (more zero activity readings), but also more high-intensity movement (more high activity readings), potentially producing no change in mean activity. High volume activity data has the potential to be a more sensitive outcome measure, but thus far, analysis of such complex, high-volume multidirectional effects on activity, that takes into account the wide variation in individual activity patterns, has not been developed.</p>
              <p id="Par4">We propose modeling the minute-by-minute accelerometer data using a hidden semi-Markov model. Such a model is scientifically appealing in that the hidden states can be viewed as corresponding to latent (unobserved) activities, e.g., running, walking, resting, etc., and state duration corresponds to the length of time a subject is engaged in a given activity. Latent state-space models are common in the analysis of mobility data measured using wearable computing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. In the context of treatment evaluation, hidden Markov models have also been used to model latent health states and subsequently conduct inference for activity patterns in terms of transitions among these states and activity patterns within each state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>; however, previous applications have considered relatively coarse time scales, e.g., daily or weekly measurements, and subsequently low data volume. In the current application, subject activity is measured every minute and as a result each subject has more than one-hundred thousand measurements during the observation period. Such high volume allows for flexible modeling and estimation of distinct parameters for each subject; this is important as activity patterns can vary widely across subjects.</p>
              <p id="Par5">In the current example of the spontaneous cat OA-pain model, more than 70% of the observations are zero and therefore we propose a zero-inflated hidden Poisson semi-Markov model with patient-specific intensities in each latent state. The proposed model is an extension of a zero-inflated Poisson hidden Markov model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> to the hidden semi-Markov model framework that allows for distinct state duration densities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>.

There are multiple prolonged intervals in which there is no movement. In total, more than 70% of the minute-by-minute activity counts are zero; furthermore, the non-zero counts are heavily right-skewed owing to infrequent but high-intensity activities. Thus, such cat accelerometer data are heavy-tailed with an excessive proportion of zeros.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Left: Sample daily accelerometer data for a typical cat in the study of the treatment effect of meloxicam, showing the crepuscular pattern of activity expected in cats.

In both panels, one can see that the overall mean activity count is higher under meloxicam than placebo, but only marginally. A total of 41 out of 58 cats have a numerically larger mean activity count in the meloxicam period than in the placebo period. However, there is large between-subject variability. The standard errors for the group mean activity count at each treatment period range from 16.7 to 18.1.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Plots of the mean activity count over each period for each subject separated by treatment group.

              <p id="Par9">We applied the proposed zero-inflated hidden semi-Markov model (detailed in the Methods section) to the longitudinal accelerometer data from this study of the treatment effect of meloxicam.

The covariates included in the model were: treatment status, weekend (yes/no), night (yes/no), sex, Body Condition Score (BCS), age, total OA score, and treatment sequence.</p>

There are significant effects (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) in latent states 4–6 suggesting that cats treated with meloxicam may have increased mean activity while engaged in more intensive activities (e.g., running, jumping, etc.).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par12">We proposed a zero-inflated Poisson hidden semi-Markov model for activity data captured by accelerometer readings in a naturally occurring model of OA-associated pain. The proposed model can be used to characterize the impact of treatment on activity including changes in activity duration, intensity, and frequency. In the context of OA-associated pain, understanding such impacts is critical to fully understanding the effects of treatment on patient mobility and therefore quality of life.</p>
              <p id="Par13">Our method presents a significant advance in the analysis of therapeutic efficacy using activity counts as compared to the original analysis in Gruen et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> as well as subsequent work in Gruen et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. In Gruen et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, the activity counts were averaged within each treatment period for each cat, and an ANOVA model was used to determine the effectiveness of meloxicam. Their analysis showed a non-significant increase (<italic>p</italic> = 0.31) in the activity counts among the cats that received meloxicam in the first treatment period. This may be due to the effect of data aggregation method, which can smooth away important effects and reduce statistical power. Gruen et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> aggregated the counts across days and then used functional data analysis methods to formally assess treatment effect. This method failed to identify a significant difference between normal and arthritic cats (<italic>p</italic> = 0.541) due to the same limitations discussed above.</p>
              <p id="Par14">In contrast, our proposed subject-specific method not only preserves the original data ‘as is’ but also accounts for the large between-subject variability. More importantly, our approach can analyze the conditional treatment effect in each activity state. Indeed, our model found that meloxicam significantly improves the mobility of cats in more intensive activities, while the activity patterns did not change in less intensive activities. Although an easy assumption is that the increase in more intense activities is beneficial, the clinical relevance of these findings is, at present, unknown.</p>
              <p id="Par15">Our approach is relevant to humans. Cats, like people, show patterns of activity, with large periods of relative or absolute inactivity. Cats are generally crepuscular—that is, they show phasic patterns of activity, as do humans. Such zero-inflated patterned activity is thus common to cats and humans, and so our approach is relevant to human activity data. As the approach does not need to know what activity is being performed, it negates the need for algorithms to detect specific activities.</p>
              <p id="Par16">Future work could support our approach by evaluating concurrent video capture of moving subjects to verify that as more intense activities are being performed, the relevant latent states change. Additionally, research is needed to define the clinical relevance of the changes we have detected using the zero-inflated hidden Poisson semi-Markov model.</p>
              <p id="Par17">Our refinement of the analysis of high-volume activity data in this naturally occurring model of pain provides a clinically relevant outcome measure that can be used in naturally occurring models osteoarthritis in companion animals to provide highly relevant data on the potential efficacy of putative drugs prior to Phase II and III efficacy studies in humans, thus improving the translational paradigm by optimizing the critical go/no-go decision prior to Phase II. Such sophisticated approaches to high-volume activity data have not been applied to humans and our approach also has relevance to the analysis of activity data in humans to better understand the impact of therapeutics in a more refined manner.</p>

The study was performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations. Full details of the study have been previously published<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> and pertinent methodological information is provided in Supplementary File <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>.</p>
              <p id="Par19">A total of 66 subjects were enrolled in the original study of which 58 had available accelerometer measurements from both arms of the cross-over design. Subjects were given placebo during the open label baseline period (Weeks 1 and 2). In the first blinded treatment period (Weeks 3, 4, and 5) half of the subjects were randomized to receive meloxicam and the remainder were randomized to receive placebo. At the end of the first blinded phase, subjects entered a three-week blinded washout (Weeks 6, 7, and 8) before switching treatments for the second blinded phase. All subjects wore an accelerometer (Actical) on their collar throughout the entire study, with the epoch set at 1 min, providing an activity count for every minute of the 11-week study for each subject.</p>

                <p id="Par23">The preceding model describes individual level accelerometer data as a function of evolving covariate and treatment information. The idea of using the framework of hidden Markov model to analyze physical activity data can also be seen in the recent work of Huang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> and van Kuppevelt et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. However, the cat accelerometer data we consider are much sparser than the human accelerometer data in their work, which motivates a zero-inflation component in our model. Moreover, we can include exogenous, time-varying variables like treatment period, night indicator, and weekend indicator in our model so as to explicitly address their effects on the activity patterns of cats. Our individual level model is a nontrivial extension of the zero-inflated Poisson hidden Markov model in the literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, which not only allows for distinct state duration densities but also incorporates covariates and treatment in both transition probabilities and latent state durations.</p>
