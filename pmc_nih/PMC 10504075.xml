                <p id="Par1">Elranatamab is a humanized B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA)-CD3 bispecific antibody. In the ongoing phase 2 MagnetisMM-3 trial, patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma received subcutaneous elranatamab once weekly after two step-up priming doses. After six cycles, persistent responders switched to biweekly dosing. Results from cohort A, which enrolled patients without prior BCMA-directed therapy (<italic>n</italic>â=â123) are reported. The primary endpoint of confirmed objective response rate (ORR) by blinded independent central review was met with an ORR of 61.0% (75/123); 35.0% â¥complete response. Fifty responders switched to biweekly dosing, and 40 (80.0%) improved or maintained their response for â¥6âmonths. With a median follow-up of 14.7âmonths, median duration of response, progression-free survival and overall survival (secondary endpoints) have not been reached. Fifteen-month rates were 71.5%, 50.9% and 56.7%, respectively. Common adverse events (any grade; grade 3â4) included infections (69.9%, 39.8%), cytokine release syndrome (57.7%, 0%), anemia (48.8%, 37.4%), and neutropenia (48.8%, 48.8%). With biweekly dosing, grade 3â4 adverse events decreased from 58.6% to 46.6%. Elranatamab induced deep and durable responses with a manageable safety profile. Switching to biweekly dosing may improve long-term safety without compromising efficacy.

              <p id="Par3">The introduction of immunomodulatory drugs, proteasome inhibitors and anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies has transformed the treatment landscape in multiple myeloma. The addition of these agents has substantially improved patient survival; however, outcomes for patients with disease progression after these agents remain poor with a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 4.6âmonths and median overall survival (OS) of 12.4âmonths with a standard of care therapy, highlighting an unmet medical need in the relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. In recent years, the development of T-cell-redirecting therapies has shown promise in this patient population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par4">B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA), a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, is highly expressed on malignant plasma cells, making it an ideal target for the treatment of multiple myeloma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. A number of BCMA-directed therapies, including belantamab mafodotin, idecabtagene vicleucel (ide-cel), ciltacabtagene autoleucel (cilta-cel) and teclistamab, have shown efficacy in clinical trials and are approved for the treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par5">Elranatamab (PF-06863135) is a humanized bispecific antibody that targets both BCMA (on myeloma cells) and CD3 (on T cells)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.

                <p id="Par7">MagnetisMM-3 is an ongoing, multicenter, open-label, single-arm, phase 2 study investigating the efficacy and safety of elranatamab in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Eligible patients were 18âyears of age or older with a prior diagnosis of multiple myeloma and measurable disease per International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria, adequate bone marrow (platelets â¥25âÃâ10<sup>9</sup>âl<sup>â1</sup>, absolute neutrophil count â¥1.0âÃâ10<sup>9</sup>âl<sup>â1</sup>, hemoglobin â¥8âgâdl<sup>â1</sup>), hepatic (total bilirubin â¤2Ã upper limit of normal (ULN; â¤3x ULN if documented Gilbertâs syndrome), aspartate aminotransferase â¤2.5Ã ULN and â¤2.5Ã ULN alanine aminotransferase) and renal (creatinine clearance â¥30âmlâmin<sup>â1</sup>) function, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status â¤2. Patients had to have disease refractory to at least one proteasome inhibitor, one immunomodulatory drug and one anti-CD38 antibody, and disease relapsed or refractory to their last antimyeloma regimen. Those in cohort A must not have received prior BCMA-directed therapy. From February 9, 2021, to January 7, 2022, a total of 123 patients were enrolled in cohort A and dosed at 47 study sites in ten countries (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p><bold>CONSORT diagram of MagnetisMM-3.</bold></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41591_2023_2528_Fig1_HTML" id="d33e671"/></fig></p>

Secondary endpoints included ORR by BICR baseline extramedullary disease status, ORR by investigator, complete response (CR) rate (defined as CR or better), time to response (TTR), duration of response (DOR), duration of CR or better (DOCR), minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity rate, PFS, OS, safety, pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity. Adverse events (AEs) and laboratory abnormalities were graded by National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) v5.0, and CRS and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) were graded according to the American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy criteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Patients received subcutaneous elranatamab 76âmg once weekly in 28-d cycles after two step-up priming doses of 12âmg and 32âmg given on day 1 and day 4 of cycle 1. After six cycles, persistent responders (partial response (PR) or better lasting at least 2âmonths) switched to a dosing interval of once every 2âweeks (Q2W).</p>
                <p id="Par9">Among the 123 patients who received elranatamab, the median age was 68âyears (range: 36â89âyears), 55.3% were male, 58.5% were White, 13.0% were Asian and 7.3% were Black/African American (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). At baseline, 63.4% of patients had an ECOG performance status of 1 or 2, 15.4% had stage III disease according to the Revised International Staging System (R-ISS) and 25.2% had high-risk cytogenetics, defined as t(4;14), t(14;16) or del(17p).

Results in this study are also consistent with those observed with bispecific antibodies against other targets such as talquetamab, a bispecific antibody against CD3 and G-protein-coupled receptor, class C, group 5, member D (GPRC5D) (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>). A comprehensive analysis with extended follow-up including updated DOR, PFS and OS estimates will be conducted and reported in a future publication.</p>
              <p id="Par25">The most common TEAEs reported in MagnetisMM-3 were CRS, hematologic-related events and infections. Patients who switched to Q2W dosing experienced fewer grade 3 or 4 TEAEs compared to the same time period before switching. However, the interpretation of these findings is limited as no QW comparator group is available to understand the change in AE incidence over time.</p>
              <p id="Par26">With premedication and a two step-up priming dose regimen during the first week of treatment, CRS occurred in 56.3% of patients. All CRS events were grade 1 or 2, with no events grade 3 or higher. CRS events generally occurred early in treatment, with 90.6% limited to the step-up doses. Only one patient had a CRS event after the fourth or later dose, and few patients had more than one CRS event. ICANS was infrequent (occurring in 3.4% of patients) and limited to grade 1 or 2 events. Although the study protocol required hospitalization for the step-up priming doses (48âh after the first dose, 24âh after the second dose), the predictable and manageable profile of CRS and ICANS supports the potential for outpatient administration.</p>
              <p id="Par27">Although the toxicities associated with BCMA-targeted T-cell-redirecting therapies are similar due to their mechanisms of action, the frequency and severity may vary between agents. CRS is the most frequent AE observed with T-cell-redirecting therapies; however, the incidence and severity are lower with bispecific antibodies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. While cross-trial comparisons should be interpreted with caution, elranatamab administered with a two step-up priming regimen and premedication showed a lower CRS incidence (56.3% versus 72.1%), as well as fewer repeat CRS events (15.1% versus 33.3%) compared to teclistamab. Higher rates of CRS (85â95%, including grade 5 events) have been reported in studies of BCMA-directed CAR T cells. Similarly, neurotoxicity including ICANS has been observed more frequently with BCMA-directed CAR T cells than with bispecific antibodies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par28">Peripheral neuropathy is a common complication of multiple myeloma and its treatment, especially with early-generation proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulatory drugs such as bortezomib and thalidomide, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. More recently, neuropathy has also been observed with BCMA-targeted T-cell-redirecting therapies such as CAR T cells and bispecific antibodies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Although cross-study comparisons are limited due to the different definitions of neuropathy across studies, the incidences seem comparable across T-cell-redirecting therapies with rates of motor dysfunction and sensory neuropathy of 16% and 15%, respectively, with teclistamab, 11% and 17% of motor dysfunction and neuropathy peripheral, respectively, with ide-cel and 16% motor dysfunction with cilta-cel. In this study, the incidence of motor dysfunction and sensory neuropathy was 17.1% and 13.8%, respectively. No Parkinson-like or fatal neuropathy events have been observed with elranatamab.</p>
              <p id="Par29">Hematologic AEs were frequent, with the most common AEs being neutropenia and anemia. In comparison to other BCMA-targeted T-cell-redirecting therapies, the rate of hematologic AEs with elranatamab was similar or lower after a similar follow-up<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. The incidence of grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia was similar to that observed with teclistamab despite the lower inclusion threshold (â¥25âÃâ10<sup>9</sup>âl<sup>â1</sup>) in this study. Hematologic AEs were generally manageable with dose reductions and/or interruptions, as well as with supportive therapies. The majority of patients were able to continue treatment with elranatamab.</p>
              <p id="Par30">BCMA-targeted T-cell-redirecting therapies have been linked to a heightened susceptibility to infectious complications due to their mechanism of action<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Inhibiting BCMA signaling, which is critical for the survival and proliferation of plasma cells, may worsen the pre-existing myeloma-induced immunosupression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. In this study, among patients with quantitative immunoglobulin data, almost all had immune paresis at baseline and a substantial proportion had IgGâ&lt;â400âmgâdl<sup>â1</sup> while on treatment. The most frequently reported infectious disease was COVID-19, coinciding with the ongoing pandemic during the study period. Following emerging data on the infection risk profile observed during the conduct of this study and reported with other BCMA T-cell-redirecting therapies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> recommendations for infection prophylaxis were added to this study as a protocol amendment in July 2022. Before this protocol amendment, antimicrobial prophylaxis was used at the investigatorâs discretion. Close monitoring to ensure early recognition of infection, as well as the institution of antimicrobial prophylaxis and immunoglobulin replacement therapy, should be a priority for patients with multiple myeloma receiving BCMA-targeted T-cell-redirecting therapies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Recently published consensus guidelines provide additional information on how to manage infections in patients with multiple myeloma receiving BCMA-directed therapies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. T-cell-redirecting therapies against other targets (for example, GPRC5D) are also under development. While CRS and ICANS are associated with T-cell activation and occur irrespective of the target, other target-specific toxicities vary across treatments. For example, anti-GPRC5D-targeted agents have been associated with specific toxicities such as dysgeusia and skin and nail toxicity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. The selection of targeted therapies for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma following treatment with immunomodulatory drugs, proteasome inhibitors and anti-CD38 antibodies will depend on disease characteristics and patient-related factors such as comorbidities and toxicities with prior treatments.</p>
              <p id="Par31">The interpretation of the results in this study is limited by its single-arm design and lack of direct comparison with other treatment options, as well as by the small sample size in some subgroups. Longer-term follow-up is required to confirm benefits in DOR, PFS and OS. However, current results support further investigation of elranatamab. An ongoing open-label, randomized phase 3 study is evaluating elranatamab monotherapy versus elranatamabâ+âdaratumumab versus standard of care daratumumabâ+âpomalidomideâ+âdexamethasone in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05020236">NCT05020236</ext-link>).</p>
              <p id="Par32">In this phase 2 study in heavily pretreated patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, elranatamab demonstrated a high rate of deep and durable responses, including in patients achieving â¥CR, with a manageable safety profile. Administration of a two step-up priming dose regimen successfully mitigated the rate and severity of CRS with a predictable profile supporting the potential for outpatient administration. Although additional follow-up is needed, maintenance or deepening of response was observed with elranatamab following the switch to a biweekly schedule. Biweekly administration may provide greater patient convenience with potentially less toxicity. Elranatamab is also a readily accessible, off-the-shelf therapy, which provides an option for patients unable to access CAR T-cell therapy. These results support the continued development of elranatamab as monotherapy and its further investigation in combination with standard or new therapies for patients with multiple myeloma.</p>

Additional secondary endpoints were OS, safety, pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity. The MRD negativity rate was defined as the proportion of patients with â¥CR and with negative MRD from the date of the first dose until confirmed PD, death or start of new anticancer therapy, whichever occurred first. DOR (for patients with confirmed objective responses) was the time from the first confirmed response to confirmed PD or death due to any cause, whichever was earlier, or censoring. PFS was the time from the first dose to confirmed PD or death due to any cause, whichever was earlier, or censoring. For DOR and PFS, patients were censored at the last valid assessment before (1) initiation of new anticancer or (2) two consecutive missed efficacy assessments before an event. OS was the time from the first dose to death due to any cause or censoring. Patients not known to have died were censored at the last contact date. A prespecified sensitivity analysis evaluated response by a computerized algorithm. Responses were derived per IMWG based on the local laboratory and bone marrow data and the individual lesion data provided by the investigator. The impact of switching from QW to Q2W dosing on efficacy was assessed in responders per BICR who had switched to Q2W dosing â¥6âmonths before the data cutoff date. Patients who were in response by investigator but not by BICR at the time of the switch or who had &lt;6âmonths of possible follow-up from the time of the switch to the time of data cutoff were excluded.

As specified in the protocol and statistical analysis plan, if the null hypothesis for ORR by BICR (defined as â¤30% by IMWG) was rejected for cohort A, the key secondary endpoint of ORR by BICR for those without EMD at baseline was tested in a hierarchical fashion using the gatekeeping procedure that the ORR is â¤38% with a one-sided significance level of 0.025. If the null hypothesis for ORR by BICR for those without EMD at baseline was rejected for cohort A, the key secondary endpoint of ORR by BICR for those with EMD at baseline was tested in a hierarchical fashion using the gatekeeping procedure that the ORR is â¤12% with a one-sided significance level of 0.025. No other adjustments for multiple comparisons were made. Descriptive statistics were used for efficacy and safety outcomes unless otherwise stated. Exact two-sided 95% CIs were included for response endpoints. Time-to-event endpointsâexcept TTRâwere summarized using the KaplanâMeier method.
