                  <p>Young survivors of cancer are at increased risk for cancers that are related to human papillomavirus (HPV), primarily caused by oncogenic HPV types 16 and 18. We aimed to examine the immunogenicity and safety of the three-dose series of HPV vaccine in young survivors of cancer.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>We conducted an investigator-initiated, phase 2, single-arm, open-label, non-inferiority trial at five National Cancer Institute-designated comprehensive cancer centres in the USA. Eligible participants were survivors of cancer who were HPV vaccine-naive, were aged 9–26 years, in remission, and had completed cancer therapy between 1 and 5 years previously. Participants received three intramuscular doses of either quadrivalent HPV vaccine (HPV4; enrolments on or before March 1, 2016) or nonavalent HPV vaccine (HPV9; enrolments after March 1, 2016) over 6 months (on day 1, at month 2, and at month 6). We also obtained data from published clinical trials assessing safety and immunogenicity of HPV4 and HPV9 in 9–26-year-olds from the general population, as a comparator group. The primary endpoint was antibody response against HPV types 16 and 18 at month 7 in the per-protocol population. A response was deemed non-inferior if the lower bound of the multiplicity-adjusted 95% CI was greater than 0·5 for the ratio of anti-HPV-16 and anti-HPV-18 geometric mean titres (GMTs) in survivors of cancer versus the general population. Responses were examined separately in male and female participants by age group (ie, 9–15 years and 16–26 years). Safety was assessed in all participants who received at least one vaccine dose and for whom safety data were available. This study is registered with <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov" id="interrefs10">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="ClinicalTrials.gov" xlink:href="NCT01492582" id="interrefs20">NCT01492582</ext-link>. This trial is now completed.</p>

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>Between Feb 18, 2013, and June 22, 2018, we enrolled 453 survivors of cancer, of whom 436 received one or more vaccine doses: 203 (47%) participants had survived leukaemia, 185 (42%) were female, and 280 (64%) were non-Hispanic white. Mean age at first dose was 15·6 years (SD 4·6). 378 (83%) of 453 participants had evaluable immunogenicity data; main reasons for exclusion from per-protocol analysis were to loss to follow-up, patient reasons, and medical reasons. Data were also obtained from 26 486 general population controls. The ratio of mean GMT for anti-HPV types 16 and 18 in survivors of cancer versus the general population was more than 1 for all subgroups (ie, aged 9–15 years, aged 16–26 years, male, and female groups) in both vaccine cohorts (ranging from 1·64 [95% CI 1·12–2·18] for anti-HPV type 16 in female participants aged 9–15 years who received HPV9, to 4·77 [2·48–7·18] for anti-HPV type 18 in male participants aged 16–26 years who received HPV4). Non-inferiority criteria were met within each age and sex subgroup, except against HPV type 18 in female participants aged 16–26 years receiving HPV9 (4·30 [0·00–9·05]). Adverse events were reported by 237 (54%) of 435 participants; injection site pain was most common (174 [40%] participants). One serious adverse event (ie, erythema nodosum) was possibly related to vaccine (HPV9; 16–26 year female cohort).</p>

                    <bold>Evidence before this study</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para40">Before starting this study, we searched PubMed for articles published between Jan 1, 2006 (ie, the year that the quadrivalent human papillomavirus [HPV] vaccine was first licensed in the USA), and July 19, 2012 (ie, initiation date of this study), with the terms “HPV vaccine” AND “clinical trial.” Included studies were those done in humans aged 9–26 years. No clinical trials were identified that aimed to understand the immunogenicity and safety of the HPV vaccine in young male and female survivors of cancer aged 9–26 years receiving conventional therapy or haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Repeating this search through to May 3, 2021, also failed to yield any trials that were aimed at our targeted population; however, we identified one clinical trial that assessed immune response to HPV vaccination in 44 female survivors of cancer (aged 18–50 years) who received allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation.</p>

                    <bold>Added value of this study</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para60">To our knowledge, we report results of the first phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the HPV vaccine in survivors of cancer aged 9–26 years who completed cancer treatment 1–5 years previously. In this non-inferiority trial, involving 436 young survivors of cancer, we noted that antibody responses against HPV types 16 and 18 were non-inferior to general population comparisons, except against HPV type 18 in older females (ie, aged 16–26 years) receiving nonavalent vaccine. The safety profile in survivors of cancer was similar to that in the general population.</p>

                    <bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para80">Our findings provide evidence for using the three-dose HPV vaccine series in young survivors of cancer, a population at increased risk for neoplasms related to HPV. Given that uptake of HPV vaccine among young survivors of cancer is notably lower than in the general population, these findings should remove hesitancy on the part of health-care providers in incorporating HPV vaccination into routine oncological follow-up care, with the ultimate goal of preventing subsequent neoplasms related to HPV in young survivors of cancer. These data support the further study of health-care provider-focused interventions to increase HPV vaccine uptake among young cancer survivors; one such intervention is currently being assessed in a cluster randomised trial of paediatric oncology practices (<ext-link ext-link-type="ClinicalTrials.gov" xlink:href="NCT04469569" id="interrefs30">NCT04469569</ext-link>).</p>

              <p id="para90">Therapy for childhood cancer can affect both innate and adaptive immunity, yet immune recovery following completion of treatment is understudied. Delays in immune reconstitution can go unrecognised, and the few existing small studies suggest that seroprotection against vaccine-preventable illnesses can be affected for months or years following cancer treatment.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> Our first aim of this study was to examine the determinants of HPV vaccine non-initiation using a cross-sectional survey, and we found that rates of HPV vaccine uptake among young survivors of cancer are significantly lower than in the general population.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> HPV vaccine non-initiation among young survivors of cancer is associated with absence of health-care provider recommendation for the vaccine, which might stem from a paucity of evidence regarding vaccine immunogenicity and safety in survivors.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref>
</p>
              <p id="para100">Our second aim is to address this knowledge gap by examining immunogenicity and safety of the three-dose series of HPV vaccine in young survivors of cancer with a non-inferiority trial design; non-inferiority trials establish immunogenicity when efficacy trials are not feasible.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> We hypothesised that HPV vaccine would be safe among the survivors but that immunogenicity would be heterogeneous, with subpopulations who received the most intense cancer therapy showing lower immunogenicity than other cancer survivors.</p>

                <p id="para110">This investigator-initiated, single-arm, open-label, phase 2, non-inferiority trial was conducted at five National Cancer Institute-designated comprehensive cancer centres in the USA. We enrolled survivors of cancer with no previous history of HPV vaccination by self-report or report by parent or caregiver, who were aged 9–26 years, in remission, and had completed treatment for cancer 1–5 years previously. Participants were included if they spoke English or Spanish and had medical clearance from their treating clinician for study participation. Participants had to agree to return to a participating institution for three vaccine injections and had to provide informed consent or assent for participation. Participants were excluded if they had an allergy to any component of the vaccine, including yeast and aluminium; thrombocytopenia or coagulation disorder that would contraindicate intramuscular injection; transfusion of blood products or intravenous immunoglobulin within 3 months of study entry; were pregnant at time of enrolment; or were of childbearing potential and unwilling to avoid pregnancy during the vaccine phase of study.</p>
                <p id="para120">We stratified enrolment by age (9–15 years; 16–26 years) and biological sex (female; male). The study was initially designed to evaluate quadrivalent HPV vaccine (ie, HPV4). However, nonavalent HPV vaccine (ie, HPV9) was licensed in the USA<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> during HPV4 study enrolment, resulting in a protocol amendment adding evaluation of HPV9 on March 2, 2016.

Serious adverse events—defined as death, life-threatening conditions, unplanned admission to hospital for longer than 24 h, persistent or substantial disability, second cancer, or other medical event that was deemed by the investigator to jeopardise participant health—were reported in real time until month 24. Additionally, active queries regarding serious adverse events were conducted at study visits at month 7 and month 24.

Additional outcomes were clinical or host factors influencing immunogenicity and safety of HPV4 and HPV9 in young survivors of cancer. Exploratory outcomes included antibody response against the additional vaccine-associated HPV types for which antigens were included in the vaccine at study month 7 and seropositivity rates at month 7 for each vaccine-associated HPV type.

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p id="para190">This study was originally designed to evaluate immunogenicity and safety of HPV4, with targeted enrolment of 353 participants, estimated to yield 312 evaluable patients (ie, per-protocol sample). A sample of 312 patients was calculated to provide 80% power at an overall one-sided type I error of 0·025 (or 0·003125 for each of eight tests planned for anti-HPV types 16 and 18) to show non-inferiority with respect to anti-HPV type 16 or 18 response in survivors of cancer versus the general population; this sample size calculation was based on the mean GMT and SD that were reported in previous trials of male and female participants aged 9–15 years and 16–26 years from the general population,<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> assuming a non-inferiority margin of 0·5 of the GMT of the comparisons.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> However, with impending withdrawal of HPV4 from the US marketplace, the study was amended to examine the same endpoints with the newly licensed HPV9. Due to budgetary limitations, planned enrolment in the HPV9 cohort was restricted to 200 additional patients, estimated to yield 176 evaluable patients. The HPV4 cohort was closed to enrolment on March 1, 2016; at that time, 265 (75%) of the planned 353 patients had enrolled. The HPV9 cohort opened for enrolment on March 2, 2016, and (due to operating constraints) closed on June 22, 2018, with 182 (91%) of the planned 200 patients enrolled.</p>

Immunogenicity and seropositivity analyses were conducted in the per-protocol population (ie, survivors of cancer who were seronegative to the HPV type of interest on day 1, had received all three vaccine doses, and had blood drawn at month 7 within protocol-specified timeframes). Safety analyses were conducted in the intention-to-treat population (ie, survivors of cancer who received at least one vaccine dose and for whom there were safety data). All general population comparison studies also used the per-protocol population for immunogenicity and seropositivity analyses and the intention-to-treat population for safety analyses.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="para340">In this first report of immunogenicity and safety of the three-dose series of HPV4 and HPV9 in young survivors of cancer, we noted that 1 month after vaccine series completion, antibody responses against HPV types 16 and 18 in survivors of cancer were similar to those reported in several previously published clinical trials in the general population. The non-inferiority criterion was met for anti-HPV types 16 and 18 for all survivor subgroups, except for type 18 in female participants aged 16–26 years who received HPV9. Allogeneic HSCT recipients were more likely to have low immunogenicity than were cancer survivors who had not undergone allogeneic HSCT; these increased odds were driven primarily by allogeneic HSCT survivors who received HPV4.</p>
              <p id="para350">Although it is reassuring that antibody responses in most survivors of cancer were similar to or higher than those seen in the general population comparisons, we noted that a third of allogeneic HSCT survivors met the criteria for low immunogenicity to HPV type 16 or 18 (ie, less than half of the mean GMT of the corresponding group in the general population). Among allogeneic HSCT survivors in our study, receipt of HPV4 was associated with low immunogenicity. A study examining response to HPV4 among 44 adult women (median age 33 years) who had undergone allogeneic HSCT reported that 86% (38 of 44) developed antibody responses to HPV types 16 and 18, compared with 100% of 20 healthy volunteers; women receiving immunosuppressive therapy at the time of vaccination were less likely to develop antibody responses than women who were not receiving this therapy (18 [78%] of 23 <italic>vs</italic> 20 [95%] of 21).<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> Notably, compared with HPV4, HPV9 contains higher doses of HPV type 16 (40 μg <italic>vs</italic> 60 μg) and 18 (20 μg <italic>vs</italic> 40 μg) antigens and higher doses of adjuvant (225 μg <italic>vs</italic> 500 μg).<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> Increasing vaccine dose or number of doses is a strategy that is commonly used to boost immune response in populations with low immunogenicity to vaccines.<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> The increased dose of antigen and adjuvant contained in HPV9 might have been sufficient to overcome the low immunogenicity that is associated with receipt of HPV4 among the allogeneic HSCT recipients in our study. Furthermore, despite our finding that allogeneic transplantation was associated with low immunogenicity (almost exclusively among HPV4 recipients), all patients had seroconversion (ie, a marker that is commonly associated with adequate vaccine immunogenicity) to HPV type 16, and all but two patients (both of whom received HPV4) had seroconversion to HPV type 18. Thus, it seems reasonable to offer allogeneic HSCT survivors HPV9.</p>
              <p id="para360">In the general population, age at vaccination is inversely proportional to vaccine-induced antibody response,<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> and the three-dose series of HPV vaccine is recommended for people aged 15 years and older in the healthy general population.<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> However, in younger (ie, aged 9–14 years) boys and girls in the general population, non-inferior antibody responses have been shown after a two-dose series (given at months 0 and 6–12), as compared with young adult (ie 16–26-year old) women, in whom efficacy has been shown after three doses.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> On the basis of these data from general population studies, a two-dose series of HPV vaccine is recommended for healthy young people who are aged 9–14 years.<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> Importantly, in our study we noted that, among young (ie, aged 9–15 years) survivors, immunogenicity of the HPV4 and HPV9 three-dose series was non-inferior to general population comparisons, and 100% seroconversion was reached for all HPV types, suggesting an opportunity for future research focusing on immunogenicity of the two-dose vaccine series in young survivors of cancer aged 9–14 years.</p>
              <p id="para370">In older female participants (ie, aged 16–26 years) who received HPV9, the GMT ratio for HPV type 18 in survivors compared with the general population was 4·30; however, the non-inferiority response criterion was not met. This criterion was probably not met due to a small sample size and wide range of GMTs in this subgroup. Nevertheless, seroconversion to HPV type 18 was reached in 100% of older females who received HPV9. Although seroconversion analyses were exploratory due to insufficient power, the high seroconversion rates across all HPV types were reassuring. An additional exploratory sub-aim of this study that will evaluate the persistence of antibody response at 2 years post-vaccine initiation, and identify clinical and host factors influencing response persistence, will be reported separately.</p>
              <p id="para380">The HPV vaccine series were safe and generally well tolerated in survivors of cancer, with lower prevalence of adverse events at the injection site, similar rates of fever, and higher rates of nausea and fatigue than reported in several previously published clinical trials in the general population. Survivors’ previous cancer therapy, which often involves repeated injections and medical procedures, might have contributed to their lower ratings of vaccine-related pain at the injection site than by the general population. Persistent symptoms after therapy, such as nausea and fatigue, have been reported in survivors of cancer<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> and might have contributed to the higher proportion of survivors reporting nausea and fatigue after HPV9 than in general population peers. Similar to general population reports, a larger proportion of survivors receiving HPV9 reported adverse events at the injection site than survivors receiving HPV4, which might be attributable to higher concentrations of antigen and adjuvant in HPV9.<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref>

              <p id="para390">This work should be considered in the context of its limitations. First, we were unable to conduct a randomised, placebo-controlled trial due to ethical concerns of withholding a vaccine with known efficacy in the general population; thus, the comparison group data are from the historical participants in vaccine licensing trials.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Second, study participation was restricted to survivors who had completed cancer treatment within the previous 1–5 years, decreasing generalisability. Third, patients who enrolled were less likely to be non-Hispanic white and more likely to have a diagnosis of leukaemia than patients who refused to enrol. Fourth, due to licensing of HPV9 and withdrawal of HPV4 from the US marketplace during our trial, we were unable to reach the originally planned targeted enrolment for the HPV4 cohort, increasing type II error; however, CIs are provided to show the variability. Fifth, given the few patients with allogeneic HSCT in the cohort (ie, the main subgroup with low immunogenicity), findings from the low immunogenicity analysis should be interpreted with caution. Sixth, at the time of this report, we have not yet evaluated persistence of antibody response in this cohort. Finally, vaccine efficacy was not an endpoint in this study. The HPV vaccine is highly efficacious against acquisition of infection and development of premalignant and malignant lesions related to HPV in HPV-naive women and men in the general population.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Given that the protective mechanism afforded by HPV vaccine is via neutralising antibody production, and that antibody responses in survivors of cancer were similar to those seen in the general population, similar vaccine efficacy in survivors of cancer is probable.</p>
              <p id="para400">Our study had many strengths, including enrolment of a large, diverse sample across the spectrum of diagnoses and treatments commonly seen in young survivors of cancer and excellent retention rates. Additionally, introduction of HPV9 provided an opportunity to evaluate immunogenicity and safety of HPV9 in survivors of cancer shortly after its implementation in the general population.</p>
              <p id="para410">We noted that, among young survivors of cancer 1–5 years after completion of cancer treatment, the three-dose series of HPV vaccine was safe and well tolerated, and immunogenicity was similar to that in the general population, providing evidence for its use in survivors of cancer. Additionally, since the primary factor that was associated with low immunogenicity among allogeneic HSCT survivors was HPV4, clinicians can be reassured that low immunogenicity is unlikely among survivors who receive HPV9. As we have previously shown in part 1 of this study,<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> uptake of HPV vaccine among young survivors of cancer is significantly lower than that in the general population. Thus, findings regarding safety and immunogenicity of the three-dose HPV vaccine from this trial should remove any hesitancy on the part of health-care providers in incorporating HPV vaccination into routine oncological follow-up care, with the ultimate goal of preventing subsequent neoplasms related to HPV in survivors of cancer.</p>
