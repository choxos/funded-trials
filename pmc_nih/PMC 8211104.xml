              <abstract>
                <p>The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified type 2 diabetes (T2DM) as a neglected, important, and re-emerging risk factor for tuberculosis (TB), especially in low and middle-income countries where TB is endemic. In this clinical trial study, oral liposomal glutathione supplementation (L-GSH) or placebo was given to individuals with T2DM to investigate the therapeutic effects of L-GSH supplementation. We report that L-GSH supplementation for 3 months in people with T2DM was able to reduce the levels of oxidative stress in all blood components and prevent depletion of glutathione (GSH) in this population known to be GSH deficient. Additionally, L-GSH supplementation significantly reduced the burden of intracellular mycobacteria within <italic>in vitro</italic> granulomas generated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of T2DM subjects. L-GSH supplementation also increased the levels of Th1-associated cytokines, IFN-Î³, TNF-Î±, and IL-2 and decreased levels of IL-6 and IL-10. In conclusion our studies indicate that oral L-GSH supplementation in individuals with T2DM for three months was able to maintain the levels of GSH, reduce oxidative stress, and diminish mycobacterial burden within <italic>in vitro</italic> generated granulomas of diabetics. L-GSH supplementation for 3 months in diabetics was also able to modulate the levels of various cytokines. </p>

From the estimated 1.7 billion people infected with <italic>M. tb</italic>, only a small portion of about 5-10% develop the disease in their lifetime (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Geneva: World Health Organization, 2019</xref>). Tuberculosis remains a public health threat despite an average decline in TB incidence because of the rise in comorbidities involving conditions such as diabetes and HIV. Several studies, including a systematic review of 13 observational studies, showed that T2DM was associated with increased TB risk, regardless of the study design or population (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Jeon and Murray, 2008</xref>). Individuals with T2DM, characterized by hyperglycemia, show an increase in ROS, proinflammatory cytokines, and an altered GSH synthesis and metabolism. Several studies have confirmed that GSH concentration is compromised in erythrocytes and plasma of people with diabetes along with the decreased levels of enzymes that participate in GSH biosynthesis (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Yoshida etÂ al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Lagman etÂ al., 2015</xref>). Intracellular redox homeostasis is characterized by the ratio of oxidized glutathione (GSSG) to reduced glutathione (GSH), with reduced GSH being the active antioxidant. On the other hand, GSSG is non-functional and quickly converted back to GSH by glutathione reductase (GSR). Under non-pathological conditions, the ratio of GSSG to GSH is 1%. The depletion of GSH, combined with ROS overproduction in people with diabetes, has resulted in an altered immunity that has contributed to the increasing prevalence of TB-T2DM co-infection and poorer outcomes for people with diabetes (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Restrepo, 2016</xref>). The probability of developing an active TB disease increases with risk factors such as HIV, diabetes, undernutrition, smoking, and alcohol consumption (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Geneva: World Health Organization, 2019</xref>). People living with HIV are at 19 times higher risk for developing active TB than the general global population, while individuals with T2DM have three times the risk (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Restrepo, 2016</xref>).</p>
              <p>The standard therapeutic regimen to treat active TB recommended by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is a multidrug regimen of antibiotics taken from 6 to 9 months known as DOTS (Directly Observed Treatment, Short-course) (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Centers for Disease Control and Preventation, 2016</xref>). DOTS comprise of four antibiotics: isoniazid (INH), rifampicin (RIF), pyrazinamide (PZA), and ethambutol (ETH) for two months (initial phase) followed by INH, and RIF for four months (continuation phase) (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Lagman etÂ al., 2015</xref>). There are many adverse effects, ranging from serious ones like hepatotoxicity to minor ones like peripheral neuropathy, joint, pain, visual impairment, nausea, and vomiting (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">El-Sadr etÂ al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Ramappa and Aithal, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Sharma etÂ al., 2013</xref>). Due to the lengthy duration of treatment and adverse side effects, there is a high drop-out rate from DOTS therapy. Thus, non-compliance is directly contributing to the development of multidrug and extensively drug resistance (MDR/XDR)-TB. Multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant TB are already emerging worldwide and has become a major public health threat (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Singh and Subbian, 2018</xref>).</p>
              <p>One approach to combat <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tb</italic> infection is to identify host-directed therapies (HDT) or strategies that can modulate specific host immune pathways for more effective killing of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tb.</italic> HDT for <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tb</italic> aims to augment an individualsâ immune response or metabolism to optimize the use of antibiotics for better clearance of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tb</italic> (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Singh and Subbian, 2018</xref>).</p>
              <p>A potential adjunct therapy is glutathione (GSH). GSH is a tripeptide synthesized in the cell cytosol from the amino acids precursors: glutamate, cysteine, and glycine, by two ATP-requiring enzymes: glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCL) and GSH synthetase (GSS). First, glutamate is coupled to cysteine by GCL. Second, the Î³-glutamylcysteine product is coupled to glycine <italic>via</italic> GSH synthetase (GSS) to produce GSH or reduced GSH (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Teskey etÂ al., 2018a</xref>). GSH has an active thiol group present on the cysteine residue and functions by directly detoxifying reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) or indirectly <italic>via</italic> GSH-dependent peroxidase-catalyzed reactions (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Cooper etÂ al., 2011</xref>). GSH is also required for other critical cell processes, including cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Ballatori etÂ al., 2009</xref>).</p>
              <p>T2DM is a chronic metabolic disease characterized by hyperglycemia, prolonged elevated levels of glucose, and insulin resistance. T2DM and hyperglycemia are also associated with oxidative stress from the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and decreased efficiency of scavengers systems (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Collier etÂ al., 1990</xref>; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Powell etÂ al., 2004</xref>). Oxidative stress and hyperglycemia have been shown to alter GSH synthesis and metabolism in cases of diabetes (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Dave and Kalia, 2007</xref>).</p>
              <p>Furthermore, our lab has previously shown that individuals with T2DM have lowered levels of GSH due to decreased levels of both GCL and GSS protein compared to healthy subjects (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Lagman etÂ al., 2015</xref>). In the same study, increased levels of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-Î²), a cytokine known to reduce the expression of GCL, were observed in plasma samples from T2DM subjects when compared to the healthy group. These lowered levels of GSH and the GSH metabolism enzymes in T2DM individuals led to increased susceptibility to an <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tb</italic> infection (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Lagman etÂ al., 2015</xref>). Our lab has also shown that GSH deficiency is correlated with increased levels of free radicals and intracellular <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tb</italic> viability (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Venketaraman etÂ al., 2008</xref>). Additionally, our lab has found that GSH has direct antimycobacterial activity, thus functioning as an effector molecule in the innate defense against <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tb</italic> (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Venketaraman etÂ al., 2005</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic> restoration of GSH with the glutathione precursor: N-Acetyl Cysteine (NAC), combined with antibiotics, INH and RIF, resulted in bolstering cytokine modulation and complete clearance of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tb</italic> infection in granulomas generated from PBMCs from healthy subjects (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Teskey etÂ al., 2018b</xref>). Moreover, <italic>in vitro</italic> GSH supplementation in macrophages isolated from individuals with T2DM resulted in improved control of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tb</italic> infection (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Teskey etÂ al., 2018b</xref>).Â We therefore determined if oral supplementation with liposomal glutathione (L-GSH) for three months (12 weeks) in individuals with T2DM will reduce oxidative stress and enhance antimycobacterial responses against <italic>in vitro M. tb</italic> or <italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG infections, alongside antibiotics.</p>

                <title>Study Design and Intervention</title>
                <p>This study was a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trial conducted at the Western University of Health Sciences. This study was approved by Western University of Health Sciences Institutional Review Board (IRB); protocol #FB17/IRB/031. All participants gave written informed consent before enrollment into the study. The experimental group received oral liposomal glutathione (L-GSH) for three months and while the placebo group received the oral empty liposomes for three months. Each subject in both groups took 1.5 teaspoons of oral liposomal glutathione or empty liposomes twice a day (morning and evening), for a total of 3 teaspoons daily (15Â ml or 1260 mg of L-GSH). Your Energy Systems manufactured the oral L-GSH supplement as ReadiSorbâ¢ LRG, a dietary supplement supplying reduced form of GSH in liposomes suspended in liquid. The same company manufactured the placebo treatment with the same materials, but with empty liposomes. All the components in ReadiSorbâ¢ LRG are natural and considered GRAS (Generally Recognized as Safe) by the FDA. No toxicity in children using LRG daily for two months was documented (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Kern etÂ al., 2011</xref>). Previous studies also documented no toxicity in healthy and HIV-positive subjects using the same LRG daily for three months with the same dose in this study (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Ly etÂ al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Valdivia etÂ al., 2017</xref>).

                <p>Patients were recruited from the on-campus clinic, the Patient Care Center (PCC) of Western University of Health Sciences, from October 2018 until the target sample size was reached for both the experimental and placebo-controlled arm. Enrolled subjects were between the ages of 18-65 years old, positive for T2DM with glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels between 7-13%. Subjects enrolled were also negative for HIV and had no history of latent tuberculosis infection or liver function abnormalities. Past infections with hepatitis and frequent alcohol abuse could impair liver function and independently cause depletion of GSH levels (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Teskey etÂ al., 2018b</xref>). Antibodies against HIV were tested in all groups to confirm that all participants were negative for HIV through a pre-screening that included a comprehensive metabolic panel, HbA1c levels, hepatitis B surface antigen, and pregnancy test (if applicable). Exclusion criteria included an HIV-positive test result or abnormal liver function due to chronic viral hepatitis or alcohol abuse. The AUDIT questionnaire (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test) was given to determine if there was alcohol abuse. AUDIT questionnaire scores &gt;8 indicated hazardous alcohol use and excluded from the study (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Saunders etÂ al., 1993</xref>). The exclusion criteria enabled enrollment of participants without liver abnormalities to provide a better association between T2DM, decreased GSH levels, and increased susceptibility to mycobacterial infections.Â During the pre-screening appointment, the clinician also took vital measurements, performed a physical exam, symptom, and medication review. After this initial pre-screening visit and cleared for enrollment, each subject met with the same clinician for a total of three more in-person visits: Visit #1 (Baseline), Visit #2 (Midway point), Visit #3 (Post-Treatment). 50Â ml of venous blood was drawn and collected from subjects during the Pre-screening, Visit #1, and Visit #3, but not during the Visit #2 (midway-point). The blood collected was used for <italic>in vitro</italic> research studies in BSL-3 and BSL-2 facilities. Study subjects received $100 in cash for their participation in four installments of $25 during each clinical encounter: pre-screening, baseline (V1), midway point (V2), and post-treatment (V3). Eight healthy volunteers also made a one-time donation of their blood for preclinical studies to establish a baseline against the clinical trial T2DM subjects. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1"><bold>Figure 1B</bold></xref> shows an overview of the preclinical study design with healthy and T2DM subjects.

                <p>The main host defense mechanism against mycobacterial infection involves granuloma formation to encapsulate and limit the pathogenâs infection. Granulomas are formed by various immune cells, including macrophages, dendritic cells, T cells, fibroblasts, epithelioid histiocytes, giant cells, and natural killer cells (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">North and Jung, 2004</xref>).

              <p>In our current study we investigated the effects of a 3-month supplementation with oral L-GSH in T2DM individuals <italic>M. tb</italic> or <italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG (BCG)infection. To determine the effects of clinical intervention with L-GSH for three months on improving oxidative stress and improving mycobacterial responses against <italic>M. tb</italic> in individuals with T2DM, we first evaluated the levels of GSH, MDA, and various cytokines in their plasma, RBCs, and PBMCs before and after supplementation with L-GSH or placebo. We also conducted <italic>in vitro</italic> studies by infecting isolated PBMCs with either <italic>M. tb</italic> or BCG to generate <italic>in vitro</italic> granulomas to determine whether <italic>in vivo</italic> L-GSH supplementation improved immune responses against mycobacterial infection. Additionally, we evaluated the levels of various cytokines within the <italic>in vitro</italic> granuloma supernatants generated from the infection studies.</p>
              <p>T2DM, a chronic metabolic disease is associated with oxidative stress from the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and decreased efficiency of scavenger systems (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Collier etÂ al., 1990</xref>; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Powell etÂ al., 2004</xref>). Oxidative stress-induced generation of proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-6 and TNF-Î±, mediates ROS production, further increasing oxidative stress (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Zhang etÂ al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Donath, 2013</xref>). Previous findings from our lab also indicate that T2DM individuals with HbAlc levels above 7% consistently demonstrated a significant decrease in levels of GSH, increased levels of oxidative stress, and higher <italic>M.tb.</italic> burden when compared to healthy individuals without T2DM (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Lagman etÂ al., 2015</xref>). Our lab has also shown that GSH deficiency is correlated with increased levels of free radicals and intracellular <italic>M.tb.</italic> viability (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Venketaraman etÂ al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, we first conducted preclinical studies in healthy and T2DM individuals to confirm these previous studies findings on the differences between healthy and T2DM individualsâ immune responses against an <italic>in vitro M. tb</italic> or BCG infection. We observed that compared to the healthy group, the T2DM group had a significantly increased burden of both <italic>M. tb</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2"><bold>FigureÂ 2A</bold></xref>) and BCG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2"><bold>Figure 2B</bold></xref>). The significantly increased growth of intracellular <italic>M. tb</italic>. and BCG supports the previous findings on T2DM patientsâ reduced ability to control mycobacterial infections and thus having poorer outcomes than healthy individuals (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Jeon and Murray, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Lagman etÂ al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Saing etÂ al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Ferlita etÂ al., 2019</xref>). As T2DM patients are known to have decreased levels of GSH, not surprisingly, we also found that the T2DM group had a 4-fold reduction of GSH levels in plasma when compared to the healthy group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3"><bold>Figure 3A</bold></xref>). Correlated with this decrease in GSH levels, we found that the T2DM group also has significantly higher levels of MDA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3"><bold>Figures 3B, C</bold></xref>) and higher levels of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3"><bold>Figure 3D</bold></xref>) than the healthy group. These results again are not a new discovery and only act to strengthen the existing literature and our previous findings that T2DM individuals have an overproduction of ROS and proinflammatory cytokines, while also having decreased levels of GSH.</p>
              <p>Supplementation with L-GSH for three months in T2DM subjects overall was able to reduce oxidative stress and decrease levels of oxidized GSH (GSSG), while maintaining levels of reduced GSH (GSH) within various blood components. We measured oxidative stress levels through malondialdehyde (MDA), a naturally occurring product of lipid peroxidation, and an established marker for oxidative stress. We found that supplementation with L-GSH for three months was able to reduce the levels of MDA in all blood components, including plasma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4"><bold>Figure 4C</bold></xref>), PBMCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4"><bold>Figure 4D</bold></xref>), and RBCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4"><bold>FigureÂ 4E</bold></xref>). The placebo group had either an increase or no change in oxidative stress, as shown by a significant increase in MDA in RBCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4"><bold>Figure 4E</bold></xref>) or no change in MDA in plasma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4"><bold>Figure 4C</bold></xref>) or PBMCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4"><bold>Figure 4D</bold></xref>). Furthermore, there was a significant reduction in the levels of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 in both the plasma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4"><bold>Figure 4A</bold></xref>) and PBMCS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4"><bold>Figure 4B</bold></xref>) from T2DM subjects who received L-GSH supplement. In contrast, the placebo group resulted in increased levels of IL-6 or the same levels of IL-6 in plasma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4"><bold>Figure 4A</bold></xref>). Furthermore, supplementation with L-GSH in T2DM subjects, resulted in maintained levels of reduced GSH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4"><bold>Figures 4FâH</bold></xref>), while the group that received placebo had decreased levels of reduced GSH after 3 months (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4"><bold>Figures 4FâH</bold></xref>). We also saw that with placebo supplementation, the levels of oxidized GSH significantly increased, while levels of reduced GSH significantly decreased in all blood components. As seen in the preclinical results, GSH was at a 4-fold reduction in theT2DM group when compared to the healthy group, therefore supplementing with L-GSH can maintain GSH levels, decrease the levels of oxidized GSH, decrease the levels of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 and other oxidative stress markers in individuals with diabetes.</p>
              <p>Immunity against <italic>M. tb</italic> is mainly driven by Th1 cells that secrete IFN-<italic>Î³</italic>, IL-2, and TNF-Î±. IL-2 is responsible for maintaining T-cell viability, and therefore promotes T-cell responses. Both IFN-Î³ and TNF-Î± are key players in the induction of cell-mediated immunity and granuloma formation to effectively control an <italic>M. tb</italic> infection. IFN-Î³ is responsible for macrophage activation, enhanced antigen presentation, and induction of nitric oxide-mediated killing mechanisms (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Cavalcanti etÂ al., 2012</xref>). TNF-Î± stimulates the migration of immune cells to the site of infection and is essential for the maintenance and formation of granulomas (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Sedgwick etÂ al., 1999</xref>). TNF-Î± also synergizes with IFN-Î³ to simulate the production of reactive nitrogen intermediates for mycobacterial killing within macrophages (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Cavalcanti etÂ al., 2012</xref>).</p>
              <p>Our preclinical studies confirmed the previous findings that the T2DM group has lower levels of IFN-Î³ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3"><bold>Figure 3E</bold></xref>) and TNF-Î± (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3"><bold>Figure 3F</bold></xref>) when compared to healthy individuals. These lowered baseline levels of IFN-Î³ and TNF-Î± may represent the cytokine dysregulation and altered immunity among individuals with T2DM that reduced their ability to control <italic>M. tb</italic> infection. We found that L-GSH supplementation in T2DM subjects modulated levels of IFN-Î³, TNF-Î±, IL-2, and IL-10 within plasma and PBMCs from T2DM subjects. Post- L-GSH supplementation, we found increased levels of IFN-Î³ in PBMCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5"><bold>Figure 5A</bold></xref>), increased levels of TNF-Î± in plasma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5"><bold>Figure 5C</bold></xref>) and PBMCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5"><bold>Figure 5D</bold></xref>), and increased levels of IL-2 in plasma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5"><bold>Figure 5E</bold></xref>) and PBMCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5"><bold>Figure 5F</bold></xref>) when compared to before L-GSH supplementation. There was also a significant decrease in IL-10 in plasma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5"><bold>Figure 5G</bold></xref>) after L-GSH supplementation. IL-10 has an immunoregulatory function and mainly acts as an immunosuppressive cytokine. IL-10 suppresses the production of IFN-Î³, TNF-Î±, and IL-12 and also works to block actions of antigen-presenting cells (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Cavalcanti etÂ al., 2012</xref>). The observed decreased levels of IL-10 could be diminishing itâs immune suppressing effects and therefore aligns with the observed increase in IFN-Î³ and TNF-Î±. We would also like to note that the significant changes in the cytokine levels for IFN-Î³ and IL-10 were observed between the pre- and post-GSH groups and when the L-GSH group was compared to the placebo group. However, specifically for TNF-Î± and IL-2 increased levels were only significant between the pre- and post- L-GSH group, but not when the L-GSH group was compared to the placebo group. Therefore, the data supports supplementing with L-GSH was able to increase the levels of IFN-Î³, and decrease the levels of IL-10 When pre- and post- placebo groups were compared, there were no significant changes in any of these cytokine levels.</p>
              <p>The antimycobacterial effects of PZA and INH has been well established., but our lab wanted to specifically test the effects of these first-line antibiotics at 1/10 the minimum inhibitory concentration against <italic>M. tb</italic>. Previous published findings from our lab have showed that using <italic>in vitro</italic> antibiotics at 1/10 MIC PZA (5 Î¼g/ml) and 1/10 MIC INH (0.0125 Î¼g/ml) was able to reduce the burden of <italic>M.tb</italic>. in healthy individuals and we wanted to investigate this for T2DM individuals (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Abrahem etÂ al., 2019</xref>). In our preclinical studies, we provided <italic>in vitro</italic> first-line antibiotic treatment at 1/10 the MIC of PZA and INH to <italic>in vitro</italic> granulomas derived from PBMCs of T2DM individuals and measured the intracellular survival of <italic>M. tb</italic>. We found that compared to the untreated categories, treatment with 1/10 the MIC of PZA or 1/10 the MIC of INH resulted in a significant decrease in the burden of intracellular <italic>M. tb</italic> at both 8 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3"><bold>Figure 3G</bold></xref>) and 15 days post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3"><bold>Figure 3H</bold></xref>). Thus, demonstrating the efficacy of using 1/10 the MIC for PZA or 1/10 the MIC INH in improving the control of <italic>M. tb</italic> within <italic>in vitro</italic> granulomas of T2DM patients.</p>
              <p>L-GSH supplementation in individuals with T2DM for 3-months also resulted in improved control of <italic>in vitro</italic> BCG infection when compared to the placebo group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6"><bold>Figure 6A</bold></xref>). These results indicate that <italic>in vivo</italic> L-GSH supplementation in T2DM individuals could improve their ability to control a BCG infection within granulomas, compared to placebo. The improved ability to control a BCG infection for the L-GSH group, when compared to the placebo group, also correlated with significant increases in the levels of IFN-Î³ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6"><bold>Figures 6B, C</bold></xref>) and TNF-Î± (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6"><bold>Figures 6D, E</bold></xref>) in the supernatants of <italic>in vitro</italic> granulomas. The increased levels of IFN-Î³ and TNF-Î± observed within granulomas supernatants along with the decreased burden of BCG could potentially be from the L-GSH supplement that modulated the cytokines for a more effective response against mycobacterial infection in individuals with T2DM.</p>
              <p>For the <italic>in vitro</italic> infection studies with <italic>M. tb</italic>, we also compared cytokine levels before and after L-GSH supplementation within supernatants from <italic>in vitro</italic> granulomas. The <italic>in vitro</italic> granulomas were generated from PBMCs isolated from T2DM subjects, as they were in the BCG infection studies. T2DM subjects on L-GSH supplementation have significantly reduced levels of IL-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7"><bold>Figure 7A</bold></xref>) in all categories, including with <italic>in vitro</italic> PZA and INH treatment, when compared to the control category before L-GSH supplementation. There was also a 3-fold reduction in IL-10 after L-GSH supplementation in every category when compared to the control category before L-GSH supplementation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7"><bold>Figure 7B</bold></xref>). L-GSH supplementation overall seems to help improve mycobacterial infection control, potentially through modulating various cytokine levels to help the host combat the infection.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, these findings demonstrate that a clinical intervention for 3-months with oral L-GSH in individuals with T2DM can decrease levels oxidized GSH, while maintaining levels of reduced GSH and overall reducing the extent of oxidative stress. In conjunction with improving redox imbalance, L-GSH supplementation was able to improve the control of <italic>in vitro</italic> mycobacterial infections. This improved ability to control intracellular mycobacteria could be through the improved redox homeostasis in the cell and possibly through modulation of cytokines that result in a more effective immune response against these infections. More studies should be conducted to investigate whether the observed increases in cytokines IFN-Î³, TNF-Î±, IL-2, and decrease in IL-10 found in granuloma supernatants is indeed the cause of the decreased burden of mycobacterial. As the prevalence of T2DM increases globally and is recognized as a reemerging risk and challenge to manage TB, more research should investigate the possible benefits of using L-GSH as a potential adjunct therapy alongside current anti-TB treatments or even as a preventative strategy for individuals with T2DM with known dysregulation of GSH metabolism and increased oxidative stress.</p>
              <p>Some of the limitations of our study are the small sample size, resulting from non-compliance and study drop-out during the rise of the global COVID-19 pandemic. Other limitations include the fact that the <italic><underline>in vitro</underline></italic> granuloma model used is not an exact replication of <italic>in vivo</italic> granulomas which have a more complex and dynamic environment containing other cells like fibroblasts, collagen matrix, and other white blood cells. The <italic>in vitro</italic> granuloma model can help us understand some factors that might translate to the more dynamic <italic>in vivo</italic> granuloma that humans develop in response to infections like <italic>M. tb.</italic> Other limitations involve our methods with PBMC lysates being used for cytokine measurements. This method has its pros and cons, while being helpful to measure cytokines potentially at a more localized level, these PBMCs can be affected by cryopreservation, length of storage, and the overall processing methods. We believe the strengths of our study is investigating the novelty of using oral L-GSH supplementation in people with T2DM for mycobacterial infections, as well as our use of the <italic>in vitro</italic> granuloma model that give an ideal of how <italic>in vivo</italic> granulomas would respond to <italic>in vivo</italic> oral L-GSH supplementation. We hope our findings here could lead to more studies looking into L-GSH supplementation as a possible adjunct therapy in addition to the standard normal antibiotic treatment for mycobacterial infections.</p>
