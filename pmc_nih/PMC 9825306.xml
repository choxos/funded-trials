                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Addition of temozolomide (TMZ) to radiotherapy (RT) improves overall survival (OS) in patients with glioblastoma (GBM), but previous studies suggest that patients with tumors harboring an unmethylated <italic toggle="yes">MGMT</italic> promoter derive minimal benefit. The aim of this open-label, phase III CheckMate 498 study was to evaluate the efficacy of nivolumab (NIVO) + RT compared with TMZ + RT in newly diagnosed GBM with unmethylated <italic toggle="yes">MGMT</italic> promoter.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="s2">
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Patients were randomized 1:1 to standard RT (60 Gy) + NIVO (240 mg every 2 weeks for eight cycles, then 480 mg every 4 weeks) or RT + TMZ (75 mg/m<sup>2</sup> daily during RT and 150–200 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/day 5/28 days during maintenance). The primary endpoint was OS.</p>

                <sec id="s3">
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>A total of 560 patients were randomized, 280 to each arm. Median OS (mOS) was 13.4 months (95% CI, 12.6 to 14.3) with NIVO + RT and 14.9 months (95% CI, 13.3 to 16.1) with TMZ + RT (hazard ratio [HR], 1.31; 95% CI, 1.09 to 1.58; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = .0037). Median progression-free survival was 6.0 months (95% CI, 5.7 to 6.2) with NIVO + RT and 6.2 months (95% CI, 5.9 to 6.7) with TMZ + RT (HR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.15 to 1.65). Response rates were 7.8% (9/116) with NIVO + RT and 7.2% (8/111) with TMZ + RT; grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse event (TRAE) rates were 21.9% and 25.1%, and any-grade serious TRAE rates were 17.3% and 7.6%, respectively.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>The study did not meet the primary endpoint of improved OS; TMZ + RT demonstrated a longer mOS than NIVO + RT. No new safety signals were detected with NIVO in this study. The difference between the study treatment arms is consistent with the use of TMZ + RT as the standard of care for GBM.</p>

              </caption>
              <p>Given the survival benefits of immunotherapy in cancer, it was hypothesized that it may also offer promise in difficult-to-treat cancers, such as glioblastoma (GBM). Worse outcomes are observed in patients with GBM with unmethylated versus methylated <italic toggle="yes">MGMT</italic> promoter. Temozolomide (TMZ), the standard chemotherapy, is associated with limited efficacy in unmethylated <italic toggle="yes">MGMT</italic> tumors. Here we report data from the largest phase III study in patients with GBMs and unmethylated <italic toggle="yes">MGMT</italic> promoter and the first prospective phase III study examining TMZ omission in this chemoresistant phenotype. Nivolumab + radiotherapy (NIVO + RT) showed a shorter survival benefit vs TMZ + RT, suggesting that NIVO is not a suitable replacement for TMZ. Results also suggest that in the absence of other treatment options, TMZ should continue to be the standard of care for all patients with GBM regardless of <italic toggle="yes">MGMT</italic> promoter status.</p>

            <p>Glioblastoma (GBM), the most common primary malignant brain tumor, is associated with a dismal prognosis and poor quality of life.<sup><xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1–4</xref></sup> The mainstay of treatment for newly diagnosed disease is surgical resection followed by radiotherapy (RT) with concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide (TMZ).<sup><xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4–6</xref></sup> The benefit of this treatment was demonstrated in a phase III study, which showed improved overall survival (OS) from 12.1 months with RT alone to 14.6 months with TMZ chemoradiotherapy (hazard ratio [HR], 0.63; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; .001).<sup><xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p>
            <p>Chemosensitivity to alkylating agents has been strongly linked to epigenetic silencing of the <italic toggle="yes">MGMT</italic> gene in various cancers.<sup><xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Methylation of the <italic toggle="yes">MGMT</italic> promoter results in decreased <italic toggle="yes">MGMT</italic> expression, which reduces DNA repair capacity and confers chemosensitivity.<sup><xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8–10</xref></sup> Analyses from the pivotal phase III study validating TMZ in GBM suggested that patients with tumors harboring a methylated <italic toggle="yes">MGMT</italic> promoter derived a survival benefit from TMZ + RT (median, 21.7 vs. 15.3 months), whereas patients with unmethylated <italic toggle="yes">MGMT</italic> promoter derived minimal and statistically insignificant benefit (median, 12.7 vs 11.8 months).<sup><xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup><italic toggle="yes">MGMT</italic> promoter methylation is also an independent prognostic factor in GBM; patients with a methylated <italic toggle="yes">MGMT</italic> promoter achieve significantly better outcomes.<sup><xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Given the lack of treatment alternatives, TMZ is offered to all patients with GBM, regardless of tumor <italic toggle="yes">MGMT</italic> promoter methylation status—with or without tumor-treating fields.<sup><xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Because of TMZ’s minimal benefit and known toxicities, reassessment of its role in GBM with unmethylated <italic toggle="yes">MGMT</italic> promoter remains of interest, and novel treatment alternatives are clearly needed for this patient population.<sup><xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p>
            <p>Nivolumab (NIVO) is a fully human immunoglobulin G4 monoclonal antibody targeting the programmed cell death 1 protein (PD-1) immune checkpoint. NIVO has been shown to improve survival in multiple cancers, including melanoma, lung cancer, and renal cell carcinoma, and has demonstrated activity in brain metastasis from melanoma.<sup><xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14–16</xref></sup> Gliomas have been shown to express PD-1 ligand (PD-L1), and expression levels have been associated with tumor grade.<sup><xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Preclinical studies in GBM models suggest that efficacy of PD-1 inhibitors could be enhanced through combination with RT.<sup><xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> RT may expose antigenic mutations, induce the expression of peptides that can activate T cells, and recruit antigen-presenting and immune effector cells to the tumor microenvironment (TME).<sup><xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20–22</xref></sup> Given the chemoresistance observed in tumors with unmethylated <italic toggle="yes">MGMT</italic> promoter, we conducted a phase III study to evaluate whether immunotherapy with NIVO could improve survival when combined with RT (NIVO + RT) compared with conventional chemoradiotherapy with TMZ + RT in this patient population.</p>

                <title>Study Design and Participants</title>
                <p>In this open-label, phase III study, patients were stratified by degree of tumor resection (complete vs. partial) at baseline and randomized 1:1 to receive NIVO + RT or TMZ + RT. In both arms, focal RT consisted of 60 Gy in 2-Gy fractions. In the NIVO + RT arm, RT was combined with NIVO 240 mg every 2 weeks for eight doses followed by NIVO 480 mg every 4 weeks until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. In the TMZ + RT arm, RT was combined with the standard TMZ regimen, 75 mg/m<sup>2</sup> once daily during RT (concomitant),<sup><xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> followed by a 4-week treatment break and then adjuvant treatment with TMZ 150 to 200 mg/m<sup>2</sup> once daily on days 1 to 5 of a 28-day cycle for ≤ 6 cycles (maintenance). The median dose and duration of RT was 60.0 Gy and 6.1 weeks in both arms, respectively. Per investigator’s discretion, patients receiving NIVO were permitted to continue treatment beyond suspected progression until confirmation of progression on follow-up MRI.</p>
                <p>Eligible patients were aged ≥ 18 years and had newly diagnosed, histologically confirmed, supratentorial GBM with unmethylated <italic toggle="yes">MGMT</italic> promoter determined centrally by a methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction assay.<sup><xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Other key eligibility criteria included no prior treatment for GBM beyond surgery and Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) ≥ 70. At randomization, patients must have been receiving ≤ 20 mg prednisone or ≤ 3 mg dexamethasone (or equivalent). Patients were excluded if they had recurrent or secondary GBM; undergone biopsy only for GBM at surgery; tumors harboring <italic toggle="yes">IDH-1</italic> or -<italic toggle="yes">2</italic> mutation; unresolved CNS hemorrhage; metastatic extracranial or leptomeningeal disease; active, known, or suspected autoimmune disease; tumor-treating fields therapy (not a recommended treatment at time of study start); or used a biodegradable carmustine wafer.</p>

                <title>Procedures</title>
                <p>Tumor samples were assessed for <italic toggle="yes">MGMT</italic> promoter methylation status; testing was performed by Covance laboratory services. A sample was determined to be <italic toggle="yes">MGMT</italic> unmethylated when the ratio of the gene copy numbers of methylated <italic toggle="yes">MGMT</italic> to control (β-actin) × 1000 was &lt; 2 and the gene copy numbers of <italic toggle="yes">MGMT</italic> and control were within the reportable range (β-actin ≥ 10 copies and <italic toggle="yes">MGMT</italic> ≥ 10 copies). Disease status was assessed using contrast-enhanced MRI at baseline and beginning 4 weeks (± 7 days) after RT completion. Then, disease status was evaluated every 8 weeks (± 7 days) until progression per Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria.<sup><xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> As detailed in the RANO criteria, classification of tumor progression during the first 12 weeks after completion of RT requires either that the new enhancement be located outside of the radiation field (beyond the high-dose region or the 80% isodense line) or unequivocal pathological confirmation of progressive disease. Confirmation was determined at a subsequent MRI performed within 8 weeks after the initial radiological assessment of progression. Theoretically, patients treated with immunotherapy may derive clinical benefit despite initial evidence of disease progression; therefore, patients in the NIVO + RT arm were allowed to continue NIVO in the setting of suspected progression at investigator discretion until progression was confirmed. Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as time from randomization to documented progression or death from any cause. OS was defined as time from randomization to death from any cause. Tumor-sample sections for PD-L1 expression were retrospectively assessed centrally (LabCorp Clinical Trials, Research Triangle Park, NC, USA); PD-L1 positivity was defined as percentage of membranous staining of tumor cells with 1% and 5% cutoff values. Adverse events (AEs) were assessed continuously during the study per National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.03. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) related to patients’ health-related quality of life (HRQoL) were assessed using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30 and EQ-5D-3L questionnaires, collected at baseline, week 11, and then every 8 weeks during treatment until disease progression. The time to deterioration in PRO score was assessed by time from randomization to first worsening of PRO score from baseline during treatment—meeting or exceeding the minimal change in responder definition threshold—without subsequent improvement based on the responder definition.<sup><xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup></p>

                <p>OS, defined as the time between the date of randomization and the date of death due to any cause, was compared between treatment arms using a two-sided log-rank test stratified by extent of surgical resection (complete or partial). The final OS analysis was planned after follow-up of ≥ 23 months or when ≥ 390 deaths were reported, providing ≈ 90% power with an overall type I error of 0.05. At the time of the database lock, some patients had &lt; 24 months of follow-up. However, given the number of events at the time of the database lock, it was considered that the number of patients with follow-up of &lt; 24 months at the time of the current analysis would not have affected the data maturity or interpretability of the results. Kaplan-Meier methodology was used to estimate OS and PFS curves, medians with 95% CIs, and OS and PFS rates at fixed time points with 95% CIs. HRs and corresponding two-sided 95% CIs were estimated using a stratified Cox proportional hazards model. A stratified Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to estimate the HR between treatment groups. Baseline characteristics in all randomized patients and safety in all treated patients were assessed using descriptive statistics.</p>

                <p>From March 1, 2016, through October 25, 2018, 560 patients with newly diagnosed GBM with unmethylated <italic toggle="yes">MGMT</italic> promoter were randomized to receive NIVO + RT (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 280) or TMZ + RT (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 280) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Patients were enrolled at 124 sites across 19 countries. Of 560 randomized patients, 278 of 280 (99.3%) in the NIVO + RT arm and 275 of 280 (98.2%) in the TMZ + RT arm eventually received treatment. No marked imbalances were observed in baseline characteristics or demographics between arms (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S1</xref>).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>CheckMate 498 is a randomized phase III study investigating the efficacy of NIVO + RT compared with conventional TMZ + RT chemoradiation in patients with newly diagnosed GBM with unmethylated <italic toggle="yes">MGMT</italic> promoter. Although patients in both arms fared better than historical controls, the primary endpoint was not met. TMZ + RT was associated with superior OS compared with NIVO + RT (mOS, 14.9 vs. 13.4 months), suggesting that NIVO is not a substitute for TMZ in this patient population.</p>
              <p>Although NIVO has shown notable efficacy in several other cancer types, it did not demonstrate a survival benefit in patients with newly diagnosed GBM with unmethylated <italic toggle="yes">MGMT</italic> promoter compared with TMZ. Likewise, in a subgroup analysis of the CheckMate 143 phase III study, NIVO did not demonstrate a survival benefit versus bevacizumab in patients with recurrent GBM with unmethylated <italic toggle="yes">MGMT</italic> promoter.<sup><xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> PD-L1 expression in this study (≈ 41% of all patients expressed PD-L1 ≥ 1%) was similar to that observed in other GBM studies.<sup><xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> However, it did not predict survival benefit with NIVO, suggesting that other factors may hinder successful immune responses in this tumor type. Notably, recent results from the CheckMate 548 study (NCT02667587) in newly diagnosed GBM with methylated <italic toggle="yes">MGMT</italic> have also shown the addition of NIVO to TMZ + RT does not prolong PFS or OS compared with TMZ + RT alone.<sup><xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> Taken together, these results clearly highlight a need for better understanding the mechanisms of immune evasion in GBM to improve the efficacy of immunotherapies. In addition to PD-L1 expression, multiple factors have been implicated in the maintenance of an immunosuppressive microenvironment in gliomas. These include both tumor- and brain-specific mechanisms (eg, low tumor mutational burden, recruitment of other immune checkpoints, decreased T-cell responsiveness, inhibitory cytokine production, interactions between CNS microenvironment and microglia, predominance of myeloid cells, and paucity of lymphocytes in TME), in addition to frequent corticosteroid use.<sup><xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30–33</xref></sup></p>
              <p>A key limitation of our study was the lack of immune-predictive biomarkers and comprehensive genomic characterization due to limited availability of tumor samples; therefore, novel biomarkers remain to be further explored. In addition, this study did not consider potential effects of the timing of PD-1 blockade relative to RT administration, which has subsequently been demonstrated to be of possible consequence in some preclinical, non-GBM settings.<sup><xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup></p>
              <p>The overall safety profile with NIVO + RT in this study was similar to that reported in CheckMate 143 for NIVO alone, with no new safety signals observed.<sup><xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> However, in some AE categories, as expected, more AEs were reported in the NIVO + RT arm than in the TMZ + RT arm. One of the reasons for the omission of TMZ in the NIVO + RT arm was to manage lymphopenia and immunosuppression; indeed, lymphopenia was more frequent in the TMZ + RT arm than in the NIVO + RT arm. Interestingly, HRQoL deteriorated numerically more rapidly in the TMZ + RT arm than in the NIVO + RT arm, consistent with expected effects of chemotherapy. However, time to deterioration results were affected by heavy censoring and should be interpreted with caution.</p>
              <p>Our study found a statistically significant survival benefit with TMZ + RT over NIVO + RT despite tumor <italic toggle="yes">MGMT</italic> unmethylated status. mOS was 14.9 months (95% CI, 13.3 to 16.1) with TMZ + RT and 13.4 months (95% CI, 12.6 to 14.3) with NIVO + RT. These results were similar to those of previous studies, including the study conducted by Gilbert et al.,<sup><xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> which reported an mOS of 14.6 months (95% CI, 13.2 to 16.5) with TMZ + RT. The study conducted by Hegi et al.<sup><xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> also produced similar results: an mOS of 12.7 months (95% CI, 11.6 to 14.4) with TMZ + RT and 11.8 months (95% CI, 9.7 to 14.1) with RT alone. Several potential differences in studies exist, including patient selection, study design, and patient management. However, one caveat is that NIVO was compared with TMZ, and any potential benefit of combining NIVO with TMZ was not evaluated to fully assess the effects of NIVO.</p>
              <p>In summary, we report on the largest phase III study conducted to date in patients with GBM molecularly selected for unmethylated <italic toggle="yes">MGMT</italic> promoter and the first to prospectively examine the omission of TMZ in this population. Overall, our results indicate that immunotherapy with NIVO is not a suitable replacement for chemotherapy with TMZ despite the chemoresistance of this difficult-to-treat patient population. Further immunotherapy efforts in GBM include alternative immune checkpoint inhibitors, vaccines, oncolytic viruses, and cell therapies. Additionally, immune checkpoint inhibitors combined with each other or with vaccines may also be explored.</p>
