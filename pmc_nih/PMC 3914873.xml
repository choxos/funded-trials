              <abstract>
                <p>Induced regulatory T-cells (iT-reg) and T helper type 17 (Th17) in the mouse share common CD4 progenitor cells and exhibit overlapping phenotypic and functional features. Here, we show that human Th17 cells endowed with suppressor activity (supTh17) can be derived following exposure of iT-reg populations to Th17 polarizing conditions. In contrast to “pathogenic” Th17, supTh17 display immune suppressive function and express high levels of CD39, an ectonucleotidase that catalyzes the conversion of pro-inflammatory extracellular nucleotides ultimately generating nucleosides. Accordingly, supTh17 exhibit nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase activity, as demonstrated by the efficient generation of extracellular AMP, adenosine and other purine derivatives. In addition supTh17 cells are resistant to the effects of adenosine as result of the low expression of the A2A receptor and accelerated adenosine catalysis by adenosine deaminase (ADA). These supTh17 can be detected in the blood and in the lamina propria of healthy subjects. However, these supTh17 cells are diminished in patients with Crohn’s disease. In summary, we describe a human Th17 subpopulation with suppressor activity, which expresses high levels of CD39 and consequently produces extracellular adenosine. As these uniquely suppressive CD39<sup>+</sup> Th17 cells are decreased in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, our findings might have implications for the development of novel anti-inflammatory therapeutic approaches in these and potentially other immune disorders.</p>

Th17 cells drive inflammatory and autoimmune conditions in both mice and humans and have been linked to intestinal inflammation <xref rid="pone.0087956-Miossec1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087956-Korn1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells can be differentiated into Th17 cells when exposed to TGF-β in combination with IL-6 or IL-21 in mice and to IL-6, TGF-β and IL-1β in humans, or into induced (i)T-reg under the influence of TGF-β <xref rid="pone.0087956-Miossec1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087956-Korn1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.

              <p>Using genetic lineage tracing of Foxp3 T-reg, Zhou and colleagues observed that a significant proportion of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> cells undergo down-regulation and in some cases loss of Foxp3 expression is noted <xref rid="pone.0087956-Zhou1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. These ‘ex-Foxp3’ cells display an effector memory cell phenotype, produce pro-inflammatory cytokines and are numerically increased in experimental autoimmune diabetes <xref rid="pone.0087956-Zhou1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Moreover, exposure of T-reg to IL-6 can down-regulate both Foxp3 and IL-17 expression, suggesting that T-reg may be ‘subverted’ to Th17-like cells <xref rid="pone.0087956-Xu1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. In addition, it has been reported that T-reg can further acquire effector properties - i.e. IFNγ production - when cultured in the presence of IL-12 <xref rid="pone.0087956-DominguezVillar1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.

              <p>The stimulation of naïve T-cells with TGF-β and IL-6 triggers IL-17 production but it also induces the expression of IL-10, limiting the pathogenic potential of these cells <xref rid="pone.0087956-McGeachy1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Indeed, additional studies have reported that IL-17<sup>+</sup> T-cells can limit tissue damage during inflammation <xref rid="pone.0087956-OConnor1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087956-SchnyderCandrian1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. In experimental murine tumor settings, it has been demonstrated that CD39 and CD73 expressed by ‘suppressor’ Th17 cells (supTh17) suppress tumor-specific immunity <xref rid="pone.0087956-Chalmin1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Whether comparable human supTh17 cells exist has been unexplored to date.</p>
              <p>CD39 hydrolyses ATP and ADP into AMP, which is then converted into adenosine by CD73. The regulatory properties of CD39 were initially noted in studies conducted on CD39<sup>null</sup> mice in which an enhanced production of IFNγ, IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α was found <xref rid="pone.0087956-Enjyoji1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087956-Enjyoji2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. CD39 and CD73 expression on murine T-reg is required for the suppressive function of these cells, which results from the production of adenosine <xref rid="pone.0087956-Deaglio1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Accordingly, T-reg isolated from CD39<sup>null</sup> mice are unable to block allograft rejection in adoptive transfer studies <xref rid="pone.0087956-Deaglio2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p>
              <p>Expression of CD39 has been reported on human T-reg in parallel to FOXP3 and low levels of CD127 <xref rid="pone.0087956-Borsellino1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087956-Dwyer1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Human T-reg do not co-express high levels of CD73 with CD39 in contrast to murine counterparts. Thus AMP conversion to adenosine by human CD39<sup>+</sup> T-reg is thought to result from paracrine mechanisms by the presence of CD73 on target or neighboring cells <xref rid="pone.0087956-Dwyer1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Regardless of the molecular mechanism involved, it has been shown that human CD39<sup>+</sup> T-reg exert preferential suppression on CD4 target cell IL-17 production <xref rid="pone.0087956-Fletcher1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>.</p>
              <p>Defective numbers of CD39<sup>+</sup> T-reg have been reported in patients with multiple sclerosis, autoimmune hepatitis <xref rid="pone.0087956-Grant1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> and CD39 polymorphisms linked to low-level CD39 expression have also been described in Crohn’s disease <xref rid="pone.0087956-Borsellino1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087956-Fletcher1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087956-Friedman1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Recent studies have shown that in addition to T-reg, CD39 is also expressed on a subset of memory cells with effector function <xref rid="pone.0087956-Zhou2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Although this expression of CD39 by human T-reg has been reported and putative roles dissected, the demonstration and relevance of specific CD39 expression by human Th17 cells has been unexplored to date.</p>
              <p>We describe here a population of human supTh17 cells that in contrast to prototypic pathogenic Th17 display high levels of both CD39 and FOXP3 and exhibit immune suppressive properties. Our new observations also provide mechanistic insights into the development of supTh17 and indicate the role of CD39 and purinergic immunomodulation. The pathophysiological relevance of these cells is supported by the detection of decreased frequencies of CD39<sup>+</sup> supTh17 cells in both peripheral blood and lamina propria of patients with Crohn’s disease, an illness characterized by manifestations of unfettered intestinal inflammation.</p>

                <p>The ability of Th17, iT-reg and supTh17 to control target cell proliferation and effector cytokine production was evaluated following 4-day co-culture with CD4 responder cells. Following 24 hour resting in cytokine and bead-free medium, Th17, iT-reg and supTh17 were added at 1/8 ratio to autologous CD4 target cells (2.5×10<sup>4</sup> cells/well) previously exposed to IL-2 (30 U/ml) and T-cell expander (bead/cell ratio: 1∶2) for 5 to 7 days. The 1∶8 ratio was selected because capable of exerting a detectable regulatory function in preliminary experiments where ratios of 1∶16, 1∶8, 1∶4 and 1∶2 were compared as these putatively reflect pathophysiological proportions between suppressor and effector lymphocytes. Parallel cultures of CD4 responder cells and of Th17, iT-reg and supTh17 on their own were performed under identical conditions. All experiments were performed in duplicates. After 4 days, cultures were pulsed with 0.25 µCi/well <sup>3</sup>H-thymidine and harvested 18 hours later using a cell harvester (Tomtec, Hamden, CT). Incorporated thymidine was measured by liquid scintillation spectroscopy. In preliminary experiments, inhibition of CD4 target cell proliferation in the absence and presence of suppressor cells was also analyzed using carboxy fluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) staining. As CFSE- and <sup>3</sup>H-thymidine-based assays gave comparable results, given the requirement for fewer cells, <sup>3</sup>H-thymidine was used to measure proliferation in subsequent experiments. The ability of Th17, iT-reg and supTh17 cells to control the production of IFNγ and IL-17 by target cells was determined by intracellular cytokine staining after 4-day co-culture as detailed above.

As depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0087956-g004">Figure 4D</xref>, supTh17 and iT-reg were both able to generate adenosine that supTh17 cells further effectively degraded into inosine. In contrast, Th17 cells were capable of hydrolyzing ADP into AMP but did not generate extracellular adenosine, in accordance with low levels of CD39 and CD73 expression. In keeping with concomitant CD39 and CD73 expression, supTh17 are therefore competent in generating adenosine, which is then effectively degraded into inosine.</p>

                <p>We then examined possible mechanisms that could further account for resistance of supTh17 to exogenous adenosine. We considered that resistance to adenosine may result from low expression levels of adenosine receptors, from high levels of adenosine deaminase (ADA), which degrades adenosine into inosine, and/or high expression of phosphodiesterases (PDE) - the enzymes degrading the phosphodiester bond of cAMP. Thus, we determined the expression of A1, A2A, A2B and A3 adenosine receptors by quantitative real-time PCR. The expression of A2A receptor, known to be involved in down-regulation of inflammation and protection from tissue damage <xref rid="pone.0087956-Ohta1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, was decreased at mRNA levels in supTh17, when compared to Th17 and iT-reg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0087956-g006">Figure 6A</xref>).</p>

                </fig>
                <p>In order to test whether adenosine resistance of supTh17 was the result of enhanced adenosine clearance, we first assessed the expression of ADA. We observed expression of ADA in Th17 and supTh17 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0087956-g006">Figure 6B</xref>), indicating that both these cell types have the ability to deaminate adenosine. In contrast, ADA was only weakly expressed in iT-reg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0087956-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). ADA is completely functional at the cell surface (known as ecto-ADA), where it directly interacts with the dipeptidylpeptidase IV (CD26) and regulates adenosine receptors. ADA activity depends on CD26, the expression of which has been recently reported to be increased on human Th17 <xref rid="pone.0087956-Bengsch1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. We therefore assessed the expression of CD26 and found that the CD26 MFI was higher in iT-reg and supTh17 compared to Th17 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0087956-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). These data indicate that the effective degradation of adenosine into inosine displayed by supTh17 relies on the co-expression of both ADA and CD26. In contrast Th17 and iT-reg, which express either ADA (Th17) or CD26 (iT-reg), do not display effective deamination activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0087956-g006">Figure 6C</xref>).</p>
                <p>We next determined the expression of PDE4A and PDE4B. We found that both enzymes are expressed by Th17, iT-reg and supTh17 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0087956-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). The supTh17, however, did not overexpress any of the PDE, ruling out the possibility that the adenosine resistance noted in these cells result from high levels of cAMP clearance. We therefore conclude that supTh17 resistance to exogenous adenosine is associated with low A2A adenosine receptor expression and enhanced scavenging of nucleosides by ecto-adenosine deaminase.</p>

              <p>We have shown that a population of human supTh17 cells can be derived following the exposure of iT-reg to Th17 polarizing conditions <italic>in vitro</italic>. These putative supTh17 display phenotypic features of both effector Th17 (i.e. production of IL-17 and expression of CCR6, IL-22 and IL-23R) and iT-reg (expression of FOXP3) and importantly control effector cell function by inhibiting CD4 cell proliferation as well as production of IFNγ and IL-17. It is not clear whether these cells might be representative of a late stage in Th17 differentiation, in which the effector potential of prototypic Th17 cells is attenuated or rather constitute unique cell subsets in which overlapping regulatory and effector features coexist.</p>
              <p>The robust <italic>in vitro</italic> system used in the present study enabled us to observe changes in T-cell phenotype and function upon stimulation in the presence of Th17 and iT-reg polarizing conditions. Previous studies have documented differentiation of CD4 cells into Th17 or iT-reg following short- and medium-term cell culture <italic>in vitro</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0087956-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087956-Davidson1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087956-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087956-AcostaRodriguez2" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. These and our studies may be of particular relevance to disease settings, in which antigen-primed CD4 memory cells may be sequentially exposed to different cytokine milieus and undergo modulation accordingly, during either inflammatory or remission phases.</p>
              <p>Given the putative importance of CD39 in immunoregulation, particularly concerning purinergic mechanisms governing the suppressive function of iT-reg, we studied whether supTh17 expressed this ectonucleotidase. Our data show that, in contrast to prototypic Th17 cells, supTh17 display high levels of CD39. Furthermore, supTh17 cells also co-express ecto-5′-ectonucleotidase CD73, which is pivotal in the generation of adenosine from AMP. These supTh17, in contrast to prototypic Th17, have the potential to generate adenosine in a manner comparable to iT-reg, which can be noted by standard biochemical tests (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0087956-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). However, in a manner distinct from iT-reg, the extracellular adenosine that is generated by supTh17 undergoes further degradation, given the concomitant expression of adenosine deaminase and CD26 by these cells. In accordance with the low CD73 levels expressed, prototypic Th17 cells were unable to generate adenosine.</p>
              <p>When we examined the effect of exogenous adenosine on supTh17 phenotypic and functional properties, we could observe that these cells were resistant to the effect of this mediator. Curiously, these cells did not undergo upregulation of CD39 expression nor did these cells exhibit amelioration of suppressive function, in the manner observed in anergic type iT-reg.</p>
              <p>Adenosine resistance in supTh17 cells is likely to be conferred by low levels of A2A adenosine receptor and by higher levels of adenosine catalysis. The A2A adenosine receptor is primarily known to mediate anti-inflammatory effects: lymphocytes from A2A receptor (−/−) mice show higher rates of cell proliferation and produce high IFNγ levels upon stimulation <xref rid="pone.0087956-Mills1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. A2A receptor stimulation has established inhibitory effects on Th1 and Th17 effector cell generation and, in contrast, favors generation of FOXP3<sup>+</sup> and LAG-3<sup>+</sup> regulatory T-cells <xref rid="pone.0087956-Zarek1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. Our data suggest that the most likely mechanisms for supTh17 resistance to adenosine are linked to low A2A receptor levels and enhanced levels of adenosine catalysis, enabled by ADA and CD26 co-expression. We have observed that iT-reg display marked decreases in mRNA levels of the A2B adenosine receptor. This observation might have relevance for the differential effects of A2B versus A2A signaling by these cells. Furthermore, Moriyama and Sitkovsky have demonstrated in studies of A2AR versus A2BR expression in transfected cells that substantive proportions of A2BR are preferentially degraded by the proteasome, a mechanism that might be also operative here in differentiating Th17 cells from iT-reg <xref rid="pone.0087956-Moriyama1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>.</p>
              <p>The observation that supTh17 are resistant to adenosinergic modulation implies that these cells are not conventional suppressors, nor are these cells anergic. The supTh17 cells might adapt their own intrinsic ability to regulate or inflict damage according to the immunological context in which they operate. Given that in these cells, both regulatory (i.e. adenosine generation, suppressive function) and pro-inflammatory (i.e. low levels of A2A and inosine generation) features co-exist, it is plausible to suggest that supTh17 might reside in a form of ‘purinergic limbo’ and unresponsiveness until a crucial time where this balance may be perturbed. This temporal ‘status’ would enable supTh17 cells to influence extrinsic homeostatic properties of target cells via suppression mediated through generation of adenosine while maintaining intrinsic resistance to this immune suppressive molecule. In contrast, iT-reg exert suppression via production of adenosine, while being also wholly susceptible to the nucleoside modulatory effects that might stabilize their immune suppressive phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0087956-g008">Figure 8</xref>; <xref rid="pone.0087956-Deaglio1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087956-Dwyer1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>). At variance with iT-reg, supTh17 are not subjected to this autocrine loop, suggesting that these cells, in contrast, may play roles as both regulators of late stage immune responses and in the maintenance of T-cell memory functionality.</p>

                  <p>Both supTh17 and iT-reg cells have the capacity to suppress effector T-cells (Teff) by generating adenosine. In a manner distinct from iT-reg which are anergic, however, supTh17 express low levels of A2A receptor and exhibit nucleoside scavenging ecto-enzymatic activity. These properties confer on supTh17 an important intrinsic resistance to suppressive effects of adenosine, which may develop in parallel with prolonged cellular activation in accordance with memory T-cell status. These differences suggest that supTh17 might undergo conversion and be recruited as suppressor-type cells in the later evolution of immune responses where these cells may persist at sites of resolving injury.</p>

              <p>Another important finding of this investigation is that supTh17 could be enumerated in both circulation and lamina propria of healthy subjects and patients with Crohn’s disease. These cells appear to preferentially home to the intestine, as demonstrated by their high percentages in the lamina propria, suggesting that the intestine may be the compartment where Th17 cells undergo regulation. Our data indicate there are higher percentages of supTh17 cells expressing Stat-3 in the lamina propria indicating that this transcription factor may have a role in the expression of CD39 and induction of supTh17 in the colon <xref rid="pone.0087956-Chalmin1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. In agreement with these data, in mouse models of colitis, pathogenic Th17 cells are also considered to undergo regulation in the intestine where these cells acquire phenotypic and functional T-reg-like properties <xref rid="pone.0087956-Esplugues1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>.</p>
              <p>Importantly, supTh17 numbers are markedly decreased in Crohn’s patients. This decrease might theoretically result in disease exacerbation and perpetuation because of the decreased ability of effector Th17 to undergo regulation. Previous clinical studies demonstrated impaired immunoregulation and particularly numerically defective and dysfunctional T-reg in these same disease settings <xref rid="pone.0087956-Chamouard1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087956-Ishikawa1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>.</p>
              <p>Hence, the increased numbers of effector Th17 cells, also shown here may originate from defective control usually operated by active immune suppression - i.e. primarily defective T-reg, or alternatively be the result of decreased Th17 autoregulation. Interestingly, supTh17 from Crohn’s patients appear skewed towards a pro-inflammatory phenotype as these cells contain higher frequencies of TNF-α and IL-2 pro-inflammatory cytokines than those noted in healthy controls.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, we have shown that human supTh17 can be obtained upon exposure of iT-reg to Th17 driving conditions <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>
              <p>High levels of CD39 expression distinguish these immune suppressive cells from effector pathogenic Th17 cells. We propose that these fundamental alterations in purinergic signaling might control tissue damage while limiting cellular pathogenicity in local and systemic inflammatory illnesses, such as in Crohn’s disease. Promoting the local expansion of supTh17 cells and the maintenance of these should boost local immune suppressive activities and augment diminished T-reg functionality, as previously noted in IBD [34,55]. Indeed, these studies and development of modalities to boost CD39 expression have implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies in Crohn’s disease.</p>
