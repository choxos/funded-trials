                <p id="Par1">While food allergy oral immunotherapy (OIT) can provide safe and effective desensitization (DS), the immune mechanisms underlying development of sustained unresponsiveness (SU) following a period of avoidance are largely unknown. Here, we compare high dimensional phenotypes of innate and adaptive immune cell subsets of participants in a previously reported, phase 2 randomized, controlled, peanut OIT trial who achieved SU vs. DS (no vs. with allergic reactions upon food challenge after a withdrawal period; <italic>n</italic> = 21 vs. 30 respectively among total 120 intent-to-treat participants). Lower frequencies of naïve CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and terminally differentiated CD57<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets at baseline (pre-OIT) are associated with SU. Frequency of naïve CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells shows a significant positive correlation with peanut-specific and Ara h 2-specific IgE levels at baseline. Higher frequencies of IL-4<sup>+</sup> and IFNγ<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells post-OIT are negatively correlated with SU. Our findings provide evidence that an immune signature consisting of certain CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell subset frequencies is potentially predictive of SU following OIT.</p>

              <p id="Par3">Oral immunotherapy (OIT), during which food allergens are gradually introduced at increasing doses until a maintenance dose is reached, has been successful in desensitizing patients to offending food antigens and many trials administering peanut OIT have been performed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. While these trials have demonstrated the efficacy of peanut OIT to desensitize participants to peanut, the proportion of such desensitized participants achieving sustained unresponsiveness (SU), i.e., a lack of clinical reactivity following a period of OIT discontinuation is highly variable<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Moreover, while some aspects of the immune mechanisms resulting in desensitization (i.e., DS, for the purposes of this study, defined by the recurrence of any allergic reaction upon food challenge after a period of withdrawal post-successful OIT outcome) have been largely elucidated, the immune pathways or biomarkers that may distinguish SU vs. DS are yet to be fully characterized<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par4">To address this issue and to gain insight into mechanisms underlying development of SU, we performed a comprehensive post-hoc mechanistic analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and plasma from participants in our phase 2 OIT POISED study (Peanut Oral Immunotherapy: Safety, Efficacy, Discovery) (NCT 02103270). The design, objectives, and primary outcomes of this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled (DBPC) clinical trial have been previously published<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Briefly, in this study, after dosage build-up over ~52 weeks, peanut-allergic patients were maintained on 4000 mg peanut protein daily for another 52 weeks, while a blinded placebo group received oat flour. At week 104, 80 (98.77%) of per-protocol active participants passed the DBPC food challenge (DBPCFC) and peanut ingestion was withdrawn in a group of 51 blinded participants (i.e., peanut avoidance group) for 12 weeks. At week 117, 21 (41.2%) of per-protocol participants in the peanut avoidance group passed the 4000 mg DBPCFC without any allergic reaction, thus demonstrating SU. Those 21 participants continued to have DBPCFCs every 3 months and were allowed to continue peanut OIT discontinuation if they passed a DBPCFC. At week 156, 12 months after peanut discontinuation, only 8 participants passed the DBPCFCs (i.e., had achieved long-term SU with no allergic reaction upon food challenge).</p>
              <p id="Par5">We recently reported higher frequencies of peanut-reactive (pr) CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in peanut-allergic individuals and demonstrated interactions between pr CD8<sup>+</sup> and Th2 cells leading to enhancement of allergic pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Based on these findings, we postulated a pr CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell-based mechanism in distinguishing SU vs. DS outcomes. Furthermore, our group and others have demonstrated distinct functions of innate immune cells in food allergy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, and so we further hypothesized that pr CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells along with innate immune cell subsets likely impact the possibility achieving SU.</p>
              <p id="Par6">To test these hypotheses, we perform high dimensional functional immunophenotyping of peanut-stimulated, PMA/Ionomycin-stimulated, and unstimulated PBMCs with mass cytometry, and plasma and peanut-stimulated PBMC supernatants with Luminex technology from all per-protocol trial participants. We quantitate immune changes from SU (i.e., SU defined as those who had no allergic reaction at the DBPCFC at week 117 or later) vs. DS (i.e., those who had allergic reactions to the DBPCFC at week 117) at week 117. To identify potential biomarkers predictive of SU, we examine differences in immune profiles of SU vs. DS participants at baseline (BL, i.e., pre-OIT) as well as at the end of OIT at week 104 (i.e., after successful desensitization). One of the primary baseline inclusion criterion for study participation was tolerance to ≤500 mg of cumulative peanut protein dose during the DBPCFC at the screening stage. The participants who successfully passed 4000 mg peanut OFC at week 104, but failed at a peanut dose of ≤500 mg at week 117 represented a subset having relapsed to the baseline threshold following mere 12 weeks of avoidance. Thus, as a nested analysis of participants at the ends of SU vs. DS outcome spectrum, we compare a subset of DS participants, who failed week 117 DBPCFC at a peanut protein dose ≤500 mg (<italic>n</italic> = 7) with the 8 SU participants, who passed all DBPCFCs up to week 156. We also examine peanut OIT-induced immune changes by comparing active vs. placebo groups at week 104.</p>
              <p id="Par7">Our results show that lower frequencies of naive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and terminally differentiated, CD57<sup>+</sup> pr CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells at BL are strongly associated with SU. On the other hand, higher frequencies of IL-4<sup>+</sup> and IFNγ<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells post-OIT are negatively correlated with SU. In summary, we discover a distinct CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell pattern in vivo that is associated with the impairment of achieving SU during food allergy OIT. In addition, our data confirm the attenuation of Th2 phenotype post-OIT.</p>

                <p id="Par9">The frequencies of IL-4<sup>+</sup>, IL-9<sup>+</sup> and IL-10<sup>+</sup> peanut-reactive (pr) CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (i.e., CD69<sup>+</sup>CD40L<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells) among total CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were significantly reduced in participants on active OIT (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>; <italic>q</italic> = 0.002, 0.09 and 0.04, respectively). Peanut-reactive CD4<sup>+</sup> cells also demonstrated a reduced frequency and expression of Th2-polarization surrogate marker OX40 in active vs. placebo groups (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>; <italic>q</italic> = 0.01 and 0.03, respectively), indicating downregulation of the Type 2 phenotype in the active peanut OIT-treated, desensitized participants. Peanut-reactive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells also demonstrated increased frequencies of subpopulations expressing the costimulatory molecule CD27 and the activation marker CD38 in active vs. placebo (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>; <italic>q</italic> = 0.046 and 0.092, respectively). Similar differences in OX40 and CD27 expression were observed in active vs. placebo comparison of pr CD4<sup>+</sup> cell clusters identified through FlowSOM-based unsupervised clustering (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1a, b</xref>; <italic>q</italic> = 0.01 and 0.006, respectively). Expression of other functional markers evaluated in pr CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells including IL-17, LAP (TGF-β) and IFN-γ and frequencies of pr CD4<sup>+</sup> and pr CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells among peanut-stimulated PBMCs were similar in active vs. placebo comparison at week 104 (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1c</xref>; <italic>q</italic> &gt; 0.1). Also, frequencies of all the manually gated immune subpopulations examined within the scope of our mass cytometry panel including Treg (CD25<sup>hi</sup>CD127<sup>-</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup>), NKT (CD56<sup>+</sup>CD3<sup>+</sup>αβ T), naive γδ (CD45RA<sup>+</sup>CCR7<sup>+</sup>γδTCR<sup>+</sup> CD3<sup>+</sup>) T cells, and plasmablasts (CD27<sup>hi</sup>CD38<sup>hi</sup>HLA-DR<sup>+</sup>CD19<sup>+</sup>CD3<sup>-</sup>) among peanut-stimulated and unstimulated PBMCs were comparable across active and placebo participants at week 104 (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1d</xref>; <italic>q</italic> &gt; 0.1).</p>
                <p id="Par10">Analysis of supernatants of peanut-stimulated PBMCs by Luminex assay showed that expression of the Type 2 cytokines IL-4, IL-5, IL-9 and IL-13 was significantly decreased at week 104 in active vs. placebo (<italic>q</italic> = 0.09, 0.006, 0.005 and 0.006, respectively) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c, d</xref>).

                <p id="Par11">While all 51 per-protocol active participants randomized into the avoidance group were successfully desensitized at week 104, 12 weeks of peanut avoidance thereafter led to two distinct clinical outcomes, viz., SU (<italic>n</italic> = 21) vs. DS (<italic>n</italic> = 30) (no vs. with allergic reactions on the 4000 mg DBPCFC at week 117, respectively). To identify changes in immune markers or cell type frequencies that might identify SU participants, we compared immune changes in peanut-stimulated and unstimulated PBMCs from SU participants with those from DS at BL, week 104, and week 117. Interestingly, in both peanut-stimulated and unstimulated PBMCs, differences distinguishing SU vs. DS were identified within CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets but not in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Peanut-reactive (pr) CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (i.e., CD69<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup>) among peanut-stimulated PBMCs of SU participants were primarily of effector memory (EM; CD45RA<sup>-</sup>CCR7<sup>-</sup>) phenotype while those from DS participants exhibited a naive (CD45RA<sup>+</sup>CCR7<sup>+</sup>) phenotype (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). Also, pr CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from DS participants had a significantly higher frequency and expression of CD57 (<italic>q</italic> = 0.079 and 0.079, respectively), a marker of terminal differentiation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). Similarly, EM and TEMRA (CD45RA<sup>+</sup>CCR7) CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets of peanut non-reactive (i.e., CD69<sup>-</sup>) CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells among peanut-stimulated PBMCs from DS participants showed a significantly higher frequency and expression of CD57 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>; <italic>q</italic> = 0.019, 0.05, 0.02 and 0.02, respectively). This CD57 expression pattern among EM and TEMRA CD8<sup>+</sup> cells was evident in unstimulated PBMCs as well (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>; SU vs. DS <italic>q</italic> = 0.05, 0.009, 0.03 and 0.01, respectively). Interestingly, CD56<sup>dim</sup>CD16<sup>+</sup> NK cells, a subset involved in host protective immunity through cytolysis along with CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, from DS participants also showed an elevated frequency and expression of CD57 at BL and at week 117 in peanut-stimulated (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2a</xref>; <italic>q</italic> = 0.059 and 0.068, respectively) and unstimulated PBMCs (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2a</xref>; <italic>q</italic> = 0.02 and 0.01, respectively).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell differentiation status distinguishes SU participants from DS.</title><p>Immune cell subsets among peanut-stimulated (<bold>a</bold>, <bold>b</bold>, <bold>d</bold>, <bold>f</bold>) and unstimulated (<bold>c</bold>, <bold>e</bold>, <bold>g</bold>) PBMCs from SU participants were compared with DS participants at BL, week 104, and week 117. <bold>a</bold>–<bold>c</bold> Significant frequency and CD57 expression differences among pr CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<bold>a</bold>), and peanut non-reactive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<bold>b</bold>) among peanut-stimulated (SU, <italic>n</italic> = 20; DS, <italic>n</italic> = 29), and unstimulated (<bold>c</bold>) (SU, <italic>n</italic> = 20; DS, <italic>n</italic> = 26), BL PBMCs. <bold>d</bold>, <bold>e</bold> Significant differences in the naive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell frequency in peanut-stimulated (<bold>d</bold>) and unstimulated (<bold>e</bold>) PBMCs at BL (pea stim: SU, <italic>n</italic> = 20, DS, <italic>n</italic> = 29; unstim: SU, <italic>n</italic> = 20, DS, <italic>n</italic> = 26), week 104 (pea stim: SU, <italic>n</italic> = 21, DS, <italic>n</italic> = 30; unstim: SU, <italic>n</italic> = 20, DS, <italic>n</italic> = 29), and week 117 (pea stim: SU, <italic>n</italic> = 17, DS, <italic>n</italic> = 27; unstim: SU, <italic>n</italic> = 17, DS, <italic>n</italic> = 27). <bold>f</bold>, <bold>g</bold> Significant differences in the frequency or expression of CD86 in memory B cells among peanut-stimulated PBMCs (<bold>f</bold>) and APC subsets among unstimulated PBMCs (<bold>g</bold>) at BL (pea stim: SU, <italic>n</italic> = 20, DS, <italic>n</italic> = 29; unstim: SU, <italic>n</italic> = 20, DS, <italic>n</italic> = 26). <bold>h</bold> IL-2 levels in peanut-stimulated BL PBMC culture supernatants from SU (<italic>n</italic> = 7) vs. DS (<italic>n</italic> = 7) participants.

                <p id="Par12">In addition, among peanut non-reactive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in peanut-stimulated PBMCs, the frequency of naive CD8<sup>+</sup> cells was substantially lower in SU vs. DS participants at BL, week 104 and week 117 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>; <italic>q</italic> = 0.02, 0.01 and 0.04, respectively). Unstimulated SU vs. DS BL, week 104 and week 117 PBMCs also reflected these differences in naive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell frequency (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>; <italic>q</italic> = 0.02, 0.008 and 0.03, respectively). A significantly reduced frequency of CD8<sup>+</sup> naive T cells among total live cells was also detected in SU vs. DS participants at BL, week 104 and week 117 using unsupervised clustering of peanut-stimulated PBMCs (<italic>q</italic> = 0.09, 0.009 and 0.09, respectively), and unstimulated PBMCs (<italic>q</italic> = 0.09, 0.01 and 0.06, respectively) (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2b–d</xref>). On the contrary, SU participants showed a markedly higher frequency of peanut non-reactive EM CD8<sup>+</sup> cells among peanut-stimulated and ustimulated total CD8<sup>+</sup> cells at week 104, and week 117 PBMCs compared to DS participants (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2e</xref>; <italic>q</italic> = 0.02, 0.03 respectively, and Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2f</xref><italic>q</italic> = 0.025 each).

              <p id="Par22">Our overarching aim for this study was to understand those T-cell changes that might elucidate why SU develops only in a subset of desensitized participants following a period of allergen withdrawal. Using agnostic computer-based learning algorithms as well as hypothesis-based analyses from high dimensional immune studies, our findings suggest a pivotal function of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell differentiation status in defining the likelihood of SU. Our findings suggest that SU is favored by: (i) a lower frequency of terminally differentiated, CD57<sup>+</sup> allergen-reactive, and allergen non-reactive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells possibly coupled with a higher frequency of cytotoxic EM CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, (ii) a lower frequency of naive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, (iii) a lower expression of CD86 on APCs and/or a lower frequency of CD86<sup>+</sup> APCs pre-OIT, and (iv) a lower frequency of IFN-γ<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> memory T effectors post-OIT.</p>
              <p id="Par23">While many clinical studies have confirmed the efficacy of peanut OIT in conferring desensitization, only a handful have tested the induction of SU during the post-avoidance period. Moreover, the immune mechanistic studies performed during a subset of such SU testing trials primarily have been focused on serological readouts (i.e., peanut-specific IgE and IgG4), basophil activation, measurement of Th2 cytokines, and changes in the frequency of total and peanut-reactive CD4<sup>+</sup> Tregs and Teffectors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. A recent study examining longitudinal transcriptional changes and clonality of peanut-reactive Th cell subsets from peanut OIT participants offers further refined insights into OIT-induced changes and features predictive of post-OIT outcome in the context of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. However, a comprehensive evaluation of circulating immune cell frequencies and functional markers, and the cumulative potential impact of any significant changes distinguishing SU in a given OIT cohort, has not been previously performed. Our analyses put forth such an evaluation by employing high dimensional, multi-parametric tools such as mass cytometry and Luminex. Our study thus provides unique insights into immune players in the induction of OIT-induced tolerance.</p>
              <p id="Par24">Notably, we observed significant differences beyond Th2 and Treg subsets while comparing immunophenotypes of SU vs. DS participants within our CyTOF dataset. In agreement with previous reports, attenuation of Th2 phenotype was observed exclusively among active participants post-OIT compared to placebo-treated participants, while no change was noted in the frequencies of pr CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and Tregs post-OIT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Interestingly, in addition to prototypical Th2 cytokines, the frequency of a regulatory cytokine- IL-10<sup>+</sup> pr CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells was seen to be diminished in active participants post-OIT. This might be attributed to an initial autocrine IL-10 induction in pathogenic pr CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in response to peanut dose build-up followed by a marked decrease by week 104 post-OIT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. However, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subset readouts did not significantly distinguish SU vs. DS in our study or those by others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Instead, higher frequencies of naive CD8<sup>+</sup> and lower frequencies of EM CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, at BL and throughout the course of OIT, identified those individuals with less likelihood of becoming SU. Our preliminary data demonstrate that CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from SU participants have higher GzB-mediated cytolytic potential. Of note, GzB has been shown to be critical for TCR-induced death of Th2 cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> thus raising a possibility of EM CD8<sup>+</sup> cell sourced-GzB conferring SU participants a selective advantage by regulating pathogenic peanut-reactive Th2 proliferation, and thus peanut-specific IgE during avoidance. The significant negative correlation observed between the BL frequency of EM CD8<sup>+</sup> cells and peanut-specific as well as Ara h 2-specific IgE reinforces this possibility. Investigations are underway to evaluate how GzB from EM CD8<sup>+</sup> cells may preferentially target immune cell subsets in the IgE pathway, and influence of CD57 expression on GzB function in this context. The higher frequency of naive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, despite higher expression of CD86 on APC subsets and a higher level of IL-2 in peanut-stimulated PBMC culture supernatants, observed in DS compared to SU participants at BL likely implies a higher threshold of activation. Of note, our group has recently reported hypomethylation of the IL-2 locus, and consequently higher levels of IL-2, in peanut-stimulated PBMC culture supernatants as one epigenetic readout distinguishing peanut-allergic twins from their non-allergic counterparts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par25">Concomitantly, a higher frequency and expression of CD57 on EM and TEMRA CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in DS participants suggests terminal differentiation and immunosenescence. Early childhood viral exposure, chronic in vivo inflammation, and natural aging may drive such terminal differentiation. The speculation regarding early childhood viral exposure also is consistent with the significantly lower age of wheezing onset we diagnosed for DS participants (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>).</p>
              <p id="Par26">CD57 and CD27 have reciprocal expression patterns in T cell ontology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Interestingly, terminally differentiated CD27<sup>-</sup>CRTH2<sup>+</sup>CD161<sup>+</sup> memory allergen-reactive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, termed Th2A cells, have been strongly associated with allergies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Despite being frequently associated with senescence, CD57<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells subsets have been reported to be highly proinflammatory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. We also observed a higher frequency of IFNγ<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T effectors among post-OIT PBMCs of DS participants on PMA/Ionomycin stimulation. Thus, taken together, preexistence of terminally differentiated, proinflammatory CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> subsets compounded with a high-activation-threshold, “reluctant-to-differentiate” CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in DS participants, likely pose immune plasticity challenges. These challenges might be mitigated during active dosing of OIT leading to successful desensitization, although they can resurface post-avoidance, and are reflected through clinical relapse/reactivity to allergens.</p>
              <p id="Par27">There are limitations to our study. Firstly, not all immune subsets of interest such as Tfh subsets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, Th2a<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> cells could be monitored through our CyTOF panel. Secondly, a thorough longitudinal analysis inclusive of PBMCs and plasma from additional time points over the course of OIT was not feasible due to limited sample availability. In addition, unlike manual gating, FlowSOM-based unsupervised clustering analysis could not identify certain rare immune cell subsets as clusters, particularly pr CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Semi-supervised cell type annotation algorithm- CyAnno<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> developed by our group will likely yield a better output in this regard. In addition, the ML models used to identify features for classification of SU vs. DS groups were based on small sample size of training and testing datasets, which may have led to model over-fitting, and would be a major limitation of models proposed in this study and features identified. To address this issue, we simulated the real dataset 300 times and built elastic net models for each of them. Here, the elastic net model was applied because it uses L1 and L2 regularization penalties for model building and the algorithm has been proven to be useful for similar cases where the number of features are larger than the number of samples. To further minimize the effect of model over-fitting, we only prioritized the SU vs. DS classification features that are conserved across 300 elastic net model. The current ML model based findings nonetheless warrant validation using a similar, independent dataset of food OIT study participants tested for SU.</p>
              <p id="Par28">Higher levels of allergen- or allergen-component-specific IgE pre-OIT have been reported in the past to predict a negative outcome towards SU<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Frequency of naive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells positively correlated with peanut and Ara h 2-specific IgE, while abundance of CD57<sup>+</sup> pr CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells negatively correlated with the Ara h 2-specific IgG/IgE ratio at BL. Thus, the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell differentiation status, along with the frequency of IL-4<sup>+</sup> and IL-9<sup>+</sup> pr CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, may be considered as potential biomarkers predictive of SU following OIT. Prospective peanut-allergic participants presenting with such skewed CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell differentiation may benefit from continued peanut dosing. In addition, adjunctive treatment with anti-IgE, which has been shown to reduce the frequency of CXCR3<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> could be helpful in certain patients.

              <p id="Par29">The CyTOF and Luminex data presented here confirmed attenuation of Th2 phenotype as well as reduction in proinflammatory cytokines in active participants at week 104 post-OIT. In addition, the Luminex data also showed significant changes in monocyte and DC differentiation-related mediators such as GCSF, GMCSF and FLT3L, as well as a reduction in tissue homeostasis factors viz. IL-22 and VEGF, which warrant further investigation.</p>

The study protocol, patient demographics, and treatment outcomes have been described in detail previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Briefly 120 peanut-allergic participants (age: 7–55 years) were randomized into active vs. placebo group. Participants in the active arm (<italic>n</italic> = 95) were built up and maintained on 4000 mg peanut protein through week 104. Fifty-one of the total per-protocol active arm participants were randomized to discontinue peanut consumption post-week 104 (peanut-0 group).

The downstream steps comprising cell harvesting, staining, were followed as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.

The cells were then washed with CyFACS buffer and barcoded using Cell-ID 20-Plex Pd Barcoding Kit (Fluidigm Co., Product# 201060) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Barcoded cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4 °C. Following a CyFACS wash the next day, equal number of cells per sample were pooled, permeabilized, and stained with intracellular antibody cocktail (Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">1</xref>) for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were then washed twice with permeabilization buffer followed by two washes with CyFACS buffer. Finally, the pooled samples were stained with Ir interchelator, washed twice in CyFACS buffer, followed by one wash in CyPBS and two further washes in MilliQ water. Approximately 300,000 cells per sample in each pool were acquired on a Helios mass cytometer (Fluidigm Co.).
