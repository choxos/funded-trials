                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Bilinguals with aphasia (BWA) present varying degrees of lexical access impairment and recovery across their two languages. Because both languages may benefit from therapy, identifying the optimal target language for treatment is a current challenge for research and clinical practice. Prior research has demonstrated that the BiLex computational model can accurately simulate lexical access in healthy bilinguals, and language impairment and treatment response in bilingual aphasia. Here, we aim to determine whether BiLex can predict treatment outcomes in BWA in the treated and the untreated language and compare these outcome predictions to determine the optimal language for rehabilitation.</p>

                  <p>The study involves a prospective parallel-group, double-blind, randomised controlled trial. Forty-eight Spanish–English BWA will receive 20 sessions of semantic treatment for lexical retrieval deficits in one of their languages and will complete assessments in both languages prior and after treatment. Participants will be randomly assigned to an experimental group receiving treatment in the optimal language determined by the model or a control group receiving treatment in the language opposite to the model’s recommendation. Primary treatment outcomes include naming probes while secondary treatment outcomes include tests tapping additional language domains. Treatment outcomes will be compared across the two groups using 2×2 mixed effect models for repeated measures Analysis of variance (ANOVA) on metrics of treatment effects commonly employed in rehabilitation studies (ie, effect size and percentage change).</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Aphasia, a common speech and language disorder after brain damage, is a crucial target for bilingual rehabilitation given its contribution to the long-term disability and impact on the quality of life of stroke survivors<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> in bilingual societies worldwide. Bilinguals with aphasia (BWA) experience deficits that affect one or both of their languages with varying degrees and patterns of impairment and recovery,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 3</xref> resulting in communicational limitations across multiple sociocultural and linguistic contexts. Speech and language therapy is effective for poststroke aphasia,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> however, most existing evidence on its effectiveness in BWA comes from single case studies or studies with small heterogeneous samples. Current reviews addressing language rehabilitation outcomes in BWA suggest that both languages show potential for treatment-induced recovery<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5–7</xref> although evidence is mixed and remains inconclusive. For instance, some studies have shown that BWA can present treatment gains in the treated language and generalisation effects to the untreated language.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8–13</xref> Yet, other studies have shown benefits in just the treated language but lack of generalisation to the untreated language,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14 15</xref> and even cross-language interference effects.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16 17</xref> Several factors can modulate individual differences in treatment outcomes in BWA<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> including prestroke factors such as bilingual background<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19 20</xref> and poststroke factors such as language impairment<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> and lesion location.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Inter-individual variability may further be influenced by differences in the methodological approach and interventions employed across studies and the language combinations examined across participants, thus limiting the generalisation of prior findings. Overall, the existing behavioural research has contributed to our current understanding of language dysfunction and treatment-induced recovery in BWA. However, the abovementioned limitations have resulted in a lack of evidence-based guidelines that can help clinicians develop optimal rehabilitation plans for BWA<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> and crucially, inform them which language should be targeted in treatment to observe maximum treatment gains across the treated and the untreated language.</p>
              <p>Predictive models of rehabilitation outcomes in aphasia can help evaluate the contribution of relevant factors to language therapy outcomes.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22 23</xref> In BWA, such models may further allow identifying the optimal treatment language and developing treatment plans that increase the likelihood of observing maximum benefits. However, making reliable predictions of treatment effects is challenging as collecting representative patient datasets requires large scale longitudinal studies that are highly demanding and often unfeasible. Computational modeling can offer an alternative promising approach to the prediction of treatment outcomes in BWA while accounting for relevant prestroke and poststroke factors that influence language recovery. Computational models have been used to examine multiple aspects of second language processing in healthy bilinguals<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24–26</xref> and simulate language impairment<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> and treatment response in BWA.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Building on our prior research,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25 27 28</xref> we developed BiLex, a neural network model that can accurately simulate lexical access in Spanish–English healthy bilinguals in both their native (L1) and second (L2) language, while accounting for individual differences in their L2 age of acquisition (AOA), and the relative amounts of lifetime use and exposure to each language.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> The BiLex model has been further employed to simulate lexical access impairment and treatment outcomes in a retrospective sample of 13 Spanish–English BWA.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> This simulation was successfully achieved by (1) modeling prestroke naming ability for each BWA accounting for their age at testing, L2 AoA, and prestroke exposure and use of each language, (2) modeling their L1 and L2 naming impairment by implementing damage to the semantic and phonetic systems of the neural network simulating the bilingual lexicon of each individual and (3) retraining the neural network to simulate treatment effects in each language when therapy is provided in just one language. These simulations demonstrated that BiLex can accurately capture poststroke lexical access impairment and treatment outcomes in each language, thus validating its use to predict treatment response in BWA.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></p>
              <p>The primary objective of this randomised control trial (RCT) is to determine the capacity of our computational model to predict language therapy outcomes in a sample of 48 Spanish–English BWA. Specifically, we aim to examine whether BiLex can accurately determine the optimal treatment language that will result in maximum gains in the treated and the untreated language for each patient by comparing simulated treatment effects when treatment is provided in one language versus the other. To this aim, we will randomly allocate participants to a model-prescribed experimental group receiving therapy in the language defined as optimal by the model, or a model-opposite control group receiving therapy in the opposite language. We hypothesise that BWA treated following the model’s recommendation will show greater treatment outcomes than those who are trained opposite to the model’s recommendation. This RCT involves semantic feature analysis<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> treatment with proved effectiveness in BWA.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 11 32</xref> Because this treatment entails strengthening semantic representations which are shared across languages in bilinguals<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> we expect positive treatment effects in the treated language and some degree of generalisation to the untreated language as shown in prior research.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8–13</xref> Thus, we will examine treatment effects on primary and secondary treatment outcome measures in the treated language and will employ the same metrics to determine the degree of cross-language transfer effects in the untreated language. Secondary objectives include providing a computational explanation for different patterns of cross-language generalisation arising from facilitation and inhibitory mechanisms<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 32</xref> and expanding the architecture and function of the model to Chinese–English to account for a different bilingual combination.</p>

                <p>As part of the initial screening process, recruiting sites will request information relevant to the eligibility of BWA to the referring clinician, institution, or caregivers to determine whether they are potential study participants. Trained clinicians will provide detailed information about study participation in the patient’s preferred language, explain all related procedures and obtain written consent from patients willing to participate in the RCT. Full eligibility will be determined according to inclusion and exclusion criteria (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>) after clinicians obtain the signed consent form during the first session. To ensure eligibility, the patient and caregiver will fill out a patient history form collecting information about demographics, stroke history, medical history, current medications and an overview of current language difficulties. They will also complete a Language Use Questionnaire (LUQ)<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> to examine the patient’s bilingual background and a HIPAA release form to request stroke-related medical records from treating physicians, hospitals and rehabilitation facilities to ensure fulfilment of inclusion criteria (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>). Prospective enrollment will last 5 years between 2018 and 2023 and will include 32 participants in addition to the planned sample size to minimise potential patient attrition.</p>

                <p>All patients will be tested on the Item Selection Naming Test (ISNT) developed to examine naming ability on a large set of 273 unique items of 13 broad semantic categories, including semantically related and unrelated non-cognates (ie, &lt;50% cross-language phonemic overlap). The test will be administered in each language separately to identify items that each patient fails to retrieve correctly in both languages. These items will be used to create six stimuli sets per patient, three sets in English and three sets of their Spanish direct translations. Each set will include 15 items, for a total of 45 unique words and their translations (<xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref>). SET 1 will include treated words and their translations, SET 2 will include words that are semantically related to those in SET 1 (ie, semantic category coordinates) and their translations, and SET 3 will include words that are semantically unrelated to those in SET 1 and their translations. Word pairs in SET 1 and SET 2 will be sister terms as verified on the online lexical database Wordnet available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://wordnet.princeton.edu/">https://wordnet.princeton.edu/</ext-link>. If the ISNT does not provide enough items that the patient fails to name in both languages to create the stimuli sets, clinicians can select items from the 60-item naming screener<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> or test the patient on an additional naming screener with novel items. All stimuli sets will be unique to each patient reflecting their particular naming deficits across both languages.</p>

Three baseline naming probes will be conducted on three different sessions (maximum gap of 1 week between probes) prior to treatment to establish individual baseline naming performance. Baselines will be considered stable when they show no more than 30% variability.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Two additional baseline probes will be administered for patients showing larger performance variability. Ten treatment naming probes will be conducted, one at the beginning of every second session of a week of treatment. Three post-treatment naming probes will be completed after treatment on three different sessions (maximum gap of 1 week between probes) to examine the maintenance of treatment effects once treatment is interrupted.</p>
                <p>Each naming probe will present all 45 pictures with a language-blocked design (ie, all items tested in one language first and tested again in the other language) and language order will be counterbalanced across sessions. The order of presentation will be pseudo-randomised to avoid the sequential order of items from the same semantic category. Pictures will be presented on a computer and clinicians will record responses without providing accuracy feedback. All naming probes will credit one point for each response produced in the target language that involves the target word, an acceptable variation of it or a production that deviates from the correct response by one phoneme. Incorrect responses including instances of language mixing will be analysed following an error scoring system reported elsewhere.<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> Naming probe scores will be recorded on a spreadsheet that graphs the trend lines across baseline, treatment and post-treatment naming probes for each patient.</p>

                <p>Treatment steps encompassed in our intervention may target additional language domains other than naming ability. Although BiLex will not predict treatment responsiveness as measured by secondary outcome measures, treatment effects will also be reported using secondary outcome measures of semantic knowledge, lexical-semantic processing, comprehension, single word and sentence production, and executive function (see <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref> for standardised tests and specific measurement variables). In all cases, pre-treatment and post-treatment will be the specific measurement time points of interest for analysis. Change from pre-treatment to post-treatment will be considered the metric for participant-level analysis and mean group values will be computed as method of aggregation. All outcome measures are considered reproducible, relevant and sensitive to measure change in post-stroke aphasia and have been used in prior bilingual aphasia rehabilitation research.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 8–17 21 32</xref></p>

                <p>The BiLex computational model<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> will be employed to conduct 50 independent simulations per patient, with each simulation leading to a predicted treatment outcome in each language separately (ie, percentage of items incorrectly named in the baseline naming probes that were correctly named after treatment). Next, BiLex will compare treatment outcomes (eg, outcomes in the treated and untreated language when treatment is provided in English, vs outcomes in the treated and untreated language when treatment is provided in Spanish) by adding up the treatment effects in both treated and untreated language for each simulation and computing the number of simulations that predict a larger overall effect for treatment in English versus treatment in Spanish. This comparison will enable BiLex to predict the optimal language for treatment (ie, the language with ≥10% of all 50 simulations showing superior outcomes when treatment is provided in one language over the other). When BiLex has no clear recommendation (ie, the difference in simulated outcomes for treatment in English vs treatment in Spanish is &lt;10%), it will compute the median treatment effect for all 50 simulations for each treatment language and will predict the optimal language of treatment using a different criterion (ie, the language showing a median difference ≥5% relative to the other language will be determined as being more optimal for treatment). All simulations will use the same input data for each patient including their age at testing, LUQ metrics including L2 AoA, lifetime exposure to each language, and prestroke language use to simulate prestroke naming abilities in each language (the use of these LUQ metrics in simulations will be similar to our previous work described in detail elsewhere.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Also, their age at stroke onset, and poststroke semantic (ie, Pyramid and Palm Trees Test<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> Scores) and naming performance (ie, scores on the Boston Naming Test,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36 37</xref> 60-item naming screener<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> and baseline naming probes) in each language will be used to simulate post-stroke language deficits and treatment response as previously reported.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></p>

                <title>Randomisation and group allocation</title>
                <p>The laboratory manager will use a pre-defined non-stratified randomisation module in REDCap<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> (concealed to all other team members involved in the RCT) to randomly assign each patient to one of the 25 slots available for each intervention group in the randomisation sequence: the experimental model-prescribed group receiving language therapy in the optimal language defined by the computational model, or the control model-opposite group receiving therapy in the opposite non-prescribed language (allocation ratio of 1:1). Following the order of enrollment and on completion of baseline assessments, the computer scientist of the team will receive the relevant input data of each patient to conduct the simulations that will define his or her optimal language of treatment, and will inform the laboratory manager about the treatment language chosen for each patient. Next, the laboratory manager will enter the patient ID code into the randomisation module to assign the patient to the model-prescribed or the model-opposite group and will inform the treating clinician of the language chosen for treatment (eg, if the predicted language for a given patient is English and the randomisation module returns ‘model-opposite group’, the laboratory manager will inform the treating clinician that Spanish will be the treatment language and the patient will receive treatment accordingly). Because current clinical services for BWA depend on geographic location, availability of bilingual speech-language pathologists, the patient’s language proficiency and personal preference, it is surmised that when all these factors are considered, patients may receive English or Spanish treatment at a 50% probability. Our experimental design reflects this 50% probability of receiving treatment in any one language by using a fully randomised allocation to the model-prescribed or model-opposite group. The same procedure schedule (ie, 10 weeks of treatment with testing prior and after treatment) will be followed by each group and the language targeted in treatment (ie, prescribed vs opposite) will be the only characteristic differing across groups. For consistency with the computational procedure, treatment will only be provided in one language whether or not cross-language generalisation is observed.</p>

                <p>The predictive capacity of the computational model will be confirmed when it demonstrates an accurate prediction of both optimal rehabilitation and sub-optimal rehabilitation outcomes. To this aim, we will compare primary treatment outcomes for the model-prescribed group with those of the model-opposite group using 2 (Group)×2 (Time-point: pre and post-treatment) mixed effect models for repeated measures Analysis of variance (ANOVA) on effect size (ES) and percentage change (PC) measuring treatment effects, using a random intercept and random slope for time model to account for within-subject variation over time.</p>
                <p>ES and PC allow measuring the extent to which changes in primary treatment outcomes from prior to after treatment are statistically reliable. ES will be calculated as ((mean of post-treatment probes-mean of baseline probes)/SD of baseline).<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> In our previous work using the same treatment for BWA,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> ES have ranged from 0 to 16.5 (Mean=9.0) for trained items, from 0 to 13.7 (Mean=3.1) for the semantically related items and from 0 to 10.6 (Mean=2.18) for translations. Control set effect sizes ranged from 0 to 6.8 (Mean=1.7). Thus, the average effect size based on our preliminary data is 3.4. Our RCT sample size (n=48) will have at least 80% power to detect large effect sizes (ie, ES ≥0.8) indicating significant change in primary treatment outcomes.<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> PC will be calculated as (mean of three post-treatment probes−mean of three pre-treatment probes) and will also be used to measure change in secondary treatment outcomes after treatment. Additionally, each model-prescribed patient will be matched to a model-opposite patient using propensity sampling in terms of age, L2 AoA, language exposure and degree of impairment in the two languages and we will compare differences between patient pairs in their time-series slope using simple paired t-tests. We expect that model-prescribed patients will show significantly higher slopes than the model-opposite patients. While we plan to complete a per-protocol analysis, secondary analysis of the data will also include intention-to-treat analysis to avoid selection bias.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>The last few decades of bilingual aphasia research have shown that BWA require assessment and treatment options that respond to their specific individual patterns of deficits and communicational needs in each language while considering their individual history of bilingualism. While there is evidence that both languages show potential for recovery in BWA,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5–7</xref> the crucial question regarding which language should be targeted in their treatment to observe maximum therapy outcomes remains unanswered. This RCT will address this question employing a computational modeling approach<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> that accounts for factors known to determine recovery in BWA including prestroke bilingual background and poststroke impairment to predict individual treatment response.</p>
              <p>The results of this RCT will contribute to the field of bilingual aphasia rehabilitation in several ways. Findings from this study may be of great clinical significance as they may inform clinicians which language to target in treatment and how much cross-language generalisation can be expected by treating one language versus the other considering the particular characteristics of each patient. If therapy in either language is available and cross-language transfer effects are to be expected, choosing the optimal language for therapy becomes crucial to improve treatment cost-benefits for BWA. If therapy is available in just one language, knowing which language to target in treatment can inform monolingual clinicians about when to seek assistance to treat a patient in the other language. Given its large patient cohort, this RCT may also inform about patterns of treatment-induced recovery according to specific bilingual profiles (ie, treatment response, extent of recovery and cross-language transfer for bilinguals with balanced vs unbalanced proficiency, and according to degree and type of impairment across languages). Our study may also contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms of language recovery in BWA during rehabilitation. Because parallel activation of the two language representation systems exists in bilinguals,<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref> facilitation and inhibition mechanisms may provide an explanation for the presence or absence of generalisation effects in BWA<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 32</xref> although they are not well understood. Retrospective computational simulations with patient treatment data may help understanding such mechanisms via a systematic variation of (1) facilitatory spreading activation of treated to untreated language representations within the treated language and across languages or (2) lateral inhibition between specific representations within and across languages. These simulations may provide a mechanistic account for the presence and absence of generalisation, and interference effects reported in the literature.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8–17</xref> Another factor that may influence individual variation in treatment response across BWA is language distance.<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref> Although our computational model simulates lexical access in Spanish–English speakers, it can expand its simulations to other language combinations by changing specific language representations while preserving its essential architecture. Thus, BiLex may predict treatment outcomes for BWA with different language combinations.</p>
              <p>Finally, this work can contribute to the development of optimal rehabilitation protocols for BWA as comprehensively described therapy protocols for this population are rather uncommon. This protocol describes a RCT looking at the effects of semantic treatment for word finding deficits in the largest sample of BWA to be studied yet. Thus, it can guide future rehabilitation studies on study feasibility, documented procedures, selection of outcome measures and methods for delivering therapy. This RCT involves a few limitations including the fact that treatment targets specific concrete nouns and may present only limited generalisation to other word types and language measures, and the absence of follow-up assessments. Future research should address simulations of outcomes for different types of language therapy and include long-term assessments to evaluate the maintenance of treatment effects. To conclude, the present work will provide evidence of the feasibility of employing computational models to predict rehabilitation outcomes for BWA and will demonstrate the validity of using this approach in RCT studies. In the future, computational models may help optimise therapeutic interventions and reduce disability in BWA by considering an accurate characterisation of bilingual background and language deficits after brain damage.</p>
