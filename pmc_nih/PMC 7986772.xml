                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Advances in HIV treatment have proven to be effective in increasing virological suppression, thereby decreasing morbidity, and increasing survival. Medication adherence is an important factor in reducing viral load among people living with HIV (PLWH) and in the elimination of transmission of HIV to uninfected partners. Achieving optimal medication adherence involves individuals taking their medications every day or as prescribed by their provider. However, not all PLWH in the USA are engaged in care, and only a minority have achieved suppressed viral load (viral load that is lower than the detectable limit of the assay). Sexual and gender minorities (SGM; those who do not identify as heterosexual or those who do not identify as the sex they were assigned at birth) represent a high-risk population for poor clinical outcomes and increased risk of HIV transmission, as they face barriers that can prevent optimal engagement in HIV care. Research in dyadic support, specifically within primary romantic partnerships, offers a promising avenue to improving engagement in care and treatment outcomes among SGM couples. Dyadic interventions, especially focused on primary romantic partnerships, have the potential to have a sustained impact after the structured intervention ends.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>This paper describes the protocol for a randomised control trial of a theory-grounded, piloted intervention (DuoPACT) that cultivates and leverages the inherent sources of support within primary romantic relationships to improve engagement in HIV care and thus clinical outcomes among persons who are living with HIV and who identify as SGM (or their partners). Eligible participants must report being in a primary romantic relationship for at least 3 months, speak English, at least one partner must identify as a sexual or gender minority and at least one partner must be HIV+ with suboptimal engagement in HIV care, defined as less than excellent medication adherence, having not seen a provider in at least the past 8 months, having a detectable or unknown viral load or not currently on antiretroviral therapy. Eligible consenting couples are allocated equally to the two study arms: a structured six-session couples counselling intervention (DuoPACT) or a three-session individually-delivered HIV adherence counselling intervention (LifeSteps). The primary aim is to evaluate the efficacy of DuoPACT on virological suppression among HIV+ members of SGM couples with suboptimal engagement in care. The DuoPACT study began its target enrolment of 150 couples (300 individuals) in August 2017, and will continue to enrol until June 2021.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Engagement in HIV care, including high levels of adherence to antiretroviral treatment (ART), is essential for managing HIV infection and for ending the HIV epidemic.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> Consistent medication adherence is linked to viral suppression, which allows people living with HIV (PLWH) to live longer and healthier lives, and viral suppression can eliminate the potential for further transmission to uninfected sexual partners.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Suboptimal medication adherence reduces the chances of suppressing HIV viral load in PLWH. The HIV care cascade (also referred to as the care continuum) conceptualises the level of engagement in care in PLWH throughout the USA and has been used as a framework to address the barriers many people face managing their health and HIV treatment.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> As of 2016, 49% of PLWH in the USA were estimated to be retained in care, and only 53% of those had achieved viral suppression.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Barriers associated with successful medication adherence, a key component of the continuum, include medication fatigue, side effects from the medications and forgetfulness.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 7</xref> In addition, there are gaps within other parts of the HIV care continuum, such as retention in care, that prevent PLWH from achieving viral suppression.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 9</xref> Recent research has focused on social support between dyads, specifically among romantic partnerships, which shows promise in addressing some of these gaps.</p>
              <p>Being in a primary relationship can provide health-promoting benefits through tangible and emotional support, and various kinds of social support are associated with positive outcomes for people living with chronic illnesses.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10–19</xref> Within the context of couples affected by HIV, there is evidence that social support from primary romantic partnerships is associated with better HIV care engagement, such as ART adherence, compared with social support from people other than romantic partners.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20–24</xref></p>
              <p>Although the preponderance of evidence suggests an overall positive impact from partners on many outcomes in healthcare, being in a relationship can also present challenges to HIV care engagement. Partners may have different roles in the dyad, such as a caretaker, that may prevent a person from taking care of themselves while taking care of their partner, which includes preventing them from taking care of their own HIV infection or other health demands.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Negative influences, such as substance use, conflict, abuse and violence can also prevent optimal engagement in care for one or both partners in the dyad.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></p>
              <p>Overall, however, the evidence supports the premise that social support within a relationship dyad has more positive than negative impact on HIV and other health-related outcomes. By extension, interventions designed to improve communication, emotional support and involvement in healthcare within dyads can improve health behaviours such as engagement in care. This is particularly true for some subpopulations in the USA, in which the HIV epidemic continues to be concentrated, including sexual and gender minority (SGM) individuals and their sexual partners.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> As many as half to three-quarters of HIV transmissions among sexual minority persons likely occur within the context of primary romantic relationships.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> While there are not parallel modelling data for gender minority persons, the worldwide prevalence of HIV among transgender persons is 49 times higher than among other groups.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Collectively, these data support a focus on continued innovation and intervention for preventing HIV and optimising treatment among SGM persons and their partners.</p>

                <title>Aim of the study</title>
                <p>The primary objective of the DuoPACT study is to test a couple-level HIV intervention designed for SGM couples in sero-discordant or sero-concordant HIV-positive relationships that have evidence of poor engagement in care. The purpose of the intervention is to leverage and shape relationship dynamics to improve engagement in HIV care. Such an approach has the potential to be a powerful, cost-effective and sustainable tool to optimise treatment outcomes among couples affected by HIV. Due to lower viral loads being a quantitative element associated with better engagement in care, the study team uses HIV-1 RNA quantitative real-time PCR to analyse the trend of viral loads among participants living with HIV. The study will evaluate the efficacy of DuoPACT on the primary outcome of virological suppression among SGM PLWH in primary relationships.</p>

                <p>The study is a randomised control trial with 150 couples (300 individuals) in the San Francisco Bay Area in Northern California (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>). Recruitment began in August 2017 and will continue until June 2021, with final data collection complete in March 2022. Participation in the study takes a total of 9 months, with surveys conducted at baseline, 3, 6 and 9 months. The primary trial outcome is HIV virological suppression, as measured by laboratory assay. Secondary outcomes include behavioural indicators of engagement in HIV care, including ART adherence, HIV care appointment attendance, as well as use of PrEP for HIV-uninfected partners, a highly effective daily HIV medication that can prevent HIV infection following sexual exposure.</p>

                <p>The study sample consists of primary romantic couples, in which at least one partner identifies as SGM, both are age 18 or older and who describe each other as ‘a partner to whom they feel committed above anyone else and with whom they have had a sexual relationship’. At least one partner must be HIV+ and report suboptimal engagement in HIV care defined as one or more of the following: less than excellent medication adherence, having not seen a provider in at least the past 8 months, having a detectable or unknown viral load or is not currently (for the past 30 days) on ART. Less than excellent medication adherence is operationalised as reporting anything other than excellent on a validated single-item adherence rating scale that asks ‘Thinking back over the past 30 days, how would you rate your ability to take your HIV medications as prescribed?’ Response choices include excellent, very good, good, poor and very poor, with responses validated with viral load and electronic adherence measurements.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31 32</xref> See <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="B1">box 1</xref> for full inclusion criteria.</p>

                <title>Recruitment strategy</title>
                <p>Participants are recruited through venue-based and online strategies as well as referral. Flyers are posted in venues (LGBTQ resource centres, bars, coffee shops and so on), community-based organisations (CBOs), clinics, pharmacies and community bulletin boards. Staff distribute packets with study materials, including an information sheet outlining the basic eligibility criteria, flyers and postcards, to clinics and CBOs throughout the Greater Bay Area. Providers and CBOs are asked to place these materials in waiting areas where potential participants are likely to see them. Study advertisements are posted online on Craigslist and Facebook and through dating/hook-up applications such as Growlr and Grindr.</p>
                <p>In-person study recruitment takes place in HIV clinic waiting rooms. Recruiters present the study at staff/provider meetings in clinics throughout the Bay Area that have a high number of patients living with HIV to facilitate referral to the study. Recruiters also staff tables at symposia, conferences and community events to continue collaboration with HIV healthcare providers as well as connect with members of the community that may be interested in participating in the study.</p>
                <p>All recruitment materials include a toll-free number and a link to the study webpage. Interested potential participants are directed to call the number listed on the recruitment resources or fill out the Contact Us form to learn more about the study and initiate the screening process. Study staff are notified when a potential participant completes the form and contact within one business day to ensure a higher chance of contact.</p>
                <p>Enrolled participants have the opportunity to refer couples to the study via a ‘snowball’ recruitment method. To maintain confidentiality of the enrolled participants, potential participants are asked ‘how did you hear about the study’ and must mention the name of the participant that referred them. To maintain confidentiality, staff cannot confirm nor deny whether the participant identified is enrolled in the study.</p>

                <title>Screening procedures</title>
                <p>To determine eligibility, callers undergo a phone screening procedure, in which staff relay background about the study and ask a series of questions to determine eligibility, as per the criteria outlined above. Both individuals in the dyad must separately complete the phone screening process to determine eligibility. We have found in previous studies that when some individuals who are screened out figure out the particular exclusion criteria, they may call again with altered information in order to qualify. To prevent the potential for such misrepresentation, individuals are screened to the end of the phone screen form so that ineligible individuals will not readily be able to discern the criteria that excluded them. If an individual is screened as ineligible, the study will not contact their partner for screening.</p>

                <title>Couple status verification</title>
                <p>With couple-level studies that offer remuneration for participation, there is a risk of potential participants attempting to fake their relationship status or other inclusion criteria to enrol in the study. Therefore, a series of questions have been adapted from McMahon and colleagues to increase confidence that the individuals are indeed in a primary romantic relationship with each other.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> In this screening, each individual has to corroborate details from each other’s lives such as: (1) Where did your partner live before living in the Bay Area? (2) When is your partner’s birthday? (or at least what month?) (3) How old is your partner? (4) If they report not living together, ‘What street does your partner live on?’ Similar to McMahon’s protocol, we are lenient on the answers given between the dyad, as some relationships may be as recent as 3 months, and it is not uncommon for couples to live separately. Because these procedures are not fool-proof, when inconsistencies in responses between the two members of a dyad emerge, interviewers consult with senior project leadership to determine whether answers were sufficient to verify couple status. Rarely, more in-depth questions about the dyad are asked.</p>

                <title>Study enrolment</title>
                <p>Eligible and interested couples are scheduled for an in-person enrolment visit, requiring that both members of the couple present together in person. They are directed to bring proof of HIV status, which can be an official list of medications from their pharmacy, their HIV medication bottle with their name on it or a letter of diagnosis from their provider. To minimise the possibility that one partner is pressuring the other to participate, partners are consented in separate rooms. Trained staff read and give a detailed explanation of what to expect in the study, potential risks, compensation, as well as their rights as a research participant. To continue with the enrolment process, both partners must independently agree to the study procedures and sign their respective consent forms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">online supplemental form 2</xref>). Each participant is given a copy of the consent document and another copy is securely kept with the study file. After the participant provides informed consent, staff collect detailed contact information, and a medical records release authorisation form to contact HIV care providers is also obtained in order to secure CD4 and viral load results if needed. A baseline visit is scheduled for 2 weeks later to allow time for laboratory procedures.</p>
                <p>Participants who are living with HIV are directed to have their blood drawn for viral load and CD4 count at their choice of 1 of 40 community laboratory centres located throughout the area prior to their baseline survey visit. Participants are oriented to the service centre locations and hours of operation and are given a requisition for laboratory assays, labelled with participants' study ID and date of birth to minimise error with specimen mix-ups. Additionally, if a participant loses a paper requisition, study staff can send it electronically to the laboratory via a secure laboratory database, and date of birth will allow laboratory staff to verify participant identity with this minimal identifier. Laboratory results are posted to a secure online system for controlled access by study staff.</p>
                <p>At the in-person baseline survey visit, participants are separated into separate private rooms to complete their own computer-assisted personal interviewing survey using Qualtrics (Provo, Utah, USA). The survey contains a series of validated measures focusing on adherence, medication use, partner support, relationship dynamics, behavioural health issues, as well as other important factors in their overall engagement in healthcare. The survey focuses on the participant’s relationship with their partner, communication, intimacy, conflict, social support and the role of HIV medications in their relationship. Relationship quality and closeness are measured through the survey using the Kurdek Commitment Scale.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Partner perceptions of closeness and autonomy were previously found to be significantly associated with adherence and virological suppression.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35 36</xref> Therefore, the survey includes questions about Inclusion of Other in the Self using a figure that has a set of circles with varying degree of overlap which best reflects their overall relationship and another set of circles which describes their engagement in each partner’s healthcare.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> The survey questions assess reports of medication adherence,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31 38</xref> the participant’s knowledge of their partner’s medication adherence,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> adherence self-efficacy<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> and reports of recent HIV healthcare appointment attendance.

                <title>Randomisation</title>
                <p>Once participants complete the baseline surveys, they are brought back together and are randomised as a couple (stratified by couple-level HIV serostatus) to one of two study conditions: (1) the DuoPACT couple intervention, which comprises a series of six couple sessions delivered weekly; or (2) LifeSteps, a three-session individual intervention for HIV+ partners who meet inclusion criterion suggesting suboptimal engagement in HIV care. Couples are randomised to study conditions via a 1:1 allocation ratio. Reflecting the stratified nature of the study design, separate randomisation lists were created for HIV-discordant and HIV-concordant negative couples. Within each stratum, couples are randomised using randomly-permuted block sizes of 2, 4 and 6. Randomisation is done via Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap). REDCap is a secure platform that is HIPPAA compliant and stores highly sensitive information.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> The first counselling session is usually scheduled within the subsequent week.</p>

                  <title>Experimental intervention</title>
                  <p>The DuoPACT intervention comprises 6 weekly couples’ sessions. Each session lasts 60–90 min and focuses on communication in the relationship and support for each other’s health and adherence to medical regimens (both ART for treatment and PrEP). The partners learn and practice communication skills, work on aligning support tactics (eg, reminding to take medications, go to clinic appointment with partner) and set goals related to their own health and medication adherence as well as supporting their partner’s health. They also practice problem solving as a couple and amplifying positive moments in the relationship. In between sessions, the couples are asked to track times each of them felt supported by their partner around their health.

                <p>Participants living with HIV complete three follow-up blood draws, and all participants complete 3, 6 and 9 month surveys regardless of study arm. Once each follow-up blood draw has been completed, each participant is electronically sent a personal Qualtrics link to a follow-up survey that they complete on their own device at any WIFI enabled convenient location. Each participant is asked to complete the assessment separately. If a participant does not have email, or a WIFI enabled device/access, they can come to our study office to complete the follow-up survey on our tablet. Follow-up surveys take approximately 1 hour to complete and include the core measures from the baseline. The final (9 month) assessment also includes a satisfaction and acceptability measure based on the Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></p>

Finally, recent recommendations in the literature point to the superior performance of generalised estimating equations (GEE) relative to generalised linear mixed models for the analysis of dyadic data with categorical outcomes (eg, virological suppression).<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref> Accordingly, GEE will be used to perform the proposed primary analysis, which is a planned time-averaged comparison of post-baseline measurements across the intervention and control groups to test primary Hypothesis 1. Alpha will be set at 0.05 for this planned comparison. Any additional post-hoc comparisons (eg, paired comparisons of the two study arms at each time point) will maintain nominal α=0.05 through the use of simulation-based stepdown multiple comparison methods.<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref> The alternating logistic regression approach implemented in SAS PROC GENMOD can be used to address the three-level clustering of observations within participants and participants within dyads.

These analyses will also investigate whether these constructs mediate the relationship between intervention group assignment and virological suppression and whether couple HIV-serostatus and cohabitation moderate these associations. Main and interaction effects of couple drug and alcohol use and racial concordance will also be evaluated in these models. Mediation and moderation will be assessed using the causal inference-based approach of Valeri and Vanderweele, which yields optimal estimates of indirect effects in the presence of binary outcomes and moderator–mediator interactions.<xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref> Mplus will be used to fit causal mediation models because it can adjust SEs for nesting of participants within couples.<xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref> Additional secondary analyses will consider the effects of intervention dose exposure on virological suppression as a main effect and as moderated and mediated by theory-based constructs described above to determine for whom and via which mechanisms of action intervention dosing is most efficacious.

We will extend the analyses described above to include actor and partner effects for continuous covariates and mediators. Actor effects describe the influence that one’s standing on independent or mediating variables of interest (eg, communication, intimacy) has on one’s own dependent variables (eg, self’s virological suppression) whereas partner effects describe the influence that one’s standing on independent variables has on the dependent variables of one’s partner (eg, partner’s virological suppression). This technique illuminates the effects that partners in intimate relationships can have on both their own and their partner’s behaviour. Actor and partner effects can be evaluated in models with either continuous<xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref> (eg, healthcare empowerment, adherence self-efficacy) or categorical dependent variables (eg, virological suppression).<xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref> A closely related approach uses sums and differences of continuous covariates and mediators to quantify within-couple and between-couple effects.

                  <p>Power analyses were generated using the two-group repeated proportions module in NCSS PASS<xref rid="R68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref> to compute minimum detectable effect sizes for the primary analysis to address Hypothesis 1. The study will begin with 300 participants from 150 couples evenly assigned to the intervention and control groups. We further assume half of the couples will be HIV sero-discordant (N=150) and half will be sero-concordant (N=150). Under these assumptions, three-quarters (N=180) of the 240 participants will be living with HIV and therefore have virological suppression outcome data. Due to the clustered nature of the dyadic data, observations from participants who belong to the same couple who are living with HIV will be correlated. In our previous Duo observational study of couples, for instance, the average within-couple correlation of viral load measurements was r=0.23. Accordingly, we lowered the effective sample size (ESS) input for the power analyses to be ESS=N/DEFF for these couples, where DEFF is the design effect or variance inflation attributable to using correlated data. DEFF is computed as 1+(M–1)<italic>×</italic>r, where M is the number of participants per dyad (ie, two). Therefore DEFF=1+(2–1)×0.23=1.23, so ESS for HIV-concordant couples is 150 HIV participants in HIV-concordant couples/1.23=122. For HIV-discordant couples, 75 participants will be living with HIV and since their outcome values should be statistically independent, no design effect adjustment is required for this subset of couples. Thus, the total ESS for the proposed primary analysis incorporating members from both sero-concordant and sero-discordant couples is 122+75=197. Further assuming 20% attrition, the post-attrition ESS will be 197×(1–0.20)=158 for analysis at all time points. Assuming, α=0.05, power=0.80 and ESS=158, we computed the minimum detectable OR, proportion difference (pdiff) and standardised proportion difference (h) for the proposed time-averaged comparisons, assuming three post-baseline measurements and assuming a wide range within-subject correlation values, r, which were varied between 0.20 and 0.80. Because the virological suppression base rates P<sub>0</sub> are also unknown, we considered several scenarios: low (P<sub>0</sub>=30%), medium (P<sub>0</sub>=50%) and high (P<sub>0</sub>=80%). Under these assumptions, the minimum detectable effect size estimates for our primary analyses range from 10.4% to 20.1% for raw pdiffs; standardised effect size estimates (h) range from 0.30 to 0.41, which are between published benchmarks of 0.20 and 0.50 for small and medium standardised effect sizes,<xref rid="R69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref> respectively. These results suggest that our primary analysis will have sufficient power to detect effects that are between small and medium across a wide range of potential analytical scenarios (see <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>).</p>

              <p>HIV care is a lifelong process that can create challenges for PLWH. Dyadic support within couple relationships provides an opportunity for partners in primary romantic relationships to help address the barriers associated with their HIV care engagement. By developing an intervention that focuses on partner support, communication, problem solving as a couple, relationship strengths and social support, couples can develop important skills to maintain active and successful engagement in their HIV care. Couple-level interventions have the potential to continue to have a sustained impact after the formal intervention ends, as the partner takes on an active and sustained role in supporting target behaviours. Optimal engagement in care will subsequently lead to virological suppression, leading to increased survival and quality of life, decreased morbidity and reduced likelihood of transmission of HIV to previously uninfected partners.</p>
