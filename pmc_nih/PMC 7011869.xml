                  <title>Objective</title>
                  <p>To study vamorolone, a first-in-class steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD).</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>An open-label, multiple-ascending-dose study of vamorolone was conducted in 48 boys with DMD (age 4–&lt;7 years, steroid-naive). Dose levels were 0.25, 0.75, 2.0, and 6.0 mg/kg/d in an oral suspension formulation (12 boys per dose level; one-third to 10 times the glucocorticoid dose in DMD). The primary goal was to define optimal doses of vamorolone. The primary outcome for clinical efficacy was time to stand from supine velocity.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Oral administration of vamorolone at all doses tested was safe and well tolerated over the 24-week treatment period. The 2.0–mg/kg/d dose group met the primary efficacy outcome of improved muscle function (time to stand; 24 weeks of vamorolone treatment vs natural history controls), without evidence of most adverse effects of glucocorticoids. A biomarker of bone formation, osteocalcin, increased in vamorolone-treated boys, suggesting possible loss of bone morbidities seen with glucocorticoids. Biomarker outcomes for adrenal suppression and insulin resistance were also lower in vamorolone-treated patients with DMD relative to published studies of glucocorticoid therapy.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>Daily vamorolone treatment suggested efficacy at doses of 2.0 and 6.0 mg/kg/d in an exploratory 24-week open-label study.</p>

                  <title>Classification of evidence</title>
                  <p>This study provides Class IV evidence that for boys with DMD, vamorolone demonstrated possible efficacy compared to a natural history cohort of glucocorticoid-naive patients and appeared to be tolerated.</p>

            <p>The potent anti-inflammatory efficacy of an adrenal steroid, 17-hydroxy-11-dehydrocorticosterone, was first reported in 14 patients with arthritis in 1949,<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> and the 1950 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was quickly awarded.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Glucocorticoid treatment is effective for many inflammatory disorders; however, long-term treatment is associated with significant adverse effects. These are particularly problematic in the very young and the elderly.</p>
            <p>Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a progressive disorder caused by dystrophin deficiency in muscle.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Glucocorticoids are the standard of care for DMD, delaying loss of ambulation caused by this condition for 2 to 4 years<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Activation of the proinflammatory nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway, the target of glucocorticoids, is seen soon after birth in muscle of patients with DMD.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup></p>
            <p>Vamorolone is a novel drug that appears to optimize traditional steroidal anti-inflammatory activities: transactivation (gene transcription via GRE-mediated binding of ligand/receptor dimers) is lost; transrepression (NF-κB inhibition anti-inflammatory activity) is retained; physiochemical membrane stabilization properties are improved; and mineralocorticoid receptor activity is changed from agonist to antagonist.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">–</xref><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Studies of vamorolone in animal models of chronic inflammatory states, including DMD mouse models, have shown retention of anti-inflammatory efficacy and loss of adverse effects compared to prednisolone.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">–</xref><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> The retention of anti-inflammatory efficacy and loss of side effects in preclinical models are consistent with vamorolone blocking NF-κB–associated proinflammatory signals as a ligand/receptor monomeric state instead of the traditional molecular models of ligand/receptor dimeric complexes.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> A phase 1 study of vamorolone in healthy adult men<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> and a 2-week treatment, 2-week washout, 4-week phase 2a study in patients with DMD<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> showed an improved profile of typical glucocorticoid-like safety concerns as measured by serum biomarkers after 2 weeks of treatment. Vamorolone showed pharmacokinetics and metabolism similar to those of corticosteroids and is similarly administered with daily oral dosing.<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> The 48 patients with DMD enrolled in the 4 week phase 2a study (VBP15-002) were then enrolled in a 24-week extension study (VBP15-003) to test for drug efficacy, and the latter study is reported here.</p>

              <sec id="s1-1">
                <title>Study design and participants</title>
                <p>The primary research questions were to assess whether there was a dose-response relationship of orally administered vamorolone to improvement of gross motor strength and endurance through a dose-escalation study design and to assess the extent to which vamorolone has the pharmacodynamic safety concerns of glucocorticoids. The classification of level of evidence assigned to these questions was considered Class IV. Statistical adjustments for multiple testing (type 1 error) were not possible due to the multiple doses (n = 4) being tested and compared in a first-in-patient study of limited size and scope.</p>
                <p>This open-label clinical trial included 2 sequential clinical trials involving the same 48 pediatric patients with DMD. The first trial, VBP15-002, was a first-in-patient study using a traditional multiple-ascending-dose design, with the primary outcome of safety and toxicity. Participants were boys 4 to &lt;7 years old diagnosed with DMD with molecular criteria (gene or protein studies) who had never been treated with glucocorticoids. Twelve patients were enrolled in each dose group, with 4 dose groups sequentially enrolled over a 24-fold dose range (0.25, 0.75, 2.0, 6.0 mg/kg/d) (n = 48). Each dose group was monitored for safety, with each child treated with vamorolone for 2 weeks of daily treatment, followed by 2 weeks of washout (no drug treatment), before beginning recruitment into the next dose group. The findings of this initial multiple-ascending-dose study have been published.<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> To fulfill the intent to treat required for clinical studies in children, all participants enrolled in VBP15-002 were subsequently enrolled in a 24-week extension phase at the same dose (VBP15-003). The results of VBP15-003 are reported here. The clinical trials were designed with Food and Drug Administration advice (Investigational New Drug 11,8942) and European Medicines Agency guidance (EMEA-001794-PIP02-16).</p>
                <p>The trials were designed with sample sizes needed to detect a glucocorticoid effect on timed function tests and change in body mass index (BMI) <italic toggle="yes">z</italic> score by comparison with steroid-naive patients enrolled in the Cooperative International Neuromuscular Research Group (CINRG) Duchenne Natural History Study (DNHS; NCT00468832)<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> and a CINRG clinical trial of prednisone (0.75 mg/kg/d) (NCT00110669)<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> using a similar age range (4–&lt;8 years). Comparison of 12- and 24-week changes in CINRG DNHS steroid-naive patients (n = 25) vs CINRG prednisone-treated boys (n = 13–28) suggested that group sizes of ≈12 patients per dose group would be sufficient to detect improvements in timed function tests (efficacy outcomes) and increases in BMI <italic toggle="yes">z</italic> score (safety outcome), assuming that vamorolone treatment would show the same effects on efficacy and safety as prednisone treatment (supplemental table 1 available from Dryad, <ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.1rd4hc7" ext-link-type="uri">doi.org/10.5061/dryad.1rd4hc7</ext-link>). Although the comparator studies provided the best available controlled evidence for study design, their use was limited to provision of an approximate guide for study design because they were conducted &gt;10 years ago.</p>
                <p>Ethics approval was obtained at each site. Patients were recruited at CINRG sites in the United States (5 sites), Canada (1 site), Australia (2 sites), Israel (1 site), Sweden (1 site), and the United Kingdom (1 site) over a 13-month enrollment period (July 2016–August 2017). After informed consent was obtained, 55 patients were screened, of whom 7 patients failed screening and were excluded from the study for 1 or more of the following reasons: lack of evidence of varicella immunity (2), inability to comply with study procedures (5), no confirmed diagnosis of DMD (1), and inability to complete the timed stand from supine (TTSTAND) test without assistance (1).</p>

                <title>Procedures</title>
                <p>Vamorolone was supplied as a 4% weight/volume citrus-flavored suspension administered orally by volumetric syringe once daily in the morning. Dosing was followed by consumption of a 240-mL glass of full-fat milk or fat equivalent because vamorolone absorption is increased by high-fat food.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> The first treatment period (VBP15-002; 2 weeks on drug, 2 weeks washout) has been described in detail elsewhere.<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> At the week 4 visit of VBP15-002, patients were reconsented for VBP15-003, with the last visit of VBP15-002 coinciding with the first visit of VBP15-003 and daily drug treatment then continuing at the same dose for the patients who agreed to participate in the VBP15-003 study.</p>
                <p>Procedures at screening (VBP15-002) and at weeks 4, 8, 16, and 24 (VBP15-003) included physical examination (including standard eye and integumentary evaluation), blood for laboratory investigations, and a 12-lead ECG. Timed function tests,<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> 6-minute walk test (6MWT),<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> and North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA)<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> were conducted by trained clinical evaluators according to CINRG standard operating procedures.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Timed function tests were done at screening, at baseline (VBP15-002), and at weeks 12 and 24 (VBP15-003). Blood draws for fasting insulin and glucose measures and pharmacodynamic biomarker assessments were done periodically throughout VBP15-003. Adverse events were monitored throughout the study.</p>

                <p>Additional safety outcomes included blood chemistry panels and adverse event reporting. Glucocorticoid adverse effects were monitored with pharmacodynamic biomarkers used as proxy for (bridged to) later clinical morbidities (bone turnover markers [osteocalcin, type I collagen C-telopeptides, and procollagen 1 N-terminal propeptide], adrenal suppression [first-in-morning serum cortisol], and insulin resistance [fasting serum insulin and glucose]).</p>

              <p>Vamorolone was well tolerated in patients with DMD 4 to &lt;7 years of age, with no adverse events leading to reduction of drug dosing or withdrawal from the trial. All SAEs were assessed as either unrelated or remotely related to study medication by both the investigators and sponsor; no action was taken with study medication beyond brief interruption.</p>
              <p>The TTSTAND primary outcome measure in vamorolone-treated patients with DMD supports efficacy of the 2.0–mg/kg/d dose group (≈3 times the prednisone dose of 0.75 mg/kg/d for DMD) at 24 weeks (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref> and <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>) and for the secondary outcome measure of 6MWT at both 12 and 24 weeks of treatment (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">figure 2</xref>). The 2.0–mg/kg/d dose showed superior clinical safety to prednisone-treated external comparators with less weight gain (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">figure 4</xref>) and improvement of bone turnover and insulin resistance biomarkers. There was evidence of adrenal suppression in a subset of boys with DMD treated with 2.0 mg/kg/d vamorolone, with 18% of patients showing reduced morning cortisol levels. Future studies of vamorolone will include adrenocorticotropic hormone–challenge tests to further explore adrenal function.</p>
              <p>The highest dose of vamorolone tested, 6.0 mg/kg/d (≈9 times the prednisone dose in DMD), showed greater improvements in 6MWT (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">figure 2</xref>) and TTRW (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">figure 3</xref>). However, this dose also showed more safety concerns than the 2.0–mg/kg/d dose, with a mean increase in BMI <italic toggle="yes">z</italic> score similar to that with prednisone (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">figure 4</xref>), increased incidence of adrenal suppression as measured by morning cortisol (88.9% of patients after 24 weeks of treatment), and mild increases of serum insulin possibly due to increased insulin resistance.</p>
              <p>A longitudinal study of 440 boys with DMD in the CINRG DNHS defined 5 milestone groups based on TTSTAND findings at a young age that were predictive of later time of loss of clinically meaningful milestones closely linked to quality-of-life measures.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Average improvement of the 2.0–mg/kg/d vamorolone dose group was from 5.3 seconds (baseline) to 4.2 seconds (24 weeks of treatment). This corresponds to a transition from milestone group 2 (likely to experience decline in function and possibly loss of standing ability) to milestone group 1 (patients likely to show stability or improvement), suggesting that vamorolone-related improvements in the primary outcome measure may be clinically meaningful.</p>
              <p>The 6MWT showed a clinically meaningful and significant vamorolone treatment effect of &gt;40 m in those treated with the 6.0–mg/kg/d dose.<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Similarly, the NSAA showed an improvement of 2 to 2.5 points at 24 weeks with vamorolone treatment of 2.0 and 6.0 mg/kg/d, which is indicative of a functional improvement reaching or exceeding a 1-point gain for 2 clinically meaningful activities or a substantial improvement in 1 functional activity transitioning from inability to perform the activity to normal performance.</p>
              <p>A limitation of the statistical comparison of the lowest-dose group (0.25 mg/kg/d) to higher-dose groups (2.0 and 6.0 mg/kg/d) is that the 0.25–mg/kg/d group was slightly older and weaker at baseline than the other groups (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>).</p>
              <p>The lack of deleterious changes in bone turnover markers in patients with DMD treated with vamorolone suggests a possible loss of bone morbidities typically associated with glucocorticoids. Glucocorticoid treatment is the most common cause of osteoporosis; fractures occur in 30% to 50% of patients with DMD receiving long-term therapy.<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> A recent retrospective study of an inception cohort of 403,337 patients newly diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, asthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis, lupus, and sarcoidosis found 72% to be prescribed glucocorticoids (52% at age &lt;50 years).<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> Use of glucocorticoids was strongly associated with increased rate of fractures, with greatest risk at doses of prednisone ≥15 mg/d. A 35-kg boy with DMD taking 0.75 mg/kg/d prednisone or 0.9 mg/kg/d deflazacort is taking about double this “high risk” dose (≈30 mg/d prednisone or equivalent). Serum osteocalcin is a robust biomarker of bone formation and bone turnover in children that is central to growth.<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> Increases in serum osteocalcin have been shown to predict improvements in bone density and bone geometry.<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> Both deflazacort and prednisone significantly reduce serum osteocalcin levels.<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> In contrast, vamorolone increased osteocalcin levels, suggesting loss of deleterious bone effects (supplemental table 10 available from Dryad, <ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.1rd4hc7" ext-link-type="uri">doi.org/10.5061/dryad.1rd4hc7</ext-link>).</p>
              <p>A limitation of this trial is the open-label, nonrandomized, non–placebo-controlled design considered Class IV evidence. However, it is unlikely that a placebo effect resulted in the findings reported here for the following reasons. First, the study design included a 24-fold dose range of vamorolone, and all drug responsive data were found to fit dose-response curves for efficacy and safety. Second, this first-in-patient study estimated a sample size needed to detect a difference from steroid-naive patients from a natural history study<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> and a prednisone trial<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> in the same narrow age range; therefore, the study was powered for detection of both efficacy and safety outcomes with 48 patients (12 per dose group). Third, the vamorolone trial was conducted by the CINRG academic clinical trial network, which also conducted the comparator natural history and prednisone studies using similar outcome measures and training protocols for clinical evaluators. Fourth, the results for the low-dose vamorolone groups (0.25 and 0.75 mg/kg/d) were similar to results of the untreated natural history comparator group. Finally, we used multiple serum biomarkers in multiple contexts of use as objective outcome measures for both safety (bone turnover, insulin resistance, and adrenal suppression) and efficacy (exploratory pharmacodynamics).<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> All showed clear dose responses within this dose-ranging study.</p>
              <p>Of the 48 patients enrolled in this trial, 43 continue treatment through a 2-year long-term extension study with permitted dose escalation (VBP15-LTE) such that all increased to either the 2.0– or 6.0–mg/kg/d dose. Therefore, patients have ≈12 months of additional high-dose drug exposure (2.0 and 6.0 mg/kg/d) at the time of writing. Such longer-term studies may enable better assessments of glucocorticoid morbidities such as long bone and vertebral fractures, stunting of growth, and delayed puberty.</p>
              <p>A double blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of vamorolone is currently underway (VBP15-004; NCT03439670). This trial is testing 2 doses of vamorolone (2.0 and 6.0 mg/kg/d) vs placebo and prednisone (0.75 mg/kg/d) and is enrolling 120 patients (30 per arm) with the same inclusion criteria as the exploratory dose-ranging study described in this report. This ongoing study is designed to provide a higher level of evidence for the efficacy and comparative safety of vamorolone in DMD.</p>
              <p>A novel dissociative steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, vamorolone, showed evidence of efficacy and reduction of safety concerns typically seen with traditional glucocorticoids in a 48-patient, open-label, exploratory, multiple-ascending-dose study in young patients with DMD.</p>
