                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Over 5000 community anti-drug coalitions operating in the USA serve as a cornerstone of federal drug prevention. These coalitions, however, have demonstrated effectiveness in preventing substance use only when they use technical assistance (TA) and implement evidence-based programs (EBPs). The absence of TA and EBP implementation by coalitions is a key research-to-practice gap. The Coalition Check-Up TA system is designed to fill this gap by supporting community coalition implementation of EBPs. Existing TA models for evidence-based coalition approaches are resource intensive and coalition model specific. The Coalition Check-Up is a lower cost strategy that works with a variety of types of coalitions to support sustainable implementation of EBPs. This study protocol describes a hybrid type 3 effectiveness-implementation trial applying Wandersman’s Interactive Systems Framework to test the effects of the Coalition Check-Up on coalition EBP implementation capacity and outcomes. The Interactive Systems Framework outlines how the prevention support system—especially TA—bolsters EBP dissemination and implementation.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">Using a cluster randomized controlled design, this trial will test the overall effectiveness of the Coalition Check-Up, including how it contributes to EBP implementation and prevention of youth substance use. The first aim is to estimate the impact of the Coalition Check-Up on coalitions’ capacity to do their work. We will recruit 68 anti-drug coalitions for random assignment to the Coalition Check-Up or “TA as usual” condition. We will evaluate whether the Coalition Check-Up improves coalition capacity using measures of coalition member responses about team processes, coalition network composition, and collaborative structure. Our second aim is to estimate the impact of the Coalition Check-Up on implementation of EBPs, and our third aim is to estimate the impact of the Coalition Check-Up on youth substance use.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">This project will clarify how the Coalition Check-Up, a scalable approach to TA due to its low cost, affects coalition capacity to support EBP implementation. Analyses also provide insight into causal pathways from the prevention support system to the prevention delivery system outlined by the Interactive Systems Framework. Results will build the evidence-base for how to support community coalitions’ sustainable implementation of evidence-based prevention programs and policies.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par15">Several federal entities fund more than 5000 community anti-drug coalitions in the USA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Such coalitions are attractive because they support community-driven solutions to local problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Community coalitions also promote processes that improve program implementation quality, including interorganizational collaboration, shared decision-making, and communication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. They can also support evidence-based practices (EBP) by serving as hubs of prevention expertise and support for the program delivery system—coordinating EBP selection, training, monitoring, evaluation, and problem-solving [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. For these reasons, coalitions provide potential key mechanisms for bridging the research-to-practice gap in substance use prevention.</p>
              <sec id="Sec3">
                <title>Technical assistance for community coalitions</title>
                <p id="Par16">Currently, there is insufficient knowledge about how to support coalitions’ EBP implementation. Community coalition models have demonstrated effectiveness only when they have entailed comprehensive TA and EBP implementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. TA is particularly important for EBP implementation because EBPs require technical expertise, coaching, coordination among partners, and monitoring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, such TA often costs more than coalitions can afford. For instance, PROSPER and Communities That Care, two coalition-based approaches to prevention, have demonstrated effectiveness in implementing EBPs. Both entailed a 25% Full-Time-Equivalent TA provider per coalition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Budget-constrained TA providers often use group-based regional trainings and webinars that are not individualized or evidence-based [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Even individualized TA typically does not determine if coalitions are self-diagnosing correctly or addressing relevant capacities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Coalitions struggling to implement EBPs are often disconnected and do not reach out for help [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Currently, there is no evidence-based model for low or moderately intensive, sustainable TA.</p>
                <p id="Par17">As a TA model, the Coalition Check-Up requires 84% less TA time compared to the TA used in Communities That Care and PROSPER (4% FTE per coalition vs. 25% FTE). The Coalition Check-Up TA model is a low-intensity yet tailored solution to the tension between TA effectiveness and cost constraints. It is not specific to a particular community coalition model (e.g., PROSPER) or EBP, instead focusing on common dimensions of coalition capacity and program implementation intended to improve youth outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Such a “light touch” intervention would be more easily sustained and is more likely to be adopted to support sustainability on a national scale than existing evidence-based TA models. Additionally, we do not yet know how coalitions can sustain implementation once TA diminishes. Although coalitions may continue to operate, their engagement and activities tend to decline when TA funding ends [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. After TA loss, some coalitions have seen large declines in recruitment rates and implementation quality for prevention programming [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. One potential benefit of the Coalition Check-Up is preventing the usual loss of functioning among coalitions as they lose funding for TA. If effective, the Coalition Check-Up will provide lower-cost and thus more sustainable TA to help community coalitions implement EBPs.</p>

                <title>Coalition Check-Up conceptual framework</title>
                <p id="Par18">To help bridge these research-to-practice gaps, this study design applies the Interactive Systems Framework for Dissemination and Implementation. This framework focuses on how the prevention support system—especially TA—bolsters EBP dissemination and implementation. Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> depicts how TA providers work with practitioners implementing EBPs in the prevention delivery system. Coalition Check-Up TA supports coalition capacity and EBP implementation, which are expected to subsequently contribute to reductions in youth substance use. Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> illustrates aims 1–3 for testing these hypothesized paths of influence.

                <p id="Par19">Previous studies suggest that the coalition capacities shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> are necessary to support EBP implementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Internal team processes such as group cohesion foster trust needed for sustained EBP implementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Coalition network structure also influences coalition outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. For example, coalitions whose members seek advice outside their area of expertise have more support from community leaders and organizations, plus more detailed sustainability plans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par20">In Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, the 4-step Coalition Check-Up TA process provides proactive data-driven continuous quality improvement cycles that TA research suggests are particularly useful [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Step 1 in the Coalition Check-Up is assessing critical dimensions of the coalition’s capacity and EBP implementation. A coalition profile based on assessment data is reviewed in Coalition Check-Up step 2. Here the TA provider works with the coalition to consider several dimensions of coalition capacity and EBP implementation while celebrating strengths and prioritizing areas for growth. Once areas for growth are prioritized, the TA provider uses structured action planning in step 3 to help coalition members establish consensus on how to improve each. For example, the Coalition Check-Up may identify network structural characteristics such as centralization of influence and information as problematic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The TA provider can then help a coalition develop an action plan to share decision-making power more broadly. To support step 3, TA providers draw upon a user-friendly guidebook, based on a comprehensive review of research for improving each dimension of coalition capacity and EBP implementation in the Coalition Check-Up assessment. This guidebook replaces otherwise improvised planning efforts and can speed decision making, thus reducing TA and coalition burden in creating action plans. In step 4, TA providers review and support progress on action plan implementation with the coalition. Efforts are evaluated every year after the initial assessment in a continuous quality improvement cycle.</p>
                <p id="Par21">Central to the Coalition Check-Up is its use of an “audit and feedback” implementation strategy, whereby performance data is collected and reviewed to inform continued improvement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Following recommendations from the audit and feedback literature, the Coalition Check-Up identifies and addresses coalition and EBP implementation capacity deficiencies that frequently lead to failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. A key innovation of the Coalition Check-Up is its use of motivational interviewing to support action planning and implementation based on an audit and feedback. TA providers use motivational interviewing techniques to cultivate a coalition-driven change process. By clarifying the benefits of change and addressing barriers without imposing recommendations, TA providers can guide coalitions to embrace change. These processes strengthen coalition motivation to develop and execute their own action plans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par22">We have found that without the structured Coalition Check-Up action planning process, coalitions do not typically use assessment reports or ask for help in doing so. For example, when a technical assistance provider faced budget cuts, they made face-to-face meetings to discuss evaluation data available only on request; only a small percentage (approximately 15%) of coalitions pursued them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Thus, the Coalition Check-Up assessment with TA process appears to be critical for proactively promoting both motivation and capacity to use the data to make decisions about next steps, thereby improving EBP implementation quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par23">Limited use of feedback for improvement purposes is a key challenge for audit and feedback as an implementation strategy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Evidence suggests that audit and feedback interventions yield only modest improvements in practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. To test the potential of more proactive TA to actualize benefits of audit and feedback, the current study compares coalitions receiving a rudimentary audit and feedback process (“TA as usual”), to those receiving the same audit and feedback materials combined with brief TA outreach that employs motivational interviewing to support action planning and action plan implementation. Specifically, we test the moderating influence of two core processes thought to strengthen audit and feedback: (1) fidelity to motivational interviewing techniques and (2) the collaborative working relationship between the person providing feedback and the coalition. We also test two factors thought to mediate the influence of audit and feedback on outcomes: (1) action plan quality and (2) action plan implementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p>

However, only coalitions assigned to the Coalition Check-Up will receive personalized outreach by TA providers. This creates a robust comparison because of the prior evidence that coalitions are unlikely to make effective use of the feedback reports without personalized TA.

The coalition coordinator interview provides a more objective perspective on Coalition Check-Up fidelity, assessing the extent to which coalitions complete each Coalition Check-Up step.

                  <p id="Par48">EBP quality is a coordinator-reported program-level variable computed as a composite of 7 scales: (a) staff training (6 items, α = .91); (b) staff motivation and competence (5 items, α = .93); (c) fidelity monitoring (11 items, α = .76); (d) evaluation (13 items, α = .81); (e) dosage (2 items); (f) adherence (7 items); and (g) implementation barriers (11 items, α = .81) (21, 26).</p>
                  <p id="Par49">EBP sustainability consists of two measures: (1) overall EBP sustainability and (2) sustainability planning. Overall EBP sustainability is a coalition-level variable that is the sum number of years all EBPs are in operation during years 2–4 of the project, including both existing and new EBPs. An EBP will be designated as non-operational when (a) it has no reach or (b) there is an absence of ongoing training or TA in the past 12 months and no funding available to support the program. Sustainability planning is a coordinator-reported program level outcome (12 items, α =.85) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>].</p>

                <title>Data analytic plan</title>
                <p id="Par52">For aim 1, multi-level longitudinal growth models will be used to test our hypotheses that coalitions assigned to the Coalition Check-Up condition will show improving coalition capacity over time compared to the comparison condition. Our first step entails testing for baseline differences on all measures of coalition capacity between the two experimental conditions. All models will be estimated in MPlus using full information maximum likehood, which has the advantage of being able to estimate missing data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par53">We will model coalition structural characteristics (decentralization, multiplexity, sectoral diversity, intersectoral communication) as coalition-level dependent variables for aim 1. These dependent variables will be predicted by the experimental condition (0=control; 1= Coalition Check-Up), controlling for potential confounders (e.g., coalition model). Once we have multiple waves of data, measurement occasion will be repeated within coalition, and we will utilize growth modeling in our tests of Coalition Check-Up impact on coalition capacity. We will include pretest (i.e., year 0) measures in the model, enabling us to examine change in these characteristics over time between the two groups. Analyses will start by testing unconditional longitudinal models with maximum likelihood estimation in order to find the best functional form, after which we will test our hypotheses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. We will identify the trajectory of coalition capacity using model fit indices—including the AIC, BIC, and the −2 Log Likelihood deviance across different types of longitudinal models, including (a) the empty model (i.e., model with only a random intercept), (b) polynomial growth models, (c) polynomial growth models with random slopes, and (d) piecewise models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. Once the developmental trajectory of coalition capacity is properly modeled, it will be predicted by experimental condition (0=control; 1= Coalition Check-Up), controlling for potential confounders.</p>
                <p id="Par54">Member experiences of coalition cohesion and efficiency will be modeled at the member level. Coalition member reports here are nested within coalitions. We will estimate a random intercept for the internal team processes in each analytic model. The effect of the Coalition Check-Up is entered at the level of coalition. We will start by testing for baseline differences in coalition capacity between the two conditions. The longitudinal data will add a third level to this model, necessitating use of growth modeling. We will use the same process to test model fit.</p>
                <sec id="Sec30">
                  <title>Aim 2: Plan of analysis</title>
                  <p id="Par55">Using Mplus, we will test the three hypotheses that coalitions receiving the Coalition Check-Up will implement EBPs with greater (1) quantity, (2) quality, and (3) sustainability as compared to the “TA as usual” condition. Prior to hypothesis tests, we will test for baseline differences on each of these dependent variables.</p>
                  <p id="Par56">To test aim 2’s first hypothesis, we will model EBP quantity as a coalition-level dependent variable. Once we have three time points of data, we will estimate the developmental trajectory of EBP quantity with growth models—following aim 1 procedures to identify the best functional form of the growth model. Once the developmental trajectory of EBP quantity is properly modeled, it will be predicted by the experimental condition (0=control; 1= Coalition Check-Up) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par57">For the second hypothesis—i.e., programs implemented by coalitions in the Coalition Check-Up condition have superior implementation quality—the unit of analysis is program level, nested within coalition level. Thus, the analytic model will estimate a random intercept. As in the first hypothesis, growth modeling procedures will estimate the developmental trajectory of EBP quality. Experimental condition (0=control; 1= Coalition Check-Up) will be entered at the level of the coalition. Program type (i.e., school-based curriculum, therapist-driven, mentoring, parent curriculum) and program complexity will be covariates at the program level.</p>
                  <p id="Par58">For the third hypothesis—i.e., programs implemented by Coalition Check-Up coalitions have superior sustainability—we will test overall EBP sustainability and sustainability planning separately. Coalition Check-Up impact on sustainability planning will be estimated with a multilevel model accounting for the nesting of programs within coalitions. Program-level covariates include program type, program complexity, and baseline EBP longevity. Since overall EBP sustainability is a coalition-level dependent variable, the regression model will not need to adjust for the nesting of programs within coalitions. As with prior models, experimental condition (0=Control; 1= Coalition Check-Up) will be entered at the coalition level.</p>
                  <p id="Par59">Mediation analyses will test whether coalition capacity mediates between intervention condition and EBP implementation. We will test whether coalition capacity has significant direct and indirect effects on each EBP implementation measure: (a) quantity, (b) quality, and (c) sustainability. Each of these outcomes will be modeled as previously described in this aim, with the addition of the coalition capacity mediational pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>].</p>

                  <title>Aim 3: Analyses</title>
                  <p id="Par60">The final aim will be to test the hypothesis that communities receiving the Coalition Check-Up will reduce youth substance use relative to communities in the “TA-as-usual” condition. Youth reports of substance use will be nested in school district (i.e., community or coalition level) via multilevel models. We will start by testing for differences in baseline levels of youth substance use between the two experimental conditions, to examine balance after randomization. If these comparisons identify a difference between the two conditions on a particular measure, it will be included as a covariate in the modeling. Then, youth substance use outcomes in year 3 will be predicted by experimental condition. A longer-term analysis of the Coalition Check-Up’s impact on youth substance use becomes possible with year 5 outcome data. These longer term outcomes will capture the effect of the Coalition Check-Up delivered as a continuous quality improvement cycle over years 2–4 of the study. We will use the same analytic models in year 5 as year 3, given that the data is identifiable at the school-district level but not the student-level.</p>
                  <p id="Par61">We will examine 8 youth substance use outcomes (see the “Aim 3: Measures—youth substance use” section) in two multivariate multi-level models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. The first model will test past 30-day use of alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, and opioids simultaneously within the coalition’s catchment area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. The second model will test lifetime usage outcomes of the same substances. If an overall significant effect is found for the Coalition Check-Up in a particular multivariate model, follow-up tests will examine the specific substances as separate dependent variables [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. These models extend analyses of Pennsylvania Youth Survey data conducted by Chilenski and Feinberg by taking advantage of increased levels of survey participation, the availability of community-level pretest measures of youth substance use, and the collection of detailed EBP implementation data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par62">Building from models of the Coalition Check-Up’s overall effects on youth substance use, we will test whether EBP implementation mediates between the experimental condition and youth substance use. We will test the EBP implementation measures described in Aim 2 (quantity, quality, sustainability) in separate mediation models. Each model will test for both direct and indirect effects on youth substance use—aggregate 30-day use, and aggregate lifetime use measures of alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, and opioids. If a mediational pathway is significant, we will conduct follow-up analyses modeling each of the specific substances separately [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>].</p>

                <p id="Par63">Throughout the project, we will assess coalition activity costs to understand the resources necessary for Coalition Check-Up implementation. This assessment will use methodology developed in prior work including annual average cost estimates as well as ranges of costs across differing coalition settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. We will adopt an ingredients-based approach where all program inputs and activities in the day-to-day implementation are identified regardless of whether a direct cost was required [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. We will seek cost information from multiple sources. Where available, project budgets indicate amounts for personnel and non-personnel inputs. For personnel costs, we will use Coalition Check-Up time allocation measures developed for this project as part of the TA Record [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. When costs are not apparent (e.g., in budgets), we will derive estimates based on opportunity cost or market value of the resource. Including such valuations enables creation of a range of cost estimates, where the lower bound excludes opportunity costs and the higher bound reflects the value of non-budgeted resources. This process will set the foundation for cost-effectiveness analyses pursued in future projects.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par65">This innovative trial tests a unique approach to supporting community coalitions’ implementation of EBPs. Other low-cost TA models are typically expert driven and specific to a single type of coalition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In contrast, the Coalition Check-Up supports coalition-driven action planning. Unlike existing TA models, the Coalition Check-Up can also be applied broadly across coalition models because it focuses on common dimensions of coalition capacity and EBP implementation linked to youth outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The proactive, data-driven monitoring in this study involves continuous quality improvement cycles that identify TA needs and provide timely support to improve capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. The Coalition Check-Up is unique in its use of motivational interviewing to support its audit and feedback implementation strategy, thereby strengthening the collaborative working relationship, enhancing coalition-driven action planning, and coalition commitment to making change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par66">Using the Interactive Systems Framework and an extensive history of coalition research, this study will examine causal pathways from TA to EBP implementation and youth outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In this way, the study advances the field of implementation science by providing new evidence of the relationship between Interactive Systems Framework domains and implementation outcomes. The scale of this project allows for longitudinal testing of mediating pathways from Coalition Check-Up to distal community-wide outcomes. Together, these innovations will yield evidence about not only if but also how the Coalition Check-Up works. Advancement of the Coalition Check-Up evidence-base will encourage model usage as a low-cost and generalizable approach for supporting coalitions to achieve community-wide reductions in youth substance use.</p>
              <p id="Par67">Each study aim is well-positioned to make important contributions to the implementation science literature. The first aim contributes knowledge of how the Coalition Check-Up affects coalition capacity, by operationalizing the pathway from the prevention support system (TA) to the prevention delivery system (EBP implementation) in the Interactive Systems Framework. These analyses are an important step toward understanding how the Coalition Check-Up might work to support positive outcomes for youth in communities. This knowledge will also help providers and policy makers understand critical components of the prevention support system. Findings will provide guidance on how the prevention support system can best build capacity to address youth substance use in communities across the country.</p>
              <p id="Par68">The second aim will show how the Coalition Check-Up does or does not contribute to aspects of EBP implementation. By examining the Coalition Check-Up as a strategy to support the adoption and integration of EBPs into community settings, we can clarify pathways that improve participant outcomes and benefit population health. Such work is important in not only establishing the evidence for this coalition-driven TA system, but also for understanding the relations between the prevention support system and the prevention delivery system as outlined by the Interactive Systems Framework. Analyses will provide empirical evidence on key implementation processes that support EBPs according to the Interactive Systems Framework.</p>
              <p id="Par69">The third aim will provide insight into how to reduce youth substance use. A granular understanding of how the Coalition Check-Up and EBPs in the prevention delivery system can reduce youth substance use will strengthen evidence bases for both the Interactive Systems Framework and the Coalition Check-Up. By understanding how EBP quantity, quality, and sustainability relate to youth outcomes, policy makers and funding agencies can make better decisions about where to focus scarce EBP dissemination and implementation resources. Furthermore, TA providers will be better able to direct coalitions towards EBP approaches that maximize impact on youth substance use. By reflecting the imperfections of real-world practice, our findings will be more generalizable than in studies where coalitions and EBPs are well funded.</p>

                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p id="Par70">A potential challenge of this project is keeping the coalitions engaged in the Coalition Check-Up and focused on the development and implementation of action plans addressing prioritized areas for growth. Success in this regard may depend on a strong relationship between the TA provider and the coalition, which we include in our fidelity monitoring protocol. TA use of motivational interviewing should help in promoting a strong relationship and in encouraging coalitions to implement their action plans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par71">Another problem could be lower than expected participation in Pennsylvania Youth Survey or the Missouri Student Survey. If we identify school districts in participating communities without student data, a new data collection incentive plan will provide financial incentive for missing school districts to participate in data collection. We will discuss with the state-level survey sponsors to see what logistical support we can offer schools in missing districts.</p>
