              <abstract>
                <p>In a published randomized controlled trial, household units were randomized to a nutrient bar supplementation group or a control condition, but the non-independence of observations within the same household (i.e., the clustering effect) was not accounted for in the statistical analyses. Therefore, we reanalyzed the data appropriately by adjusting degrees of freedom using the between-within method, and accounting for household units using linear mixed effect models with random intercepts for family units and subjects nested within family units for each reported outcome. Results from this reanalysis showed that ignoring the clustering and nesting effects in the original analyses had resulted in anticonservative (i.e., too small) time x group interaction p-values. Still, majority of the conclusions remained unchanged.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>An article by Mietus-Snyder et al. [<xref rid="pone.0275242.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] (hereafter “The Article”) reported the results of a randomized controlled trial that examined the effects of nutrient bar supplementation on metabolic biomarkers among adolescents with obesity and their adult caregivers. In The Article, randomization occurred at the level of household units so that adolescents and their caregiver(s) were group randomized to either nutrient bar supplementation or a control condition. However, inferences were drawn from statistical models that ignored the non-independence of observations within the same family unit. Herein, we present a valid statistical model that accounts for clustering and nesting effects within the context of other methodologic choices made by the original authors. We therefore do not intend to address any question or test any hypothesis beyond the scope of The Article.</p>
              <p>In The Article, anthropometric and clinical measures were analyzed separately for adolescents and adults. That is, the statistical models with anthropometric and clinical measurements of adolescents as the outcome variable did not include observations from adult participants and vice versa. In the case of plasma ceramides, sphingolipid bases, and amino acids, however, adolescents and adults were analyzed together but the clustering effect of households and the nesting effect that arises from the hierarchical structure of the data were not considered in the statistical analyses. The inconsistency in the analysis of different outcomes aside, we outline below why analyzing households without accounting for the clustering and nesting renders the results and conclusions unverifiable.</p>
              <p>When groups (clusters/households), rather than individual subjects, are randomized to experimental conditions, outcome measures of the subjects from the same group are expected to be more similar compared to those from other groups. This within-cluster correlation violates the independent observations assumption, and needs to be accounted for in the statistical analyses [<xref rid="pone.0275242.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Ignoring the clustering effect, as done in the analyses in The Article, potentially leads to incorrect estimation of the variance and an often-inflated type I error (i.e., anticonservative [that is, too small] p-values) [<xref rid="pone.0275242.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0275242.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In The Article, use of incorrect procedures occurs when caregivers and adolescents in the same household are analyzed together as independent observations. Moreover, the control group included two triad family units, one with two adults and one adolescent and the other with one adult and two adolescents. Therefore, even if adolescents and adults are analyzed separately, as reported by The Article for anthropometric and clinical outcomes, there would still be family connections between some subjects in the adult and adolescent subgroups. Therefore, all analyses require accounting for the clustering effect in The Article. A rigorous approach to analyze group randomized trials is including all observations in the statistical model while including a random effect for the cluster. This approach allows for retaining all the information, and accounts for the variability within and among clusters [<xref rid="pone.0275242.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p>
              <p>We attempted to conduct a proper analysis on the data made publicly available as a supplement to The Article. We first attempted to reproduce the original analyses as reported. In doing so, we failed to obtain the same results as those reported in The Article for sphingolipid bases and amino acids. This discrepancy was communicated with the authors of The Article and the journal editors, who acknowledged the errors we had detected. P-values we obtained based on their original analysis approach are reported in our <xref rid="pone.0275242.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> below. Additionally, the authors collegially and expeditiously shared additional information on household unit identifiers with us, which is commendable. We also report an updated participant flow diagram in our <xref rid="pone.0275242.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref> that corrects the sizes of household units from what is reported in The Article based on the additional information the authors shared with us.</p>

              <p>To reanalyze the data using procedures that take clustering and nesting effects of households into account, we performed linear mixed effect models (LMM) with random intercepts for family units (to account for the clustering effect) and subjects nested within family units (to account for the repeated measures) on each reported outcome in Tables 2, 4, 5, and 6 of The Article. We used the between-within method to adjust the degrees of freedom (SAS 9.4). The fixed effects in our models were the study group (levels: intervention or control), time (levels: baseline or follow-up), and the interaction between time and group (as the intervention effect). Included covariates were age (in years) and sex (levels: male or female). Our code is available at <ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5366705" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5366705</ext-link>. The raw data we used to generate the results and reach the conclusions in this paper are third party data. Those data (except for household unit identifiers) are publicly accessible from The Article. Household unit identifiers were shared with us by the authors of The Article through personal communications. We did not have any special access privileges that others would not have. To access household unit identifiers, others can contact the corresponding author of The Article and ask them to share household unit identifiers as they did with us. The publicly available dataset did not include participants who had dropped out or those for whom reserved plasma was not available. Therefore, we analyzed available cases only.</p>
              <p>The Article described the statistical methods as “a generalized estimating equation [GEE] procedure determined the significance of longitudinal changes […] using age and gender as co-variates”. We outline why we switched from GEE to LMM to reanalyze the data taking clustering and nesting into account. First, The Article reported a study with 11 clusters per intervention and 7 clusters per control (see <xref rid="pone.0275242.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>). GEE is a population-averaged approach [<xref rid="pone.0275242.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] using an asymptotic z test that assumes large sample sizes. Thus, GEE should be avoided in the analyses of cluster randomized trials with few clusters [<xref rid="pone.0275242.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Specifically, GEE based methods use empirical-sandwich estimation for standard errors. When the degrees of freedom are limited, empirical-sandwich estimation leads to unreliable type I error rates in hypothesis testing. That is, when the number of groups per condition is small, the increased variability of the sandwich variance estimator substantially inflates the type I error [<xref rid="pone.0275242.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0275242.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. As stated by Murray et al. “…GEEs may have only limited application in the context of group-randomized trials. The available evidence suggests that they be limited to trials having 20 or more groups allocated to each study condition” [<xref rid="pone.0275242.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Additionally, there does not appear to be any off-the-shelf software to account for more than two levels of clustering in GEE based models while The Article reported a three-level design (visit, individual subject, household). Thus, it would not be possible to account for the clustering effect of households and the repeated measures using GEE as we did by LMM.</p>
              <p>In our <xref rid="pone.0275242.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, we present the time x group interaction p-values as reported in The Article using GEE model (which were not reproducible because of discrepancies with the data), our results from corrected GEE model (still ignoring clusters as The Article did), our LMM model that still ignores clustering and nesting (LMM v1: still ignoring clusters, used to compare to LMM v2), and our corrected reanalysis using LMM with adjusted degrees of freedom, family clusters, and repeated measures all being taken into account (LMM v2: a valid approach to clustered data). In The Article, two statistical significance thresholds (&lt;0.05 and ≤0.002) are set for various outcomes. Therefore, in our Table 1, we indicate important differences between the two latter models based on both 0.05 and 0.002 thresholds.</p>
              <p>As a result of conducting analyses that account for clustering and nesting effects, we found that ignoring the clustering and nesting effects in the original analysis had resulted in anticonservative time x group interaction p-values, as is well-established in statistical methodological literature. Most time x group interaction p-values increased in our LMM analyses that accounted for nesting and clustering effects, and in the cases just below the statistical significance threshold (i.e., p = 0.05), p-values reported in The Article as statistically significant changed to not statistically significant. Of 13 statistically significant effects at the 0.05 level in LMM model where clustering and nesting effects were ignored (LMM v1), one became non-significant in LMM v2 (Threonine), and of the four statistically significant effects at the 0.002 level in LMM v1, one became non-significant in LMM v2 (Arginine Bioavailability Ratio).</p>
              <p>In theory, ignoring clustering yields unbiased estimates of regression coefficients [<xref rid="pone.0275242.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], given certain assumptions including that the cluster size is not correlated with cluster-specific treatment effects. Regression coefficients of the LMM and GEE models are presented in our <xref rid="pone.0275242.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Regression coefficients of LMM v1 and LMM v2 are similar for fasting plasma ceramides and plasma sphingolipid bases, and slightly differ for amino acid metabolites. Because our purpose is to provide corrected statistical procedures within the context of methodologic choices of The Article, which involved null hypothesis significance testing based on p-values, we do not elaborate extensively on interpretation of model coefficient estimates.</p>

              <p>Rigor and reproducibility (definitions provided in <xref rid="pone.0275242.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>) are foundations of scientific advancement, both of which are critical for verification of the results generated using the reported methods. The results reported in The Article were generated using invalid statistical methods for the study design. Our analysis with valid methods produced relatively few differences in dichotomous statistically significant findings. Yet, regardless of the magnitude of difference that valid statistical tests make, the original results are not verifiable (definition provided in <xref rid="pone.0275242.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>) and cannot be relied upon. Indeed, in similar studies with different numbers of clusters, different numbers of individuals within clusters, or effects closer to the null, the differences in statistical significance may be more or less pronounced. Post-hoc appraisal of how an invalid analysis compares to valid analyses in a particular sample does not justify the original use of the invalid approach.</p>
              <p>Although we highlighted changes in statistical significance herein, we recognize that some argue against null hypothesis significance testing using p-values [<xref rid="pone.0275242.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. It is beyond the scope of the current reanalysis activity to discuss the relative value of using p-values or frequentist testing. Rather, we argue that if one chooses to conduct and publish a study that is predicated on frequentist testing and p-values (as the authors of The Article did), one should calculate, use, and interpret p-values correctly. Consequently, changes in statistical significance are simply a dichotomous marker of changes in variance estimates, and thus the same concerns regarding reproducibility and rigor would apply to interpreting confidence intervals because they are based on the same mathematical information.</p>
              <p>Our reanalysis has some limitations. First, due to the reasons described in the methods section for switching from GEE to LMM approach, it was not possible to directly compare the findings of our reanalysis that did account for clustering and nesting with the approach used in The Article that ignored those effects. Rather, we needed to conduct the reanalysis using an approach that would allow for clustering and nesting to be accounted for (LMM), but ignore them first (LMM v1). We then compared LMM v1 with the proper analysis that accounted for clustering and nesting (LMM v2). The second limitation is related to the extent we can draw general conclusions about degrees of robustness. We did not conduct simulations or mathematical derivations to show the degrees of robustness on average. Thus, our results only show the degrees of relative robustness of the results and conclusions of this paper (i.e., The Article) when switching from an analysis with incorrect procedures to one with correct procedures. That is, we cannot make any judgement about how often such changes may or may not occur or how large the errors would be. Finally, we did not explore other techniques such as parametric bootstrap to explore how the results would be different compared to LMM. These limitations can be addressed in future research.</p>
              <p>We commend Mietus-Snyder et al. for making their raw data publicly available, and their collegiality in providing additional data on family units. In order to be probative, studies need to be rigorously analyzed and transparently reported [<xref rid="pone.0275242.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Although most conclusions in The Article remain unchanged, ignoring the clustering and nesting effects is an important and common methodological issue in obesity research that leads to unverifiable conclusions [<xref rid="pone.0275242.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0275242.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Through our ability to verify and subsequent correcting of the results, we allow them to be used by the readers who might correctly dismiss results and conclusions of The Article because the analyses are conducted using improper statistical procedures for the design. The importance of statistical analysis per the unit of randomization to avoid similar errors in future studies is vital.</p>

              <p>Academic Editor</p>
              <p>PLOS ONE</p>
              <p>Additional Editor Comments:</p>
              <p>Before finding the reviewers I read your manuscript myself and came to conclusion that (a) results of the reanalysis are similar to the original ones, (b) more technical information is required to evaluate your contribution.</p>
              <p>Specifically,</p>
              <p>1. The most important results of statistical analysis are the coefficients of the model; the p-values have secondary importance. Therefore I suggest reporting the coefficients in Table 1, along with the p-values.</p>
              <p>2. Although an overseen clustering may produce a lower level of statistical significance (larger standard errors and p-values) it yields unbiased coefficients (Demidenko, E. Mixed Models. Theory and Applications with R, Hoboken, NJ: Wiley, 2013). Moreover, while the original paper uses GEE you employ LMM. Consequently, the results on p-values must be different. Indeed, as follows from Table 1 the proportion of the changed p-values (rows) is only about 5:30. In spite the correct claim of the effect of ignored clustering the results look pale.</p>
              <p>3. Some technical description of the statistical model (dependent, independent variables, equations) and how exactly the clustering has been implemented is missing. Therefore it is impossible to evaluate the improvements and your contribution.</p>
              <p>Despite strong criticism and weak results I still invite you to resubmit but with no guarantee that your paper will be published.</p>
              <p>Journal requirements:</p>
              <p>When submitting your revision, we need you to address these additional requirements.</p>
              <p>1. Please ensure that your manuscript meets PLOS ONE's style requirements, including those for file naming. The PLOS ONE style templates can be found at</p>

              </p>
              <p>Dear Dr. Demidenko,</p>
              <p>We appreciate your insightful comments on our manuscript. Our replies are in red below. </p>
              <p>We noted a theme of incertitude about our scientific contribution and the scope of the current re-analysis activity. Thus, we provide some clarification herein and in the revised manuscript (the version with track changes) (lines 36-40). </p>
              <p>Current manuscript is a re-analysis of an existing published study (i.e., referred to in the manuscript as ‘The Article’). Therefore, details regarding the significance, procedures, conduct, and conclusions of the study are provided in The Article. Our concern in the current manuscript is invalidity of the statistical analyses used for generating the published results. We present a valid statistical model and the corresponding results. We do not intend to address any research question or test any hypothesis beyond the results presented in The Article. Journals often handle this type of re-analysis as ‘correspondence’ so that it is linked to the previously published work. Because PLoS ONE editorial policy does not provide such an option, we were advised to submit our re-analysis as an original research article. Thus, our scientific contribution should be evaluated within the context of post-publication re-analysis and error correction. </p>
              <p>• The most important results of statistical analysis are the coefficients of the model; the p-values have secondary importance. Therefore, I suggest reporting the coefficients in Table 1, along with the p-values. </p>
              <p>• Although an overseen clustering may produce a lower level of statistical significance (larger standard errors and p-values) it yields unbiased coefficients (Demidenko, E. Mixed Models. Theory and Applications with R, Hoboken, NJ: Wiley, 2013).</p>
              <p>The well-known consequences of ignoring clustering and nesting effects in the regression models for multilevel data are underestimated standard errors (and p-values) and unbiased regression coefficients [1, 2]. However, debate about the relative value of using p-values or frequentist testing, and whether regression coefficients or the p-values are superior in importance to one another is beyond the scope of this current reanalysis activity. Rather, the authors and the journal have chosen to publish a paper that was predicated on frequentist testing and p-values. Therefore, the testing, calculation, use, and interpretation of p-values should be conducted correctly, but in The Article they were not.</p>
              <p>We present the model coefficients in supplementary Table 1. </p>
              <p>• Moreover, while the original paper uses GEE you employ LMM. Consequently, the results on p-values must be different.</p>
              <p>Thanks for this insightful comment. In lines 97-111 of the manuscript, we outline the reasons why LMM is the legitimate approach to correctly account for clustering and nesting effects given the study design by Dr. Mietus-Snyder et al. Because our purpose is to focus on accounting for vs. ignoring clustering and nesting, we updated our analyses and Table 1 to compare LMMs with and without clustering and nesting effects. Please see Table 1 and lines 97-111.</p>
              <p>• Indeed, as follows from Table 1 the proportion of the changed p-values (rows) is only about 5:30. In spite the correct claim of the effect of ignored clustering the results look pale.</p>
              <p>Rigor1 and reproducibility2 are foundations of science advancement, both being critical for verification of the results generated using the reported methods. The results reported by Mietus-Snyder et al. are not generated using valid statistical methods for the study design (our reasoning outlined in the manuscript and elsewhere by our group and others [3, 4]). Thus, regardless of the magnitude of difference that valid statistical tests would make, those results are not verifiable3 (please see lines 130-135 too). In this regard, we highlight the following matters:</p>
              <p>i. Editors, journals, authors, and the scientific community overall should have a commitment to accuracy and integrity of the science [5], even if the results only change modestly as a result of doing correct analyses.</p>
              <p>ii. Hearkening back to our argument about the choice of frequentist testing, correcting the analyses changes qualitative conclusions by the standard operating procedures and social norms of the use of frequentist testing and readers have a right to know this.</p>
              <p>iii. Finally, for an astute reader, especially someone writing a blue-ribbon panel report that might utilize such a paper, or a meta-analyst, without seeing the critique and re-analysis results, they will correctly discern that the original results cannot be relied upon because the analyses are invalid. They might therefore be unable to use the study and its findings, even though the study and its findings (once correctly analyzed) do have value. That is, an unverified result is a result that cannot be utilized and relied upon fairly. By our verifying (and correcting) the results, we allow them to be used by people who correctly understand that the current analyses are not correct.</p>
              <p>Additionally, and as a side note, the proportion of the changed p-values is essentially a function of what one takes as the denominator and the significance level. As mentioned in the manuscript, we describe this proportion as “of 13 statistically significant effects at the 0.05 level in LMM models where clustering and nesting effects were ignored, one became non-significant, and of the four statistically significant effects at the 0.002 level, one became non-significant”. </p>
              <p>1Scientific rigor: “the strict application of the scientific method to ensure unbiased and well-controlled experimental design, methodology, analysis, interpretation and reporting of results.” (<ext-link xlink:href="https://grants.nih.gov/policy/reproducibility/index.htm" ext-link-type="uri">https://grants.nih.gov/policy/reproducibility/index.htm</ext-link>).</p>
              <p>2Reproducibility: “An article is designated as reproducible if the [independent investigator] succeeds in executing the code on the data provided and produces results matching those that the authors claim are reproducible” [6].</p>
              <p>3Verifiability: a study is said to be verifiable, and to have been verified, when: (a) the study is reproducible, and the results have been reproduced (by the definition of reproducibility above); and (b) a determination is made that the methods used to generate the results reproduced are valid methods. </p>
              <p>• Some technical description of the statistical model (dependent, independent variables, equations) and how exactly the clustering has been implemented is missing. Therefore, it is impossible to evaluate the improvements and your contribution.</p>

              </p>
              <p>Dear Dr. Demidenko,</p>
              <p>Thank you for your insightful comments, and giving us the opportunity to improve the manuscript. Our replies are in blue below.</p>
              <p>1. It should be mentioned in the paper that according to the theory (Demidenko, 2013) accounting for family clustering should not affect the coefficients but increase the standard errors and reduce the p-values. The current study confirms this expectation.</p>
              <p>2. I suggested reporting the coefficients themselves as well, but they are missing in the current version, again.</p>
              <p>Thank you for your cogent comment. We agree that as stated in (Demidenko, 2013), [under certain assumptions, including that the cluster size is not correlated with cluster-specific treatment effects], ignoring within-cluster correlation yields unbiased estimates of regression coefficients ((1), pages 42 and 157), but artificially reduced (more significant) standard errors and p-values (2). Though, of course, they could change in any one sample. Similarly, there appears to be little bias (less than ±10%) in the estimates of regression coefficients across the methods that accommodate clustered data for 10 or fewer clusters with few (e.g., 7-14) observations per cluster (3, 4). </p>
              <p>We have now included coefficients in our manuscript per your suggestion (see Table 2 and lines 139-146). As we report in the manuscript, “regression coefficients of LMM v1 and LMM v2 are similar for fasting plasma ceramides and plasma sphingolipid bases, but slightly differ (3% or less) for amino acid metabolites.” However, because our purpose is to provide corrected statistical procedures within the context of methodologic choices of The Article (i.e., null hypothesis significance testing using p-values), we do not dwell extensively on the interpretation of regression coefficient estimates. </p>
              <p>3. The p-values from GEE and LME are not compatible because the underlying statistical models are different. Thus, we must compare LMM v1 versus LMM v2 to understand the effect of family clustering. As follows, the difference in p-values is negligible.</p>
              <p>Thank you for these remarks. We agree that the comparison must be between the results derived from similar approach. Owing to your insightful comments on the previous version of our manuscript, we included LMM v1 and we are comparing LMM v2 vs. LMM v1 both in Table 1 and to summarize our findings. We also agree that the model that ignores clustering (LMM v1) yields roughly the same answers as the model that accounts for clustering and nesting (LMM v2). As we outline in the manuscript, we believe regardless of the magnitude of difference that valid statistical tests would make, results that are derived from inappropriate procedures for the design (which is the case for either GEE or LMM v1) are unsubstantiated and not verifiable. That is, incorrect analysis sometimes yields the correct answers and correct analysis sometimes yields incorrect answers (due to type I and/or type II errors). The fact that LMM v1 yields roughly the same answer as LMM v2 does not mean that ignoring clustering (and nesting) is a negligible issue. Our reanalysis of this article now allows the scientific community to interpret the results in the context of an analysis strategy appropriate to the study design, increasing the confidence in its findings.</p>
              <p>4. Graphic presentation where x-axis is time would be very beneficial to see the differences between GEE, LMM v1, and LMM v2 models in addition to Table 1.</p>
              <p>Thank you for this comment. We emphasize that our manuscript is not intended to be a methods paper. We are making a critique of an existing published paper because the results of that paper are produced using inappropriate procedures for its design. While we argue that the results are unsubstantiated, we cannot show that they are wrong or right because doing so would require knowing the ‘true’ answer which would be possible by conducting simulations or mathematical derivations to show the degrees of robustness. We propose that keeping the values in our table format is optimal to present our reanalysis, as the original authors did in their paper.</p>
              <p>5. Due to my previous point paper’s contribution is marginal. Yes, there is a slight improvement, but it is wrong to say that the analysis of “The Article” is incorrect. I suggest the language “adjustment” not saying that the previous analysis is wrong. This statement must be a part of the study limitations. Is it true that n=14 as follows from S1 Fig 1?</p>
              <p>• Thank you for raising this point. We agree that our writing has not been as clear as it could have been. Our statements about the ‘invalid’ analysis in The Article could be interpreted in two ways: 1) that the procedures used to produce the findings were incorrect for the purported properties of the study design, 2) that the results produced by the procedures used are not the results which would be produced by proper procedures. We clarify that we mean the former, not the latter: when we say the analysis is either wrong or invalid, we mean the procedures used to produce the results were incorrect, and when we say results, we mean the findings produced by the procedures used. In this case, the findings from the incorrect procedures and proper procedures are similar. We now have clarified this in our writing.</p>
              <p>• We also agree that it is wise to include a study limitations section. Thank you for that suggestion. We now have included the following study limitations section to the manuscript:</p>
              <p>“Our reanalysis has some limitations. First, due to the reasons described in the methods section for switching from GEE to LMM approach, it was not possible to directly compare the findings of our reanalysis that did account for clustering and nesting with the approach used in The Article that ignored those effects. Rather, we needed to conduct the reanalysis using an approach that would allow for clustering and nesting to be accounted for (LMM), but ignore them first (LMM v1). We then compared LMM v1 with the proper analysis that accounted for clustering and nesting (LMM v2). The second limitation is related to the extent we can draw general conclusions about degrees of robustness. We did not conduct simulations or mathematical derivations to show the degrees of robustness on average. Thus, our results only show the degrees of relative robustness of the results and conclusions of this paper (i.e., The Article) when switching from an analysis with incorrect procedures to one with correct procedures. That is, we cannot make any judgement about how often such changes may or may not occur or how large the errors would be. Finally, we did not explore other techniques such as parametric bootstrap to explore how the results would be different compared to LMM. These limitations can be addressed in future research.”</p>

              <p>Reviewer #1: This proposed corrected analysis of the previous publication “Randomized nutrient bar supplementation improves exercise-associated changes in plasma metabolome in adolescents and adult family members at cardiometabolic risk” by Jamshidi-Naeini et al suggest that application of a clustered analysis changes some conclusions of the original article.</p>
              <p>Three main questions emerge for the authors to consider:</p>
              <p>I could not find any mention of the conclusions that were changed, only small changes in a minority of p-values. It is stated in the final paragraph that “most conclusions in The Article remain unchanged”.</p>
              <p>1) Can the authors explain exactly which study conclusions are changed by clustered analyses and if any, what the significance of these changes to the article’s interpretation?</p>
              <p>If none, the title might more appropriately read “Incorporation of the clustering effect in group randomized trial does not change the main study conclusions”. It is interesting that the reference 5 provided as an example of use of this clustered approach from the Allison group (Golzarri-Arroyo et al, 2020) similarly did not change study conclusions, but stated that accurately in the title.</p>
              <p>Both of these PLOS ONE studies the Allison group has reanalyzed incorporating the clustering effect (Mietus-Snyder et al and Short et al) involved minority adolescent populations, who would be at heightened risk for socioeconomic disadvantage. Unfortunately, an important issue relevant to health disparity that a statistical manipulation alone cannot address, is fragmentation of traditional family units and potential breakdown in the predictability of household factors.</p>
              <p>2) Can the authors delineate which household factors are felt to be most critical in justification of the proposed clustered analysis? If dietary factors pertain, does clustered analysis reveal any difference in the diets that were reported to be uniformly poor for both adolescents and adults in the original study? If genetic or epigenetic factors are implicated, what effects do nonbiological family units or shared custody have on clustered analyses? These issues raise an important point of discussion that might be expanded upon by the authors to help explain why the application of clustered analysis – at least in this study and the study reanalyzed in reference (5) does not appear to change the main study conclusions reached without clustering.</p>
              <p>There are two sets of changes reported upon in this Correction – the first set due to an error in the original time-by-group p-values reported that has apparently been acknowledged by the study authors. It is not apparent why those p-value corrections have not already been published as a Correction as this should be the responsibility of the original study team, once alerted to their error. The title of this Correction by Jamshidi-Naeini implies that it is the application of clustered analysis, not these time x group interaction p-value corrections that changes some conclusions. It does seem apparent that the corrected time by group p-values do not change study conclusions (with the exception of aromatic amino acids tryptophan and phenylalanine, the latter still showing a trend with p = 0.07). This is not however a central observation and does not impact the article’s interpretation.</p>
              <p>It is the second set of p-value changes that are contingent on the newly applied clustered analysis that would still be germane to the Correction submitted by Jamshidi-Naeini et al. The authors support their claim that this approach overcomes an important methodological issue in obesity research with several recent reviews on this topic. Their point is well taken, but the frequent use the terms “correctly” and “appropriately” in describing the application of a clustered analysis seems unnecessarily pejorative, since as already noted, the reanalysis has not actually been demonstrated to change the study’s conclusions. It of course changed p-values, as would be expected with a decrease in the number of independent observations, but only a small number of p-values that were nominally significant become slightly insignificant. Trends remained trends and the strongest observations, on which the original study conclusions are based, remain very significant.</p>
              <p>A 2019 paper cited (ref 6) for which DB Allison is also senior author on “The Need for Greater Rigor in Childhood Nutrition and Obesity Research” states what Jamshidi-Naeini et al were sure to observe in that (quoting from ref 6) “Clustering reduces power”… going on to say “there are instances in which misanalysis of clustered childhood obesity interventions has led to unsubstantiated conclusions.” This certainly is true, but the authors have not demonstrated that it is true in this instance – which circles back to the first two questions above. Which study conclusions have actually been altered by the clustered analysis? And if none, why not?</p>
              <p>A full reading of the original paper reveals a detailed baseline principal components analysis to reduce the dimensionality of the complex lipidomic data set incorporated in baseline correlograms with traditional cardiometabolic risk factors and lipoprotein subspecies. There are also change correlation analyses that reveal numerous hypothesis-generating associations independent of pre-post metabolite p-values. Much of the discussion in the original study is rooted in the correlograms that summarize this body of data.</p>
              <p>3) Would clustered analysis lend any further insight to the principal component and correlation analyses? Can the authors explain why their reanalysis does not address these two prominent elements of the original paper?</p>
              <p>One small point: It is stated in the Abstract and Introduction that this was a “recent” study but the original report states that the trial was completed in the summer of 2011. Given the 9-year lag to publication, the metabolomic and lipidomic analyses performed, as stated in the original paper, on samples preserved at -70o F, were however surely more recent when mass spectroscopy technologies to explore these novel biomarkers became more widely available.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: The current investigators pointed out a possible design flaw in the manuscript. That is to say “In a published randomized controlled trial, household units were randomized to a nutrient bar supplementation group or a control condition, but the non-independence of observations within the same household (i.e., the clustering effect) was not accounted for in the statistical analyses." Assuming this to be the case, the investigators provided a side by side comparison of results (clustering vs. non clustering) and proceeded accordingly. The results are very similar. However, that would have to be debated with the original investigators and not this reviewer. The work was thorough and certainly appeared to be presented reasonably in a descriptive, and not methodologic, fashion as was pointed out by the investigators.</p>

              <p>Response: Thank you for these comments. We note that the fact that “[…] it just happened that for this particular study mixed model did not make considerable difference” is only known after we have reanalyzed the data using correct statistical procedures. That is, the results and conclusions published by Mietus-Snyder et al. are unsubstantiated because they are drawn from incorrect statistical methods. As a result of our reanalysis, results and conclusions derived from the original GEE models are verified or corrected. We have addressed the point about the title in our responses to reviewer 1.</p>
              <p>Response to Reviewer 1:</p>
              <p>1. I could not find any mention of the conclusions that were changed, only small changes in a minority of p-values. It is stated in the final paragraph that “most conclusions in The Article remain unchanged”. Can the authors explain exactly which study conclusions are changed by clustered analyses and if any, what the significance of these changes to the article’s interpretation? If none, the title might more appropriately read “Incorporation of the clustering effect in group randomized trial does not change the main study conclusions”. It is interesting that the reference 5 provided as an example of use of this clustered approach from the Allison group (Golzarri-Arroyo et al, 2020) similarly did not change study conclusions, but stated that accurately in the title.</p>
              <p>Response: Thank you for raising the point about the title. We agree that a change in the title would present the consequences of accounting for clustering and nesting effects in this particular sample more clearly. We changed the title to “Accounting for the clustering and nesting effects verifies majority of conclusions. Corrected analysis of: “Randomized nutrient bar …””. The suggested title by the reviewer “Ignoring the clustering effect does not change major conclusions..." implies that we are encouraging researchers to ignore clustering (and nesting) in cluster randomized trials, which is not our intended message. </p>
              <p>We state in our manuscript that most conclusions remain unchanged when the comparison is between linear mixed effects models (LMM) that account for clustering and nesting and LMMs that ignore clustering and nesting. We precisely state variables for which p-values are changed from statistically significant in the incorrect analysis to insignificant when clustering and nesting are accounted for (Threonine and Arginine Bioavailability Ratio). The changes we made to the title will further address this matter. On the other hand, addressing the consequence of accounting for clustering and nesting on the article’s conclusions and interpretations should occur under the assumption that the article’s conclusions and interpretations are based on reproducible results, but they are not. Such comparison would require re-writing the article’s interpretations based on a) “corrected GEE” models and b) consistent specification of the significance level (i.e., 0.002 or 0.05). This is, as correctly mentioned by the reviewer, a “responsibility of the original study team”.</p>
              <p>• Both of these PLOS ONE studies the Allison group has reanalyzed incorporating the clustering effect (Mietus-Snyder et al and Short et al) involved minority adolescent populations, who would be at heightened risk for socioeconomic disadvantage. Unfortunately, an important issue relevant to health disparity that a statistical manipulation alone cannot address, is fragmentation of traditional family units and potential breakdown in the predictability of household factors.</p>
              <p>Response: Thank you for raising this important matter. We agree that socioeconomic disadvantage and health disparities among adolescences have critical importance. We agree that our reanalysis efforts do not address health disparity issues among adolescents. We do not intend to address any research question with that regard in our manuscript. In this manuscript we are making a critique of an existing published paper because the results of that paper are produced using inappropriate procedures for its design. </p>
              <p>2. Can the authors delineate which household factors are felt to be most critical in justification of the proposed clustered analysis? If dietary factors pertain, does clustered analysis reveal any difference in the diets that were reported to be uniformly poor for both adolescents and adults in the original study? If genetic or epigenetic factors are implicated, what effects do nonbiological family units or shared custody have on clustered analyses? These issues raise an important point of discussion that might be expanded upon by the authors to help explain why the application of clustered analysis – at least in this study and the study reanalyzed in reference (5) does not appear to change the main study conclusions reached without clustering.</p>
              <p>Response: Thank you for raising these interesting matters. These questions present the potential to expand current knowledge and understanding of the factors that may explain correlation of observations within household units in cluster randomized trials. From a methods aspect, the effect of ignoring clustering would be more moderate in designs with more clusters and fewer individual participants per cluster compared to designs with fewer clusters and larger number of individuals per cluster. Situations in which families are randomly assigned to treatments are examples of smaller cluster sizes, such as the article under question here and the study we referred to in Golzarri-Arroyo et al. Any subjective explanation about dietary or genetic factors and their potential role in similarities or dissimilarities within or among households in this particular sample would be speculation, and not addressable within the context of our reanalysis.</p>
              <p>• There are two sets of changes reported upon in this Correction – the first set due to an error in the original time-by-group p-values reported that has apparently been acknowledged by the study authors. It is not apparent why those p-value corrections have not already been published as a Correction as this should be the responsibility of the original study team, once alerted to their error. The title of this Correction by Jamshidi-Naeini implies that it is the application of clustered analysis, not these time x group interaction p-value corrections that changes some conclusions. It does seem apparent that the corrected time by group p-values do not change study conclusions (with the exception of aromatic amino acids tryptophan and phenylalanine, the latter still showing a trend with p = 0.07). This is not however a central observation and does not impact the article’s interpretation. </p>
              <p>It is the second set of p-value changes that are contingent on the newly applied clustered analysis that would still be germane to the Correction submitted by Jamshidi-Naeini et al. The authors support their claim that this approach overcomes an important methodological issue in obesity research with several recent reviews on this topic. Their point is well taken, but the frequent use the terms “correctly” and “appropriately” in describing the application of a clustered analysis seems unnecessarily pejorative, since as already noted, the reanalysis has not actually been demonstrated to change the study’s conclusions. It of course changed p-values, as would be expected with a decrease in the number of independent observations, but only a small number of p-values that were nominally significant become slightly insignificant. Trends remained trends and the strongest observations, on which the original study conclusions are based, remain very significant.</p>
              <p>Response: Thank you for your cogent comment. 1) We agree that it is the responsibility of the original authors and the journal to correct the irreproducibility issue of the article. Both have been notified that a portion of the analyses in the article are not reproducible. We cannot comment on the reason why these errors have not been publicly acknowledged yet. 2) Our altered title should address the issue raised about the title. 3) The purpose of our manuscript is making a critique of an existing published paper because the results of that paper are produced using inappropriate procedures for its design. We have been factual throughout: majority of conclusions that are derived from correct procedures are the same as those derived from incorrect procedures. 4) Until appropriate corrections are made to the article, any comparison of our results with the article’s interpretations would require specification of which model (LMM or GEE) one is comparing our results with and which significance level (0.05 or 0.002) they are using. 5) We understand that referring to our analysis as a ‘correct’ or ‘appropriate’ analysis may be disapproved by some. We thus modified the language where our message was still clear without those words.</p>
              <p>• A 2019 paper cited (ref 6) for which DB Allison is also senior author on “The Need for Greater Rigor in Childhood Nutrition and Obesity Research” states what Jamshidi-Naeini et al were sure to observe in that (quoting from ref 6) “Clustering reduces power”… going on to say “there are instances in which misanalysis of clustered childhood obesity interventions has led to unsubstantiated conclusions.” This certainly is true, but the authors have not demonstrated that it is true in this instance – which circles back to the first two questions above. Which study conclusions have actually been altered by the clustered analysis? And if none, why not?</p>
              <p>Response: Thank you for these remarks. There should be a distinction between “unsubstantiated” results vs. “incorrect” results. There are two approaches to consider this matter: 1) that the procedures used to produce the findings were incorrect for the purported properties of the study design, 2) that the results produced by the procedures used are not the results which would be produced by proper procedures. We clarify that we mean the former, not the latter: when we say the analysis is either wrong or invalid, we mean the procedures used to produce the results were incorrect, and when we say results, we mean the findings produced by the procedures used. In this case, the findings from the incorrect procedures and proper procedures are similar.</p>
              <p>Results and conclusions of the article are unsubstantiated (i.e., unsupported) without our reanalysis. That is, regardless of the magnitude of difference that valid statistical tests would make, results that are derived from inappropriate procedures for the design are unsubstantiated and not verifiable. Incorrect analysis sometimes yields the correct answers and correct analysis sometimes yields incorrect answers (type I and/or type II errors). While we argue that the results are unsubstantiated, we cannot show that they are wrong or right because doing so would require knowing the ‘true’ answer which would be possible by conducting simulations or mathematical derivations to show the degrees of robustness.</p>
              <p>3. A full reading of the original paper reveals a detailed baseline principal components analysis to reduce the dimensionality of the complex lipidomic data set incorporated in baseline correlograms with traditional cardiometabolic risk factors and lipoprotein subspecies. There are also change correlation analyses that reveal numerous hypothesis-generating associations independent of pre-post metabolite p-values. Much of the discussion in the original study is rooted in the correlograms that summarize this body of data. Would clustered analysis lend any further insight to the principal component and correlation analyses? Can the authors explain why their reanalysis does not address these two prominent elements of the original paper?</p>
              <p>Response: We did not intend to reanalyze every analysis in the article, and do not claim as such in our manuscript. Principal components analysis is out of the scope of our discussion in this manuscript. </p>
              <p>Response to Reviewer 2:</p>
              <p>The current investigators pointed out a possible design flaw in the manuscript. That is to say “In a published randomized controlled trial, household units were randomized to a nutrient bar supplementation group or a control condition, but the non-independence of observations within the same household (i.e., the clustering effect) was not accounted for in the statistical analyses." Assuming this to be the case, the investigators provided a side by side comparison of results (clustering vs. non clustering) and proceeded accordingly. The results are very similar. However, that would have to be debated with the original investigators and not this reviewer. The work was thorough and certainly appeared to be presented reasonably in a descriptive, and not methodologic, fashion as was pointed out by the investigators.</p>
              <p>Response: Thank you for reviewing our manuscript. We notified the original research team and the journal of the issues we detected.</p>
