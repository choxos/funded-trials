                <p>We have earlier reported that a single dose of oral cholera vaccine (OCV) is protective in adults and children ≥5 years of age and sustained for 2 years. We enrolled participants (n = 240) from this study, between March-September 2017, over 3 years after receiving a primary single dose. Immune responses were measured in placebo group (Primary Immunization group: PI) and compared with those who received a single dose (Booster Immunization group: BI). The children were 4 to &lt;5 years, 5 to &lt;18 years and adults &gt;18 years. Blood was collected at day 0 (before vaccination) and after receiving 1st and 2nd doses of OCV. Overall, the BI and PI groups showed vibriocidal antibody response after 1st and 2nd dose of vaccination in all age groups to <italic>V. cholerae</italic> O1 and O139. Young children in the BI group showed significantly higher vibriocidal antibody response two weeks after receiving the first dose as compared to PI group to LPS. Elevated plasma IgA responses to LPS after the first dose were observed among the BI group compared to the PI group among the young children. Mucosal antibody responses measured in fecal extracts showed similar increases as that of vibriocidal and LPS responses in the BI group. These results suggest a single boosting dose of OCV generated immune response in primed population &gt;5 years of age who had earlier received OCV. However, young children who had received OCV earlier, boosting after a single dose, resulted in increased immune responses compared to the PI group. Further studies are needed to assess protection obtained from different strategies, especially for young children and to determine the numbers of primary and booster doses needed. In addition, more information is needed regarding the optimum interval between primary and booster doses to plan future interventions for cholera control.</p>

              <p id="p0005">Cholera remains a major public health concern despite years of control efforts, causing an estimated 1.3–4.0 million cases and 21,000–143,000 deaths per year <xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Cholera affects primarily people in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) but also fragile populations in humanitarian crises with poor access to adequate water and sanitation resources. At a global level, prevention focuses on the use of oral cholera vaccines (OCV) to control the disease particularly in outbreaks but also epidemics in endemic settings where rapid action is required <xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. In 2017, the Global Task Force on Cholera Control (GTFCC) launched a strategy aimed at reducing cholera deaths by 90% and eliminating cholera in as many as 20 countries by 2030 <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p>
              <p id="p0010">Although two doses of OCV are recommended for protection against cholera, a single dose of OCV can also prevent cholera cases reducing logistical requirements <xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Several immunogenicity studies with OCV suggest that a single dose of oral cholera vaccine elicits an antibody response similar to that seen after two doses given 2–4 weeks apart <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Epidemiological studies have shown that a single dose of OCV provided moderate protection from cholera <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. In earlier studies, we reported that after intake of two doses of OCV given at 14 days intervals, vibriocidal antibody responses rates against <italic>V. cholerae</italic> O1 Inaba, Ogawa; and O139 serotypes were 60%, 72% and 21% in adults, 84%, 75% and 64% in toddlers, and 74%, 78% and 54% in young children <xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Another study conducted in Kolkata showed an OCV boosting effect five years after the primary series which elicited an increased vibriocidal immune response among children <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. However, vaccine efficacy was lower among children less than 5 years of age <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. In the present study we have evaluated the booster effect on the immune responses among different age groups of children and adults who received a single dose of OCV (Shanchol™) three years earlier and were then given two doses of OCV, 14 days apart.</p>
              <p id="p0015">In 2014, we conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in cholera-prone urban slums of Dhaka, Bangladesh, to estimate the protection to a single dose of OCV. The protective efficacy was 39% against all cholera episodes and 50% against cholera with severe dehydration in the 2 year follow-up. The vaccine protective efficacy was 57% in individuals’ ≥5 years of age. However, in participants &lt;5 years of age, the single dose of vaccine did not show protection against cholera <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, although the study was underpowered to analyze the level of protection <xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Similar to this finding, a systematic review of OCV efficacy has revealed reduced protection among young children compared to individuals &gt;5 years of age following intake of the recommended two doses of OCV <xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. The lower vaccine efficacy after a single dose in children is low even after 6 months <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> and is of concern and prompted us to evaluate the immunogenicity of two additional doses of vaccine administered three year later after the initial OCV single dose. A group of participants from the earlier trial were enrolled in the study <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> to evaluate the boosting effect on the immune responses among children and adults who received a single dose of Shanchol or placebo.</p>

Corresponding stool samples were also collected for measuring anti-LPS specific IgA antibodies. Participants with chronic illness, any recent illness, with history of diarrheal disease within the last 7 days or with febrile illness in the last 24 hours, who took antibiotics in the last 7 days, pregnant women (identified by the urine strip test of married women) were excluded.

Target strains of V. cholerae O1 Inaba (T19479), Ogawa (X25049) and O139 (134B) were incubated with heat-inactivated plasma and exogenous guinea pig complement. Vibriocidal titers were defined as the reciprocal of the highest plasma dilution resulting in a 50% reduction in optical density (595 nm) compared to controls without plasma. To account for inter-assay variation, results were normalized using pooled high titer sera obtained from cholera patients. Positive control sera were used for each plate and assays everyday. The limit of variation to accept the plate was &lt;2 fold of the positive control titre. Seroconversion was defined as a 4-fold or greater increase of vibriocidal titer after vaccination compared to baseline.</p>

The immunogenicity analysis was performed in immunogenicity set which was defined as participants who was received at least one dose of OCV and provide at least one post baseline measure for immunogenicity. In the descriptive analysis, both central tendency (arithmetic mean, median and frequency) and dispersion statistics (range and standard deviation were calculated for participant demographic characteristics and number of adverse events was tabulated among the study groups. For nominal and categorical variables, Fisher’s exact or Chi-square tests and for continuous variable independent two sample <italic>t</italic>-test were performed to see the observed relationship with study groups. Since vibriocidal and anti-LPS antibody responses in plasma specimens may not always follow normal distribution, we reported the geometric mean (GM) as a descriptive statistic instead of arithmetic mean. For comparing the GM among different study groups, we calculated the 95% confidence interval (CI) for each GM and if two CI did not overlap, it was assumed that GMs were significantly different from each other. The ratio of two GMs were tested with reference value 1 to interpret that the GMs were also statistically different. For determining a boosting effect (response), comparison of responses were made between groups (BI and PI) at different study dates after vaccination. Error bar charts were created for presenting GM with CI over the study follow-up days among the study groups. We considered p &lt; 0.05 (two-tailed) as the margin of statistical significance for all test. All the data were entered and managed into Oracle database software by our expert data management team and analyzed using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary NC) and Graph Pad Prism 6.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA) software for figures.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="p0110">Although children bear a heavy burden of cholera globally <xref rid="b0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, vaccination with OCV of young children (&lt;5 years) confers lower levels of protective efficacy and shorter duration of protection than in older children and adults <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="b0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="b0130" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. However, the duration of protection after natural infection seems to be similar in children and adults suggesting that protective immunity conferred by natural infection may differ from that seen after vaccination <xref rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. The mechanisms behind these observations are not well understood. We have previously shown that immune responses, including memory B-cell responses, to V. cholerae LPS were associated with protection against cholera <xref rid="b0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="b0140" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> and that in children memory B-cell responses targeting LPS were induced and more sustained by natural infection than by vaccination <xref rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Considerable effort is being directed toward developing effective mucosal vaccines appropriate delivery systems, especially those targeted to the intestine.</p>
              <p id="p0115">Our study results show comparable safety profile as observed earlier <xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="b0145" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. We showed that immune responses measured by vibriocidal antibody assay and LPS-specific plasma antibody titers induced by OCV vaccination are stronger in participants who received a single dose boosted later by two doses compared to participants who did not receive a single dose of OCV earlier.</p>
              <p id="p0120">The baseline vibriocidal titre was significantly lower in young children compared to older children and adults. In high cholera endemic countries, higher baseline titers among adult and adolescent participants are most likely due to repeated prior exposure to <italic>V. cholerae</italic>
<xref rid="b0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref><italic>.</italic> Furthermore, the BI group had received one dose of OCV earlier, possibly boosted by repeated exposure. In young children, the lower baseline vibriocidal titers suggest that they may be less exposed to <italic>V. cholerae</italic> infection. In addition, young children who had received an earlier single dose of OCV (BI group) did not show a B cell memory response to LPS. In an earlier study, we have been able to show poor memory B cell responses to the LPS antigen but strong responses to cholera toxin B subunit antigen when the OCV (Dukoral) was administered <xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. However good responses is seen in cholera patients to both LPS and the toxoid antigens <xref rid="b0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Thus, it is understandable that young children given the OCV, Shanchol, do not mount memory B cell responses to LPS in this study too.</p>
              <p id="p0125">There was a significant increase of vibriocidal antibody responses after the intake of a OCV dose in adults, older children and young children in both BI and PI group while post second dose of vaccine, there was a significant reduction of antibody response compared to the first immunization (day 14 vs. days 28 and 42) in all age cohorts. This may be due to the reason that antigens in Shanchol™ induced higher serum vibriocidal responses after the first dose of vaccine, reaching a maximum level that could not be boosted further by a second dose administered after a short interval <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Another study conducted in an urban slum of Kolkata <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> showed similar results and this was explained by the reasoning that immune response in the gut that had been stimulated by the first dose may neutralize the effects of the second dose of the oral vaccine, therefore resulting in decreased vibriocidal titers, corroborating similar findings in other studies <xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="b0155" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="b0160" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> as well. The first booster dose of the vaccine may have elicited memory immune responses resulting in a brisk rise in vibriocidal titers with no further rises after the second dose. Therefore, a second dose of vaccine 14 days later does not increase the immunogenicity to OCV in any age group based on our earlier published data <xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. But this result is different from the earlier studies using the OCV, Dukoral, which contains recombinant B subunit of cholera toxin <xref rid="b0165" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> where serum vibriocidal titers increased further post second dose <xref rid="b0170" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="b0175" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. As we have already stated, this may be due to the antigenic composition of the vaccine with higher LPS content in Shanchol™ compared to Dukoral studied earlier <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p>
              <p id="p0130">The boosting effect seen to the OCV in this study in children primed with a single dose earlier may not be applicable to non-endemic countries with immunologically cholera naïve people in humanitarian crisis or natural disasters where cholera outbreaks can occur suddenly.</p>
              <p id="p0135">Our data suggest that young children in endemic countries who are vaccinated with a single dose of OCV, three years earlier (BI group) showed a boosting responses to all three LPS antigens (Ogawa, Inaba and O139) after intake of a dose of vaccine in comparison to the children who received the vaccine series for the first time (PI group). As the baseline vibriocidal antibodies and memory response to <italic>V. cholerae</italic> are lower among the young children in both groups, the boosting effect in the BI group that led to higher vibriocidal titres is due to the earlier single dose priming. Thus, lower antigen exposure to <italic>V. cholerae</italic> in the PI group resulted in relatively lower immune responses than in the BI group. Thus even a single dose given over 3 years ago can act as a priming dose to further booster effect later. However, the level of protection conferred by such late boosts as well as the optimal doses needed for primary and the booster dose needs to be studied in an effectiveness trial in a cholera endemic area.</p>
              <p id="p0140">We also observed strong LPS-specific antibodies post first dose as reported earlier <xref rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. In addition, we observed that all 3 isotypes of antibodies (IgA, IgG and IgM) were significantly upregulated in the systemic circulation after intake of OCV three years later in comparison to the primary immunization group. However, the memory B cell (MBC) responses to LPS antigens 28 days post first vaccination was relatively poor. Earlier studies showed a similar phenomenon to OCV <xref rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. However, for the first time we have carried out this study to evaluate the post boost MBC response in comparison to primary immunization. However, memory response to other cholera antigens (OSP, TcpA, sialidase etc) as well as at different time intervals between priming and boosting may help to better understand B-cell memory responses in different age groups in OCV recipients.</p>
              <p id="p0145">We analyzed fecal IgA antibody responses in the study participants. The analysis shows that fecal extracts of older children and adults contained low levels of total IgA (&lt;10 ug/mL) and so could not be further analyzed for vaccine-specific IgA responses. In contrast, half of the samples from young children fulfilled the inclusion criteria and could be analyzed for LPS specific antibodies. Low levels of total IgA in feces has also been observed in other studies recently <xref rid="b0180" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. We only observed higher responses in BI group to Ogawa LPS in the young children but not to the Inaba LPS. The antibody level to Inaba LPS in the PI group was high and not different from that seen in the BI group. It may also be mentioned that <italic>V. cholerae</italic> O1 Inaba was in circulation in the community at that time (unpublished data) and possibly led to higher exposure and mucosal immune responses to Inaba LPS.</p>
              <p id="p0150">Vibriocidal antibodies are believed to act as a surrogate marker and is considered as an indirect correlate of protection and used commonly to assess vaccine-induced immunity to OCVs <xref rid="b0185" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. The assays however does not provide information on vaccine efficacy following a boosting vs. primary vaccination. Similarly, the immune response measured 14 days after the second OCV dose does not effectively measure the magnitude of the immune response <xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. This study was conducted in an area where <italic>V. cholerae</italic> exposure is frequent. Our immunogenicity findings may not be comparable with the immune responses in non-endemic cholera-prone areas or non-endemic populations in humanitarian crisis. However, in a primed population, significantly elevated levels of vibriocidal and anti-LPS specific antibodies both in the systemic as well as in mucosal compartments were seen in young children receiving the booster dose. The results of this study also suggest that young children less than 5 years of age, need to be given booster OCV doses after an interval of around 3 years, while for older children and adults a longer interval may be sufficient similar to that observed earlier <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Our earlier data has shown that in an endemic setting <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> a single primary dose of OCV was not protective in young children. Based on this evidence, two doses need to be given among the young children in the primary series for protection against cholera. However, further studies are needed to determine the number of primary or booster doses as well as the appropriate interval for boosting immune responses to obtain protection in young children. Efficacy studies need to be complemented with these immunogenicity studies in an endemic population.</p>
