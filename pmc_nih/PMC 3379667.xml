                  <p>Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) potentiates glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). This response is blunted in type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Xenin-25 is a 25–amino acid neurotensin-related peptide that amplifies GIP-mediated GSIS in hyperglycemic mice. This study determines if xenin-25 amplifies GIP-mediated GSIS in humans with normal glucose tolerance (NGT), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), or T2DM. Each fasting subject received graded glucose infusions to progressively raise plasma glucose concentrations, along with vehicle alone, GIP, xenin-25, or GIP plus xenin-25. Plasma glucose, insulin, C-peptide, and glucagon levels and insulin secretion rates (ISRs) were determined. GIP amplified GSIS in all groups. Initially, this response was rapid, profound, transient, and essentially glucose independent. Thereafter, ISRs increased as a function of plasma glucose. Although magnitudes of insulin secretory responses to GIP were similar in all groups, ISRs were not restored to normal in subjects with IGT and T2DM. Xenin-25 alone had no effect on ISRs or plasma glucagon levels, but the combination of GIP plus xenin-25 transiently increased ISR and plasma glucagon levels in subjects with NGT and IGT but not T2DM. Since xenin-25 signaling to islets is mediated by a cholinergic relay, impaired islet responses in T2DM may reflect defective neuronal, rather than GIP, signaling.</p>

          <body>
            <p>Peptides secreted from the gastrointestinal tract play an important role in regulating insulin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). To date, attention has focused on two intestinal peptides: glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP). GLP-1 is produced predominantly by L cells in the distal bowel, whereas GIP is produced mainly by K cells in the proximal intestine. Both peptides are released into the blood immediately after eating and potentiate glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Unlike GLP-1, which stimulates insulin secretion in type 2 diabetes (T2DM), persons with T2DM are thought to be resistant to the actions of GIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>), and increasing GIP signaling has not been pursued as a therapeutic target for T2DM.</p>
            <p>To better understand how GIP regulates the incretin response, we generated and characterized transgenic mice that lack GIP-producing cells by driving expression of an attenuated diphtheria toxin transgene with regulatory elements from the GIP gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). These GIP/DT mice demonstrated markedly attenuated insulin secretory responses to oral glucose even though GLP-1 release was normal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Moreover, the GIP/DT mice exhibited a blunted insulin secretory response to exogenously administered GIP but not GLP-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Thus, GIP-producing cells may secrete a hormone(s) in addition to GIP that plays a critical role in the incretin response.</p>
            <p>Xenin-25 is a 25–amino acid neurotensin-related peptide reportedly produced by a subset of K cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) and would also be reduced in the GIP/DT mice. In vivo experiments demonstrated that xenin-25 potentiated the insulin secretory response to GIP but had little effect alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Similar results were observed in hyperglycemic NONcNZO10/Ltj mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>)—a polygenic model of human T2DM in which diabetes spontaneously develops with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). These studies raise the possibility that xenin-25 could increase the insulin secretory response to GIP in humans. The purpose of the current study was to determine if xenin-25, either alone or with GIP, could amplify the insulin secretory response to glucose in humans with normal glucose tolerance (NGT), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), and/or T2DM.</p>

Studies were performed in the Clinical Research Unit of the Institute of Clinical and Translational Sciences of Washington University after obtaining written informed consent. Male and female subjects with NGT, IGT, and mild T2DM were studied (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Glucose tolerance was defined by the 2-h plasma glucose level during a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test using diagnostic criteria of the American Diabetes Association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Baseline characteristics were determined during a screening visit after a 10-h fast. HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels were required to be ≤9.0 in all subjects. Subjects treated with insulin were excluded. Subjects treated with oral antidiabetic medications were enrolled if the agent(s) could be safely discontinued for 48 h preceding each study visit. These selection criteria were designed to exclude T2DM subjects with advanced β-cell failure and to identify participants with residual insulin secretion who have the potential to respond to incretin peptides. Women of childbearing potential were required to use birth control.

                <p>Studies were performed after a 10-h overnight fast. One intravenous catheter was placed into a hand vein. This hand was kept in a thermostatically controlled box (50–55°C) to facilitate venous sampling and to provide arterialized venous blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). A second intravenous line was inserted for administration of glucose/peptides. Subjects with a fasting blood glucose ≥120 mg/dL were given boluses of intravenous human insulin (∼0.01 units/kg) at 30-min intervals as needed to decrease the blood glucose level to 100–120 mg/dL to limit variability of initial glucose levels. Blood glucose was stable for 20 min before starting the graded glucose infusion (GGI).</p>
                <p>All subjects were administered four separate GGIs, each separated by at least 2 weeks. During the respective GGIs, along with glucose, subjects also received an intravenous infusion with GIP plus xenin-25, GIP alone, albumin alone (no peptide), or xenin-25 alone (subjects were blinded to treatment). From 0 to 40, 40 to 80, 80 to 120, 120 to 160, 160 to 200, and 200 to 240 min, the glucose infusion rates were 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 mg ⋅ kg<sup>−1</sup> ⋅ min<sup>−1</sup>, respectively. Peptides were administered by primed-continuous intravenous infusion. Infusions rates from 0 to 3, 3 to 7, 7 to 10, and 10 to 240 min were 10.8, 7.7, 5.6, and 4.0 pmol ⋅ kg<sup>−1</sup> ⋅ min<sup>−1</sup>.</p>

When experienced, diarrhea occurred within several hours of the infusion and was noted in all three groups. Stools did not contain blood, and diarrhea did not require pharmacologic or medical intervention. Infusion with GIP alone reduced mean arterial blood pressure 10–15 mmHg and increased resting heart rate ∼8 bpm in all three groups. In contrast, xenin-25, either alone or with GIP, had no effect on either parameter. Thus, xenin-25 does not appear to affect autonomic function.</p>

Incremental areas under the curve (iAUCs) were calculated for ISR and plasma glucose for each individual during the 240-min GGI with and without infusion of the xenin-25.

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>GIP is an incretin hormone that in people with NGT, significantly increases the insulin secretory response to glucose. However, since GIP-stimulated insulin release is reportedly blunted in humans with T2DM, this peptide has not been pursued as a therapy for T2DM. The current study was undertaken to further our understanding of attenuated β-cell responsiveness to GIP in T2DM and to elucidate the mechanisms involved in GIP signaling in the β-cell.</p>
              <p>Previous studies from our laboratory show that xenin-25 potentiates GIP-mediated insulin release in two mouse models that exhibit blunted insulin secretory responses to GIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). In contrast, xenin-25 alone had no effect on insulin secretion in either mouse model. Moreover, xenin-25 did not act directly on islet β-cells. Rather, xenin-25 activated a cholinergic relay in the periphery that did not require neurons in the central nervous system. The results presented in this study extend these observations and show that during GGIs at the peptide and glucose levels studied, xenin-25 alone does not affect ISR in humans but does potentiate GIP-mediated insulin secretion in humans with NGT and IGT but curiously, not with T2DM (see below).</p>
              <p>A xenin-25–specific receptor has not been identified, and there is strong evidence that the effects of xenin-25 are mediated by neurotensin receptor-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). Similar to our results with xenin-25 alone, intravenous infusion of neurotensin alone in healthy humans caused no significant change in blood pressure or plasma levels of glucose, insulin, or glucagon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Thus, our results are consistent with those for another neurotensin receptor-1 agonist.</p>
              <p>The GGI is designed to detect subtle changes in the insulin secretory response to glucose. As anticipated, ISRs during the GGIs with albumin alone increased linearly as a function of plasma glucose levels, but the slopes of lines relating ISR to plasma glucose were progressively reduced in the groups with IGT and T2DM compared with NGT. Infusion of xenin-25 alone did not significantly affect insulin secretion compared with the rates measured during control infusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs. 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). In contrast, all subjects, including those with T2DM, exhibited a rapid and transient increase in ISR in response to GIP alone as soon as the peptide/glucose infusions were initiated. Xenin-25 significantly amplified this early response to GIP in subjects with NGT and IGT but not T2DM. After this initial response, ISRs progressively increased as a function of plasma glucose level and were greatest during infusions with GIP plus xenin-25. However, this later response was statistically significant only in subjects with IGT. Unfortunately, plasma glucose levels in the subjects with NGT remained lower during the GGI compared with the other groups. Since glucose-dependent increases in the incretin response were observed starting at ∼160 mg/dL glucose (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>), the effects of GIP plus or minus xenin-25 may be underestimated in this group. Alternatively, GIP-mediated ISR may already be near maximal and cannot be further amplified by xenin-25 in subjects with NGT.</p>
              <p>It is generally assumed that the insulinotropic effects of GIP are blunted in T2DM. However, many studies supporting this conclusion were conducted using hyperglycemic clamps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). In a study of fasting nondiabetic humans, plasma insulin levels rapidly (5 min) and transiently increased immediately after GIP was administered as a single bolus in spite of the fact that plasma glucose remained euglycemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). This pattern of insulin secretion is very similar to that noted during the initial 40-min response during our GGIs in which GIP rapidly and transiently increased ISRs in subjects with NGT, IGT, and T2DM with little change in plasma glucose levels. Thus, it is possible that some effects of GIP are masked during hyperglycemic clamps. Of importance, even though the β-cell response to glucose (i.e., the slopes for ISR vs. plasma glucose during infusion with albumin alone) was progressively decreased in subjects with NGT, IGT, and T2DM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>), the magnitudes of the early responses to GIP were similar in all groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). Our results are thus consistent with the idea proposed by Meier and Nauck (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>) that humans with T2DM may retain the ability to respond to GIP, but reduced GIP responses in these subjects may reflect worsening insulin secretory responses to glucose rather than defective GIP signaling. This is further supported by the fact that the effects of GIP on blood pressure and heart rate were not blunted in humans with T2DM. Moreover, the effects of GIP on ISRs remained elevated even after this initial transient response, suggesting that like the cephalic response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>), this early response to GIP may play an important role in amplifying subsequent insulin secretion.</p>
              <p>As with ISR, xenin-25 also amplified the early and transient GIP-mediated increase in glucagon levels in humans with NGT and IGT but not T2DM. GIP rapidly and transiently increased plasma glucagon levels in healthy humans when administered during euglycemic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>) but not during hyperglycemic clamps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). The very early postprandial glucagon response is thought to prevent hypoglycemia as cells recruit Glut4 and amino acid transporters to the cell surface in anticipation of increased levels of nutrients in the blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). Thus, the rapid and transient amplification of GIP-mediated glucagon release by xenin-25 may reflect a normal islet secretory response to nutrients after an overnight fast. These results also suggest that in humans with T2DM, islets exhibit a blunted response to xenin-25 signaling.</p>
              <p>Mouse studies indicate that pharmacologic doses of xenin-25 increase GIP-mediated insulin release via a cholinergic relay requiring muscarinic receptors in the periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), and M3 muscarinic receptors in islets are required for both insulin and glucagon release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). Results in this study suggest that at the dose required to amplify GIP-mediated insulin secretion in humans, xenin-25 does not increase parasympathetic activity since it had no effect on heart rate, blood pressure, salivation, or need to urinate. Thus, an analogous xenin-25–mediated cholinergic relay is the most likely mechanism for increasing insulin and glucagon release in humans. It is worth noting that in contrast to a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>), we have been unable to detect endogenous IR-xenin in either mouse or human plasma prepared under fasting, fed, or postprandial conditions using an ELISA that can detect &lt;2 pmol/L peptide, raising the possibility that xenin-25 is not a physiologic peptide. Moreover, we have not seen other reports where endogenous xenin has been measured in plasma or purified K cells. Alternatively, endogenous xenin-25 may be modified such that it is not detected by our ELISA. Characterization of xenin-25 purified from plasma or isolated K cells would be required to address this issue. If xenin-25 is a physiologic peptide, it is unclear if local levels (e.g., at nerve endings near the K cell) would be high enough to modify islet function in vivo. However, our results with exogenously administered xenin-25 provide important insights into β-cell function during the progression from NGT to IGT to T2DM even if xenin-25 is not a physiologic peptide or if physiologic levels do not modify islet function. These results also suggest that defects in cholinergic or neuronal signaling in the periphery may contribute to defective insulin secretion in humans with T2DM. For example, xenin-25–responsive cells involved in this relay may produce and/or release reduced amounts of acetylcholine, or islet endocrine cells may exhibit reduced sensitivity to acetylcholine. Alternatively, transmitters produced and released by xenin-25–responsive cells in humans with T2DM may be different from those in humans with NGT and IGT. Studies are underway to distinguish between these different mechanisms.</p>
