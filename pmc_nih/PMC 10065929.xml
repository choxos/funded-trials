Clinical outcomes will include HIV viral suppression, alcohol use, assessed by audio computer-assisted self-interview (ACASI) and direct alcohol biomarkers, Phophatidylethanol and Ethyl glucuronide, and comorbid MH and other SU.

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="P4">Unhealthy alcohol use (UAU) is a significant driver of the HIV epidemic and reduces the clinical and quality of life outcomes of people living with HIV (PLWH) [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. UAU may also contribute to accelerated development of end organ diseases like cardiovascular disease, cancer, and neurocognitive deficits among PLWH [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Concerningly, the HIV health system is not well-equipped to respond, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa (sSA), where most PLWH receive care [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Within most HIV programs, the standard of care and typically only alcohol treatments available are alcohol brief interventions (BI). BIs can be clinically and cost-effective for reducing hazardous alcohol use and are often highly implementable [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>–<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, BIs did not lead to alcohol reduction among PLWH in SSA in several controlled clinical trials [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. One explanation for limited effectiveness of alcohol BIs among PLWH in sSA may be the high burden of comorbid mental health (MH) and other substance use (SU), which BIs are not designed to address [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p>
              <p id="P5">One intervention in sSA that holds promise for treatment of UAU among PLWH is Common Elements Treatment Approach (CETA). CETA is a modular transdiagnostic cognitive behavioral therapy-based protocol that allows a provider, over a course of 6–12 sessions, to treat a range of clinical presentations including substance use, anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. CETA was designed deliberately for low and middle-income countries (LMIC) and features streamlined approaches that permit delivery by lay health workers with no prior mental/behavioral health training [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In several non-HIV randomized evaluations, CETA reduced alcohol use and range of behavioral health comorbidities [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. While promising, CETA’s effectiveness and implementation factors among PLWH in sSA require further evaluation. Current HIV care models now minimize the times PLWH must visit their facility; therefore, whether people with HIV and UAU will adequately take up and complete a multi-session intervention like CETA needs to be established.</p>
              <p id="P6">We now describe the study protocol for a randomized controlled clinical trial among adults with HIV and UAU in Zambia. Using a 3-arm design, the trial will evaluate both CETA and an alcohol BI, based on CETA’s substance use element, for treatment of UAU. A range of HIV, alcohol, and behavioral health outcomes will be assessed. In addition, the trial includes prospective assessment of implementation outcomes, including cost effectiveness analysis, to inform future use.</p>

                <title>Overall study design</title>
                <p id="P7">The CETA HIV Alcohol Reduction Trial in Zambia (CHARTZ) is a type 1 hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial to compare the effectiveness of CETA and a one-session alcohol BI to standard of care, and to each other, and to measure implementation factors related to the integrated delivery of the interventions (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The study is guided by a conceptual framework, the modified version of Anderson’s Behavioral Model [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], which has been used to describe the utilization of health services by underserved populations globally. Use of this framework will ensure CHARTZ considers the contextual environment, the healthcare environment, and patient characteristics. Our clinical hypothesis is that both CETA and the BI alone will improve clinical outcomes and CETA will be superior to BI alone, as it can address both UAU and co-occurring and underlying mental and behavioral health comorbidities. Clinical hypotheses will be evaluated through a 3-arm individual randomized clinical trial with the primary outcome of HIV as viral load suppression (VLS), which is the central goal of HIV care. We also hypothesize that both interventions will be acceptable to patients with HIV and UAU and staff at HIV clinics, will be cost effective, and will be considered potentially scalable in Zambia.</p>
                <p id="P8">During protocol development, we met with officials at the Ministry of Health (MoH), study HIV clinics, and community health leaders in clinic catchment areas. These meetings raised awareness of the study, and helped to refine procedures for recruitment of participants and delivery of interventions. CHARTZ was approved by the University of Alabama at Birmingham Institutional Research Board, the University of Zambia Biomedical Research Ethics Committee, and the National Health Research Authority in Zambia. The trial was registered on ClinicalTrials. gov (<ext-link xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05121064" ext-link-type="uri">NCT05121064</ext-link>; date of registration, November 12, 2021) before participant enrollment. The SPIRIT guidelines for clinical trial protocols were used to present this protocol paper.</p>

                  <p id="P10">At study clinics, we will solicit referrals of adult patients with HIV who report any degree of alcohol use in the past 3 months, have suboptimal HIV outcomes in the past year, or both. HIV clinic staff will be trained in CHARTZ rationale and eligibility criteria. Patients will be recruited during daily health talks in the waiting area or during ART adherence counseling.</p>

                  <title>Counselors</title>
                  <p id="P11">HIV peer counselors at study clinics will also participate. HIV peer counselors are lay health workers (usually with 9th to 12th grade education) who have basic psychosocial counseling experience and provide various services at the HIV clinic including patient navigation, HIV testing, filing, and health talks. Based on their CV and a brief interview, 5–6 counselors will be selected per clinic. Selected HIV peer counselors will be trained in the alcohol BI, CETA, and a safety protocol in case of suicidal or homicidal ideations. Training entails a 2-week in person classroom training, a series of practice groups, and ongoing weekly supervision. It is co-led by international clinical psychologists who have master’s or doctorate degree, and local Zambian therapists who are highly trained in CETA; while not required, some local trainers also have advanced degrees. Only when supervised practice groups are completed and the supervisor is satisfied with fidelity to the model will counselors be allowed to provide interventions to trial participants. Trained HIV peer counselors will be invited to optionally be study participants themselves. If agreeable, up to 20 counselors will provide written informed consent for evaluation of their delivery of the intervention and perspectives on implementation.</p>

                <title>Patient eligibility screening, informed consent, and baseline assessment</title>
                <p id="P13">At referral, a research assistant (RA) will meet with patients to discuss the study and pre-screen for possible eligibility (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). If potentially eligible and agreeable to participate, informed consent will be obtained from the patient for the remaining screening process and inclusion in the trial if eligible. After consent, a unique study number will be issued to the participant and used in all subsequent forms and data. The remaining screening process includes a battery of patient reported outcome (PRO) surveys (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). PROs will be captured using an Audio Computer Assisted Self-Interview (ACASI) on a laptop computer [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The ACASI begins with the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test. Using an algorithm, if the participant reports no/moderate alcohol use is reported, making her/him ineligible for the trial, remaining items will be skipped. If unhealthy alcohol use, scales for behavioral health comorbidities, (depression, posttraumatic stress, anxiety, other substance use) and health-related quality of life will follow (see <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Screening for suicidal and homicidal ideation is also included. Overall, completion of the ACASI will take as little as 5 min for ineligible patients and around 30–45 min for those who enter the trial.</p>
                <p id="P14">After completion of ACASI, the final screen will display final trial eligibility (yes/no) and will flag safety if either suicidal or homicidal ideation is reported. If safety is flagged, a study HIV peer counselor will meet the client immediately to discuss the safety issue and make a safety plan. The plan will be discussed over the phone with their supervisor. If necessary, the participant will be brought for additional services. Once safety is addressed, eligible participants will be randomized. For clients who are trial-eligible, ACASI data form the baseline assessment. In addition to ACASI, baseline HIV treatment data (see <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) will also be extracted from medical records.</p>

                <p id="P15">Randomization of patient participants is conducted by the RA immediately after confirmation of trial eligibility. A statistician will generate lists of randomization ID numbers before trial commencement, and randomization will be stratified by both sex and clinic site. IDs within each stratum were randomly allocated on a ratio 1:1.2:1.2 to SOC, alcohol BI only, or BI plus referral to CETA respectively, using the <italic toggle="yes">ralloc</italic> procedures in Stata 17 MP8 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas, USA). Randomization will be blocked and RAs will be blind to the blocking sequence. The randomization assignments, for men and women, will be kept sequentially inside sealed opaque envelopes at each site to be opened by the RA at randomization. Only the data analyst, and not the participants and RAs, will be blinded to the assigned arms.</p>

                <p id="P16">After randomization, we will also collect baseline urine and blood samples. The RA will test a fresh sample of at least 10 ml of urine for 16 commonly misused substances (see <xref rid="SM1" ref-type="sec">supplementary material</xref>), including ethyl glucuronide (EtG) at a threshold of detection of 500 ng/ml, using a commercially available test cup. EtG is an alcohol biomarker that was highly specific in urine for recent (past 3 days) alcohol use [<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. As urine rapid substance use testing is not definitive, results will be for research only and not provided to the participant or the counselor for clinical use. We will also collect 10 ml of blood in an EDTA bottle using venipuncture. A 5-spot (~50 μl per spot) dried blood spot card will be made with a pipette and remaining blood will be used to measure HIV RNA concentration in plasma. HIV VL results will be returned to clinics within 2 weeks and will be used in patient care. Per local guidelines, if VL is &gt;1000 copies/ml, the patient will be referred for EAC. DBS cards will be stored frozen until batch testing for phosphatidylethanol (PEth), an alcohol metabolite on red blood cells that reflects alcohol consumption in past 3 weeks [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p>

Among those who are retained, follow-up visits will occur at 6 and 12 months post-enrollment, usually in conjunction with scheduled ART medication pickups. At follow-up assessments, a very similar ACASI will be completed, urine will tested for EtG, and blood will be used measure HIV VL and Peth in DBS. At enrollment and each follow-up assessment, participants will receive a transportation reimbursement equivalent to ~6 US dollars.</p>

                  <p id="P18">Standard of care at the HIV clinics is ART adherence counseling, which is brief semi-structured one-on-one counseling, lasting 3–10 min, that is focused on HIV medication adherence but includes brief unstructured screening and discussion of alcohol use. ART adherence counseling will be received by all participants, regardless of trial arm, at each ART medication pickup during the study. We previously reported that that ART adherence counseling can have a moderate impact on unhealthy alcohol use [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Only HIV peer counselors not trained in study interventions will provide ART adherence counseling. Adherence counseling is documented in the HIV medical record.

Study investigators developed the BI, which has 6 components (see <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), with input from local partners working in the HIV health system in Zambia. It was designed for implementation and can be completion in just 20–30 min via a single face-to-face session. CHARTZ is the first randomized evaluation of the BI. For participants assigned to the BI alone or BI plus CETA arms, the RA will refer the participant to a trained HIV peer counselor on the day of enrollment or within the next week if necessary. During the BI, counselors use a structured tool called the Improving Your Health (IYH) worksheet (see <xref rid="SM1" ref-type="sec">supplemental material</xref>), which was developed to help counselors structure the session and keep it to the 20–30 min target.</p>

                  <p id="P20">After receiving the alcohol BI as described above, participants assigned to the CETA arm will be linked to the intervention over the next 1–2 weeks. CETA (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.cetaglobal.org/" ext-link-type="uri">www.cetaglobal.org</ext-link>) is comprised of 8 modular elements and is tailored to the needs of the client (see <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. At weekly supervision meetings, the supervisor will assign newly referred participants to an available HIV peer counselor, preferably the same one that provided the BI, to leverage existing rapport. The supervisor will also provide guidance to the counselor on the treatment plan (i.e., module selection and flow). After assignment, the counselor will phone, or if necessary visit the participant at home, to arrange for the first CETA session. A typically course of CETA entails 6–12 weekly sessions with the same counselor, scheduled at times and locations convenient for both parties. While we expect most CETA sessions will occur in person, telephone-based CETA is also available if requested by the participant. The CETA manual was adapted for telehealth delivery, incorporating best practices in telehealth and recommendations from Zambian health providers. Each session begins with a 27-item Likert scale client monitoring form (CMF; see <xref rid="SM1" ref-type="sec">supplementary material</xref>), which gives the counselor feedback on treatment response, and lasts 45–90 min. The CETA course is complete when the planned treatment has been given and a clinical response is observed via the CMF.</p>

                  <title>Clinical outcomes</title>
                  <p id="P22">Our primary clinical outcome will be HIV VLS at 6 months post-enrollment. VLS will be defined as HIV RNA concentration below assay detection. If assays with varying levels of detection (such as &lt;40 and &lt; 60 copies/ml) are used, the analysis will consider the highest level of detection as cut-off for the primary outcome. In secondary analysis HIV RNA &lt;1000 copies/ml, widely used in the HIV program, will be considered as VLS. Secondary HIV outcomes at 12 months include VLS, non-retention in HIV care, based on &gt;28 days late for an ART refill, and medical possession ratio adherence &lt;90%. Non-HIV secondary outcomes include change in alcohol use, other substance use, comorbid symptoms of mental illness, and health-related quality of life from enrollment to 6 and 12 months. Change in alcohol use will be based on change in AUDIT score and by alcohol biomarkers. We will examine the change in UAU, defined as Peth &gt;50 ng/ml [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], as well as change in quantitative Peth concentration. We will also re-analyze primary and secondary outcomes after exclusion of patients with false reports of abstinence at 6 and 12 months (i.e., AUDIT score = 0 and either EtG-positive or Peth &gt;8 ng/ml).</p>

                  <title>Implementation outcomes</title>
                  <p id="P23">During the trial, we will prospectively track uptake and completion of interventions in CHARTZ. We will systematically track participant completion of the alcohol BI, uptake of CETA, defined as completion of their first CETA session, time providers dedicate to client tracking/retention in CETA, and CETA completion. Sociodemographic, clinical, and structural factors associated with CETA non-completion by 6 months will be sought using multivariable logistic regression. At the 6-month follow-up visit, a subset of around 50 participants assigned to BI plus referral to CETA will complete a mixed methods survey of implementation outcomes. Implementation measures will focus on the acceptability, appropriateness, cost, and feasibility of CETA and the alcohol BI. We will deliberately include participants who were randomized to but did not complete CETA.</p>
                  <p id="P24">Counselor and supervisor competency and fidelity to the interventions will also be assessed. Counselors will take structured knowledge surveys at 3 time points: after initial trainings, after completion of 1–2 CETA cases, and mid-way through the study. Supervisors will also take a knowledge survey at 3 time points: after initial trainings, after supervising for 3 months, and after supervising for 6 months. In addition, we will conduct role plays with counselors and measure competency using a standardized form. This will be done twice for each counselor during the study.</p>
                  <p id="P25">During the second half of the study, we will also enroll non-patient participants (see <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). HIV peer counselors and clinic staff will be invited to participate in focus groups and/or in-depth interviews to explore the acceptability, appropriateness, reach, feasibility, and attitudes, thoughts, feelings, and barriers and facilitators related to implementation. Individual qualitative interviews will be held with key informants, to understand perspectives on intervention sustainability, scale-up, and stakeholder buy-in. Qualitative data will be digitally recorded, translated into English if necessary, and transcribed.</p>
                  <p id="P26">We will also measure cost and cost-effectiveness. Implementation cost per participant (in Zambian Kwacha and U.S. dollars, purchasing parity adjusted) will be estimated for each trial arm using standard micro-costing techniques. We will rely on accounting documents and interviews with administrative and finance staff, supplemented by direct observation at facilities. Routine time and motion studies will collect data on counselors’ specific time on relevant tasks (i.e., provision of BI and CETA sessions, follow-up of clients) by arm. Program management costs such as costs of coordination and fiscal management and regular meetings will also be estimated. Total cost will include expenditures for personnel, recurring supplies, and services (including electricity, water, internet, phone call charges and other utilities), capital expenditure, and building space. Research and routine clinical costs (i.e., costs of HIV care that are covered by the Zambian government, U.S. Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or other parties) will be excluded.</p>

                <title>Sample size and data analysis</title>
                <p id="P28">The primary endpoint of the trial is VLS at 6 months. We estimated that in the control arm, 70% of patient participants would have VLS, in those receiving alcohol BI alone this would be 85%, and in those assigned to BI plus CETA it would be 95%. Our sample size calculation included 80% power and was adjusted for three comparisons with an alpha level set to 0.017 and a two-sided Person’s chi-squared test. All three comparisons were considered superiority analyses. We also inflated the sample size by 10% account for patients who transfer out to a non-study clinic or die before the primary outcome and 15% to account for missing HIV VL results. Using the most conservative of the above calculations, we estimated that we would require 200 in SOC, 240 in alcohol BI, and 240 in BI plus CETA, for a total sample size of 680. With that sample size we will be powered for alcohol and other mental and behavioral health comorbidities.</p>
                <p id="P29">Primary analyses will be intention to treat (ITT). Our primary outcome VLS will be dichotomous. We will use logistic regression model to estimate the effect of intervention (indicator variable). We will perform pairwise comparisons of the margin linear predictions, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-value, and 95% CI, adjusted for Bonferroni correction. Patients with missing data on VLS at 6 months will be excluded from the primary outcome analysis. In a sensitivity analysis, those with missing VL at 6 months will be assumed to have a detectable level. Dichotomous secondary outcomes will be analyzed in an analogous way. The effect of the interventions on changes in alcohol use, from enrollment to 6 and/or 12 months, based on AUDIT score will be analyzed using random-effects logistic regression model. In addition, the proportion with unhealthy alcohol use, defined either by AUDIT or Peth &gt;50 ng/ml, will be compared at 6 and 12 months between arms. Continuous outcomes including AUDIT score will be analyzed using linear regression model or log-normal regression model as appropriate. All analyses will be performed using Stata 17 MP8. To simulate the cost and cost-effectiveness, we will build a state-transition decision-analytic model using TreeAge Pro 2022.R2 (TreeAge<sup>®</sup> Software, Willamstown, MA). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (U.S. dollar/QALY) will be used to assess the interventions’ cost-effectiveness [<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p id="P31">CHARTZ will help to advance the screening and treatment of UAU among PLWH in several ways. Results will inform whether and to what degree integration of screening and treatment of co-occurring mental illness is needed when managing UAU among PLWH. The impact of a highly implementable alcohol-focused BI will be determined. Alcohol use, an important secondary outcome, will be measured innovatively with both self-report and biomarkers, allowing us to explore the role of these in clinical care and reduce the impact of reporting bias on trial outcomes. Analyses combining self-report and alcohol biomarkers may also help advocate for the need for objective measures of alcohol use in treatment programs. CHARTZ will also generate data on the prevalence of overlapping behavioral health comorbidities, mediators and moderators of intervention effects, and implementation factors. Although the study focuses on HIV outcomes as primary, which is the current focus of HIV programs in sSA, there is increased focus on health-related quality of life and functional status, which are negatively impacted by the behavioral issues at the heart of CHARTZ. Therefore, results may only increase in relevance as there is shift to outcomes beyond viral suppression [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p>
              <p id="P32">Several limitations warrant discussion. Both interventions tested include an assessment component; therefore, unraveling the separate impacts of assessment versus therapy will not be possible. The dose of CETA varies based on the need of the client; therefore, we will not be able to explore a dose-response relationship in our analysis. CHARTZ will occur in urban Lusaka; thus, implementation outcomes will need to be further evaluated at rural settings. Although we will recruit some clients from clinic ‘late lists’ of clients at risk of loss to follow-up, our recruitment approach focuses on PLWH who come to clinic seeking services. PLWH who are disengaged from care will not be well-represented in CHARTZ, reducing our external validity somewhat. Future studies may consider integrating CETA or BI delivery with community-delivered interventions for PLWH.</p>
