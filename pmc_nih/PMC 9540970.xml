                <p>Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) self-management support (SMS) programs can yield improved clinical outcomes but may be limited in application or impact without considering individuals’ unique social and personal challenges that may impede successful diabetes outcomes. The current study compares an evidence-based SMS program with an enhanced version that adds a patient engagement protocol, to elicit and address unique patient-level challenges to support improved SMS and diabetes outcomes. Staff from 12 Community Health Center (CHC) clinical sites were trained on and delivered: Connection to Health (CTH; 6 sites), including a health survey and collaborative action planning, or Enhanced Engagement CTH (EE-CTH; 6 sites), including additional relationship building training/support. Impact of CTH and EE-CTH on behavioral self-management, psychological outcomes, and modifiable social risks was examined using general linear mixed effects. Clinics enrolled 734 individuals with T2DM (CTH = 408; EE-CTH = 326). At 6- to 12-month postenrollment, individuals in both programs reported significant improvements in self-management behaviors (sugary beverages, missed medications), psychological outcomes (stress, health-related distress), and social risks (food security, utilities; all <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; .05). Compared with CTH, individuals in EE-CTH reported greater decreases in high fat foods, salt, stress and health-related distress; and depression symptoms improved within EE-CTH (all <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; .05). CTH and EE-CTH demonstrated positive behavioral, psychological, and social risk impacts for T2DM in CHCs delivered within existing clinical work flows and a range of clinical roles. Given the greater improvements in psychological outcomes and behavioral self-management in EE-CTH, increased attention to relationship building strategies within SMS programs is warranted.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Thirty million adults are currently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) in the USA and millions more remain undiagnosed [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Many of these individuals live and receive medical care in ethnically diverse low-income communities served by our nation’s 14,000 Community Health Centers (CHCs). CHCs often have limited resources to provide diabetes self-management support (SMS) [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Because up to 95% of the variation in diabetes-related clinical outcomes (e.g., HbA1c) result from patient behaviors that require self-management [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], there is an urgent need to develop, improve, and disseminate effective and sustainable diabetes SMS programs in CHCs.</p>
              <p>Broadly defined, SMS refers to the provision of information, skills, and resources necessary for patients to manage their health as effectively as possible through patient-centered and coordinated team care [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Existing SMS programs have led to improvements in self-management behaviors (diet, physical activity, medication taking) [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], clinical indicators (glycemic outcomes, body mass index, cholesterol), and quality of life [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, the vast majority of SMS programs employ a “one size fits all approach” that largely ignores the unique aspects of patient and provider context that drive and maintain disease-related behavior change over time, thus, reducing SMS program effectiveness [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The majority of these programs show little evidence of clinical benefit beyond 6 months [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Moreover, these programs have generally not been tailored for use by clinical teams in resource-limited settings serving patients confronted by multiple social needs or suffering disproportionately from health inequities [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Thus, while existing SMS programs show promise, there remain unanswered questions regarding their usability and general effectiveness in CHCs [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p>
              <p>Considerable clinical research suggests that the addition of a structured, evidenced-based program of patient engagement, seamlessly infused within SMS behavioral change activities, can maximize the effectiveness of SMS programs for patients with T2DM in primary care [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. <italic toggle="yes">Patient engagement</italic> is the process by which healthcare teams actively involve and support patients to act on specific behavior change while attending to their personal context, perspective, and beliefs [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. While the broad umbrella of patient engagement includes multiple strategies, core components include: patient-centered communication that elicits the patient’s concerns and experiences and builds trust between the healthcare team and the patient; focus on dynamic and evolving conditions of the patient’s environment; and responsiveness to patient’s thoughts, emotions, and unique needs around their illness management in ways that drive subsequent behavior change decisions [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Examples of current patient engagement strategies include: Autonomy Support [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], Patient Empowerment [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and Motivational Interviewing [<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. These strategies may be helpful for patients who experience significant barriers to behavioral change (e.g., lower health literacy, poverty, or unique social and emotional challenges) [<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. T2DM treatment programs that have included these patient engagement strategies have demonstrated: increased reach, improved attendance and active programmatic use, greater success in achieving patient behavioral goals, and improved psychosocial outcomes and glycemic control [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] including glycemic outcomes at 1 year [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The seamless infusion of a strong and well-structured patient engagement component into SMS, therefore, should maximize long-term SMS effectiveness especially among high risk underserved adults with T2DM. To date, however, there has been no systematic study of the degree to which fully integrating enhanced patient engagement as part of SMS will impact individuals’ behavior change over time (e.g., &gt;6 months).</p>
              <p>Our research addresses this gap by comparing an evidenced-based electronic SMS behavior change program called Connection to Health (CTH), with an enhanced CTH program that includes a practical patient engagement protocol (Enhanced Engagement CTH [EE-CTH]). In this pragmatic cluster-randomized trial, 12 CHCs clinical sites were randomized and healthcare providers were trained to provide either CTH or EE-CTH to patients as part of their diabetes care primary care appointments. In this report, we focus on patient-reported outcomes that examine program impact on modifiable behavioral and environmental factors linked with diabetes clinical outcomes [<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]: behavioral self-management (e.g., diet, physical activity, medication taking), psychological outcomes (health distress, depression symptoms), and actionable social risks (e.g., food insecurity, housing instability). In doing so, we asked two questions: (a) did significant change within each intervention group occur between baseline and 6–12 months follow-up, and (b) was there an added benefit of EE-CTH relative to CTH (differences <italic toggle="yes">between</italic> the intervention groups)?</p>

                <title>Sample and recruitment</title>
                <p>We conducted a two-arm, pragmatic, cluster-randomized trial to evaluate the added benefit of EE-CTH relative to CTH for patients with T2DM in 12 CHCs. Outcomes (behavior self-management, psychological, social risk) were assessed as part of the program at enrollment and again at 6–12 months from baseline. Clinic randomization was based on health system membership and T2DM panel size using a balancing criterion; with one randomization solution selected at random from the resulting balanced randomization solutions [<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Twelve clinical sites (6 = CTH; 6 = EE-CTH; <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) were enrolled from five safety net health systems within the San Francisco Bay Collaborative Research Network (SFBayCRN). These included 10 sites from four federally qualified health centers and two sites from one county health system. Each clinic site was responsible for enrolling a minimum of 62 eligible patients and delivering the protocol to which they were randomized utilizing existing staff and providers, with work flows modified as needed by the clinics to include the program elements. Enrolled patients had to be ≥18 years old, diagnosed with T2DM and receiving care at the clinic for ≥12 months prior to enrollment and able to read in English or Spanish (≥6th grade level). The program was available in English and Spanish. Exclusion criteria were limited to severe mental and/or cognitive disorders. Patient eligibility was verified by clinic electronic medical record data. Clinic staff were given broad latitude over which patients to enroll within these eligibility criteria. All clinics indicated their desire to focus enrollment on patients with an elevated HbA1c (7.5% and higher) while allowing patients with lower HbA1c values to enroll based on staff discretion. Data for this study were collected between 2017 and 2020 and analyzed in 2020 and 2021.</p>

                  <p>CTH is a structured, evidence-based, electronic SMS program for T2DM with details available at <ext-link xlink:href="https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/connectiontohealth" ext-link-type="uri">https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/connectiontohealth</ext-link> [<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. CTH guides patients and healthcare providers through multiple steps: (a) The person with diabetes (PWD) completes an electronic health survey that assesses areas of self-management and contextual circumstances that may impact self-management (e.g., diet, medication taking, stress), and identifies possible self-management problems from a list of 15; (b) The PWD prioritizes 1–2 problem areas they want to discuss with their healthcare provider; (c) The healthcare provider reviews the results with the PWD; (d) In collaboration, the PWD and healthcare provider select a goal from a list suggested for the self-management problems or a custom goal and together create a detailed action plan. The electronic action plan is structured with written prompts and free text space to guide the provider and PWD through systematic action planning including: goal selection, brainstorming actions (what the PWD will do), selecting and creating a detailed plan for one action (when, how often, where), barriers to acting on the plan, and confidence in carrying out the plan [<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].

                  <p>Providers in EE-CTH received the same training provided in CTH, plus additional structured training in patient engagement and relationship building skills using Motivational Interviewing, Brief Negotiation, and AASAP strategies [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. These included two stylistic elements: active listening (paying attention, talking less) and use of open-ended statements; and four content elements: (a) labeling patient feelings and beliefs, (b) use of summarize and reflect statements (e.g., “so you are saying that…”), (c) normalize and accept (e.g., “many of the people I work with feel the same way”), and (d) double reflections to understand and summarize the ambivalence that individuals may experience (“you seem to feel two ways about this: On the one hand…and on the other hand….”) [<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The EE-CTH electronic program emphasized consideration of how the patients’ underlying thoughts, feelings, and life context influence their disease management behavior. Building on the CTH program, electronic program elements unique to EE-CTH were: (a) four PWD facing (30–90 s) videos that emphasized the “why” of the program elements (e.g., why is your healthcare provider asking you these questions) and anticipatory guidance statements to prepare PWD for how they may feel (e.g., you may feel disappointed or frustrated when you see your health assessment results) [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and (b) an alternative action plan sequence that prompts and supports healthcare professional use of relationship building strategies.</p>

Baseline clinic characteristics were similar across the CTH and EE-CTH clinics regarding size (mean 1,198 ± 1,586 and 1,148 ± 1,079 total patients seen per week), number of patients with T2DM (mean 1,965 ± 2,500 and 2,192 ± 2,466), and % of patients with HbA1c &gt; 9.0 (21.2% vs. 26.6%). Over two-thirds of patients were receiving Medical or Medicare insurance (76.7% vs. 69.9%).</p>
              <p>CTH clinics enrolled a combined 408 eligible patients and 326 individuals were enrolled by EE-CTH clinics (total sample <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 734). The patient sample mean (<italic toggle="yes">SD</italic>) age was 54.0 years (11.8), 59.5% self-identified as female, 72.2% self-identified as Latino, and 59.5% completed high school or greater education.

Length of time between enrollment and follow-up assessment was on average 9.05 (2.35) months in the CTH group and 8.62 (2.38) in EE-CTH. Attrition rates at follow-up did not differ by group (18.1% CTH, 24.5% EE-CTH, <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>); greater attrition in both groups was associated with participants who did not identify as Latino, obtained higher education, or reported unstable housing or transportation problems (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; .05).

                <p>At enrollment, self-management challenges were common (<xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). For example, 57% of all participants reported daily consumption of sugar sweetened beverages (e.g., soda), on average participants reported missing taking medications 1.7 days a week, and 71% reported engaging in fewer than the nationally recommended 150 min of physical activity a week. At follow-up, statistically significant improvements were found in four of the eight measures of behavioral self-management in the EE-CTH group including: significant reductions in high fat foods, salt and sugar sweetened beverages, and fewer missed medication days (<xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). In the CTH group, significant improvements were reported in the two areas of sugar sweetened beverage consumption and missed medication days (<xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Directly compared with individuals in the CTH condition, those in the EE-CTH condition reported significantly larger improvements in diet, seen in both larger decreases in high fat food and salt in their diet (<xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). There was no significant change in vegetable consumption, alcohol or smoking in either intervention group or other differences between groups over time.</p>

                <p>At enrollment, 39% of the sample in both groups reported experiencing one or more of the four actionable social risks assessed. For individuals experiencing social risks, CTH and EE-CTH action planning could include referrals and navigation assistance within the clinic (e.g., clinic food pantry, social worker) and/or community resources (e.g., community food bank) to address social risks. At follow-up statistically significant decreases in the frequency of food insecurity and concerns paying utilities/bills were reported in both the CTH and EE-CTH groups (<xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). There were no significant differences in the degree of improvement between groups nor a change in rates of reported housing instability or transportation challenges in either group over time (<xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Among adults with T2DM receiving care in CHC primary care settings, we examined the impact of two SMS programs and tested the added utility of an enhanced patient engagement program (EE-CTH) relative to a strictly behaviorally focused SMS program (CTH). Our results indicate multiple positive behavioral, psychological, and social impacts of both programs 6–12 months following initial assessment and action planning. On average, individuals exposed to the both programs reported significant improvements in: drinking fewer sugar sweetened beverages, fewer missed medication days, lower general life stress and health-related distress, food security, and paying for utilities or other bills. In contrast, compared with individuals in CTH, those in EE-CTH reported larger decreases in high fat foods and salt in their diet, and larger reductions in general life stress and health-related distress. Notably, significant improvements in depression symptoms were reported in EE-CTH only. These results build on extant literature that supports the utility and impact of SMS programs in primary care [<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and SMS diabetes programs delivered by community health workers [<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], and extend these findings to suggest that interweaving enhanced patient engagement strategies in CHC clinical environments is impactful.</p>
              <p>Major improvements in participant-reported psychological well-being occur, including a reduction in health-related distress. Within group changes and between group differences in health-related distress are clinically and statistically meaningful, exceeding the minimal clinically important difference [<xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] of ≥0.21. Health-related distress for individuals with diabetes or diabetes distress is linked with clinical outcomes (e.g., HbA1c) and has been increasingly recognized as an important stand-alone outcome [<xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. While multiple psychological and behavioral intervention studies have now documented distress reductions in controlled studies, very few have been delivered within the real world of primary care and by clinic staff across a range of roles.</p>
              <p>In both CTH and EE-CTH, we observe significant reductions in the two most frequently endorsed actionable social risks: food insecurity and ability to pay bills. The magnitude of change for these social risks is in line with outcomes from other intervention programs that have exclusively targeted social risk reduction suggesting the integration of social risks within a broader SMS program can be effective [<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Reductions in risks related to housing and transportation, however, were minimal, which may reflect the relative lack of within clinic and/or community resources that were available to patients in geographic locations of the study. There were no between group differences in these findings. It may be that staff screen for and intervene on social risks to the extent possible, leading to minimal additional impact of the EE-CTH prompts and support. As CHCs increasingly screen for and seek to address actionable social risks within their workflows and across different roles, it will be important to continue to understand the impact of blended intervention and engagement approaches and to further test how social risk screening can be more fully integrated into more comprehensive management programs.</p>
              <p>Although two of the most common behavioral self-management challenges at initial assessment are servings of vegetables and physical activity, and a majority of action plans focus in these areas [<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], we do not find improvements in either intervention group over time. It may also be that these are topics that PWDs are already accustomed to working on with their healthcare teams [<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and that action plans on these topics have limited additional utility for such individuals. Likewise, we do not observe changes in smoking and alcohol overuse, suggesting that individuals with concerns in these areas may benefit from more specifically targeted or intensive care programs.</p>
              <p>Taken together, the pattern of findings has several implications for diabetes care in CHCs. First, programs such as CTH and EE-CTH are feasible to implement and appear to add benefit to existing diabetes primary care services. Second, the added utility of EE-CTH relative to CTH provides further support for utilizing brief, practical, evidence-based relationship building strategies. The additional improvements found in the EE-CTH group suggest that these relationship building strategies can be easily learned and provided by nonmental health professionals, making the program adaptable to different clinical workflows and roles.</p>
              <p>This pragmatic study has several strengths: a cluster-randomized comparative design; an evidence-based intervention; delivery within existing CHC workflows across a variety of roles; and inclusion of a large community sample. However, several limitations are important to keep in mind. First, the study included a comparative effectiveness design and did not allow for comparison to usual care. This was unavoidable because assessing for these areas without offering assistance in a clinical care context raises ethnical concerns. Second, because assessment was limited to only two time points, some change was likely not documented and like any intervention in a real-world context, other factors (e.g., clinic led initiatives) could have limited or enhanced change. The electronic program did not capture the language (English vs. Spanish) the survey or action plan was viewed, which precluded analyses examining language. Finally, the current report relies on self-reported data and will be strengthened by other data sources (e.g., clinical data from Electronic Health Record) in the future.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, both the CTH and EE-CTH programs demonstrated positive impacts for individuals with T2DM cared for in resource-limited clinical settings serving patients struggling disproportionately from social needs and health inequities. EE-CTH, focused on relationship building and was easily learned and adopted by health workers, and led to significantly greater reductions in psychological stress/distress and aspects of behavioral self-management relative to CTH. Greater attention to relationship building strategies within the context of self-management improvement programs and CHCs is warranted.</p>
