For participants in the genotype-guided arm with a CYP2D6 poor (PM), intermediate (IM), or ultra-rapid metabolizer (UM) phenotype, recommendations were to avoid hydrocodone, tramadol, codeine, and oxycodone. The primary endpoints were feasibility metrics and opioid use; pain intensity was a secondary endpoint. Effectiveness outcomes were collected 2-weeks post-surgery.</p>

In the genotype-guided arm, 20% had a high-risk (IM/PM/UM) phenotype, of whom 72% received an alternative opioid versus 0% of usual care participants (p&lt;0.001). In an exploratory analysis, there was less opioid consumption (200 [104-280] vs. 230 [133-350] morphine milligram equivalents; p=0.047) and similar pain intensity (2.6 ± 0.8 vs. 2.5 ± 0.7; p=0.638) in the genotype-guided vs. usual care arm, respectively.</p>

              <p id="P9">More Americans suffer from pain than are affected by heart disease, cancer, and lung disease combined.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Opioids are commonly used to treat pain and are among the most widely prescribed medications in the United States.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Given the role of opioids in acute, postoperative pain management, it is no surprise that approximately 35% of all opioid prescriptions originate from surgeons.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> However, interindividual variability in analgesic response to opioids has been observed, which may compromise post-operative pain control.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>–<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Considering factors underlying this variability in opioid response may allow surgeons to individualize treatments and optimize opioid prescribing.</p>

                <p id="P15">Prior to surgery, patients typically had two orthopaedic clinic visits. The first was an initial evaluation visit when the decision for surgery was made. The second was a pre-operative visit that occurred within one month of surgery, during which the post-operative pain management plan was developed, and a prescription for post-operative opioid therapy was provided. Clinical research coordinators approached patients about study participation at the initial evaluation visit after the decision for surgery was made. After providing written informed consent, a buccal sample and data on participant demographics and medical history were collected, and participants were randomized 2:1 to a CYP2D6-guided or usual post-operative pain management approach. Simple random allocation with block sizes of 6 or 12 was performed within each site. For participants in the CYP2D6-guided arm, buccal samples were batched each week and processed in the College of American Pathologists/Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments-licensed UF Health Pathology Laboratory, and <italic>CYP2D6</italic> genotype and metabolizer phenotype results were reported to the electronic health record (EHR). This process allowed genotype results to be available in time to inform the post-operative pain management plan. Participants randomized to the usual care pain management arm had their DNA sample stored in the pathology laboratory until they completed their study participation, at which time, the sample was processed, and <italic>CYP2D6</italic> genotype and metabolizer phenotype were reported in the EHR for future use.

At both post-operative follow-up time points, participants were also asked about their consumption of any opioid prescribed since discharge home from surgery. Pain intensity surveys were utilized to determine composite pain intensity, defined as the mean of current pain and worst and average pain over the past seven days.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Participants rated their pain intensity for each of the three questions on a 5-point Likert scale: “Had no pain” = 1, “Mild” = 2, “Moderate” = 3, “Severe” = 4, and “Very severe” = 5.

A series of questions was also posed regarding medication refills to capture opioid use beyond what was prescribed at the pre-operative appointment. If the participant had a follow-up clinic visit at the two-week time point, surveys and assessment of opioid consumption were completed in person with the study coordinator. Otherwise, based on participant preference, surveys and assessment of opioid consumption were completed by email, via a link provided in a text message, or by phone call with a pharmacist or pharmacy technician from the UF Center for Quality Medication Management.</p>

The primary outcomes were feasibility of implementing a genotype-guided opioid prescribing approach for participants undergoing an elective surgical procedure and opioid utilization. The following implementation metrics were assessed: percentage of patients who agreed to participate, percentage of participants in both arms with a clinical phenotype (based on <italic>CYP2D6</italic> and phenoconversion) warranting alternative therapy, percentage of participants in the genotype-guided arm for whom a clinical phenotype-guided recommendation was accepted by the clinician, and specific opioids prescribed by CYP2D6 phenotype.</p>

Data on pain intensity were collected to document that there were not obvious trends of the CYP2D6-guided approach leading to worse pain control, which in turn could lead to worse post-surgical outcomes. While composite pain intensity and opioid consumption were collected at both 1-week and 2-weeks post-surgery, the 2-week time-point was designated as the primary time-point for data on pain control.</p>

Main analyses were conducted in all participants in each study arm, with subset analyses conducted in IM/PMs and separately in NMs. Comparisons between the CYP2D6-guided and usual care groups for opioid consumption and composite pain intensity were also performed by analysis of covariance, adjusting for baseline differences between groups.

              <p id="P31">Data from the current investigation demonstrate the feasibility of implementing <italic>CYP2D6</italic> genotyping to guide post-operative pain management, with most participants agreeing to testing and high provider acceptance of genotype-guided recommendations in those with a high-risk phenotype. Further, our data suggest a genotype-guided approach may lead to lower opioid use without compromising pain control. Similarities in composite pain intensity and HOOS/KOOS-JR interval scores between study arms suggests participants consumed opioids as needed to minimize post-operative pain, but those in the genotype-guided arm needed less opioids for similar pain control.</p>
              <p id="P32">Results when stratified by surgery type imply that the impact of a genotype-guided approach on opioid consumption may be greatest in those undergoing more painful surgical procedures. Participants who underwent TKA had greater composite pain intensity scores and consumed more post-operative opioids than their THA counterparts, regardless of the post-operative pain management approach. The CYP2D6-guided approach was associated with decreased opioid consumption after TKA, but not THA, suggesting that overall results were driven by participants undergoing TKA.</p>
              <p id="P33">While not directly assessing the opioid epidemic, our results may have implications in this regard in that the majority of individuals who misuse opioids report the pursuit of pain relief as a primary motivator.<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> Similar pain intensity with less opioid consumption in the CYP2D6-guided arm indicates that this guided approach leads to better pain control,<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> and as such, may potentially avert future opioid misuse. Indeed, post-operative opioid use is proposed to be a gateway to chronic opioid use, with evidence of new persistent opioid use three to six months after a surgical procedure in approximately 6% of individuals who were opioid naïve prior to surgery.<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> Physicians in certain specialties, like orthopaedic surgery, prescribe opioids at a higher rate than those of other specialties and primary care physicians.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> Opioid sparing measures for post-operative analgesia have thus become a priority for surgeons to expedite patient recovery and combat the opioid epidemic,<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> and patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery may especially benefit from measures, such as <italic>CYP2D6</italic>-genotyping, to guide opioid prescribing. Patients have also expressed a desire for more individualized information regarding pain management after hip and knee arthroplasty.<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> Indeed, over 90% of patients approached about the current study agreed to participate. The elective surgical setting further lends itself well to a genotype-guided opioid approach. Even with a median genotype turnaround time of 8 days, 95% of genotypes resulted prior to the pre-operative visit, demonstrating that a major logistical barrier to pharmacogenetic implementation, that is genotype turnaround time, can be largely overcome in the elective surgery setting. While this study primarily focused on utilizing <italic>CYP2D6</italic> genotype to guide post-operative opioid prescribing, studies evaluating perioperative pharmacogenomic implementations are underway.<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup></p>
              <p id="P34">Multiple studies have evaluated post-operative opioid effectiveness according to CYP2D6 genotype. In line with our findings, a longitudinal cohort study of patients undergoing abdominal or thoracic surgeries showed similar post-operative pain scores after tramadol administration across CYP2D6 phenotypes; however, opioid consumption was not assessed.<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> Other studies evaluating tramadol effectiveness in relieving post-operative pain included both pain intensity and tramadol consumption as outcomes measures. Among patients undergoing elective nephrectomy or major abdominal surgery, increased pain intensity, despite higher opioid consumption, was observed in those with <italic>CYP2D6</italic> nonfunctional or reduced function genotypes versus NMs.<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> A study of patients undergoing knee arthroscopy showed that pain intensity, but not tramadol consumption, varied by CYP2D6 phenotype in the immediate post-operative period.<sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> The totality of these data, in addition to findings from the current study, support the importance of assessing both opioid consumption and pain intensity when evaluating post-surgical pain management approaches.</p>
              <p id="P35">The current study also highlights the importance and prevalence of phenoconversion (i.e., use of moderate and strong CYP2D6 inhibitors) in clinical phenotype determination among patients undergoing total joint arthroplasty. After considering phenoconversion in this cohort of participants, the prevalence of high-risk CYP2D6 phenotypes increased from 16% to 27%. More specifically, the prevalent use of strong CYP2D6 inhibitors resulted in the PM phenotype nearly tripling. These results suggest future pain-related pharmacogenomics research should screen for the concomitant use of moderate and strong CYP2D6 inhibitors.</p>
              <p id="P36">This study has limitations that deserve consideration. First, assessment of MME may be considered exploratory in that it was not the focus of our <italic>a priori</italic> power calculation. In addition, reliance on participant reported opioid consumption restricts MME analysis to those who successfully completed the two-week survey. Given this was a pragmatic study, participants could have received any number of analgesics at various doses. Therefore, reliance on participant responses was key to calculating MME at the follow-up time points, and incomplete participant-reported data reduces the available sample to assess post-op opioid consumption. Second, CYP2D6 phenotype distributions were unequal between genotype-guided and usual care arms, with the usual care group displaying higher IM and PM percentages than expected. This was possibly the result of adding the second study site over the course of the trial that had a less ancestrally diverse population, but not initially adjusting the randomization approach to account for a second site (e.g. randomizing separately by site). Nonetheless, adjusting for CYP2D6 phenotype did not affect the overall results. Third, only five providers were involved in the peri-operative care of these patients, and the high acceptance rate of genotype-guided recommendations observed in this study may not be generalizable across a larger provider group. However, surgeons have made opioid-sparing analgesic regimens a priority in clinical practice to reduce post-operative opioid use without compromising pain control. The overall study goals aligned with this clinical practice paradigm. Thus, surgeons were motivated to follow CYP2D6-guided recommendations, as evidenced by the high physician acceptance rate, which we expect may be true more generally. Fourth, differences in opioid consumption may be subject to a placebo-effect since study participants were not blinded. To mitigate a placebo-effect, <italic>CYP2D6</italic> results were not actively provided to study participants. However, we cannot rule out that surgeons discussed results with patients or that <italic>CYP2D6</italic> results were accessed through the patient portal. Finally, the practice of prescribing tramadol with another opioid, most commonly hydrocodone, suggests surgeons were not comfortable with prescribing tramadol as the sole post-operative opioid for NMs. Thus, further research to demonstrate whether use of tramadol alone in NMs results in sufficient pain control is warranted.</p>
              <p id="P37">Future efforts will examine the effects of having <italic>CYP2D6</italic> genotype on pain management and pain control. Findings from this study informed the design of a multi-center, NHGRI-funded, clinical trial (ADOPT-PGx: A Depression and Opioid Pragmatic Trial in Pharmacogenomics; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://gmkb.org/">https://gmkb.org/</ext-link>) evaluating the efficacy of a CYP2D6-guided approach on post-operative pain management as part of the IGNITE Pragmatic Trials Network.</p>
              <p id="P38">In summary, preemptive CYP2D6-guided opioid selection is feasible in an elective surgery setting, with high patient acceptance of genotyping and provider acceptance of genotype-guided recommendations in PMs/IMs/UMs. We also show that <italic>CYP2D6</italic> can be obtained in the pre-operative period after the decision for surgery is made so that results are available in time to guide post-operative opioid selection. Our results also suggest that a CYP2D6-guided approach may reduce post-operative opioid utilization without sacrificing pain control, with the greatest effect potentially in those undergoing more painful surgical procedures (e.g., TKA). Overall, utilizing a CYP2D6-guided approach to prescribe post-operative opioids is feasible and pain control may be achieved with less opioid use. In the current opioid climate, the need to develop safe and effective pain management strategies has never been more imperative, and precision medicine initiatives may prove invaluable.</p>
