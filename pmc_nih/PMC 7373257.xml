                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>The influence of genetic risk for obesity on food choice behaviors is unknown and may be in the causal pathway between genetic risk and weight gain. The aim of this study was to examine associations between genetic risk for obesity and food choice behaviors using objectively assessed workplace food purchases.</p>

                  <title>Methods and findings</title>
                  <p>This study is a secondary analysis of baseline data collected prior to the start of the “ChooseWell 365” health-promotion intervention randomized control trial. Participants were employees of a large hospital in Boston, MA, who enrolled in the study between September 2016 and February 2018. Cafeteria sales data, collected retrospectively for 3 months prior to enrollment, were used to track the quantity (number of items per 3 months) and timing (median time of day) of purchases, and participant surveys provided self-reported behaviors, including skipping meals and preparing meals at home. A previously validated Healthy Purchasing Score was calculated using the cafeteria traffic-light labeling system (i.e., green = healthy, yellow = less healthy, red = unhealthy) to estimate the healthfulness (quality) of employees’ purchases (range, 0%–100% healthy). DNA was extracted and genotyped from blood samples. A body mass index (BMI) genome-wide polygenic score (BMI<sub>GPS</sub>) was generated by summing BMI-increasing risk alleles across the genome. Additionally, 3 polygenic risk scores (PRSs) were generated with 97 BMI variants previously identified at the genome-wide significance level (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 5 × 10<sup>−8</sup>): (1) BMI<sub>97</sub> (97 loci), (2) BMI<sub>CNS</sub> (54 loci near genes related to central nervous system [CNS]), and (3) BMI<sub>non-CNS</sub> (43 loci not related to CNS). Multivariable linear and logistic regression tested associations of genetic risk score quartiles with workplace purchases, adjusted for age, sex, seasonality, and population structure. Associations were considered significant at <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05. In 397 participants, mean age was 44.9 years, and 80.9% were female. Higher genetic risk scores were associated with higher BMI. The highest quartile of BMI<sub>GPS</sub> was associated with lower Healthy Purchasing Score (−4.8 percentage points [95% CI −8.6 to −1.0]; <italic>P</italic> = 0.02), higher quantity of food purchases (14.4 more items [95% CI −0.1 to 29.0]; <italic>P</italic> = 0.03), later time of breakfast purchases (15.0 minutes later [95% CI 1.5–28.5]; <italic>P</italic> = 0.03), and lower likelihood of preparing dinner at home (Q4 odds ratio [OR] = 0.3 [95% CI 0.1–0.9]; <italic>P</italic> = 0.03) relative to the lowest BMI<sub>GPS</sub> quartile. Compared with the lowest quartile, the highest BMI<sub>CNS</sub> quartile was associated with fewer items purchased (<italic>P</italic> = 0.04), and the highest BMI<sub>non-CNS</sub> quartile was associated with purchasing breakfast at a later time (<italic>P</italic> = 0.01), skipping breakfast (<italic>P</italic> = 0.03), and not preparing breakfast (<italic>P</italic> = 0.04) or lunch (<italic>P</italic> = 0.01) at home. A limitation of this study is our data come from a relatively small sample of healthy working adults of European ancestry who volunteered to enroll in a health-promotion study, which may limit generalizability.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>In this study, genetic risk for obesity was associated with the quality, quantity, and timing of objectively measured workplace food purchases. These findings suggest that genetic risk for obesity may influence eating behaviors that contribute to weight and could be targeted in personalized workplace wellness programs in the future.</p>

              <p>Genetics play a role in the development of obesity and cardiometabolic disease [<xref rid="pmed.1003219.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], yet the influence of genetic risk for obesity on food choice behaviors is not well understood. The heritability of body mass index (BMI) is estimated to range from 47% to 90% [<xref rid="pmed.1003219.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. BMI-associated genetic variants, either independently (i.e., <italic>FTO</italic>, <italic>MC4R</italic>) or in aggregate (i.e., in the form of a polygenic risk score [PRS]), have also been linked with self-reported eating-related traits and behaviors, including increased appetite, reduced satiety, uncontrolled eating, and emotional eating [<xref rid="pmed.1003219.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>–<xref rid="pmed.1003219.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Self-reported behaviors, however, are prone to misreporting or social desirability biases [<xref rid="pmed.1003219.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Thus, it remains unclear whether genetic risk for obesity is associated with quality, quantity, or timing of food choices, each of which may mediate the relationship between the risk alleles and obesity.</p>
              <p>A genome-wide association study (GWAS) in over 300,000 adult participants identified 97 common independent genetic variants that are associated with BMI [<xref rid="pmed.1003219.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. More than half of these 97 variants are enriched for expression in regions of the central nervous system (CNS), including hypothalamus circuits that regulate appetite, whereas the remaining span other tissues with unlikely CNS functions [<xref rid="pmed.1003219.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003219.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Recently, it was demonstrated that a genome-wide polygenic score (GPS) comprising all 2.1 million common variants across the genome accounted for up to 20% of the variation in BMI [<xref rid="pmed.1003219.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and this may provide a more robust score to detect obesity-related associations with dietary behaviors.</p>
              <p>Previous large cohort studies have demonstrated that consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages accentuated genetic risk for obesity, whereas consumption of a healthier diet attenuated genetic risk for obesity [<xref rid="pmed.1003219.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003219.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. These studies concluded that genetic risk for obesity is modified by dietary environmental exposures. However, it remains unknown if genetic risk for obesity directly influences food choice behaviors and dietary intake. Obesity-implicated genetic variants may influence eating behaviors and obesity through a range of biological mechanisms that determine taste preferences, satiety, and cognitive and physiological responses to food and food cues [<xref rid="pmed.1003219.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>–<xref rid="pmed.1003219.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Therefore, genetic predisposition to food choice behaviors may be in the causal pathway between genetic risk and the development of obesity, and genetic variants with CNS and non-CNS functions may contribute differentially to food choice behaviors.</p>
              <p>Workplace cafeteria purchasing data provided an opportunity for objective, real-time assessment of employees’ food choices. Prior research demonstrated that the healthfulness of workplace food purchases was associated with employees’ overall dietary quality and health [<xref rid="pmed.1003219.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. We hypothesized that higher obesity genetic risk was associated with food purchasing patterns and self-reported dietary behaviors that contribute to weight gain and obesity.</p>
              <p>Therefore, the aim of the current study was examine associations between obesity genetic risk and food choice behaviors using objectively assessed workplace food purchases (quality, quantity, and timing) collected at baseline from a cohort of employees who enrolled in a workplace health-promotion trial [<xref rid="pmed.1003219.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. We also assessed whether higher CNS-related obesity genetic risk may be more likely to be associated with food behavioral choices than the non-CNS component.</p>

                <title>Setting and participants: “ChooseWell 365” cohort</title>
                <p>This study is a secondary analysis of baseline data collected from participants in the “ChooseWell 365” cohort, a workplace health-promotion study at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), prior to the start of the health-promotion intervention randomized control trial [<xref rid="pmed.1003219.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. MGH is a 999-bed teaching hospital in Boston, MA, with over 27,000 employees, who are 70% female and have a mean age of 41 years. A total of 602 MGH employees (female = 79.4%; mean [standard deviation]: age = 43.6 [12.2] years; baseline BMI = 28.3 [6.5] kg/m<sup>2</sup>) enrolled between September 2016 and February 2018 in the “ChooseWell 365” randomized controlled trial (Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT02660086) testing a workplace intervention to promote healthy food choices and prevent weight gain [<xref rid="pmed.1003219.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Employees were eligible for the trial if they were between 20 and 75 years of age and used their employee badge to purchase cafeteria items at least 4 times per week for at least 6 weeks during a 12-week period prior to recruitment. Additional recruitment criteria have been previously described [<xref rid="pmed.1003219.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Analyses were prospectively planned to test the associations between BMI genetic scores and food choices as outlined in the analysis plan (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1003219.s002">S1 Text</xref></bold>). Participants provided written informed consent upon enrollment, and the study protocol was approved by Partners HealthCare Institutional Review Board (#2015P000135).</p>
                <p>The data for the current study are restricted to participants who consented to providing genetic data and who were of European ancestry (restricted to avoid population stratification issues and to be consistent with the GWAS that were discovered in populations of European ancestry). Analyses were conducted using survey and health data collected at a baseline visit prior to the initiation of the parent trial intervention, and cafeteria data were collected retrospectively from the 3 months prior to enrollment. We used 3 months to represent typical and habitual purchases and avoid irregularities due to short-term vacations or work schedule changes. Of the 602 participants, 499 consented to have genotyping, and 397 were of European ancestry and included in the current analysis (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1003219.s008">S1 Fig</xref></bold>).</p>

                <title>Workplace purchases, anthropometry, and dietary variables</title>
                <p>During the study period, the hospital campus had 6 on-site food service locations, including 3 full-service cafeterias and 3 smaller cafes (hereafter, all referred to as “cafeterias”). The cafeterias were typically open 5 or 7 days per week and offered breakfast and lunch options in the mornings through afternoons and limited snacks/side and dinner options in the evenings and overnight. More than 1,200 different food items are available over the course of a day, including meals and entrees (e.g., hot prepared meals, prepared sandwiches and salads, and pizza), a large salad bar, snacks, and desserts, as well as hot and cold beverages. All employees in the study paid for cafeteria items by payroll deduction using their employee identification badge, and purchases were tracked using cafeteria sales data [<xref rid="pmed.1003219.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p>
                <p>All hospital cafeterias labeled food and beverages with traffic-light labels, as has been described in detail elsewhere [<xref rid="pmed.1003219.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003219.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and this labeling system had been utilized at the hospital since 2010. Briefly, the traffic-light labeling system was designed by hospital nutrition staff and based on the USDA Dietary Guidelines [<xref rid="pmed.1003219.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003219.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Every item was labeled as red, yellow, or green based on an algorithm that factored in calories, saturated fat content, and nutrient density. A green rating connoted the highest level of healthfulness and a red rating indicated the lowest level (e.g., least healthy). Options were distributed roughly evenly between those labeled green (34%), yellow (37%), or red (29%). The average costs of red, yellow, and green items were comparable for beverages, entrees, and snacks/side items, and items across a range of prices were available in each color category [<xref rid="pmed.1003219.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p>
                <p>Participants’ baseline purchases were extracted from the hospital’s cafeteria sales data for the 3 months prior to their enrollment in the randomized trial. Purchasing data included item type, time and date of purchase, and the traffic-light label color (i.e., red, yellow, green). The quality of workplace food purchases was measured with a Healthy Purchasing Score that reflected the overall healthfulness of an employee’s 3-month baseline purchases [<xref rid="pmed.1003219.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The Healthy Purchasing Score was created by weighting purchases of red items to be 0, yellow items to be 0.5, and green items to be 1. This score has been previously validated as a proxy for overall dietary healthfulness using 24-hour dietary recalls [<xref rid="pmed.1003219.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. For interpretation purposes in this study, the Healthy Purchasing Score was converted to percentage by multiplying the score by 100 (range, 0%–100% healthy). The quantity of workplace food purchases was measured by the total number of items purchased over 3 months, as well as the number of food and beverage items, separately. Time of day of workplace food purchases was measured by using the time stamp for the purchase data during the 3-month baseline period. The median timing of breakfast purchases (first food purchased between 6 AM and 10 AM) and median time of lunch purchase (first food purchased between 11 AM and 2 PM) were estimated for each participant.</p>
                <p>Participants’ weight and height were measured by clinical research nursing staff at the baseline visit, and BMI was calculated as weight/height<sup>2</sup> (kg/m<sup>2</sup>). Participants also completed an online survey that provided self-reported age, sex, meal-skipping habits (“Over the PAST WEEK, on how many days did you SKIP BREAKFAST/ LUNCH/ DINNER for any reason?”; Never, 1–2 days, 3–4 days, 5–6 days, and Every day), and home-prepared meal habits (“Over the PAST WEEK, on how many days did you eat a BREAKFAST/ LUNCH/ DINNER that was prepared at home [including meals that you bring to work]?”; Never, 1–2 days, 3–4 days, 5–6 days, and Every day).</p>

                <p>A total of 3 PRSs were generated for each participant from 97 previously identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at the genome-wide significance levels (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 5 × 10<sup>−8</sup>). The BMI<sub>97</sub> PRS comprised all 97 previously identified BMI variants [<xref rid="pmed.1003219.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Based on the biological functions of genes in or near the 97 previously identified BMI loci, such as neuronal development process, neurotransmission, hypothalamic expression and regulatory function, and neuronal expression, 54 variants have been previously classified as CNS-related, and 43 variants have been previously classified as non-CNS-related [<xref rid="pmed.1003219.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Accordingly, the BMI<sub>CNS</sub> PRS and the BMI<sub>non-CNS</sub> PRS comprised the 54 and 43 non-overlapping BMI variants, respectively [<xref rid="pmed.1003219.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. All SNPs had a minor allele frequency &gt;1% and an imputation quality (minimac <italic>r</italic><sub>sq</sub>) ≥0.50.

Scaling of the individual PRSs was performed to allow interpretation of the effects as a per-1 risk allele increase in the PRS for each trait (division by twice the sum of the β-coefficients and multiplication by twice the square of the SNP count representing the maximum number of risk alleles).</p>

                <p>Non-normally distributed outcome variables (BMI and purchase data) were inverse normalized prior to analysis. Breakfast-, lunch-, and dinner-skipping variables from surveys were dichotomized to daily eaters (never skip) and skippers (skip 1 or more meal per week). Breakfast, lunch, and dinner “prepared at home” variables were dichotomized to fewer than 3 days of home meals per week or 3 or more days of home meals per week. Genetic score quartiles (e.g., Q1 = lowest genetic risk, Q4 = highest genetic risk) were generated based on the population distribution, with the highest quartile representing the more adverse phenotype (higher BMI). As enrollment was year-round, sine and cosine functions of the date of enrollment were used to adjust for seasonality in the participants’ 3-month purchasing periods [<xref rid="pmed.1003219.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The GPS was standardized to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. Multivariable linear regression was used to test the association of each continuous, scaled PRS or GPS quartiles with BMI adjusted for age, sex, and 5 principal components of ancestry (identified by TRACE). In addition, multivariable linear or logistic regression was used to test genetic score associations with workplace purchases and survey-derived meal habits adjusted for age, sex, seasonality, and 5 principal components of ancestry. Differences across quartiles were evaluated for significance using a test for trend. We tested for statistical interaction between CNS-related and non-CNS-related results from stratified analyses (<italic>P</italic><sub>int</sub>). Associations with purchases and meal habits were also repeated using continuous measures of the genetic scores. We present unadjusted (<italic>P</italic>) and false discovery rate–corrected <italic>P</italic> values (<italic>P</italic><sub>adj</sub>) to account for multiple testing. In sensitivity analyses, we further adjusted for job type (administrative/service, craft/technicians, management/professionals, MDs/PhDs), education level (high school/some college, college degree, graduate degree), current smoking status, and physical activity level (measured with the International Physical Activity Questionnaire [<xref rid="pmed.1003219.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] at the baseline visit).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>In this study, we used objective, real-time food purchasing data to investigate the association of food choice behaviors with genetic risk for obesity. Using genetic risk scores derived with variants from a previous BMI GWAS meta-analysis, we found evidence that employees’ genetic risk was associated with the quality, quantity, and timing of the food they purchased at work. Higher genetic risk was associated with several workplace food choice behaviors that may contribute to weight gain and obesity, including purchasing less healthy food; purchasing larger quantities of food; purchasing meals at later times; skipping breakfast; and being less likely to prepare meals at home. Prior research has demonstrated that lifestyle modification may attenuate genetic susceptibility to obesity and cardiometabolic risk [<xref rid="pmed.1003219.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003219.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003219.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], and therefore our preliminary findings may have important implications for tailoring health-promotion and workplace wellness programs in the future.</p>
              <p>Overall, BMI<sub>GPS</sub> had the strongest associations with BMI and food choice behaviors. Higher BMI<sub>GPS</sub> was associated with a lower Healthy Purchasing Score, a measure of the dietary quality of workplace food that has been correlated with overall dietary quality, as measured by 24-hour dietary recalls [<xref rid="pmed.1003219.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The reasons for associations between higher genetic risk and purchasing more unhealthy foods at work are likely multifactorial and may include individual preferences for less healthy foods (e.g., foods high in saturated fat or sugar) [<xref rid="pmed.1003219.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], impulsive behavior [<xref rid="pmed.1003219.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], and vulnerability to unhealthy cues in the food environment [<xref rid="pmed.1003219.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. These associations are consistent with prior studies demonstrating that higher numbers of <italic>FTO</italic> obesity-related risk alleles were associated with more eating episodes per day, higher calories consumed at lunch, and stronger responses to food cues [<xref rid="pmed.1003219.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003219.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003219.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Other loci have established roles in anorexigenic and orexigenic signaling pathways (<italic>BDNF</italic>) [<xref rid="pmed.1003219.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], nutrient preference such as carbohydrate (<italic>RARB</italic>) [<xref rid="pmed.1003219.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and fat (<italic>ADH1B</italic>) [<xref rid="pmed.1003219.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], and energy homeostasis (<italic>MTCH2</italic>) [<xref rid="pmed.1003219.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Our findings, however, do not implicate specific genes or mechanisms, and the precise biological role of most BMI loci remain to be elucidated [<xref rid="pmed.1003219.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p>
              <p>Higher BMI<sub>GPS</sub> was also associated with purchasing more food items at work and being less likely to prepare dinner at home, a behavior previously associated with obesity in adults [<xref rid="pmed.1003219.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Lastly, the association between higher genetic risk and later breakfast purchases corroborates earlier nongenetic epidemiological findings between higher BMI and later food intake [<xref rid="pmed.1003219.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003219.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The greater number of significant associations observed for the BMI<sub>GPS</sub> relative to the BMI<sub>97</sub> may be due to the fact that the BMI<sub>GPS</sub> explained 6 times more BMI variance than the BMI<sub>97</sub>, resulting in a more robust genetic risk score and possibly capturing more of the underlying biology for BMI. Several findings for the BMI<sub>97</sub> were consistent in direction with the BMI<sub>GPS</sub> and may require a larger sample size before significant associations are detected. Collectively, these findings suggest that genetic risk for obesity may play a role in vulnerability to food behaviors that contribute to weight gain.</p>
              <p>To further explore the association of genetic risk for obesity and food choice, we examined differences by the 97 genetic variants for BMI that are enriched for expression in regions of the CNS compared with the remaining variants that are expressed in other tissues with non-CNS functions. Prior research provided evidence indicating possible differential effects of these subsets, with BMI<sub>CNS</sub> having a stronger interaction with dietary quality on BMI than BMI<sub>non-CNS</sub> [<xref rid="pmed.1003219.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In our study, we observed subset differences in the quantity of food purchased at work, with higher BMI<sub>CNS</sub> associated with purchasing fewer food items at work and higher BMI<sub>non-CNS</sub> trending toward purchasing more food items at work. Higher BMI<sub>non-CNS</sub> was associated with purchasing breakfast at a later time, skipping breakfast, and not preparing breakfast or lunch at home, but BMI<sub>CNS</sub> was not associated with any of these factors. Contrary to our initial hypothesis, our results suggest that BMI<sub>non-CNS</sub> had a stronger association with employees’ food choice behaviors that could lead to weight gain than BMI<sub>CNS</sub>. Given that the workplace food environment in this study utilized cues to promote healthier eating (i.e., traffic-light labels), it is possible that these cues may have attenuated the unhealthy food choice behaviors of employees with higher BMI<sub>CNS</sub> but did not interact with behaviors of employees with higher BMI<sub>non-CNS</sub>. Although these preliminary findings will need to be confirmed in larger samples, our results may have implications for tailoring interventions for subgroups of individuals, and insights could be leveraged to unravel and classify subtypes of BMI genetic risk, as has been conducted for other diseases such as diabetes [<xref rid="pmed.1003219.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p>
              <p>A major strength of this study is the objective and comprehensive assessment of workplace food purchases derived from 3 months of cafeteria sales data. These measures were not prone to misreporting or social desirability biases, in contrast to many prior studies in the field. Our approach also enabled a multidimensional capture of food choice behavior, including timing. Furthermore, the relevant self-reported dietary behavior provided results that were complementary to the cafeteria purchasing findings.</p>
              <p>There are also important limitations. Although the cafeteria systems provided objective data, food purchases may not have reflected actual food consumption that may have been influenced by work shift schedules and cafeteria hours. The BMI<sub>CNS</sub> and BMI<sub>non-CNS</sub> designations were limited to the 97 previously characterized BMI genetic variants, but additional variants may be missing from these genetic scores. We primarily present <italic>P</italic> values unadjusted for multiple testing because of our modest sample size and because the BMI genetic risk scores and the outcomes tested were not independent. Therefore, we acknowledge that individual “significant” findings should be interpreted with caution, since accounting for multiple comparisons led to nonsignificant <italic>P</italic> values, and that larger samples are necessary to verify our findings. Although the types of data we collected suggest we could infer potential causal links using mendelian randomization analyses, our sample size is too small for such an approach. Selection bias was possible as a result of inclusion and exclusion criteria for the randomized trial in addition to the criteria for this analysis, such as non-European ancestry (restricted to avoid population stratification issues). Also, despite our covariate adjustment, we recognize that a general weakness of observational studies is a risk of bias due to residual confounding. Finally, our sample consisted of a relatively small number of healthy working adults at a large urban hospital who had volunteered to enroll in a health-promotion study, which may limit generalizability of our findings to other working populations and rural or non-employed people.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, this study identified associations between obesity genetic risk scores and food choice behaviors, suggesting that the genetic risk for obesity may play a role in vulnerability to food behaviors that are relevant for the development of obesity. Our findings demonstrated that higher genetic risk for BMI was associated with workplace food choice behaviors that may contribute to weight gain. Prior research has shown that healthy lifestyle behaviors, including dietary intake, can attenuate weight gain and cardiovascular disease in those at high genetic risk [<xref rid="pmed.1003219.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003219.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003219.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Therefore, understanding genetic predisposition to certain food choice behaviors that contribute to cardiometabolic disease could inform interventions that are tailored to changing individuals’ dietary habits.</p>

              </p>
              <p>Dear Dr. Dashti,</p>
              <p>Thank you very much for submitting your manuscript "Association of genetic risk for obesity with the quality, quantity, and timing of workplace food purchases" (PMEDICINE-D-20-00219R1) for consideration at PLOS Medicine. </p>
              <p>Your paper was evaluated by a senior editor and discussed among all the editors here. It was also discussed with an academic editor with relevant expertise, and sent to independent reviewers, including a statistical reviewer. The reviews are appended at the bottom of this email and any accompanying reviewer attachments can be seen via the link below:</p>
              <p>[LINK]</p>
              <p>In light of these reviews, I am afraid that we will not be able to accept the manuscript for publication in the journal in its current form, but we would like to consider a revised version that addresses the reviewers' and editors' comments. Obviously we cannot make any decision about publication until we have seen the revised manuscript and your response, and we plan to seek re-review by one or more of the reviewers. </p>
              <p>In revising the manuscript for further consideration, your revisions should address the specific points made by each reviewer and the editors. Please also check the guidelines for revised papers at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/revising-your-manuscript">http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/revising-your-manuscript</ext-link> for any that apply to your paper. In your rebuttal letter you should indicate your response to the reviewers' and editors' comments, the changes you have made in the manuscript, and include either an excerpt of the revised text or the location (eg: page and line number) where each change can be found. Please submit a clean version of the paper as the main article file; a version with changes marked should be uploaded as a marked up manuscript.</p>
              <p>In addition, we request that you upload any figures associated with your paper as individual TIF or EPS files with 300dpi resolution at resubmission; please read our figure guidelines for more information on our requirements: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/figures">http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/figures</ext-link>. While revising your submission, please upload your figure files to the PACE digital diagnostic tool, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pacev2.apexcovantage.com/">https://pacev2.apexcovantage.com/</ext-link>. PACE helps ensure that figures meet PLOS requirements. To use PACE, you must first register as a user. Then, login and navigate to the UPLOAD tab, where you will find detailed instructions on how to use the tool. If you encounter any issues or have any questions when using PACE, please email us at <email>PLOSMedicine@plos.org</email>.</p>
              <p>We expect to receive your revised manuscript by May 29 2020 11:59PM. Please email us (<email>plosmedicine@plos.org</email>) if you have any questions or concerns.</p>
              <p>***Please note while forming your response, if your article is accepted, you may have the opportunity to make the peer review history publicly available. The record will include editor decision letters (with reviews) and your responses to reviewer comments. If eligible, we will contact you to opt in or out.***</p>
              <p>We ask every co-author listed on the manuscript to fill in a contributing author statement, making sure to declare all competing interests. If any of the co-authors have not filled in the statement, we will remind them to do so when the paper is revised. If all statements are not completed in a timely fashion this could hold up the re-review process. If new competing interests are declared later in the revision process, this may also hold up the submission. Should there be a problem getting one of your co-authors to fill in a statement we will be in contact. YOU MUST NOT ADD OR REMOVE AUTHORS UNLESS YOU HAVE ALERTED THE EDITOR HANDLING THE MANUSCRIPT TO THE CHANGE AND THEY SPECIFICALLY HAVE AGREED TO IT. You can see our competing interests policy here: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/competing-interests">http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/competing-interests</ext-link>.</p>

              <p>Your article can be found in the "Submissions Needing Revision" folder. </p>
              <p>To enhance the reproducibility of your results, we recommend that you deposit your laboratory protocols in protocols.io, where a protocol can be assigned its own identifier (DOI) such that it can be cited independently in the future.

              <p>Please ensure that the paper adheres to the PLOS Data Availability Policy (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/data-availability">http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/data-availability</ext-link>), which requires that all data underlying the study's findings be provided in a repository or as Supporting Information. For data residing with a third party, authors are required to provide instructions with contact information for obtaining the data. PLOS journals do not allow statements supported by "data not shown" or "unpublished results." For such statements, authors must provide supporting data or cite public sources that include it. </p>
              <p>We look forward to receiving your revised manuscript. </p>
              <p>Sincerely,</p>

              <p>Senior Editor </p>
              <p>PLOS Medicine</p>

              <p>-----------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>Requests from the editors:</p>
              <p>Please revise your title according to PLOS Medicine's style. Your title must be nondeclarative and not a question. It should begin with main concept if possible. "Effect of" should be used only if causality can be inferred, i.e., for an RCT. Please place the study design ("A randomized controlled trial," "A retrospective study," "A modelling study," etc.) in the subtitle (ie, after a colon).</p>
              <p>Abstract</p>
              <p>Aim and study design should be clearly stated in the background and methods section respectively</p>
              <p>Please provide brief participant demographics and when the study took place</p>
              <p>Please provide participant numbers</p>
              <p>Please provide precise p-values, except when p&lt;0.001</p>
              <p>The last sentence of the methods and findings section must highlight a limitation of your study design or methodology</p>
              <p>Abstract Conclusions:</p>
              <p>* Please address the study implications without overreaching what can be concluded from the data; the phrase "In this study, we observed ..." may be useful.</p>
              <p>* Please interpret the study based on the results presented in the abstract, emphasizing what is new without overstating your conclusions.</p>
              <p>* Please avoid vague statements such as "these results have major implications for policy/clinical care". Mention only specific implications substantiated by the results.</p>
              <p>* Please avoid assertions of primacy ("We report for the first time....")</p>
              <p>Author summary</p>

              <p>Comments from the reviewers:</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: The authors present a very interesting study that correlates genetic risk scores for BMI with food choices.</p>
              <p>The genetic risk scores are generated in four different ways based on an existing GWAS, one genetic risk score is based on genome-wide data (GRS), while the other three scores are based on 97 genome-wide significant SNPs, which is further subdivided into 54 SNP related to the central nervous system and 43 SNPs which are not.</p>
              <p>The design of the study is innovative and could provide important insights into how genetics influence human behaviour. The manuscript is well written and clear. Yet, I would appreciate if the authors could address my comments on the statistical analysis.</p>
              <p>Major comments:</p>
              <p>--------------------</p>
              <p>1. Different results depending on the risk score used: How do the authors explain the stark difference in results between the GRS and 97 SNP risk scores as shown in Figure 2? While there are suggestive findings for GRS, the results for the 97 SNP risk score are Null.</p>
              <p>2. Overfitting of the genome-wide PRS: How robust are the results with respect to different p-value cut-offs of the genome-wide PRS? A p-value threshold of 0.19 seems rather lenient and arbitrary. Did the authors perform any more sensitivity analysis on this p-value threshold? May the tuning of the threshold parameter in the actual dataset induce overfitting?</p>
              <p>3. Multiple testing: Why did the study not adjust for multiple testing? In my opinion this study would require to adjust at least for the number of outcomes examined.</p>
              <p>4. Power calculation: Did the authors perform a power calculation prior to the study? Is the study well-powered to detect differences in food choice based on genetic risk?</p>
              <p>5. How representative is the sample? Supplementary Table 1 states that 80% of the participants are women, 70% have high physical activity and the average BMI is 27.9. What were the selection criteria for enrolling participants in the Choosewell study? Please discuss if there is potential selection bias in the study due to the participants not being selected at random but volunteering.</p>
              <p>6. Quartiles: Why did the authors decide to summarise the polygenic scores into quartiles and present results as the comparison between highest and lowest quartile? How do the results look like when including the exact scores as quantitative predictors into the model?</p>
              <p>Minor comments:</p>
              <p>--------------------</p>
              <p>- Supplementary Figure 1. Please put "" around "ChooseWell 365", otherwise this may read as 365 study participants.</p>
              <p>- Supplementary Table 2. Explain "highly expressed in the CNS" in the legend.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: The authors present a secondary analysis(?) of an impressive trial, where participants health behaviour manipulated. The dataset is rich as objective food purchases have been measured, along with genetics. I would be very intrigued to read analysis of the phenotypic BMI in relation to the objective eating study variables. The PGS just seems to serve as a fancy method, but I think using PGS is an overkill - it makes associations very small and ultimately does not deliver any extra interpretative value. </p>
              <p>The study seems as a secondary analysis, as although the study is a trial, the manipulation is not being analysed. It would be helpful to have a reference to the paper analysing primary outcomes of the study, if available. The clinical trial outlines a moderating role of the PGS. This does not seem to be tested here. Please outline clearly, whether you followed the clinical trials protocol in this analysis or conducted exploratory additional analyses. Both approaches are ok, this just needs to be clear.</p>
              <p>The study's goals fall short likely due to smallish sample size for these goals. This is expemplified by the use of quartiles throughout the paper, which highlight associations that likely do not emerge when using PGS-s as linear predictors. This approach has been previously critiqued in relation to polygenic scores. See this blog for accessible overview and further materials. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://discourse.datamethods.org/t/discussion-of-polygenic-prediction-of-weight-and-obesity-trajectories-from-birth-to-adulthood/1585">https://discourse.datamethods.org/t/discussion-of-polygenic-prediction-of-weight-and-obesity-trajectories-from-birth-to-adulthood/1585</ext-link> . If the authors wish to use quartiles, they should justify their choice in relation to this critique.</p>
              <p>I invite authors to think through, what is the message and scientific question they want to deliver. If the goal is to understand how obesity influences food choices and reactiveness to the trial, then I would just use phenotypic obesity. This allows using a bigger sample, and also having bigger statistical effects. I would be very interested in learning the phenotypic results! </p>
              <p>Generally speaking, BMI_PGS-phenotype associations reproduce known BMI_phenotype-phenotype associations. So you could just study phenotypic associations and conclude that this is likely how genetic BMI plays out. Perhaps you could try reproducing the strongest phenotypic BMI- eating associations with a BMIpgs? </p>
              <p>If you want to make claims between BMIcns- and BMInon-cns, you need to test the statisical difference in effect sizes. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://comparingcorrelations.org/">http://comparingcorrelations.org/</ext-link></p>
              <p>Polygenic scores can also be used in certain conditions to infer causality. But I think that you need a larger sample size to do this kind of research. </p>

              <p>Reviewer #3: This study addresses a more relevant aspect in the knowledge of determining factors of obesity that has also been scarcely described as is the choice of food.The work is well written and the results presented, below with some comments:</p>
              <p>1.The authors mention the fact that is in workplace, it could be also interesting if they could discuss about what kind of food is available in those cafeteria and if that could be a bias</p>
              <p>2.The authors mention that the collection was made three months retrospectively, is that because it was part of another study or why it is measured retrospectively?. In that sense the authors calculated the average?</p>
              <p>3.It would be interesting if the authors could characterize the types of food available in the cafeteria, in addition to saying the traffic lights.</p>
              <p>4.Although in complementary material they indicate the genes evaluated, it is interesting that in the discussion they could deepen into this and how some genes could effectively modulate aspects of food choice, put it in more concrete terms on the mechanism</p>

              <p>------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>Requests from Editors:</p>
              <p>Suggest title is tempered as you are not directly measuring genetic risk? In addition, the study descriptor might be better as ‘a secondary analysis from the ChooseWell 365 randomised trial’. </p>
              <p>Please provide a table with demographic information of participants</p>
              <p>Please consider revising “influencing” to perhaps “associated with” as this is an observational study “We also assessed whether higher CNS-related obesity genetic risk that may be more likely to influence food behavioural choices than the non-CNS component”. The same goes for where you mention “causal in pathway”. I don’t think the study design or results allow this extrapolation, so please use more cautious language throughout. </p>
              <p>It appears that your STROBE checklist was not included in the revised manuscript and it was not called out in the methods section. Please do so, as requested previously. We ask that you don’t use line or page numbers as these are likely to change during publication</p>
              <p>In the methods, in addition to simply mentioning that you had a prospective analysis plan, please provide this analysis plan as an SI file and also provide a call out to the file in the methods section. As stated previously “If a prospective analysis plan (from your funding proposal, IRB or other ethics</p>
              <p>committee submission, study protocol, or other planning document written</p>
              <p>before analyzing the data) was used in designing the study, please include the</p>
              <p>relevant prospectively written document with your revised manuscript as a</p>
              <p>Supporting Information file to be published alongside your study, and cite it in</p>
              <p>the Methods section. A legend for this file should be included at the end of your manuscript”. </p>
              <p>Please add unaccounted confounding as a limitation in your discussion, as there are several confounders linked to food choice and not all can be measured in an observational setting.</p>

              </p>
              <p>Dear Dr. Dashti, </p>
              <p>On behalf of my colleagues and the academic editor, Dr. Sanjay Basu, I am delighted to inform you that your manuscript entitled "Polygenic risk score for obesity and the quality, quantity, and timing of workplace food purchases: a secondary analysis from the ChooseWell 365 randomised trial" (PMEDICINE-D-20-00219R3) has been accepted for publication in PLOS Medicine. </p>
              <p>PRODUCTION PROCESS</p>
              <p>Before publication you will see the copyedited word document (in around 1-2 weeks from now) and a PDF galley proof shortly after that. The copyeditor will be in touch shortly before sending you the copyedited Word document. We will make some revisions at the copyediting stage to conform to our general style, and for clarification. When you receive this version you should check and revise it very carefully, including figures, tables, references, and supporting information, because corrections at the next stage (proofs) will be strictly limited to (1) errors in author names or affiliations, (2) errors of scientific fact that would cause misunderstandings to readers, and (3) printer's (introduced) errors.</p>
              <p>If you are likely to be away when either this document or the proof is sent, please ensure we have contact information of a second person, as we will need you to respond quickly at each point.</p>
              <p>PRESS</p>
              <p>A selection of our articles each week are press released by the journal. You will be contacted nearer the time if we are press releasing your article in order to approve the content and check the contact information for journalists is correct. If your institution or institutions have a press office, please notify them about your upcoming paper at this point, to enable them to help maximize its impact. </p>
              <p>PROFILE INFORMATION</p>
              <p>Now that your manuscript has been accepted, please log into EM and update your profile.
