                  <title>Objective</title>
                  <p>Interleukin-8 (IL-8, CXCL8) plays important roles in immune responses at mucosal sites including in the lower genital tract. Since several types of bacteria produce proteases that cleave IL-8 and many types of bacteria can be present in lower genital tract microbiota, we assessed genital fluids for IL-8 cleavage/alteration.</p>

                  <title>Study Design</title>
                  <p>Genital fluids collected by lavage from 200 women (23 HIV-seronegative and 177 HIV-seropositive) were tested for IL-8 cleavage/alteration by ELISA.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>IL-8 cleaving/altering activity was observed in fluids from both HIV-positive (28%) and HIV-negative women (35%). There was no clear relationship between the activity and the types of bacteria present in the lower genital tract as determined by high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. Protease inhibitors specific for matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) reduced the activity and a multiplex assay that detects both inactive and active MMPs showed the presence of multiple MMPs, including MMP-1, -3, -7, -8, -9, -10 and -12 in genital secretions from many of the women. The IL-8-cleaving/altering activity significantly correlated with active MMP-9 as well as with cleavage of a substrate that is acted on by several active MMPs.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>These studies show that multiple MMPs are present in the genital tract of women and strongly suggest that MMP-9 in genital secretions can cleave IL-8 at this mucosal site. These studies suggest that MMP-mediated cleavage of IL-8 can modulate inflammatory responses in the lower genital tract.</p>

              <p>The chemokine Interleukin-8 (IL-8, CXCL8) is a member of the CXC chemokine family that plays a number of important roles in immunity including activation and attraction of neutrophils [<xref rid="pone.0116911.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0116911.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In vitro, IL-8 is produced by neutrophils, macrophages, monocytes and epithelial cells when exposed to either microbial products derived from commensal bacteria or organisms that cause sexually transmitted infections (STI) [<xref rid="pone.0116911.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0116911.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. IL-8 levels in lower genital tract secretions are increased in women with STIs [<xref rid="pone.0116911.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0116911.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and also increased in response to non-STI alterations in lower genital tract microbiota [<xref rid="pone.0116911.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0116911.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. IL-8 elevations in genital secretions and in cultures of epithelial cells have been used as a biomarker of inflammation in clinical trials of microbicides [<xref rid="pone.0116911.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0116911.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p>
              <p>There are several proteases that have been reported to act on IL-8. A protease made by some strains of <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> has been shown to cleave the C-terminal alpha helix of IL-8 resulting in IL-8 inactivation [<xref rid="pone.0116911.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In infected patients, disease severity correlated with the IL-8 protease activity expressed by the <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> isolates [<xref rid="pone.0116911.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. <italic>Porphyromonas gingivalis</italic>, an oral bacterium implicated in periodontitis, also produces a protease that can cleave at the amino terminal end of IL-8 [<xref rid="pone.0116911.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0116911.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The host-derived protease matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) has also been reported to cleave IL-8 [<xref rid="pone.0116911.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. MMP-9 removes six amino acids from the N-terminal portion of IL-8, but instead of inactivation, this cleavage results in dramatically enhanced IL-8 signaling through CXCR1.</p>
              <p>The bacterial microbiota in the female lower genital tract of different women can be comprised of many different genera of bacteria including <italic>Lactobacillus, Prevotella, Megasphaera, Gardnerella, Mobliluncus, Atopobium, Parvimonas, and Sneathia</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0116911.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0116911.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Strains of <italic>Streptococcus</italic> and <italic>Porphyromonas</italic> are also present in the genital tract of some women. We hypothesized that some of these genital bacteria could express proteases that cleave IL-8. To explore this hypothesis, we used ELISA to assess a reduction of IL-8 detection after incubation with genital tract fluids collected from 200 different women. Since a reduction of reactivity in the ELISA does not necessarily show cleavage of IL-8, we used the terms “cleavage/alteration” and “cleaving/altering” throughout the paper to indicate reduction in ELISA activity.</p>

                <title>Subjects</title>
                <p>Genital samples were obtained from women in the Rwanda Women’s Inter-association Study and Assessment (RWISA). RWISA is an observational prospective cohort study investigating the effectiveness and toxicity of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and comorbidities in HIV-infected Rwandan women.</p>
                <p>Written informed consent was obtained in accordance with protocols approved by the Rwanda National Ethics Committee and the Institutional Review Board of Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx NY. Genital samples were collected by cervicovaginal lavage (CVL) performed by irrigation of the cervix with 10 ml of nonbacteriostatic sterile saline, followed by aspiration from the posterior fornix. CVL were transported from the study site to the lab within two hours of collection, aliquoted and frozen.</p>

CVL were clarified by centrifugation and diluted 1:4 with RPMI-1640 medium buffered with HEPES (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, added as a source of cations) and 0.1 ml of diluted fluid was added to 0.1 ml (2 ng/ml) of carrier-free recombinant human IL-8 (rhCXCL-8/IL-8, R&amp;D Minneapolis, MN, USA). The mixtures were incubated for 20 h at 4°C or 37°C. Afterward, ELISA was used to determine the concentration of IL-8 (BD Bioscience, San Diego, CA USA). The cutoff for determining if samples were positive for IL-8 cleavage/alteration was set by calculating the standard deviation of negative controls in multiple runs and multiplying by 3. In some experiments, protease inhibitors were added to the incubations; either General Protease Inhibitor (1:25 final concentration) (Sigma), EDTA (2 mmol final concentration), Marimastat (13 nM final concentration, Tocris, Bristol, UK) or CP471474 (16 nM final concentration, Tocris). A culture supernatant from Group A <italic>Streptococcus</italic> was used as a positive control in all experiments (a kind gift from Paul Sumby, Center for Molecular and Translational Human Infectious Diseases Research, Huston, Texas 77030).</p>

                <p>An assay similar to one previously reported [<xref rid="pone.0116911.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] was used to determine if proteases that could cleave IL-8 were present in the lower genital tract fluid collected from women. Recombinant human IL-8 was incubated for 20 h at either 4°C or 37°C with either saline (negative control), a supernatant from cultures of group A Streptococcus (positive control) or genital mucosal fluid collected by lavage from women. The positive control resulted in 95–100% reduction in ELISA detection (not shown) while incubation with the negative control had no effect on IL-8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0116911.g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). Samples from 200 women were tested; 23 from HIV-seronegative women and 177 from HIV-seropositive women. Reduction in IL-8 detection greater than 3% was observed in 57 (29%) of the 200 samples. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0116911.g001">Fig. 1A</xref> shows examples of several of the positive samples including ones from HIV+ subjects with the most reduction (subjects 26 and 56) and three from HIV+ subjects that exhibited no reduction (83, 90 and 100). Note that the genital fluid samples from the subjects had higher levels of IL-8 after 4°C incubation than the saline control because genital fluid from most women contains some endogenous IL-8 [<xref rid="pone.0116911.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p>

                <p>Cleavage/alteration was observed in 28% of the samples from the HIV-seropositive women and 35% from the HIV-seronegative women (p&gt;0.05, Chi-square analysis). For the samples from the HIV+ women, we determined if there was a relationship between peripheral blood CD4 number (assessed by flow cytometry) and IL-8 cleaving/altering activity. Surprisingly, we found that the CD4 number was significantly higher in women whose samples were positive (&gt;3% cleavage) for activity (median CD4 of 277 cells/microliter) than in those negative for IL-8 cleavage/alteration (&lt;3% cleavage, median CD4 of 176 cells/microliter, p = 0.004, Mann-Whitney test). In contrast, the plasma HIV levels were not significantly different between the two groups.</p>
                <p>The fact that IL-8 cleavage/alteration occurred at 37°C when compared with 4°C suggested that an enzyme was responsible. To determine the heat stability of the activity, a portion of one genital fluid sample was heated at 80°C for 45 min before testing its activity. While the unheated genital fluid reduced IL-8 detection by 55%, heating at 80°C completely eliminated the activity (0% cleavage) indicating the activity was heat labile (data not shown).</p>
                <p>The time and concentration dependence of the IL-8 cleaving/altering activity in the sample from subject 26 was also tested. Substantial IL-8 cleavage/alteration was observed by 4 hours when the genital sample was diluted 1:40 with even more cleavage from the more concentrated sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0116911.g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). Incubation for 24 hours increased the amount of cleavage/alteration.</p>

                <p>Since no clear relationship between the bacterial microbiota and IL-8 cleavage/alteration was observed, the type of protease responsible for the activity was next investigated. Samples with high activity (samples 26 and 56) were tested in the presence of several protease inhibitors. PMSF, a serine protease inhibitor, had no effect on activity (not shown). However, both EDTA and a protease inhibitor mixture (general protease inhibitor, GPI) reduced IL-8 cleavage/alteration with similar efficacy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0116911.g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). Since EDTA is known to inhibit matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), we next tested the effect of two MMP inhibitors, Marimastat and C471474, on IL-8 cleavage. Both of the MMP inhibitors reduced IL-8 cleavage/altering compared to the DMSO control, although Marimastat was more effective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0116911.g003">Fig. 3B</xref>).</p>
                <p>Since the inhibitor experiments suggested MMPs could be involved in IL-8 cleavage/alteration, we next used a multiplex assay to measure the total amount (both active and inactive) of MMPs 1, 3, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 12 in samples that were positive (n = 22) or negative (n = 5) for activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0116911.g004">Fig. 4</xref>). All of the MMPs could be detected in at least some of the samples. When comparing IL-8-cleavaging/altering-positive and –negative samples, none of the MMPs were significantly different between the two groups.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>This study shows that an activity that can act on IL-8 is present in the lower genital tract fluid of some women. Inhibitor studies of samples collected from the two women with the highest activity strongly suggested that MMPs were causing IL-8 cleavage. Further, a strong positive correlation was observed between the IL-8 cleaving/altering activity and active MMP-9 levels as well as between the activity and cleavage of a substrate that can detect multiple active MMPs. Together these data, along with previous studies showing that MMP-9 can act on IL-8 [<xref rid="pone.0116911.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], indicate that in most of the samples, MMPs and specifically MMP-9 was responsible for the IL-8 cleaving/altering activity. However, several of the samples that had relatively high levels of IL-8 cleavage/alteration had relatively low MMP-9 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0116911.g005">Fig. 5B</xref>). Some of the samples with low MMP-9 activity had relatively high activity with the substrate that can be cleaved by multiple MMPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0116911.g005">Fig. 5A</xref>). Thus, our results suggest that in some of the samples, MMPs other than MMP-9 might participate in cleavage of IL-8. Several other MMPs have been reported to act on other chemokines [<xref rid="pone.0116911.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. For example, MMP-3 can cleave MCP-1 and MMP-8 can cleave CXCL5, although other MMPs have not been reported to act on IL-8 [<xref rid="pone.0116911.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Alternatively, it is possible that other proteases, possibly either host- or bacterially-derived, could be present and act on IL-8 in the lower genital tract samples. A previous study of stability of IL-8 in lavage specimens showed that pooling lavages and incubating at 37°C for 24 h decreased IL-8 detection by about 50% [<xref rid="pone.0116911.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, in that study it is not clear that an enzymatic activity was responsible for the decreases in IL-8 and MMPs were not assessed.</p>
              <p>To our knowledge this is the first report of active MMPs in the lower genital tract of women that shows the presence of multiple MMPs, although we did not test if all the MMPs were active. All of the tested MMPs including MMP-1, -3, -7, -8, -9, -10 and -12 were found in at least some of the women while none of the MMPs were found in all of the women. A study by Heng et al. [<xref rid="pone.0116911.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] measured MMPs 1, -2, -3, -7, -8, -9, -12, and -13 and showed that MMP-7 was increased in labor, although MMP activity was not evaluated in that study. Active MMPs have multiple complex roles in inflammation including inhibition and potentiation [<xref rid="pone.0116911.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], so that the active MMPs detected in our study could potentially alter responses to STDs or microbiota in the lower genital tract.</p>
              <p>In this study, IL-8 cleaving/altering activity was observed in samples from both HIV-seropositive and –seronegative women. Thus, the presence of the activity does not appear to be associated with HIV-induced immunodeficiency. In fact, in the HIV-seropositive women, CD4 counts were higher in samples with activity than in samples with no activity. This could suggest that the expression of the protease in the genital tract is controlled through immune responses, and that the activity levels are consequently reduced in immunodeficient subjects. In contrast to our results, in a study of crevicular MMP-9 in HIV-infected subjects, a significant negative correlation between MMP-9 and CD4 levels was seen [<xref rid="pone.0116911.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The IL-8 cleaving/altering activity was also not associated with types of bacterial microbiota. All but two of the nine positive samples had a microbiota that was dominated by <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>, which in previous studies has been associated with low levels of inflammation as determined by levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines [<xref rid="pone.0116911.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0116911.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0116911.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0116911.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0116911.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0116911.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. However, it is possible that other infectious or non-infectious inflammatory stimuli could have induced the expression of the IL-8 cleaving activity in the women, but the women in this cohort were not tested for these. Neutrophils or macrophages could be the source of MMPs in our studies [<xref rid="pone.0116911.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Interestingly, a cytolytic factor that can lyse neutrophils has been reported to be produced by <italic>Gardnerella</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0116911.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Such a factor produced by genital bacteria could increase the levels of host-derived IL-8 degrading enzymes in the genital tract due to release from neutrophils.</p>
              <p>Since IL-8 cleavage in many of the genital samples in this study was likely mediated by MMP-9, cleavage would be expected to substantially (approximately 10×) increase IL-8 biological activity as previously reported [<xref rid="pone.0116911.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Due to the presence of endogenous IL-8 and other chemokines [<xref rid="pone.0116911.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0116911.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], and also potentially cleaved IL-8 in lower genital tract fluids, the bioactivity resulting from IL-8 cleavage could not be assessed in our study. A large increase in IL-8 bioactivity due to cleavage could substantially influence the amount of inflammation that occurs during STIs or other causes of lower genital tract inflammation that may have negative effects such as increasing HIV susceptibility [<xref rid="pone.0116911.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Further study of the role that MMPs play in modulating genital inflammation are warranted, especially since inhibitors of MMPs are available that could be used to reduce pathogenic effects [<xref rid="pone.0116911.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p>
