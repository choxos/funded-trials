                  <title>Purpose:</title>
                  <p>Cyclin D/CDK4/6 is critical in controlling the G<sub>1</sub> to S checkpoint. <italic toggle="yes">CCND</italic>, the gene encoding cyclin D, is known to be amplified in a variety of solid tumors. Palbociclib is an oral CDK4/6 inhibitor, approved in advanced breast cancer in combination with endocrine therapy. We explored the efficacy of palbociclib in patients with nonbreast solid tumors containing an amplification in <italic toggle="yes">CCND1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">2</italic>, or <italic toggle="yes">3</italic>.</p>

                  <title>Patients and Methods:</title>
                  <p>Patients with tumors containing a <italic toggle="yes">CCND1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">2</italic>, or <italic toggle="yes">3</italic> amplification and expression of the retinoblastoma protein were assigned to subprotocol Z1B and received palbociclib 125 mg once daily for 21 days of a 28-day cycle. Tumor response was assessed every two cycles.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results:</title>
                  <p>Forty patients were assigned to subprotocol Z1B; 4 patients had outside assays identifying the <italic toggle="yes">CCND1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">2</italic>, or <italic toggle="yes">3</italic> amplification and were not confirmed centrally; 3 were ineligible and 2 were not treated (1 untreated patient was also ineligible), leaving 32 evaluable patients for this analysis. There were no partial responses; 12 patients (37.5%) had stable disease as best response. There were seven deaths on study, all during cycle 1 and attributable to disease progression. Median progression-free survival was 1.8 months. The most common toxicities were leukopenia (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 21, 55%) and neutropenia (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 19, 50%); neutropenia was the most common grade 3/4 event (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 12, 32%).</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions:</title>
                  <p>Palbociclib was not effective at treating nonbreast solid tumors with a <italic toggle="yes">CCND1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">2</italic>, or <italic toggle="yes">3</italic> amplification in this cohort. These data do not support further investigation of single-agent palbociclib in tumors with <italic toggle="yes">CCND1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">2</italic>, or <italic toggle="yes">3</italic> amplification.</p>

              <p><italic toggle="yes">CCND1/2/3</italic> amplifications are found in solid tumors and are assessable on commercially available genomic sequencing panels. <italic toggle="yes">CCND</italic> encodes the cyclin D protein, which complexes with CDK4/6 to allow progression from G<sub>1</sub> to S phase of the cell cycle. Thus, tumors that have amplification of <italic toggle="yes">CCND1, 2</italic>, or <italic toggle="yes">3</italic> may exhibit enhanced proliferation, and be particularly sensitive to palbociclib, a first-in-class oral CDK4/6 inhibitor approved to treat advanced breast cancer. We tested this hypothesis in a subprotocol of the NCI-MATCH trial. Our results do not support the use of palbociclib in nonbreast tumors containing a <italic toggle="yes">CCND1, 2</italic>, or <italic toggle="yes">3</italic> amplification.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>One of the hallmarks of cancer is dysregulation of the cell cycle (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Although the cell cycle is controlled by multiple pathways and proteins, the key regulator of the G<sub>1</sub> to S checkpoint is the retinoblastoma protein (Rb). Unphosphorylated active Rb inhibits the transition to S phase of the cell cycle by coupling to E2F transcription factors and blocking E2F-mediated gene transcription. Expression of cyclin D is highly regulated. Cyclin D complexes with and activates CDK 4 and 6 (CDK 4/6). This cyclin D/CDK4/6 complex phosphorylates and inactivates Rb, releasing E2Fs, and allowing progression into S phase. The key role of cyclin D/CDK4/6 is emphasized in that these complexes are also regulated by upstream mitogenic signaling pathways such as PI3K/AKT, Wnt, ER/PR, and MAPK (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2–5</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">CCND1, 2</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">3</italic> are the genes that encode the Cyclin D protein isoforms.</p>
              <p>There are three CDK4/6 inhibitors (palbociclib, ribociclib, and abemaciclib) that are FDA-approved to treat estrogen receptor positive metastatic breast cancer in combination with endocrine therapy. Palbociclib received accelerated approval in combination with the aromatase inhibitor letrozole based upon a near doubling of progression-free survival (PFS) when compared with single-agent letrozole in the first-line metastatic setting, regardless of tumor <italic toggle="yes">CCND 1, 2</italic>, or <italic toggle="yes">3</italic> amplification (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6, 7</xref>). Results were confirmed in a randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled phase III trial (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Although the CDK4/6 inhibitors have been extensively studied in breast cancer, their efficacy shows some promise in other tumor types, though is less well explored. Palbociclib has been reported to stabilize Rb expressing growing teratoma in a group of 12 adults (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) as well as in a case report of a child with central nervous system growing teratoma syndrome who at the time of the report was receiving cycle 22 of therapy (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Further, in a cohort of 17 heavily pretreated patients with mantle cell lymphoma, which due to the t(11:14) chromosomal translocation, express high levels of <italic toggle="yes">CCND1</italic> mRNA, treatment with palbociclib produced a modest objective response in 3 patients (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Consistent across all of these trials, palbociclib has a favorable side-effect profile, with neutropenia being the most common toxicity. The Cancer Genome Atlas reported that <italic toggle="yes">CCND1, 2</italic>, or <italic toggle="yes">3</italic> amplification occur at variable rates across many tumor types. We hypothesized that palbociclib would be effective in nonbreast cancers that harbor amplification in the <italic toggle="yes">CCND1, 2</italic>, or <italic toggle="yes">3</italic> genes.</p>
              <p>NCI-MATCH (EAY131, NCT02465060) is a national platform clinical trial designed to assess efficacy of targeted therapies in tumors with specific molecular alterations. The trial is run by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)-American College of Radiology Imaging Network (ACRIN) Cancer Research Group through the National Clinical Trials Network and the NCI Community Oncology Research Program. Here, we report the results of the NCI-MATCH Subprotocol Z1B, a phase II single arm study evaluating palbociclib in patients with nonbreast cancers containing a <italic toggle="yes">CCND1, 2</italic>, or <italic toggle="yes">3</italic> amplification and expression of Rb.</p>

                <title>Clinical trial design</title>
                <p>The Molecular Analysis for Therapy Choice (NCI-MATCH) trial, developed by ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group (ECOG-ACRIN) and the NCI, aimed to find signals of efficacy for treatments targeted to actionable molecular alterations found in any tumor type. Each drug under investigation in the NCI-MATCH trial is vetted and must have at least preclinical evidence of target engagement (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Each subprotocol was approved by the Central IRB for the NCI (the NCI Adult IRB). Patients undergo initial eligibility screening and metastatic tumor biopsy in Step 0, where targetable molecular alterations are identified. In Step 1, patients are assigned to subprotocols defined by the molecular alteration, which assessed the efficacy of a specific scientifically rational targeted therapy (or therapies). Patients undergo additional eligibility screening during Step 1 for each subprotocol. Subprotocol Z1B was designed to examine the clinical activity of palbociclib, a CDK4/6 inhibitor, in tumors with <italic toggle="yes">CCND1, 2</italic>, or <italic toggle="yes">3</italic> amplifications. By inhibiting CDK4/6, palbociclib was hypothesized to mitigate the increase in proliferation due to excess activated Cyclin D/CDK4/6, resulting from amplification of the <italic toggle="yes">CCND1, 2</italic>, or <italic toggle="yes">3</italic> genes. Because Cyclin D/CDK4/6 signaling is mediated through Rb and preclinical studies show lack of efficacy of CDK4/6i in Rb null tumor cells (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), tumor Rb expression was also required for eligibility on subprotocol Z1B. Written informed consent was obtained by all patients prior to any study activities; the study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, Belmont Report, and U.S. Common Rule.</p>

                  <title>Patient selection</title>
                  <p>Adult patients with any nonbreast solid tumor, lymphoma or myeloma who progressed on standard treatment, or for whom no standard treatment was available, were eligible. Adequate hematopoietic, liver and kidney function, a performance status of ECOG ≤1 were required. Initially submission of fresh tissue was required, but an amendment on May 11, 2017, allowed patients to be enrolled using results from the designated lab network (instead of central testing). To be eligible for this subprotocol, tumors had to contain both an amplification in <italic toggle="yes">CCND1, 2</italic>, or <italic toggle="yes">3</italic> and Rb expression. <italic toggle="yes">CCND</italic> amplification was defined as seven or more copies of the gene; Rb expression was defined as 1+ or greater staining by IHC.</p>

                  <p>Actionable mutations were assessed using an NGS panel of 143 genes, including SNVs, indels, amplifications and selected fusions, and IHC assays for <italic toggle="yes">PTEN</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">MLH1</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">MSH2</italic> (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14, 15</xref>). If patients were identified as having a tumor with <italic toggle="yes">CCND1, 2</italic>, or <italic toggle="yes">3</italic> amplification, reflex testing for Rb expression by IHC was performed to confirm eligibility.</p>
                  <p>After completion of central testing of 5,954 patients’ fresh tumor biopsies, trial accrual continued by identification of patients whose tumors were found to have eligible alterations by molecular profiling performed for clinical reasons at one of 25 CLIA accredited laboratories approved to screen for NCI-MATCH. Confirmatory central testing was required in order for these patients to be included in the primary analysis.</p>

                  <p>The primary objective was to evaluate overall response rate (ORR) to palbociclib. A response rate of 5 of 31 patients (16%) or more was considered a signal of activity. This criterion allowed for 92% power to distinguish a 25% ORR from a null rate of 5%. The one-sided type I error rate was 1.8%. Secondary objectives were PFS at 6 months (PFS6), PFS, toxicity assessment, and evaluation of predictive biomarkers (comutations or other factors that potentially predict which patients will respond). The original accrual goal was 35 patients, to obtain 31 eligible patients. However, this subprotocol could accrue up to 70 patients (35 additional patients), after CTEP review of analysis from the first 31 and would take into account disease histology. Accrual beyond the first 35 would only be allowed for cancer types with less than 10 patients enrolled.</p>
                  <p>Descriptive statistics were used to summarize patient characteristics, treatment, and study outcomes. A one-sided <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> value for the ORR was calculated using a one-sample binomial test against the null rate of 5%, and <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.05 for the first 31 eligible patients was deemed as statistically significant; if expansion to 70 was permitted, the ORR to be tested was one-sample binomial test against null rate of 5% with <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.018 All statistical analyses were performed with R, version 3.5.0 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing).</p>

              <title>Results</title>
              <p>From August 16, 2016, to December 5, 2017, 40 patients were identified as having <italic toggle="yes">CCND1</italic> (39 patients), <italic toggle="yes">CCND2</italic> (0 patients), or <italic toggle="yes">CCND3</italic> (1 patient) amplification in Step 0. Three patients did not meet eligibility criteria, and 1 patient died prior to starting study therapy. Of the remaining 36 patients, 4 had <italic toggle="yes">CCND1</italic> amplification by local testing only; because these were not centrally confirmed, they are excluded from the primary analysis. This left 32 evaluable patients who went on to Step 1 therapy with palbociclib. Patient characteristics are summarized in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The median age of the patients was 62, IQR 59–67 years. The majority (56%) of patients were male. See Supplementary Table S1 for a summary of the representativeness of our study population. Seventy percent of patients had received three or more prior lines of therapy (mostly chemotherapy) for their malignancies. A wide variety of malignancies was represented in this cohort (shown in <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The majority of patients had adenocarcinoma (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 15) or squamous (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 14) histology. The four most commonly represented malignancies were squamous cell lung cancer (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 5, 13.9%), adenocarcinoma of the prostate (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 4, 11.1%), squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 3, 8.3%), and adenocarcinoma of the colon (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 3, 8.3%). The most common reason for discontinuation of study therapy was disease progression which occurred in 23 subjects (64%); one subject progressed during C1 and 14 progressed at the first disease assessment timepoint at the end of C2. There were seven deaths due to progression on study, all during cycle 1 of therapy.</p>

              <p>There were no partial or complete responses. The best RECIST response observed was stable disease (SD) occurring in 12 patients (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Of the 32 patients in the final cohort, 8 patients were not evaluable for response due to death during cycle 1 (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 7) or rapid clinical disease progression during cycle 1 (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 1), thus not having anatomic imaging with which to calculate a RECIST response. A waterfall plot depicting the percent change in tumor volume per RECIST v1.1 in each evaluable patient is shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>. The largest reduction in tumor volume was 13% and was observed in a patient with adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. To further examine those patients with SD, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref> highlights the time on treatment with palbociclib. Most patients with SD experienced progression of disease by cycle 4 of therapy. Four patients remained on study for 4 cycles or longer: individual patients with squamous cell lung cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the head neck larynx, adenoid cystic carcinoma of the parotid, and adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, were treated on study for 11, 8, 8, and 5 cycles, respectively. The range of prior lines of therapy in these four subjects was one to two, as compared with the eight subjects who came off trial in cycle 1 whose number of prior lines ranged from two to nine. The median PFS among patients treated with palbociclib was 1.8 months and the estimated 6-month PFS was 13% (90% CI, 5%–29%; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). The median overall survival was 7.7 months (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Subprotocol Z1B of the NCI-MATCH trial examined the efficacy of palbociclib in patients with solid tumors (other than breast cancer) containing amplifications in <italic toggle="yes">CCND1, 2</italic>, or <italic toggle="yes">3</italic> with concomitant expression of the Rb protein. Of the 32 evaluable patients, 31 had a tumor with <italic toggle="yes">CCND1</italic> amplification and 1 had <italic toggle="yes">CCND3</italic> amplification. There were no objective responses observed in this NCI-MATCH subprotocol. Four patients had SD for at least six cycles, and no patient stayed on palbociclib longer than 10 cycles. The AE profile observed in this subprotocol was similar to those reported in the previously published trials of palbociclib in patients with breast cancer (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7, 8, 20, 21</xref>): neutropenia was the most common AE and was also the most common grade 3/4 event, though febrile neutropenia was not observed.</p>
              <p>Examination of genomic biomarkers assessed at the time of study enrollment failed to identify any additional genomic alterations that were unique to the tumors of the four individuals who derived potential clinical benefit. Although these results support the safety of palbociclib in the treatment of advanced solid tumors, they do not support its use in nonbreast cancers containing <italic toggle="yes">CCND1 or 3</italic> amplifications with Rb expression. These findings are consistent with recently published studies in metastatic breast cancer, which concluded that <italic toggle="yes">CCND1</italic> amplification did not predict response to palbociclib and letrozole. PALOMA1 (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), a phase I/II unblinded trial that randomized patients with breast cancer to receive letrozole alone or in combination with palbociclib in the first-line metastatic setting, was enriched for patients with tumors containing either <italic toggle="yes">CCND1</italic> amplification or loss of p16. In this study, the PFS of patients treated with palbociclib/letrozole was significantly better than that in patients treated with letrozole alone. However, <italic toggle="yes">CCND1</italic> amplification was not associated with superior clinical benefit from letrozole/palbociclib (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">CCND1</italic> amplification also failed to predict response to single-agent palbociclib in a smaller study in patients with metastatic breast cancer (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). There have been no predictive biomarkers discovered for palbociclib, although there are biomarkers that may predict lack of response: loss of Rb and high <italic toggle="yes">CCNE</italic> mRNA expression (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>).</p>
              <p>Our study is limited most significantly by the number of early events. Of the 40 patients who were enrolled into this subprotocol from Step 0, 1 patient died before reaching Step 1, 7 patients died during C1, 1 patient progressed during C1, and 14 additional patients progressed by C3. Thus, over half of patients either died or progressed within 2 months of identification of the <italic toggle="yes">CCND</italic> amplification. The eight early deaths were not due to prolonged time between Step 0 and Step 1 [median days 41 for the 8 patients who experienced early death compared with 42 for the remainder of the cohort (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &gt; 0.9)]. This high rate of early events may be a result of the heavily pretreated nature of the study population and may reflect disease states too advanced to respond to a cytostatic drug. Although in the total study population, the median number of lines of therapy was 3 (1 to 10), the 8 patients who passed away had numerically more prior lines of therapy (median lines 3, range 2–10). Thus, rather than a biomarker of response to palbociclib, it may be a passenger mutation acquired over time during the course of multiple therapies and a biomarker of poor outcome. The idea of <italic toggle="yes">CCND1</italic> amplification being a biomarker of poor outcome is also supported by a study performed by Chen and colleagues that examined over 25,000 solid tumors. This study found that presence of <italic toggle="yes">CCND</italic>1 amplification correlated with worse overall survival and worse response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Whether palbociclib might be effective as earlier-line metastatic treatment remains an open question.</p>
              <p>Another limitation to the current analysis is the lack of pathway functional analysis. Further studies will be undertaken to more thoroughly examine the tumor genomes in patients enrolled onto this subprotocol to try to elucidate why some tumors progressed so quickly whereas others remained stable. It is plausible that there is an intricate interplay between <italic toggle="yes">CCND</italic> and its regulators, such as AMBRA1 (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24–26</xref>), that may impact response to palbociclib.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, this study is the first to examine the efficacy of palbociclib in <italic toggle="yes">CCND1, 2</italic>, or <italic toggle="yes">3</italic> amplified nonbreast solid tumors. Although our study confirms safety of the drug, our results do not support its use as a single agent in patients with solid tumors that contain amplification of the <italic toggle="yes">CCND1</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">3</italic> genes. Thus, future trials should concentrate on rational palbociclib drug combinations and use more in-depth functional assays of enzyme and pathway function to fully understand what molecular alterations are predictive biomarkers for this drug. Additional analyses are currently ongoing and may shed light on what drugs or drug combinations (with or without palbociclib) will be effective in patients with <italic toggle="yes">CCND</italic> amplified solid tumors.</p>
