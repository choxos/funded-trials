                <sec>
                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>In the last decade, universally available antiretroviral therapy (ART) has led to greatly improved health and survival of people living with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa, but new infections continue to appear. The design of effective prevention strategies requires the demographic characterisation of individuals acting as sources of infection, which is the aim of this study.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Between 2014 and 2018, the HPTN 071 PopART study was conducted to quantify the public health benefits of ART. Viral samples from 7124 study participants in Zambia were deep-sequenced as part of HPTN 071-02 PopART Phylogenetics, an ancillary study. We used these sequences to identify likely transmission pairs. After demographic weighting of the recipients in these pairs to match the overall HIV-positive population, we analysed the demographic characteristics of the sources to better understand transmission in the general population.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>We identified a total of 300 likely transmission pairs. 178 (59Â·4%) were male to female, with 130 (95% CI 110â150; 43Â·3%) from males aged 25â40 years. Overall, men transmitted 2Â·09-fold (2Â·06â2Â·29) more infections per capita than women, a ratio peaking at 5Â·87 (2Â·78â15Â·8) in the 35â39 years source age group. 40 (26â57; 13Â·2%) transmissions linked individuals from different communities in the trial. Of 288 sources with recorded information on drug resistance mutations, 52 (38â69; 18Â·1%) carried viruses resistant to first-line ART.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Interpretation</title>
                  <p>HIV-1 transmission in the HPTN 071 study communities comes from a wide range of age and sex groups, and there is no outsized contribution to new infections from importation or drug resistance mutations. Men aged 25â39 years, underserved by current treatment and prevention services, should be prioritised for HIV testing andÂ ART.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="p0015">The past decade has seen a global transformation in HIV care, with the near universal availability of affordable and effective combination antiretroviral therapy (ART), which durably suppresses viral replication, prevents AIDS, and stops onward transmission of the virus. The discovery that combination ART blocks transmission led to the idea that an effective form of HIV prevention is HIV testing, followed by initiation of ART for infected individuals.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref>
<boxed-text id="dtbox1a"><caption><title>Research in context</title></caption><sec id="tbox3sec1"><title>Evidence before this study</title><p id="p0220">We searched PubMed, with no date or language filters, to identify previous quantitative studies investigating the role of age, sex, mobility, and drug resistance mutations (separately or in combination) as drivers of new heterosexual HIV transmissions in sub-Saharan Africa. Observational studies were considered along with those using phylogenetic or mathematical modelling methodologies.</p><p id="p0225">In observational studies, having an older partner or a migrant partner is frequently identified as a risk factor for HIV acquisition, particularly in women, but this is a slightly separate question to the quantification of the overall frequency of these demographics among the sources of new infections. The most recent studies of drug resistance have shown an increasing prevalence, particularly in non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor resistance.</p><p id="p0230">The ability to use phylogenetics to investigate HIV transmission is reasonably recent, and the ability to use it to reconstruct who infected whom in transmission pairs is more recent still. One previous, influential study in South Africa posited a key role of men in their 30s in infecting very young women, and being themselves infected by women in their 30s, but that work did not use a methodology that was able to accurately reconstruct direction of transmission. A more recent study in Botswana found similar age distributions for male and female sources of transmission, with the average individual being in their late 30s or early 40s. However, these ages were recorded at the time of study enrolment and do not take into account the time from infection to sampling. The paper also showed that, in that setting, the majority of transmissions were between members of the same community. A number of other phylogenetic studies have been concerned with the very specific dynamics of HIV-1 in the fishing communities of Lake Victoria. No previous phylogenetics work to our knowledge hasÂ considered the distribution of drug resistance mutations in sources, and none considered the interaction between source characteristics.</p><p id="p0235">We were unable to find any previous mathematical modelling studies for which the characterisation of sources according to these variables was a major focus.</p></sec><sec id="tbox3sec2"><title>Added value of this study</title><p id="p0240">Our methodology uses a phylogenetic approach to identify likely transmission pairs and the direction of transmission between their members. We find a total of 300 pairs, larger than any previous study. We demonstrate a novel and simple new approach to accounting for potential sampling bias. We also employ a methodology that allows us to estimate the ages of the individuals involved at the time of transmission, rather than that of sampling, countering a key bias in previous approaches. Partly for this reason,Â our age profiles for sources peak at earlier ages than in previous work, with an average in the early 30s for male sources and mid-20s for females. We fail to confirm the existence of a ârenewal cycleâ of transmission involving a major contribution from women in older age groups. We also examine the contribution of outside-community transmission and drug resistance mutations, and, for the first time, show that these threeÂ characteristics (age and sex, migration, and drug resistance) operate on separate axes and do not cluster together. We use our results to calculate the relative contribution of male to female sources to transmission in age bands, finding that this grows toÂ aÂ peak in the 35â39 years age group in which men are responsible for almost six times as many new infections per personÂ as women.</p></sec><sec id="tbox3sec3"><title>Implications of all the available evidence</title><p id="p0245">The heterosexual HIV epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa appears to be maintained by transmissions from young women and slightly, but not substantially, older men. The contributions of sources transmitting drug-resistant virus, or sources who reside outside a focal community, are not particularly large, and there is no disproportionate contribution from individuals who share any combination of a high-risk age group, a residence outside the community, and drug-resistant virus.</p><p id="p0250">In generalised HIV epidemics, it is tempting to attempt to identify particular demographic groups, of relatively small sizes, for whom intensive targeting of prevention measures will have a major effect on transmission in the general population. The current state of the evidence suggests that this might not be possible, with transmission coming most frequently from younger individuals, disproportionately men, whose demographics are otherwise quite typical of their community. While it might be more difficult and resource-intensive to design universal interventions for the whole population, there can be no shortcuts.</p></sec></boxed-text></p>
              <p id="p0020">The HPTN 071 (PopART) cluster-randomised trial<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> evaluated whether a prevention package including universal testing and treatment (UTT) would reduce HIV incidence in communities in Zambia and South Africa.

                <p id="p0085">For each directed pair, we characterised the source partner by sex, age group (in 5-year bands), viral drug resistance mutations, and whether they were registered in a different community from their recipient. Sampling bias is an important consideration in a source attribution study. We observed that the study could be viewed as a survey in which recipients of infection provided information about their sources. Thus, methods for adjusting for unrepresentative sampling from survey methodology are appropriate, and we used iterative proportional fitting (ârakingâ) as implemented in the R <italic>anesrake</italic> package to weight the population of recipients to be demographically representative of the HIV-positive population of individuals in the trial, in regard to four variables: sex, birth cohort (pre-1960, post-1994, and seven bins of 5 years covering the intervening period), community, and marital status. The target population distribution of the former three variables was estimated from the PopART-IBM individual-based model<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> while the last was calculated from the marital status of HIV-infected individuals in the 2018 Zambia Demographic and Health Survey.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> Proportions of sources with a particular characteristic (eg, age group) were then calculated by using the sum of their recipientsâ weights asÂ numerator, instead of the simple number of pairs. 95%Â CIs for weighted proportions were calculated using the RÂ <italic>survey</italic> package.</p>

              <p id="p0105">The phylogenetic topology assigned a direction of transmission to 295 pairs, while 265 were called by comparison of the time of infection estimates. 145 were called by both methods, with 25 excluded due to conflicting results. When combined, the analysis yielded 355 probable directed transmission pairs. For 300, transmission was estimated to have occurred during the trial period (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figureÂ 1</xref>). This was consistent with a power calculation conducted before the study to determine the number of transmission pairs required to characterise sources of infection (see <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">appendix p 2</xref>). 284 (94Â·7%) of the 300 pairs were subtype C for both partners. The remainder were called as recombinants in one or both cases, but C was always one of the parents (see <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">appendix p 13</xref>).</p>

Note that there are fewer probable sources identified than recipients, as 14 individuals were reconstructed as infecting multiple others. 13 of these (seven males and six females) were probable sources for two other individuals, and one (female) for four others. We emphasise that the principal unit of our analysis is the transmission, and that characteristics such as ages at time of transmission and the source residing in a different community to the recipient will not necessarily be consistent between two transmissions even with the same source. We are exploring the characteristics of the sources involved in 300 distinct transmissions, rather than those of 300 unique sources.</p>
              <p id="p0115">Pre-weighting, 170 (56Â·7%) transmissions were from male to female participants; weighting brought this to 178Â (59Â·4%). The age distributions of the individuals identified as probable sources, both male and female, showed the highest rates of transmission coming from individuals between 20 and 39 years of age: 130 (95% CI 114â144; 72Â·9%) of the 178 male sources were between 25Â and 39 years of age at the estimated time of transmission, representing 43Â·3% of the 300 transmissions, while 87 (75â98; 71Â·6%) of 122 female sources were between 20 and 34 years of age, representing 29Â·0% (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">figureÂ 3A</xref>). Unless otherwise stated, figures given in this section are all weighted to adjust for sampling bias as described in the Methods. Weighted counts are rounded to the nearest whole number. In the PopART-IBM simulation, 18â094 (19Â·4%) of 93â272 infected individuals in 2017 were men aged 25â39 years, while 25â443 (27Â·3%) were women aged 20â34 years. The median age at time of transmission wasÂ 32 years (range 20â64) for male sources and 25 years (17â49) for female sources (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">figureÂ 3A</xref>). There was no evidence of a difference in the ages of sources (weighted Kruskal-Wallis test p=0Â·98 for male-to-female pairs, p=0Â·48 for female-to-male pairs) between trial arms.<fig id="fig3"><label>FigureÂ 3</label><caption><p>Characteristics of sources of transmission</p><p>(A) Age profile (at the estimated time of transmission) of the sources of infection for participants estimated to have been infected during the trial period.

              <p id="p0120">We calculated relative transmission rates among demographic groups, defined as the ratio of the proportion of sources identified from a group to that groupâs proportion of the overall HIV-positive population, as estimated by PopART-IBM (see <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">appendix pp 2â3</xref>). For men, this was 1Â·44 (bootstrapped 95% CI 1Â·43â1Â·5) while for women it was 0Â·69 (0Â·65â0Â·7). The ratio of these two numbers is 2Â·09 (2Â·06â2Â·29), indicating that HIV-positive males were contributing more than twice as many new infections as HIV-positive females, per person. The ratio was 1Â·79 (1Â·78â1Â·95) when the groupâs proportion of the HIV-positive population not on ART, instead of the total HIV-positive population, was used as a denominator, indicating that even when adjusting for ART coverage, men infected more women per person than vice versa.</p>
              <p id="p0125"><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">FiguresÂ 3B and 3C</xref> show these statistics for both denominators stratified by age group. The peak relative rate among females was observed in the 20â24 years age group (2Â·0 compared with the HIV-positive population, 95% CI 1Â·41â2Â·67) while for males it was the 30â34 years age group (2Â·76; 2Â·09â3Â·37). The male-to-female ratio was 4Â·38 (2Â·8â8Â·25) in the 30â34 years age group and 5Â·87Â (2Â·78â15Â·8) in the 35â39 years age group. This ratio was above 1 in all age groups other than 20â24 years but the confidence interval included 1 for the 20â24, 25â29, and 45â49 years age groups for both denominators.</p>
              <p id="p0130">A weighted total of 12 (3Â·8%) sources had an unknown drug resistance profile (due to poor genome coverage at relevant sites). Of the remaining 288, 236 (95% CI 220â250; 81Â·9%) carried drug-sensitive viruses, while 20 (12â32; 7Â·0%) showed low-level resistance to first-line ART and 32Â (21â46; 11Â·1%) high-level resistance (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">figureÂ 3D</xref>). Thus some measure of resistance was seen in 52 (38â69; 18Â·1%) sources. Again, there was no evidence of a difference in the distribution of mutations with respect to the trial arm of the recipient (Ï<sup>2</sup> test p=0Â·32). For comparison, of 285 recipients with non-missing data, 227 (209â242; 79Â·7%), 31 (21â46; 11Â·0%), and 27 (16â40; 9Â·3%) recipients had virus that was respectively sensitive, low-level, or high-level resistant, in line with a previously published study on resistance.<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="p0135">Lastly, we determined the fraction of transmission pairs for which the source lived in a different community from the recipient (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">figureÂ 3E</xref>). A weighted total of 260 of 300Â (95% CI 243â274; 86Â·8%) transmissions occurred within the same community, compared with 40 (26â57; 13Â·2%) that did not. Contrary to the other variables, here there was some evidence of a difference in the proportion of transmissions coming from outside the community by trial arm (Ï<sup>2</sup> test p=0Â·035), with a rounded total of 10 of 91 (11Â·2%) from outside the community in arm A, 20 of 100 (20Â·1%) in arm B, and 9 of 109 (8Â·5%) in arm C.</p>
              <p id="p0140">We next sought to understand the extent to which characteristics of sources might occur disproportionately often in combinations. To do this, we ranked each combination according to the fraction of transmissions in which they played a role (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">figureÂ 4A</xref>). The highest fraction originated from males aged 25â39 years who lived in the same community as their recipient and had no viral resistance to first-line ART. They were the sources for 1Â·78 times as many transmissions as the female risk group aged 20â34 years with the same characteristics andÂ 1Â·18 times as many transmissions as all sources outside these two age groups. There was no group that disproportionately combined several of the risk factors, as real values were generally very close to values expected if risk factors present in the population of sources had been randomly assigned to this population (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">appendix p 4</xref>).<fig id="fig4"><label>FigureÂ 4</label><caption><p>Combined characteristics of source individuals</p><p>(A) Distribution of all combinations of four key risk factors among the set of directed opposite-sex pairs determined to have been infected during the trial period.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="p0150">We identified characteristics of likely sources of HIV-1 transmission in Zambia between 2014 and 2019. The aim of the study is to provide policy makers with data on where transmission is still occurring in a generalised epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa, despite delivery of a UTT intervention, and advise where prevention efforts should be focused.</p>
              <p id="p0155">We identified men aged 25â39 years as the group most commonly transmitting HIV-1. They were the source of 43Â·3% of transmissions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">figureÂ 4B</xref>), despite males aged 25â39 years representing only 19Â·4% of prevalent cases in 2017. 29% of transmissions were attributable to women aged 20â34 years. Age distributions of sources were wide, suggesting that transmitters were not confined to any small demographic category. 2Â·09 times as many infections were attributable to male sources as to females, and when stratified by age this number rose to 4Â·38 for men and women in the 30â34 years age group and to 5Â·87 in the 35â39 years age group. Men in these age groups were notably less likely than other demographic groups to be linked to care and on ART.<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> A similar phylogenetics study conducted as part of the Ya Tsie trial in Botswana largely concurred with this finding, although estimated ages for sources were somewhat greater.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> That study, however, recorded ages at time of sampling, with no attempt to estimate time of infection. These results highlight the need for more intensive efforts in UTT programmes to achieve high and sustained ART coverage and testing for men aged 25â39 years; a programme that leaves a deficit in coverage for the demographic group responsible for the greatest proportion of transmissions might be viewed as insufficiently universal. It also suggests that pre-exposure prophylaxis services should also be considered for the partners of these men.<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="p0160">Much prevention effort on HIV in sub-Saharan Africa has focused on intergenerational relationships, older men, and the âsugar daddyâ phenomenon.<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> A previous phylogenetic study further suggested that the epidemic is maintained through a renewal process, in which young women are infected by considerably older men, who had been infected by women of a similar age to themselves.<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> Policies aimed at breaking this cycle have been promoted by UNAIDS and PEPFAR, in particular with the DREAMS programme. We find little evidence for this cycle or for intergenerational relationships being major drivers of transmission, with the median age of female sources being 25 years and that of males 32 years. While we do find that a significant minority of transmissions came from outside the community, this is nevertheless a minority, casting doubt, at least in this setting, on another commonly hypothesised driver of new transmissions, human mobility.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> Our results in totality indicate that infections are predominantly local and disproportionately from men.</p>
              <p id="p0165">11Â·1% and 7Â·0% of sourcesâ viral populations were dominated by variants with high-level and low-level resistance against first-line ART, respectively. A caveat is that the precise timing of ART initiation was not known, and therefore some resistance could have been acquired in sources following transmission to the recipient. Nevertheless, this level of drug resistance mirrors the high percentage of first-line ART resistance reported by other studies in the past few years.<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> Resistance against current first-line ART, including dolutegravir (which was not rolledÂ out in Zambia at the time of this study), needs to beÂ monitored by local surveillance teams as the availability of HIV drug resistance testing and next-generation sequencing in sub-Saharan Africa increases.</p>
              <p id="p0170">While a large majority of transmissions occurred between partners from the same community, 13Â·2% did not (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">figureÂ 4B</xref>). This analysis cannot help but exclude pairs for which the source resided outside the trial population and thus could never be sampled, and so this estimate will be lower than the overall proportion of imports (and potentially much lower). Although movement does not necessarily compromise the effect of treatment as prevention, it does affect the ability of trials such as HPTN 071 to accurately measure its effect. Thus, as the primary analysis of the trial<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> took no account of between-community transmission, even this probably underestimated figure indicates that HIV-1 incidence would have been further reduced if the PopART prevention package had been implemented country-wide. The complex statistical corrections required to assess the impact of the intervention taking into account between-community transmission are outside the scope of this study, but further genomic analysis is likely to lead to a higher estimate of its effectiveness.</p>
              <p id="p0175">A limitation of the <italic>phyloscanner</italic> procedure is that it is not able to rule out missing intermediaries in transmission, but for heterosexual epidemics this is easy to detect as it would result in observed same-sex pairs. Our 242Â female-to-female pairs are exceptionally unlikely to represent genuine sexual transmission, but the 90 male-to-male examples could potentially be men who have sexÂ with men (MSM). However, of all combinations ofÂ females in the dataset, a proportion of 5Â·2Ã10<sup>â5</sup> (95%Â binomial CI 4Â·6Ã10<sup>â5</sup>â5Â·87Ã10<sup>â5</sup>) were linked by the analysis, compared with 4Â·09Ã10<sup>â5</sup> (3Â·3Ã10<sup>â5</sup>â5Â·0Ã10<sup>â5</sup>) of males. As the female-to-female links must be erroneous, the overlapping confidence intervals suggest no evidence for an excess of male-to-male pairs that would imply a substantial contribution of cryptic MSM transmission to infections in the sampled population. We might be underestimating the amount of MSM transmission due to simple undersampling of MSM, especially if they were less likely to participate in the trial for reasons of stigma. Nevertheless, our results suggest that MSM are not widely integrated into heterosexual networks. The restriction to same-sex pairs also naturally removes any pairs with a single missing intermediary, increasing the specificity of <italic>phyloscanner</italic> as only situations of two or more missing intermediaries cannot be ruled out.</p>
              <p id="p0180">This study has limitations. This work was conducted in the context of the HPTN 071 trial, which potentially limits the generalisability of results to other settings. However, the trial did have a control arm, and the only variable that we explored whose distribution showed a clear difference between arms was transmission from outside the community, which was higher in intervention arms. This is consistent with the intervention reducing transmission within-community, resulting in a larger fraction of infections being caused by introductions. Nevertheless, we acknowledge that the conditions of even the control communities might have differed from those in other locations where no trial was taking place, for example because the presence of trial staff in the community might have some effect on health-care seeking behaviour in the population.</p>
              <p id="p0185">While between 13Â·0% and 35Â·2% of people living with HIV in the study communities were sampled, a proportion comparable to similar large studies in sub-Saharan Africa,<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> and much larger than was possible in the quite recent past, the sample was still not fully representative of the whole HIV-positive population. In particular, the design restricted sampled individuals to one person per household in the population cohort, limiting our ability to identify within-household transmission pairs. This is mitigated by the collection of samples in the health-care facilities, which had no such restrictions, but might have introduced its own bias towards identifying individuals who presented to these facilities of their own volition. Our inclusion criterion for samples was simply that sequencing was successful above a quality threshold, which might also introduce some bias. In particular, the laboratory approach only yielded sequences for participants with more than 5000 viral copies per mL. This will exclude patients with lower viral loads, but still corresponds to 92Â·8% of participants with viral loads above 1500 copies per mL.<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> Individuals on effective ART at the time of sampling would not usually be included, due to their specific exclusion in the health-care facilities and their low viral loads preventing sequence acquisition in the population cohort. We estimate that the contribution of MSM to transmission among the sampled members of this community is at most small, and hence that by including only opposite-sex pairs we analysed the transmission route responsible for sustaining infections in this population. Nevertheless, it remains possible that genuine examples of MSM transmission were detected, and we did not explore the characteristics of those pairs as it was impossible to distinguish them from heterosexual transmissions with a missing intermediary. A proper investigation of any MSM transmission in this or similar populations would require a different study design.</p>
              <p id="p0190">HPTN 071-02 (PopART) Phylogenetics is the largest HIV phylogenetic study conducted to date, the first large transmission study to be based on an a priori power calculation, and the most comprehensive study of characteristics of sources of HIV-1 infection in sub-Saharan Africa. The study highlights that residual transmission was not limited toÂ coming from small risk groups. However, men aged 25â39 years were, as a group, responsible for a large share of transmissions and should be prioritised in prevention efforts, even if linking them to care requires more effort.</p>
