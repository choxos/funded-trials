                  <p id="P1">Phosphoglucomutase-1 deficiency is a subtype of congenital disorders of glycosylation (PGM1-CDG). Previous case-reports in PGM1-CDG patients receiving oral D-galactose (D-gal) showed clinical improvement. So far no systematic <italic>in vitro</italic> and clinical studies assessed safety and benefits of D-gal supplementation.

                  <title>Methods/Results</title>
                  <p id="P2">D-gal supplementation was increased to 1.5 g/kg/day (maximum 50 g/day) in three increments over 18 weeks. Laboratory studies were performed before and during treatment to monitor safety and effect on serum transferrin-glycosylation, coagulation, liver and endocrine function. Additionally, the effect of D-gal on cellular glycosylation was characterized <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>
                  <p id="P3">Eight patients were compliant with D-gal supplementation. No adverse effects were reported. Abnormal baseline results (ALT/AST/aPTT) improved or normalized already using 1g/kg/day D-gal. Antithrombin-III levels and Transferrin-glycosylation showed significant improvement, and increase in galactosylation and whole glycan content. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies before treatment showed N-glycan hyposialylation, altered O-linked glycans, abnormal LLO-profile, and abnormal nucleotide-sugars in patient fibroblasts. Most cellular abnormalities improved or normalized following D-gal treatment.</p>

                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p id="P4">D-gal increased both UDP-Glc and UDP-gal levels and improved LLO fractions in concert with improved glycosylation in PGM1-CDG. Oral D-gal supplementation is a safe and effective treatment for PGM1-CDG in this pilot study. Transferrin glycosylation and ATIII levels were useful trial end points. Larger, longer duration trials are ongoing.</p>

              <p id="P5">Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDGs) are defects in glycoprotein and glycolipid synthesis<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. Phosphoglucomutase 1 deficiency (PGM1-CDG; MIM 612941) is a recently characterized CDG with oro-facial malformations and multisystem involvement including cardiomyopathy, coagulopathy, endocrinopathies, and hepatopathy<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>–<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. These clinical features have been attributed to abnormal protein glycosylation. Additionally, patients suffer from recurrent hypoglycemia and myopathy, which is thought to occur by insufficient glycogen mobilization due to PGM1 deficiency<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="P6">PGM1 is required for the interconversion of glucose 1-phosphate and glucose 6-phosphate, and is a key enzyme in glycolysis, glycogenesis, and glycogenolysis<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. Although the exact mechanism remains unclear, PGM1 deficiency has been associated with abnormal intracellular levels of glucose and galactose metabolites, as well as reduced assembly and remodeling of N-linked glycans. These metabolic disturbances are thought to be responsible for both the missing and the truncated glycans detected in serum by transferrin isoform analysis. There is a lack of whole glycans and reduction of galactose units and terminal sialic acids in truncated glycans in PGM1-CDG, demonstrated by QTOF mass spectrometry<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="P7">In a landmark study, we reported on improved glycosylation with galactose supplementation in PGM1-CDG<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies in skin fibroblast cell lines derived from three patients showed improvement in protein glycosylation following D-galactose (D-gal) treatment. Additionally, in six patients who received dietary supplementation of D-gal, both transferrin glycosylation and total serum N-glycome showed improvement within two weeks. Oral lactose supplements had minimal effect on transferrin-IEF, and high dietary lactose content didn’t affect clinical outcome. While improvements were documented in a few patients ingesting D-gal, a systematic clinical study has yet to assess the effect of oral galactose supplementation on other features of PGM1-CDG and establish the extent of clinical improvement.</p>

The secondary endpoints were the restoration of the plasma glycan sub-fractions, monitored via glycomics (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, <xref rid="SD4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 3</xref>), and normalization of antithrombin III activity and serum alanine transaminase (ALT) levels.</p>

In patient cell lines 1, 2, 8 and cell-line 2013Y, we found increased levels of UDP-Glc (72.2 % and 49.3 % of control, 141.3% and 90.5% of control, 60.9% and 23.0% of control and 142.1% and 87.7% of control, respectively) and in a lesser degree UDP-Gal (29.6 % and 23.4 % of control, 84.4% 69.7% of control, 9.1% and −22% of control, 48.3% and 32.7% of control, respectively).

                <p id="P46">There is no proven effective treatment available in most CDG types, except for MPI-CDG, where coagulopathy and hypoglycemia are successfully treated by oral mannose supplementation<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>–<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. Based on a hypo-galactosylation glycan-pattern in PGM1-CDG, compassionate use of D-gal resolved hypogonadotropic hypogonadism in two patients<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. In the present prospective pilot study, we assessed different laboratory parameters as potentially secondary end point markers in blood. Those, abnormal at baseline, improved or normalized by 12 or 18 weeks, with a few exceptions. ALT was abnormal at baseline in half of the patients and completely normalized in all but one patient. Interestingly during infection-related diarrhea in patient 2 the liver transaminases dramatically re-increased within 2 weeks. AST was abnormal in all patients. Although AST levels markedly improved in most patients on D-gal, none normalized during the study period. AST is also a biomarker for muscle involvement. Creatine kinase, another biomarker of muscle injury, remained also elevated in all patients. Persistently elevated AST might be indicative of unresolved myopathy, caused by insufficient glycogenolysis<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. The observed improvement in both serum transaminases suggests that galactose supplementation ameliorates liver dysfunction, thus decreasing the risk for hepatic steatosis and fibrosis. We also demonstrated that D-gal supplementation was safe and tolerated at 1.5g/kg/day, even using 50 g/day/day (patients 1, 2 and 3). ATIII also improved and found to be significantly higher in patients on D-gal. ATIII could be a potential biomarker for future treatment trials.</p>
                <p id="P47">Long-term use of galactose in patient 1 over one year beyond the study period showed normalization of almost all biochemical anomalies, except for transferrin glycosylation. Normalization of several coagulation factors on galactose resolved the patient’s frequent, spontaneous epistaxis episodes, and improved quality of life. Some of the coagulation factors remained abnormal, which might suggest the need for either higher D-gal dose or longer treatment and follow up. Interestingly, the frequency of hypoglycemia and fluctuation of creatine kinase levels also decreased, without episodes of rhabdomyolysis.</p>

                <title>Improved glycosylation in patients</title>
                <p id="P48">Serum transferrin glycosylation showed a characteristic PGM1 mixed type I/ type II profile in all patients at baseline, with truncated glycans and lack of whole glycans. Upon galactose supplementation, the spectrum shifted from a mixed profile to a mild type I profile. Only patient 5 did not shift to a type I glycosylation, but this patient was also on the mildest spectrum of all patients. The spectra did not completely normalize, mostly type 1 peaks remained present. However, most of the truncated galactose-lacking glycoforms strongly decreased during this 18 weeks of supplementation. Overall, the spectra suggest that galactose is able to directly restore the lack of galactose on the truncated glycans, while there seems to be a second, unsolved mechanism of action of galactose on the more slow improvement of CDG type I glycosylation, which could lead potentially a completely normalized glycosylation.</p>

                <p id="P49">ICAM1 is a known cell-marker of glycosylation. In contrast to patient 5, patients 1 and 2, and cell-line 2015X showed an increase in ICAM1 expression upon <italic>in vitro</italic> galactose treatment. This was in concert with the improvement of glycomics results in fibroblasts of patient 2 on galactose. Interestingly, before <italic>in vitro</italic> galactose treatment the sialylation of N-glycans was found to be reduced, with increased hyposialylated subspecies. Galactose treatment improved sialylation (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary</xref>).</p>
                <p id="P50">O-linked glycosylation in PGM1-deficient cells showed a significant reduction of disialo-core1 species and increase of sialylated core2 species. Since core-2 GlcNAc-transferase, the rate-limiting step of core2 synthesis, competes with ST6GalNAc-transferase, increased sialylated core2 and core1 ratio points to a deficiency at the step of ST6GalNAc transferase that forms 2,6 sialic acid motifs on disialo-core1 T antigen. However, 2,3 sialylation in O-linked glycosylation is not significantly affected in PGM1-CDG fibroblasts. Similar to the effect on N-linked glycosylation, galactose treatment improved the level of disialo core1 species and partially corrected the ratio between disialo core2/disialo core1. The Km of CMP-sialic acid for sialyltransferase of O-linked glycosylation is at least 10 times higher than the Km for sialyltransferases of N-linked glycosylation. Thus, it is more likely that the selective difference between 2,3 sialylation and 2,6 sialylation in O-GalNAc glycosylation is related to the difference in Km of these different sialyltransferases for CMP-sialic acid. Future studies on CMP-sialic acid levels in PGM1 deficient cells is necessary to better understand the changes in O-linked glycosylation.</p>

                <p id="P51">LLO analysis on serum starvation revealed an accumulation of shortened LLO in cultured patient skin fibroblasts. This indicates a disruption in the synthesis of LLO, required for N-linked glycosylation in the ER. Interestingly, accumulation of Man<sub>9</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub>-PP-Dol is characteristic for several type I CDG, including ALG6-CDG<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>, ALG8-CDG<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>, and MPDU1-CDG<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. Whereas the activity of glucosyltransferases is impaired in the first two CDG subtypes, the synthesis of Dol-P-Glc is defective in the latter case. PGM1 deficiency, in the lack of normal nutrients, like in the experimental setup of serum starvation, depleted the cellular pool of UPD-Glc, available for Dol-P-Glc synthesis. Interestingly, both UDP-Gal and UDP-Glc, depleted in patient cells during serum starvation, normalized on D-gal supplements (data not shown) and also the LLO profile in patient cell-line 2013Y, strongly suggesting a link between PGM1, glucose metabolism and N-glycosylation. D-gal supplementation did not improve LLO in patient 8, who is severely PGM1-deficient. UDP-Gal and particularly UDP-Glc might have been diverted towards energy production and tnot used for Dol-P-Glc synthesis in this case.</p>
                <p id="P52">In the presence of sufficient glucose in the culture medium (not using serum starvation), during the experiments, UDP-glc and UDP-gal pools were elevated in patients without D-Gal-therapy, compared to controls (<xref rid="SD8" ref-type="supplementary-material">supplementary table 5</xref>). D-gal treatment led to a further increase in nucleotide sugar levels of UDP-glc and UDP-gal in patients, but did not change the UDP-glc to UDP-gal ratio, while controls normalized after 4 days. Based on our experiments, in spite of increasing nucleotide sugar concentrations on D-gal, with or without serum starvation, the ratio of UDP-glc/UDP-gal remained abnormal, compared to control, therefore still affecting substrate availability for glycosylation. This means that the D-gal related UDP-monosaccharide pool improvement can’t be the only explanation for the improvement of glycosylation, and for the clinical improvement in patients, and we should further search for other regulatory mechanisms.</p>

                <p id="P53">Patients with PGM1-CDG show diverse abnormalities in endocrine, coagulation and liver function tests, therefore, our study included inconsistent baseline laboratory values. Noncompliance was observed in one patient, one patient accidentally prematurely increased D-gal dose, and a gastrointestinal infection affected treatment in another patient. Another limitation of this study was the small sample size, wide spectrum of ages at the time of enrollment (ranging from 19 months to 21 years), and the lack of adequate handling or volume of some of the blood samples at various time points.</p>
                <p id="P54">Statistical analysis was reliable for only the serum transferrin samples, where all baseline levels were abnormal, and for ATIII, showing significant improvement on D-gal. Other laboratory values, showing frequent normal values even spontaneously during disease course were not reliable markers for end points, and for statistical analysis.</p>

                <p>Lipid linked oligosaccharide analysis in 4 PGM1 deficient cell lines showing reduced LLO at Baseline and Improvement Following D-gal Supplementation</p>
                <p>To investigate whether PGM1 deficiency disrupts the formation of LLO, which is a required precursor for the synthesis of nascent N-linked glycoproteins in the ER, we performed lipid linked oligosaccharide (LLO) and protein linked oligosaccharide (PLO) analyses in the skin fibroblasts of patients 1, 2, 8, and cell-line 2013Y. The cells were deprived of glucose while the culture media was supplemented without or with 10mM D-gal (for one hour. The level of full-length LLO (Glc<sub>3</sub>Man<sub>9</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub>-PP-Dol, G3) or sugar moieties bound to newly synthesized PLO (mainly Glc<sub>1</sub>Man<sub>9</sub> and Man<sub>9</sub>), remained fairly unchanged in control cells (Figure 4, left column), indicating a high degree of metabolic fitness in these cells. In contrast, cells from all four patients showed a large amount of shortened LLO (Man<sub>9</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub>-PP-dolichol) (Figure 4, LLO top row). In contrast, the PLO profile was indistinguishable from the control cells (Figure 4, PLO top row). Interestingly, galactose supplementation led to the reduction of shortened LLO (Man<sub>9</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub>-PP-dolichol) in patients 1 2, and cell-line 2013Y, resulting in a LLO profile that is similar to control. No improvement was observed in patient 8 (Figure 4, LLO bottom row). D-Gal supplementation had no effect on the PLO profile in all patients (Figure 4, PLO bottom row).</p>
