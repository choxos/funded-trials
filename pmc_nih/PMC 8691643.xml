              <abstract>
                <p>Multiple factors make adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) a complex process. This study aims to describe the barriers and facilitators to adherence for patients receiving first-line and second-line ART, identify different adherence strategies utilized and make recommendations for an improved adherence strategy. This mixed method parallel convergent study will be conducted in seven high volume public health facilities in Gauteng and one in Limpopo province in South Africa. The study consists of four phases; a retrospective secondary data analysis of a large cohort of patients on ART (using TIER.Net, an ART patient and data management system for recording and monitoring patients on ART and tuberculosis (TB)) from seven Johannesburg inner-city public health facilities (Gauteng province); a secondary data analysis of the Intensified Treatment Monitoring Accumulation (ITREMA) trial (a randomized control trial which ran from June 2015 to January 2019) conducted at the Ndlovu Medical Center (Limpopo province); in-depth interviews with people living with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (PLHIV) who are taking ART (in both urban and rural settings); and a systematic review of the impact of treatment adherence interventions for chronic conditions in sub-Saharan Africa. Data will be collected on demographics, socio-economic status, treatment support, retention in care status, disclosure, stigma, clinical markers (CD4 count and viral load (VL)), self-reported adherence information, intrapersonal, and interpersonal factors, community networks, and policy level factors. The systematic review will follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) reporting and Population, Interventions, Comparisons and Outcomes (PICO) criteria. Analyses will involve tests of association (Chi-square and t-test), thematic analysis (deductive and inductive approaches) and network meta-analysis. Using an integrated multilevel socio-ecological framework this study will describe the factors associated with adherence for PLHIV who are taking first-line or second-line ART. Implementing evidence-based adherence approaches, when taken up, will improve patient’s overall health outcomes. Our study results will provide guidance regarding context-specific intervention strategies to improve ART adherence.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Inconsistent adherence to treatment is a contributing factor to poor health outcomes of people affected by numerous health conditions, including HIV, tuberculosis, diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypertension [<xref rid="pone.0261107.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0261107.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines adherence as the degree to which a patient is able to follow a treatment schedule and take medication at recommended times [<xref rid="pone.0261107.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0261107.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In the context of HIV, lapses in adherence to medication can lead to the development of viral rebound, which can result in immunosuppression and viral resistance [<xref rid="pone.0261107.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0261107.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0261107.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p>
              <p>WHO recommends the use of the HIV drug dolutegravir (DTG) as the preferred first-line and second-line ART treatment regimens for all populations due to its formidable resistance barrier and improved tolerability [<xref rid="pone.0261107.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0261107.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Despite the advantages of this first-line regimen, in South Africa between 20%-30% of patients with HIV experience clinical, immunological or virological failure from first-line ART due to lapses in adherence [<xref rid="pone.0261107.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0261107.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This is a concern because of the clinical and cost implications attached to treatment failure [<xref rid="pone.0261107.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0261107.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p>
              <p>Adherence to ART is a complex process that is affected by multiple factors, and numerous studies have attempted to establish what the barriers and facilitators of ART adherence are [<xref rid="pone.0261107.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0261107.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Individual-level factors such as age, sex, ethnicity, HIV status disclosure and forgetfulness, have been reported as important in predicting ART adherence [<xref rid="pone.0261107.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However, using individual-level factors one is only able to report a limited proportion of the variability in non-adherence [<xref rid="pone.0261107.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Good interpersonal relationships between patients and care givers or treatment supporters including healthcare providers, an intimate partner, family members, and friends have been reported as predictors for good adherence [<xref rid="pone.0261107.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0261107.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In contrast to intrapersonal and interpersonal factors, the community level factors such as poverty, HIV related stigma and discrimination against patients on ART introduce barriers to ART adherence [<xref rid="pone.0261107.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Additional to community level factors, awareness of healthcare policy level factors like HIV treatment guidelines, policies, and best practices are imperative in ensuring good adherence and maintenance of the continuum of care [<xref rid="pone.0261107.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p>
              <sec id="sec002">
                <title>Conceptual framework</title>
                <p>Various studies have demonstrated that there are many factors that play an important role in maintaining adherence behaviour [<xref rid="pone.0261107.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0261107.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. These factors have been explored using several models, including: 1) Anderson’s Health Care Utilisation model [<xref rid="pone.0261107.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], which is a framework that considers predisposing factors (individual’ own personality and behaviour), enabling factors (patient and health provider relationship, community education) and need factors (patient’s beliefs, alternative medicine treatment options, community support); 2) the Dahlgren-Whitehead ’rainbow model’ [<xref rid="pone.0261107.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], a model that builds the relationship between the individual, the environment they live in and health; 3) Information-Motivation-Behavioural skills model (IMB model) [<xref rid="pone.0261107.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0261107.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], a model that views adherence behaviour as a function of the interrelations between adherence-related information, motivation, and behavioural skills; 4) the socio-ecological conceptual framework [<xref rid="pone.0261107.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0261107.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], which takes into consideration the individual, and their connections to other people, and how they adapt their behaviour to the social environment. This model suggests that an individual’s behaviour is cohesive in a dynamic network of intrapersonal, interpersonal characteristics, community features and existing health policies [<xref rid="pone.0261107.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0261107.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p>
                <p>Our study will adapt the socio-ecological conceptual framework to investigate multilevel and interactive factors such as individual/intrapersonal, interpersonal, community, and health policy level factors that affect adherence to ART (<xref rid="pone.0261107.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). It will explore the different aspects of these factors that act either as barriers or facilitators of adherence to ART.</p>

                <title>Research gap</title>
                <p>Although ample literature on adherence to ART has been available for a while, there remains a dearth of studies relating to the multi-level factors associated with adherence to treatment and processes shaping adherence behaviour, particularly in South Africa. This lends to the lack of understanding of the interplay between the various factors involved at different levels of the treatment taking behaviour of the ART patient.</p>
                <p>In South Africa specifically, there is lack of reported knowledge about the effectiveness and impact of strategies currently employed to promote adherence in people living with HIV (PLHIV) who are taking ART (particularly young patients, males, and those experiencing severe treatment related side effects) [<xref rid="pone.0261107.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0261107.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Unfortunately, there are no quantitative studies of combination ART in South Africa (and even sub-Saharan Africa more generally) that have used a social-ecological perspective or approach. This is despite the understanding that patients on ART require comprehensive adherence strategies and strict viral load monitoring [<xref rid="pone.0261107.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0261107.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p>
                <p>Until 2017, there were minimal related treatment adherence strategies (routine blood monitoring, targeted adherence counselling, and adherence clubs [<xref rid="pone.0261107.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0261107.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]) employed by the South African government [<xref rid="pone.0261107.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. However, effectiveness of these interventions have not been widely reported on. Additionally, the patients’ perspectives seem to be given little consideration in the adherence intervention development and implementation. It is therefore important to assess effectiveness of existing strategies from the perspectives of PLHIV taking ART in order to recommend and develop relevant and acceptable strategies to patients [<xref rid="pone.0261107.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0261107.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. This is evidenced in a study conducted in Malawi which highlighted how critical it is for health programmers to prioritize adherence view points from patients as part of strengthening the clinical monitoring strategy used [<xref rid="pone.0261107.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p>

                <title>Rationale for the study</title>
                <p>Consistent high levels of adherence to HIV medication are important for viral suppression, consequently preventing resistance to ART and progression of the illness [<xref rid="pone.0261107.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. According to the socio-ecological framework, numerous levels of factors affects patients’ adherence to treatment [<xref rid="pone.0261107.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Therefore, a multilevel socio-ecological framework will provide information about the influence of particular risk factors relative to others, or if combined effects of risk factors are additive or related. The socio-ecological framework will serve as the conceptual framework in our study in order to understand factors affecting treatment adherence at different levels and also guide strategies to improve ART adherence.</p>

                  <p>For this study, all records of people with HIV who were ever initiated on ART between 01 April 2004 (the inception of the South African national HIV treatment programme in the public health setting) and 29 February 2020 from the seven public health facilities will be included. Based on the TIER.Net database, about 130 000 adult patients were initiated on first-line and second-line ART in the seven facilities selected in the city of Johannesburg region F.</p>

TIER.Net captures demographic information such as patient age, sex, facility name and contact details and also HIV specific information such as HIV diagnosis date, ART start date, regimen at baseline, ART visit dates, CD4 count, viral load done and viral load suppression The system also records all treatment related information, including ART switch. All these variables will be extracted (see <xref rid="pone.0261107.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Appendix</xref> study codebook). The data will be exported to STATA 15.1 for data cleaning and analysis. Records with missing data will be excluded in the final analysis.

Variables such as age, sex, health facility, baseline regimen, ART start date, baseline CD4 count, most recent CD4 count, ART visit dates, and months on ART will be considered as predictor variables or independent variables. Analysis will include survival analysis which will consider different entry time points into the ART program. Subsequently, patients will not be grouped all together but will be followed up in a 12-month interval when measuring the outcomes (virological failure and lost to follow up).</p>

Data coding will be undertaken using deductive (top down) and inductive approaches (bottom up) [<xref rid="pone.0261107.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. A deductive approach is driven by researchers’ analytic interest in the study, reflecting the broad issues addressed in the interview guide. An inductive approach is used to identify the detailed themes related to the overarching issues that can be identified in the data [<xref rid="pone.0261107.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Thematic analysis will be used, which is a method for identifying, analysing, and reporting patterns (themes) within data [<xref rid="pone.0261107.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0261107.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Transcripts will be read while noting similar topics that will be grouped into major topics or themes. Data will be analysed as transcripts become available shortly after interviews are conducted. This will ensure the early identification of emerging themes and assist in the identification of data saturation. Analysis of the IDIs will follow the phases of thematic analysis which are familiarization, generating initial codes, searching for themes, reviewing themes and interpretation [<xref rid="pone.0261107.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Familiarization (getting grounded into the data collected), will be achieved by reading the transcripts and field notes repeatedly. During the process of generating codes, key emerging ideas and words from the familiarization phase will be recorded from which we will search, identify, and review themes, concepts, categories, and sub-categories. This will be done in keeping with socio-ecological framework, views and experiences that persist from the data. Finally, factors that influence adherence to ART will be identified and grouped into main categories. Analysis will be guided by the codebook which will be developed by the study team post familiarization with the data. There will be multiple independent coders to ensure the reliability of the coding.</p>

Furthermore, we will perform a sensitivity analysis to measure the robustness of our results to the choice of summary statistic and calculated unadjusted risk differences. We will apply a random- effects model to calculate summary RRs and 95% Cl. To test the robustness of the findings, we will re-run the analysis using a fixed effects model.

              <p>The overarching aim of this study is to contribute to knowledge that can provide guidance regarding the barriers and facilitators to adherence for first-line and second-line ART patients and different adherence strategies utilized. Using an integrated multilevel socio-ecological framework, this study will focus on determining the influence of the multiple factors that impact on adherence to ART. In line with socio-ecological frameworks [<xref rid="pone.0261107.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0261107.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] and propositions, the findings from this study will be discussed under four units of analysis: intrapersonal level, interpersonal level, community level and policy level factors.</p>

Intrapersonal level factors such as being age, sex, substance abuse, and comorbidities will be discussed, in line with the existing literature [<xref rid="pone.0261107.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0261107.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>].</p>

                <title>Policy level factors</title>
                <p>The policy-level factors address awareness and influence of public health policies, guidelines, and standards on patients [<xref rid="pone.0261107.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0261107.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. The South African HIV programme has undergone several changes since its implementation in 2004 [<xref rid="pone.0261107.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. This study will evaluate patient understanding/awareness of ART adherence or HIV treatment related health policies, guidelines, and best practices that are followed by health providers when providing health services. Knowledge of ART medicines or regimens (names of ART drugs), definitions, and clinical functions of viral load (knowledge of threshold for virological failure and suppression) and CD4 cell count (understanding of high or low CD4 cell count) will be discussed as themes in assessing individual’s awareness of existing HIV treatment policies and guidelines. Additionally, we will be able to provide recommendations on required changes at the policy level to improve treatment adherence.</p>
                <sec id="sec046">
                  <title>Strengths and limitations</title>
                  <p>To our knowledge this will be the first study using a social-ecological perspective and a convergent parallel mixed method design to report on combination ART in South Africa. Combining quantitative and qualitative data from public health settings, a controlled environment, the patient perspective and evidence from the region will enable us to make recommendations for a comprehensive, acceptable, and appropriate adherence strategy for the country.</p>
                  <p>The study presents a fewlimitations. The study will be conducted in a total of eight health facilities (seven of over 120 health facilities in one South African metropolitan municipality (urban setting) and one facility in a rural setting). Therefore, findings may not be generalizable to other municipalities and districts in South Africa, or to other country settings. Furthermore, although there are efforts to ensure good quality of data by the South African Department of Health, supporting partners and research staff, secondary data are subject to quality issues, due to data inconsistencies and missing data. Other potential predictors of adherence, such as disclosure, stigma, and self-reported adherence, will be assessed through a standard questionnaire. This may lead to reporting bias (memory and social desirability biases). Policy-level factors might not probe for relevant factors due to how this study is designed (with it focus on the individual’s awareness of health policies and guidelines which is insufficient to fully assess policy-level factors).</p>
                  <p>In conclusion, our study will demonstrate how an existing socio-ecological conceptual framework can be used as a tool to provide guidance regarding facilitators and barriers to ART adherence. By populating this framework through secondary data analysis, participant interviews of PLHIV who are taking ART and a systematic review comparing adherence intervention strategies for the chronic conditions, this mixed method study will provide evidence on factors affecting treatment adherence at different socio-ecological levels and guide context-specific intervention strategies to improve ART adherence. We believe that the use of our study results to strengthen adherence intervention will subsequently improve health outcomes and decrease the number of patients switching to complex treatment such as second-line and third-line regimens.</p>

              <p>1. Does the manuscript provide a valid rationale for the proposed study, with clearly identified and justified research questions?</p>
              <p>The research question outlined is expected to address a valid academic problem or topic and contribute to the base of knowledge in the field.</p>

              <p>********** </p>
              <p>2. Is the protocol technically sound and planned in a manner that will lead to a meaningful outcome and allow testing the stated hypotheses?</p>
              <p>The manuscript should describe the methods in sufficient detail to prevent undisclosed flexibility in the experimental procedure or analysis pipeline, including sufficient outcome-neutral conditions (e.g. necessary controls, absence of floor or ceiling effects) to test the proposed hypotheses and a statistical power analysis where applicable. As there may be aspects of the methodology and analysis which can only be refined once the work is undertaken, authors should outline potential assumptions and explicitly describe what aspects of the proposed analyses, if any, are exploratory.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Partly</p>
              <p>********** </p>
              <p>3. Is the methodology feasible and described in sufficient detail to allow the work to be replicable?</p>
              <p>Descriptions of methods and materials in the protocol should be reported in sufficient detail for another researcher to reproduce all experiments and analyses. The protocol should describe the appropriate controls, sample size calculations, and replication needed to ensure that the data are robust and reproducible.</p>

              <p>4. Have the authors described where all data underlying the findings will be made available when the study is complete?</p>
              <p>The <ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/materials-and-software-sharing" ext-link-type="uri">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception, at the time of publication. The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data—e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party—those must be specified.</p>

              <p>Reviewer #1: The authors present a clear and detailed study protocol a complex study on ART adherence. The planned study will address four distinct research questions, each using four distinct analytic approaches including a routine healthcare record analysis, a secondary analysis of clinical trial data, interviews with patients, and a systematic review of literature.</p>
              <p>Given the complexity of the study, it would be helpful to explain why each component is needed and how results from the different components will come together to address the overarching study aims. It would be especially helpful if the researchers could provide an overarching central hypothesis and hypotheses for each of the research questions, and then comment on how the components will come together to address the overarching aims of the study.</p>
              <p>There are a few points of confusion with the conceptual framework and how the study components will use the framework.</p>
              <p>First, the framework and the analysis do not include access-related enablers such as distance to clinic/pharmacy, wait time in clinic/pharmacy, frequency of clinical visits and ART re-supply visits, etc. These have been shown to influence ART medication possession and adherence. How will these be accounted for in the framework and analysis?</p>
              <p>Second, medication reimbursement policies are included in the framework, but will any study participants be exposed to requirements for any form of payment for ART? How will this be evaluated, given that ART medications are available free-of-cost in public sector clinics in South Africa?</p>
              <p>Third, the way in which the researchers plan to elicit policy-level factors seems to be probing not the policy-level factors themselves (which have a direct effect on adherence) but rather an individual’s understanding of health policies and guidelines. These seem to be two different things and it is not clear that one can be substituted for the other. For example, a patient may not be familiar with what the current policies are, or the names of ART medications, but they may still be affected by policies, for example, by being prescribed those medications, whether or not they know their names.</p>
              <p>Finally, in the Introduction, the following claim is unsubstantiated and contrasts with the earlier discussion of numerous extant frameworks for understanding adherence. “Unfortunately, most adherence studies are not guided by any conceptual framework and subsequently are unable to draw adherence strategies from conceptual frameworks of any kind.”</p>
              <p>Appendices are thorough and detailed. Phase 2 codebook is missing a data dictionary/glossary for the variable abbreviations.</p>
              <p>The paper has a number of minor grammatical problems and need a thorough proof-read for sentence structure and punctuation consistency. A few grammatical issues:</p>
              <p>Abstract: open parenthesis before “(using” is never closed.</p>
              <p>Introduction:</p>
              <p>“adherences” – I’m not sure this can be plural</p>
              <p>“However, individual-level factors are only able to report a limited portion of the variability in non-adherence.” – here the subject ‘individual-level factors’ is not doing the verb ‘report.’ Also ‘portion’ → proportion?</p>
              <p>“Good interpersonal relationships between patients and care givers or treatment supporters including healthcare providers, an intimate partner, family members, and friends have been reported as a predictor for good adherence.” – should make ‘a predictor’ plural</p>
              <p>“intrapersonal, interpersonal” – word repeated</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: The protocol submitted by Gumede et al proposes 4 parallel studies to answer questions about barriers and facilitators of adherence and useful interventions to support adherence. This field of research is not new, but conclusive results are not yet available therefore new evidence is welcome.</p>
              <p>Despite the ambitious plan of conducting a four phases study and the use of a predefined conceptual framework, I am not sure that the proposed methodology allows to reach the expectations. In addition there is little explanation about how mixed methods will be applied.</p>
              <p>The research gap is not well documented by an in-depth analysis of the abundant literature available on the subject and falls short of building a strong justification (rational) to the study.</p>
              <p>Research questions: it is not clear to me the difference between the first and the second question if not for the setting (urban vs rural) and the used dataset (cohort vs RCT). Or is it that the first question uses virological failure and the second adherence as main outcome? but in data analysis the selected outcomes are the same.</p>
              <p>Material and methods:</p>
              <p>Phase 1: the possible sample size for this study is very interesting, but the type of dataset is very limited. this should be discussed as well as how missing data will be managed (missing data are very frequent in routinely collected data). Another important point to discuss is the time frame of the analysis. Will all patients be evaluated at the 12-month follow up? adherence being dynamic, possible barriers and facilitators will be very different for someone after 1 year of treatment or after 17 years despite similar characteristics at baseline. how survival bias will be managed? (the less adherent may have died over time) How this point will be managed? Some of the control variable seem not available in the list provided (code-book)</p>
              <p>Phase 2: this study is a secondary analysis of data collected during an RCT. The trial should be presented to understand the population involved and the type of intervention evaluated to allow the reader to understand if the study can answer the question. Nowhere is defined how adherence is measured and the codebook provided is unintelligible to the non initiated to the database. Again the outcome variables are ill defined and do not include adherence (see research question)</p>
              <p>Phase 3: I think this may be the most fruitful phase of the study as it stands on primarily collected data.</p>
              <p>The other comment on this phase is that I feel that even if interviewed patients can provide their perspectives on health system and policy factors, the research to be multilevel should include perspectives from the other "levels" included in the framework, being them service providers or policy makers.</p>
              <p>Phase 4: I do not understand why the study protocol for this phase is provided in supplementary material instead of in the main body of the protocol. I am not experienced in protocols for systematic review and meta-analysis, but my impression is that neither in the main protocol nor in the one provided in the supplementary material the study methodology is very clear. What is the difference between interventions and strategies for the authors? will they compare single adherence support activities or categories of intervention (Cognitive behavioral therapy? incentives? Behavioral skills training? etc)</p>
              <p>Will they consider only clinical trials? how will they manage the quality of the study selected? How will they deal with the different measurement of outcomes? I feel that there is already a lot of work done on adherence and if the methodology of review is not rigorous also in terms of choice of outcome and way of measuring, the study will contribute only to more confusion. on this point I advise to include in the bibliography Lancet HIV 2017; 4: e31–40</p>
              <p>Concerning availability of data after the study, very little is discussed; with a generic "data ca be made available on reasonable request". I understand that more and more it is requested that data are made public on specific repository. this should be discussed.</p>
              <p>Concerning ethical aspects: in this paragraphe it is usually requested to discuss benefices and risks for participants and the measures taken to safeguard confidentiality and privacy of participants. The obtained ethical clearance concerns all the phases of the protocol?</p>
              <p>Discussion: readers are expecting in this chapter the discussion of the strengths and limits of the study, how the study fits with the multilevel socio-ecological framework, and how the parallel mixed method design will enrich interpretation of the data. In fact what is missing is the mixing of the methods: the protocol as presented it is more a multi-studies protocol, not indicating how the mixing of methods will be done.</p>
              <p>Minor comments:</p>
              <p>- update the paragraphe about WHO first line recommandations to include dolutegravir</p>
              <p>- check that all abbreviations are given first in extent</p>
              <p>- it is useful to define a single primary outcome to make the statistics, with the other endpoints being secondary</p>
              <p>- it is useful to give the definitions used for each variable and its categories: in the supplementary material it is not very clear for the study phase 2</p>

              <p>PLOS ONE</p>
              <p>Journal Requirements:</p>
              <p>Please review your reference list to ensure that it is complete and correct. If you have cited papers that have been retracted, please include the rationale for doing so in the manuscript text, or remove these references and replace them with relevant current references. Any changes to the reference list should be mentioned in the rebuttal letter that accompanies your revised manuscript. If you need to cite a retracted article, indicate the article’s retracted status in the References list and also include a citation and full reference for the retraction notice.</p>

              <p>
                <bold>Comments to the Author</bold>
              </p>
              <p>1. Does the manuscript provide a valid rationale for the proposed study, with clearly identified and justified research questions?</p>
              <p>The research question outlined is expected to address a valid academic problem or topic and contribute to the base of knowledge in the field.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: Partly</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
              <p>**********</p>
              <p>2. Is the protocol technically sound and planned in a manner that will lead to a meaningful outcome and allow testing the stated hypotheses?</p>
              <p>The manuscript should describe the methods in sufficient detail to prevent undisclosed flexibility in the experimental procedure or analysis pipeline, including sufficient outcome-neutral conditions (e.g. necessary controls, absence of floor or ceiling effects) to test the proposed hypotheses and a statistical power analysis where applicable. As there may be aspects of the methodology and analysis which can only be refined once the work is undertaken, authors should outline potential assumptions and explicitly describe what aspects of the proposed analyses, if any, are exploratory.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
              <p>**********</p>
              <p>3. Is the methodology feasible and described in sufficient detail to allow the work to be replicable?</p>
              <p>Descriptions of methods and materials in the protocol should be reported in sufficient detail for another researcher to reproduce all experiments and analyses. The protocol should describe the appropriate controls, sample size calculations, and replication needed to ensure that the data are robust and reproducible.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
              <p>**********</p>
              <p>4. Have the authors described where all data underlying the findings will be made available when the study is complete?</p>
              <p>The <ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/materials-and-software-sharing" ext-link-type="uri">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception, at the time of publication. The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data—e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party—those must be specified.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
              <p>**********</p>
              <p>5. Is the manuscript presented in an intelligible fashion and written in standard English?</p>
              <p>PLOS ONE does not copyedit accepted manuscripts, so the language in submitted articles must be clear, correct, and unambiguous. Any typographical or grammatical errors should be corrected at revision, so please note any specific errors here.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
              <p>**********</p>
              <p>6. Review Comments to the Author</p>
              <p>Please use the space provided to explain your answers to the questions above and, if applicable, provide comments about issues authors must address before this protocol can be accepted for publication. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about research or publication ethics.</p>
              <p>You may also provide optional suggestions and comments to authors that they might find helpful in planning their study.</p>
              <p>(Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: Now that I understand this paper is for a student's degree requirement, I recommend that the student iterate the hypotheses with their academic advisor in order to choose hypotheses based on gaps in the field. The hypothesis that "PLHIV who have optimum adherence to ART and remain in care will have better treatment and clinical outcomes" does not appear to be a gap in the field because it is well-known than HIV care and adherence to ART improves clinical outcomes and indeed saves lives of PLHIV.</p>
              <p>The critique regarding inappropriate methods for evaluating policy-level factors was not adequately addressed. I recommend changing the study aims/framing to be evaluating comprehension/awareness of policy, rather than evaluating the effect of policy on patient outcomes, which this study is not currently designed to do.</p>
              <p>Typo: "asherence"</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: The authors have considered reviewers' comments and amended the protocol consequently. The overarching hypothesis is not of the most in need of confirmation, but the final results will be of interest for the global knowledge on adherence and for the local authorities for policy making.</p>
              <p>As the authors state at different sections of their answer, the protocol is for a doctoral thesis and have to comply with different requirements. I congratulate the authors for their major endeavor in realizing all these studies.</p>
              <p>**********</p>
              <p>7.

If published, this will include your full peer review and any attached files.</p>
              <p>If you choose “no”, your identity will remain anonymous but your review may still be made public.</p>
              <p><bold>Do you want your identity to be public for this peer review?</bold> For information about this choice, including consent withdrawal, please see our <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.plos.org/privacy-policy" ext-link-type="uri">Privacy Policy</ext-link>.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: No</p>
