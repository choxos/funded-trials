                <p>There is a gap in knowledge on the affective mechanisms underlying effects of exposure to health misinformation. This study aimed to understand whether discrete emotional responses and perceived relative harm of e-cigarettes versus smoking mediate the effect of exposure to tweets about the harms of e-cigarettes on Twitter and intention to purchase e-cigarettes among adult smokers. We conducted a web-based experiment in November 2019 among 2400 adult smokers who were randomly assigned to view one of four conditions of tweets containing different levels of misinformation. We fitted mediation models using structural equation modeling and bootstrap procedures to assess the indirect effects of exposure to tweets through perceived relative harm of e-cigarettes and six discrete emotions. Our findings support that exposure to tweets about harms of e-cigarettes influence intention to purchase e-cigarettes through perceived relative harm, discrete emotional responses, and serially through emotional responses and perceived relative harm. Feeling worried, hopeful, and happy mediated the effects of condition on intention to purchase e-cigarettes. Feeling scared, worried, angry, and hopeful mediated the effects serially through perceived relative harm. Affective responses and perceived relative harm following exposure to misinformation about e-cigarette harm may mediate the relationship with intention to purchase e-cigarettes among adult smokers.</p>

              <title>1. Introduction</title>
              <p>There is increasing evidence of the proliferation of online misinformation, defined as information that is factually incorrect or misleading [<xref rid="B1-ijerph-18-12347" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], with regards to e-cigarettes on social media including Twitter [<xref rid="B2-ijerph-18-12347" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-ijerph-18-12347" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Misinformation about tobacco products is not a new phenomenon as the tobacco industry has perpetuated falsehoods to downplay and deny harms and addictiveness of combustible cigarettes over decades. However, with the introduction of alternative forms of nicotine delivery such as e-cigarettes, the information landscape surrounding e-cigarette use and relative harms against cigarette smoking has become more complex. For instance, based on the current state of research around e-cigarette harms [<xref rid="B4-ijerph-18-12347" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-ijerph-18-12347" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], misinformation related to e-cigarette harms may include statements that downplay the risks and addictiveness of e-cigarettes [<xref rid="B6-ijerph-18-12347" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Conversely, misinformation about e-cigarette harms may exaggerate the harms of e-cigarettes such as through claims that they are just as or more harmful than smoking combustible cigarettes. In the context of social media, a rising platform for consuming health information, both types of misinformation may be amplified more widely and can influence decisions about the uptake of e-cigarettes versus continuation of smoking combustible cigarettes. </p>
              <p>Current evidence suggests that the short-term health risks of using e-cigarettes are lower than smoking combustible cigarettes [<xref rid="B4-ijerph-18-12347" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-ijerph-18-12347" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Smokers who quit smoking combustible cigarettes and switch to e-cigarettes completely may reduce their risk and exposure to cigarette smoke and smoking-related illnesses [<xref rid="B5-ijerph-18-12347" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B7-ijerph-18-12347" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Yet, recent studies among current smokers reported misperceptions about the relative harm and risks of e-cigarettes are increasing in both the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States (US) [<xref rid="B8-ijerph-18-12347" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Fewer adult smokers in the UK believed that e-cigarettes were less harmful than cigarettes in 2019 (34%) compared with smokers in 2014 (45%) [<xref rid="B5-ijerph-18-12347" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Similar trends were observed among smokers in the US where 26% of smokers believed that e-cigarettes were less harmful than smoking cigarettes in 2018 compared with 29% of smokers in 2017 [<xref rid="B9-ijerph-18-12347" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Conversely, more smokers believed e-cigarettes were much more harmful than smoking cigarettes in 2018 (4%) than in 2017 (2%) [<xref rid="B5-ijerph-18-12347" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. </p>
              <p>Misperceptions about the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared with smoking may deter smokers from using e-cigarettes to help with quitting smoking [<xref rid="B10-ijerph-18-12347" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-ijerph-18-12347" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, we also highlight that e-cigarette use is not completely harmless. Using e-cigarettes is associated with potential health risks due to inhalation of particulate matter, detectable levels of potential carcinogens, and other constituents with known health risks [<xref rid="B4-ijerph-18-12347" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Nevertheless, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledges that smokers can potentially benefit from e-cigarettes if they used them as a complete substitute for combustible cigarettes [<xref rid="B12-ijerph-18-12347" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. </p>
              <p>To better understand the impact of misinformation on social media on population health, Chou and colleagues called for five key areas of research that are currently understudied, one of which included understanding the psychological drivers of misinformation acceptance and sharing [<xref rid="B13-ijerph-18-12347" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. There is currently a research gap in understanding the roles of emotion and cognition in relation to e-cigarette misinformation on behavioral outcomes in the adult population who are smoking cigarettes. We found one study, in the context of infectious disease outbreaks, that reported social media use can significantly increase preventive behaviors via fear and anger and the public’s risk perception [<xref rid="B14-ijerph-18-12347" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Other studies examined the diffusion of emotional content on social media, such as how moral-emotional messaging on social media tends to spread more within ideological groups than between groups [<xref rid="B15-ijerph-18-12347" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Studies have also analyzed the prevalence of emotions in Facebook posts, with one study finding that positive emotions are more prevalent than negative emotions when browsing Facebook [<xref rid="B16-ijerph-18-12347" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and another study explored emotional contagion [<xref rid="B17-ijerph-18-12347" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. There is a need for more evidence of the emotional and cognitive drivers of the influence of misinformation on health behaviors [<xref rid="B18-ijerph-18-12347" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p>
              <p>To address this research gap, we conducted a web-based randomized controlled experiment to assess the effect of exposure to misinformation in the specific context of social media content about e-cigarette harm on Twitter [<xref rid="B19-ijerph-18-12347" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. We aimed to analyze whether emotions and perceived relative harms of e-cigarettes, elicited by exposure to e-cigarette misinformation, influenced adult smokers’ intention to purchase e-cigarettes. In a previously published paper using these data, we found that condition (either viewing tweets that e-cigarettes were just as or more harmful than smoking, e-cigarettes were completely harmless, e-cigarette harms were uncertain, or control tweets about physical activity) was associated with intention to purchase e-cigarettes and perceived relative harm perceptions and was not associated with quit intention [<xref rid="B20-ijerph-18-12347" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. </p>
              <p>We test the hypotheses that emotions and perceived relative harm mediate the influence of exposure to misinformation on social media on smokers’ intention to purchase e-cigarettes. </p>
              <p>We will be exploring this mediation pathway informed by the Appraisal Tendency Framework [<xref rid="B21-ijerph-18-12347" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The Appraisal Tendency Framework provides a nuanced explanation of discrete emotions in shaping perceptions and behavioral outcomes, with each emotion distinctively leading to differential risk perceptions and behavioral consequences (Lerner and Keltner, 2001). Based on previous findings and theoretical frameworks, distinct emotions and perceived risk are expected to be the psychological mechanism through which exposure to misinformation on social media influences e-cigarette related behaviors, such as intention to purchase [<xref rid="B14-ijerph-18-12347" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p>
              <p>Specifically, we propose the following hypotheses to examine how exposure to one of four types of information affects perceived relative harm and intention to purchase e-cigarettes through six distinct emotions: scared, angry, worried, happy, hopeful, and relieved. The four types of exposure to information, or conditions, were: E-cigarettes are as or more harmful than smoking (Condition 1), E-cigarettes are completely harmless (Condition 2), Uncertainty of e-cigarette harm (Condition 3), or information on physical activity (Condition 4). Conditions 1 and 2 represent misinformation about e-cigarette harms. Condition 3 represents tweets that highlight how e-cigarette harms are not yet known. Condition 4 represents the control condition. A summary of our hypotheses is depicted in <xref rid="ijerph-18-12347-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

Briefly, we conducted a keyword search of 1% of tweets relevant to e-cigarette harms on Twitter between January and September 2019 (n = 499 tweets). The sample of tweets was reduced to approximately 20 per condition. We reached consensus on whether each tweet would be suitable as experimental stimuli based on the following: (1) explicit messaging that e-cigarettes were either more harmful than smoking, completely harmless, or uncertain, (2) no mention of youth, (3) no mention of diseases, (4) no profanity, (5) had ‘likes’ or ‘retweets’, (6) no advertising, (7) no pictures, (8) and was publicly available deleted. Next, we chose four tweets for the three conditions: (1) E-cigarettes are as or more harmful than smoking, (2) E-cigarettes are completely harmless, and (3) Uncertainty. It is important to understand the effects of exposure to Tweets that include uncertainty of e-cigarette harms, as media and public discourse around this topic have included uncertainty as evidence-based information around e-cigarette harms have been developing [<xref rid="B20-ijerph-18-12347" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].

They next completed post-test measures of emotional responses and behavioral intention [<xref rid="B20-ijerph-18-12347" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], beliefs of e-cigarette harms, their tobacco use behaviors, media exposure and use, and sociodemographic characteristics. </p>

                <title>2.5. Data Analysis</title>
                <p>We fitted a structural equation model using Stata version 14.0 (College Station, TX, USA) to examine how exposure to one of four types of Tweets affects perceived relative harm and intention to purchase e-cigarettes directly and indirectly through six distinct emotions, as depicted in our hypothesized model in <xref rid="ijerph-18-12347-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>. The model controlled for baseline intention to purchase e-cigarettes and baseline perceived relative harm of e-cigarettes. The control condition (physical activity promotion) was the comparison condition. An initial model with no correlated errors between emotions had poor fit with the data. Based on the model fit and modification indices, we fitted a second model that added correlated errors among the positive emotions and correlated errors among the negative emotions and this improved the fit significantly and retained this as our final model (RMSEA = 0.066, CFI = 0.992, TLI = 0.949, SRMR = 0.026). To address the three mediation hypotheses (through relative harm (H1), emotions (H2), and serial mediation through emotions and relative harm (H3)), we ran the mediation model with a bootstrapping procedure (with 1000 replications). We used the bootstrap approach because this method has high power and does not rely on the assumption that estimates of the indirect effects are normally distributed [<xref rid="B24-ijerph-18-12347" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. We computed the indirect effect coefficients as a product of the coefficients for condition x relative harm (H1), condition x each emotion (H2), and condition x each emotion x relative harm (H3). The bootstrap procedure was used to compute the bias-corrected confidence intervals and we assessed whether each indirect effect was statistically significant by observing if the confidence interval included zero. Listwise deletion was used to deal with values missing on baseline and/or post-test perceived relative harm of e-cigarettes. </p>

              <title>4. Discussion</title>
              <p>Our analysis provided partial support of hypotheses that misinformation effects are mediated through perceived relative harm of e-cigarettes, discrete emotions, and serially through emotions and perceived relative harm. Three of the six discrete emotions mediated the effects of condition on intention to purchase e-cigarettes (worried, hopeful, and happy) while 4 discrete emotions mediated the effects serially through perceived relative harm (scared, worried, angry, and hopeful). Individually, the mediated effects of condition through each emotion and the serial mediation effects were small. However, the cumulative mediated effects through emotions may explain a meaningful proportion of the effects of condition on the intention to purchase e-cigarettes. </p>
              <p>Chou and colleagues described that understanding the psycho-socio-emotional drivers of misinformation acceptance is an important first step for developing successful interventions [<xref rid="B13-ijerph-18-12347" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Simply providing factual information to counter misinformation may prove ineffective if we do not also address the emotions associated with encountering misinformation. Our study findings address a key gap in the literature to help inform the design of successful interventions to disrupt the negative impacts of health misinformation on social media through emotional and cognitive pathways. We learnt that certain emotions and not all of the six emotional responses we evaluated were significant mediators in the association between exposure to misinformation and behavioral intention. </p>
              <p>The Appraisal Tendency Framework distinguishes differences between discrete emotions and cautions grouping emotions into categories such as “negative,” for example with the case of fear and anger, both of which we included in our study [<xref rid="B21-ijerph-18-12347" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. It is important to consider targeting specific emotions when developing interventions or corrective materials to combat misinformation and encourage less risk behavior. For example, prior work using the Appraisal Tendency Framework to understand discrete emotions and smoking found that sadness, but not all negative emotions, heightens addictive behaviors, and posits that messages triggering sadness could unintentionally increase cigarette cravings among smokers [<xref rid="B25-ijerph-18-12347" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Although sadness was not a discrete emotion in our study, this theory and prior research supports why certain emotions in our study were significant but not others. This could explain why in some pathways “worried” was significant, but “scared” was not.</p>
              <p>Our findings will inform future intervention design to target corrective information that addresses specific emotions. For instance, smokers were less likely to purchase e-cigarettes after viewing tweets that e-cigarettes are just as harmful as or more harmful than smoking (relative to those who viewed control tweets) and this difference was partly mediated by reporting they were worried after reading the tweet, potentially preventing people who smoke from reducing their harm if they were to switch to e-cigarettes completely [<xref rid="B12-ijerph-18-12347" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This would suggest that an intervention to mitigate the effect of such misinformation on e-cigarette purchase intentions would also need to consider information that allay smokers’ worry about the relative harms of e-cigarettes compared with smoking.</p>
              <p>We further learnt that while certain emotions and perceived relative harms separately mediated the effects of exposure to conditions on intentions to purchase, there was evidence to support that certain emotions were serial mediators of these effects through perceived relative harms. This finding provides preliminary evidence to suggest that emotions and cognitions are integrally connected in the pathway of misinformation processing and acceptance and that future research should include both affective and cognitive measures when examining misinformation effects on population behaviors. We found support for the serial mediation hypotheses for 4 of the 6 emotions (scared, worried, angry, and hopeful). Future research should further explore the underlying reasons why the activation of these emotions was uniquely associated with processing of e-cigarette harms and potential ways to leverage this evidence in intervention design.</p>
              <p>This study has a few limitations. First, we measured self-reported emotional responses, perceived relative harm, and intention to purchase e-cigarettes. Future work could consider measuring psychophysiological responses, such as skin conductance or heart rate, as measures of emotional arousal to misinformation. Second, we are unable to determine the causal direction between the self-reported measures. For instance, perceived relative harm may conceivably influence one’s emotional response. We further conducted sensitivity analyses reversing the order of perceived relative harm and emotions and this model also had an acceptable model fit. Further research to examine the causal relationships between emotional response and perceived relative harm in the context of misinformation will be needed. The study involved a brief exposure of misinformation stimuli in a single sitting and within an online survey. We were therefore not able to determine effects of repeated exposure in the more naturalistic setting of viewing misinformation within participants’ social media accounts. Future studies could consider replicating this research by measuring the impact of e-cigarette misinformation exposure when participants viewed such information during routine use of social media. Neither did we examine whether the mediating pathways would differ across population subgroups. It is possible that specific emotions and perceived relative harms may be differentially activated and mediate the exposure–intention relationship between populations based on their vulnerability to misinformation (e.g., conspiracy ideation, health literacy, or access to accurate health information) [<xref rid="B13-ijerph-18-12347" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Future research is needed to identify those who are more susceptible to misinformation effects and to examine if the study findings would be replicated in these populations.</p>

              <title>5. Conclusions</title>
              <p>In sum, these findings suggest the importance of considering both affective and psychological responses of health misinformation on social media as mediating mechanisms when assessing the effect of such misinformation among adult smokers. In cases such as exposure to misinformation, it may be easier to intervene on a mediator rather than the exposure to address behavioral intentions to purchase e-cigarettes [<xref rid="B26-ijerph-18-12347" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], especially since it is difficult to regulate the online content people are regularly exposed to. Education and corrective messaging that incorporate specific emotions and address perceived relative harms may reduce the negative impacts of exposure to misinformation of e-cigarettes. These study findings will inform further theorizing of the mechanisms of misinformation effects on behavioral intentions and potential approaches to mitigate adverse effects of exposure to misinformation on social media.</p>

                  <p>Note. The referent condition is Condition 4 (physical activity control tweets). N = 2167 (233 cases were missing either baseline or post-test perceived relative harm). All bolded effects are nonzero. These analyses report the effects of the paths from the first named variable to the last named variable through the mediator, adjusting for baseline intention to purchase e-cigarettes and perceived relative harm of e-cigarettes. The bootstrap procedure was used to compute the bias-corrected 95% confidence intervals.</p>
