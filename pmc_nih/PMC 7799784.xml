                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>HIV–positive women suffer a high burden of mental disorders due in part to gender-based violence (GBV). Comorbid depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are typical psychiatric consequences of GBV. Despite attention to the HIV-GBV syndemic, few HIV clinics offer formal mental healthcare. This problem is acute in sub-Saharan Africa, where the world’s majority of HIV–positive women live and prevalence of GBV is high.</p>

                <sec id="sec002">
                  <title>Methods and findings</title>
                  <p>We conducted a randomized controlled trial at an HIV clinic in Kisumu, Kenya. GBV-affected HIV–positive women with both major depressive disorder (MDD) and PTSD were randomized to 12 sessions of interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) plus treatment as usual (TAU) or Wait List+TAU. Nonspecialists were trained to deliver IPT inside the clinic. After 3 months, participants were reassessed, and those assigned to Wait List+TAU were given IPT. The primary outcomes were diagnosis of MDD and PTSD (Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview) at 3 months. Secondary outcomes included symptom measures of depression and PTSD, intimate partner violence (IPV), and disability. A total of 256 participants enrolled between May 2015 and July 2016. At baseline, the mean age of the women in this study was 37 years; 61% reported physical IPV in the past week; 91% reported 2 or more lifetime traumatic events and monthly income was 18USD. Multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression showed that participants randomized to IPT+TAU had lower odds of MDD (odds ratio [OR] 0.26, 95% CI [0.11 to 0.60], <italic>p</italic> = 0.002) and lower odds of PTSD (OR 0.35, [0.14 to 0.86], <italic>p</italic> = 0.02) than controls. IPT+TAU participants had lower odds of MDD-PTSD comorbidity than controls (OR 0.36, 95% CI [0.15 to 0.90], <italic>p</italic> = 0.03). Linear mixed models were used to assess secondary outcomes: IPT+TAU participants had reduced disability (−6.9 [−12.2, −1.5], <italic>p</italic> = 0.01), and nonsignificantly reduced work absenteeism (−3.35 [−6.83, 0.14], <italic>p</italic> = 0.06); partnered IPT+TAU participants had a reduction of IPV (−2.79 [−5.42, −0.16], <italic>p</italic> = 0.04). Gains were maintained across 6-month follow-up. Treatment group differences were observed only at month 3, the time point at which the groups differed in IPT status (before cross over). Study limitations included 35% attrition inclusive of follow-up assessments, generalizability to populations not in HIV care, and data not collected on TAU resources accessed.</p>

                  <p>IPT for MDD and PTSD delivered by nonspecialists in the context of HIV care yielded significant improvements in HIV–positive women’s mental health, functioning, and GBV (IPV) exposure, compared to controls.</p>

                <p>People living with HIV (PLWH) suffer from mood and anxiety disorders at 3 to 5 times the prevalence of general populations [<xref rid="pmed.1003468.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003468.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Among PLWH, HIV–positive women suffer even higher rates of mental disorders partly because of high rates of intimate partner violence (IPV) against HIV–positive women [<xref rid="pmed.1003468.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Mental disorders affect many gender-based violence (GBV) survivors, typically manifesting as depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [<xref rid="pmed.1003468.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Despite attention to the HIV-GBV syndemic and awareness that depression and PTSD significantly worsen HIV outcomes [<xref rid="pmed.1003468.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003468.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], few HIV clinics have integrated formal mental healthcare.</p>
                <p>This problem is particularly acute in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where most of the world’s HIV–positive women live [<xref rid="pmed.1003468.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and where GBV prevalence is highest [<xref rid="pmed.1003468.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Many HIV–positive women develop depression and PTSD—intensifying the public health urgency is the scarcity of public sector mental healthcare [<xref rid="pmed.1003468.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003468.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Even in general populations of PLWH in SSA, depression and PTSD prevalence are high: A meta-analytic study (<italic>n</italic> = 60,476) of depression among PLWH in SSA found a 36% prevalence [<xref rid="pmed.1003468.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. A study among PLWH in Zimbabwe found that more than half met criteria for probable PTSD [<xref rid="pmed.1003468.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Compounding the problem, low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), including those in SSA, have a 75% treatment gap—75% of individuals in LMICs with common mental disorders, such as depression or PTSD, never receive treatment at all [<xref rid="pmed.1003468.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Indeed, LMICs carry the great preponderance of world mental health disability due to the coupling of high prevalence with this treatment gap.</p>
                <p>More than a decade of research shows that local nonspecialists can provide efficacious, evidence-based psychotherapy for depression and anxiety in LMICs [<xref rid="pmed.1003468.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. More recently, studies in SSA have demonstrated that non-mental health specialists can deliver interventions to decrease common mental disorder symptoms in primary care clinics with high HIV prevalence and improve adherence among PLWH [<xref rid="pmed.1003468.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>–<xref rid="pmed.1003468.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. A recent cluster randomized trial (<italic>n</italic> = 1,473) of nonspecialist group support psychotherapy for major depressive disorder (MDD) among PLWH in Uganda found it more effective than group HIV education [<xref rid="pmed.1003468.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Yet, to our knowledge, no integrated treatment studies exist for formally diagnosed comorbid MDD and PTSD—the most common mental disorders for traumatized individuals—and extremely prevalent among the many HIV+GBV+ women living in SSA.</p>
                <p>Our study site was the Family AIDS Care, Education, and Services (FACES) HIV care and clinical research clinic in Kisumu, Kenya. Funded by the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, FACES is a 12-year collaboration between the University of California San Francisco and the Kenya Medical Research Institute serving more than 140,000 HIV–positive individuals in the Nyanza region of Kenya. This region has the country’s highest adult HIV prevalence, reaching 21% in some areas, and the second highest prevalence of physical and/or sexual violence against women by an intimate partner—51.9% of women aged 15 to 49.</p>

                <title>Mental healthcare needs study</title>
                <p>In 2013, we conducted a qualitative mental healthcare needs assessment of HIV+GBV+ women served by the large, Kisumu FACES clinic, using focus groups and key informant interviews [<xref rid="pmed.1003468.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Respondents included HIV–positive female clinic attendees, clinic HIV care providers, medication adherence counselors, hospital leadership, and community leaders. Most interviewees reported that physical, emotional, and sexual violence against HIV–positive women were common in the region and named depression, anxiety, traumatic stress symptoms, and suicidal thoughts as resulting mental health problems among HIV+GBV+ women. Respondents believed that HIV+GBV+ women needed mental health treatment and the great majority preferred weekly individual counseling at the HIV clinic as a treatment modality. Seeking social support was the dominant method of coping with emotional distress. As previously reported [<xref rid="pmed.1003468.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003468.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], these data informed our selection and adaption of interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) delivered by local non-mental health specialists within the HIV clinic to treat MDD and PTSD symptoms of female HIV+GBV+ clinic attendees.</p>
                <p>Delivering mental healthcare for diagnosed disorders inside the HIV clinic was a clear preference reported in our needs assessment study and has a strong evidence base [<xref rid="pmed.1003468.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003468.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Locating mental healthcare in an HIV clinic has additional advantages in the context of East African culture and structure of HIV clinic operations: Attendees typically consider HIV clinics “safe” locations to receive care for stigmatized diseases. Because both mental disorders and HIV infection are highly stigmatized in SSA, combining care at an HIV clinic may help patients feel safer and more willing to attend treatment. Unlike much regional primary healthcare focusing on one-time visits for acute conditions, East African HIV clinics typically provide patients’ medication monthly, meaning patients return to the clinic regularly when not acutely ill to obtain medication and see HIV clinicians. This characteristic of the HIV clinics is syntonic with mental healthcare—treatment for MDD and PTSD is longitudinal and requires multiple visits when physical illness is non-acute.</p>

                <title>Comparator condition</title>
                <p>Treatment As Usual (TAU) comparators for psychotherapy trials are the subject of controversy [<xref rid="pmed.1003468.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003468.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In choosing a Wait List+TAU control condition for this study, we note that recent psychotherapy trial guidelines advise against creating “de novo” control interventions that are not genuine local clinical alternatives, because the results of such studies would not inform care for target populations [<xref rid="pmed.1003468.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. For studies that examine new effects of an intervention such as IPT for comorbid MDD and PTSD among HIV+GBV+ women, current guidance indicates that stakeholder interests are best served by allowing the intervention to demonstrate its effects without an overly formidable comparator that could prevent further investigation of a beneficial treatment [<xref rid="pmed.1003468.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003468.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Avoiding this potential harm to stakeholders is particularly important when working in a low-resource setting such as western Kenya where public sector treatment access is scarce. We note that selection of Wait List+TAU as our comparator condition does lead to other risks, such as lack of control over the treatment received in the Wait List+TAU group and related threats to internal validity [<xref rid="pmed.1003468.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In this case, we concluded that these and other sacrifices were worth the potential stakeholder gain achieved through the development of useful treatment for the most common mental disorders among HIV+GBV+ women in Kenya.</p>

                <title>Objective</title>
                <p>The study aimed to test a sustainable, scalable model for treating comorbid MDD and PTSD among GBV-affected HIV–positive women. We conducted a randomized, effectiveness-implementation type I trial of IPT plus TAU delivered by nonspecialists in an HIV clinic compared to Wait List+TAU for care-engaged HIV–positive women (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1003468.g001">Fig 1</xref> and study design, below; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1003468.s001">S1 Table</xref>). Effectiveness-implementation hybrid studies have developed over the past decade to collect both clinical and implementation data simultaneously. The goal of these designs is to speed translation of positive findings toward scale up and benefit to public health by collecting implementation data earlier in the pipeline than traditionally done, allowing for faster recognition of scalable (and not scalable) interventions [<xref rid="pmed.1003468.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003468.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. “Type I” effectiveness-implementation hybrid designs (as with this study) emphasize effectiveness outcomes, while collecting initial data on implementation parameters [<xref rid="pmed.1003468.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p>

                </fig>
                <p>After completing baseline assessments on all participants, IPT was offered to the IPT+TAU group. After the 3-month, posttreatment assessment of those initially assigned to IPT, the Wait List+TAU group was offered IPT. We hypothesized IPT+TAU would be more effective than Wait List+TAU for remission of MDD and PTSD at month 3. Assessments were repeated at months 6 and 9 to evaluate IPT effect on the Wait List+TAU group and maintenance of gains for the IPT+TAU group. Given effectiveness-implementation design, our primary outcome of interest was remission (absence of disease)—the usual goal of “real-life” psychiatric practice.</p>

                <p>As detailed in the published study protocol [<xref rid="pmed.1003468.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], the effectiveness aspect of the study included a mental health clinical core, neurocognitive testing, HIV treatment adherence, and HIV viral load on a participant subsample, while the implementation domains were assessed using qualitative analyses of acceptability and appropriateness, as well as quantitative measures of feasibility, treatment fidelity and economic productivity, and treatment cost-benefit analyses. Given the breadth of outcome data, we are not able to report all the study’s findings with adequate discussion here. Therefore, we focus on the mental health clinical core, which included the study’s primary outcomes and key secondary outcomes, as well as implementation outcomes with direct relevance to the intervention—feasibility and fidelity.</p>

                  <p>IPT is a time-limited psychotherapy, often delivered as 12 weekly sessions, developed in the 1970s by Gerald Klerman and Myrna Weissman to treat MDD by addressing interpersonal difficulties and crises [<xref rid="pmed.1003468.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In Euro America, IPT is a first-line MDD treatment and showed better results for depressed HIV–positive patients than cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or supportive psychotherapy [<xref rid="pmed.1003468.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. It demonstrated non-inferiority to exposure-based psychotherapy for PTSD, with advantages over prolonged exposure for patients with comorbid MDD [<xref rid="pmed.1003468.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. IPT has a history of strong efficacy when delivered by nonspecialists in East African populations (e.g., [<xref rid="pmed.1003468.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]). IPT helps patients improve social functioning and manage interpersonal crises characterized as grief, role dispute, or role transition, by building social skills and gathering social support (see details in our prior publications) [<xref rid="pmed.1003468.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The group randomized to IPT+TAU began weekly sessions after their baseline evaluation and continued until completing 12 IPT sessions. Participants could miss and make up 2 IPT sessions if they scheduled the make-up within 1 week of the missed session. Kenyan December holidays required 2 to 4 week breaks in IPT, depending on participants’ travel. The 3-month assessment was completed at posttreatment, after 12 sessions of IPT were complete; the 24-week assessment occurred after the Wait List+TAU group completed IPT. Some posttreatment assessments occurred at a different time than others to adjust for missed and rescheduled sessions. IPT was conducted in private rooms adjacent to the HIV clinic. Sessions lasted approximately 60 minutes and the same therapist treated the participant throughout. Details of IPT used in the MIND study are described in a published case history from the study [<xref rid="pmed.1003468.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p>

                  <p>Prospective IPT therapists were recruited with local advertisement by FACES. The local therapists trained to deliver IPT in this study needed only to have completed high school. All were women who underwent a 10-day training designed by study team IPT experts, followed by supervised practice cases. During the practice phase, each therapist received weekly telephone supervision from 1 of 2 psychiatrists expert in IPT (SMM and LO). Therapists were scored on 10 key aspects of delivering IPT, according to the IPT phase in which they were working, using a 10-point Likert scale. Only therapists consistently scoring 9 to 10 by the end of their IPT case progressed to work with enrolled study participants. Therapists not meeting this criterion treated an additional 1 to 2 pilot IPT cases and did not treat study participants unless they achieved competency (defined as scores of ≥9).</p>
                  <p>During the trial, IPT therapists continued weekly individual telephone supervision and IPT protocol adherence rating by the expert psychiatrists. IPT adherence was scored based on treatment phase (initial, formulation, middle, and termination). Adherence monitoring included assessment for use of “off-protocol” techniques and specifically evaluated for use of CBT and/or exposure therapy. A train-the-trainer model provided selected IPT therapists with training as on-site peer supervisors. These peer supervisors ran weekly, on-site IPT group supervision and adherence monitoring conducted as an adjunct to ongoing weekly telephone supervision.</p>

These services and providers were available for access as needed. The TAU condition provided no explicit, evidence-based mental health treatment, although the social support implicit in each service is known to benefit mental health. While HIV clinicians can prescribe antidepressant medication, clinic attendees are rarely assessed or treated for mental disorders.

Demographics (age, marital status, ethnic group, ART medications, other mental health treatment, and ART counseling received) and the trauma history questionnaire were administered at baseline; all other measures were assessed at baseline, 12 weeks, 24 weeks, and 36 weeks. The week 12 assessment took place after the IPT+TAU participants completed IPT and before the Wait List+TAU group started IPT. The week 24 assessment took place after the Wait List-TAU group had completed IPT. A team of study evaluators blinded to group assignment conducted all assessments. Given variable literacy in the region, all measures were translated into the local Dhuluo and Kisawhili languages at the lowest expected adult education level and were read to participants. The study instruments have been validated in diverse populations. Additional psychometric testing and validation exceeded the study scope and budget.</p>

While this effect size is large, it is consistent with other studies of evidence-based psychotherapy in LMICs [<xref rid="pmed.1003468.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>–<xref rid="pmed.1003468.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].

Recognizing the migration patterns of the study population and the study requirement to complete 4 assessments across 36 weeks, with substantial time investment at each assessment, we allowed for approximately 20% attrition at each assessment point and selected a sample size of 100. Because we collected venous blood samples for HIV viral load testing (data in preparation) in a subgroup of participants, which required multiple venipunctures, and fear of venipuncture can raise attrition, we increased our sample size by 50% per assessment point, estimating the need to screen approximately 380 participants to reach our recruitment goal.</p>

Using an intent-to-treat analysis, MDD and PTSD MINI scores were grouped as binary variables to indicate positive versus negative status at each assessment visit, with continuous measures for the BDI and PCL. At each assessment visit, BDI and PCL were analyzed as numerical scores. Additional baseline measures included: Alcohol Use (AUDIT), Drug Use (DAST), lifetime traumatic events (THQ), IPV in past week among partnered participants (CTS2), disability (WHODAS), days in the past month partially or completely unable to work, school fees paid on time in past month for those with school-aged children, and monthly income. We included baseline values in all analyses (as opposed to covariate) and used all relevant time points: baseline through end of follow for numeric, and month 3 through end of follow for binary outcomes that were 100% at baseline (MDD and PTSD) and were therefore fixed. We report the frequency of non-missing data out of the total number of participants in each group for each measure. To evaluate baseline between-group comparability, patient data were stratified by randomization group and tested for between-group differences. Similarly, each treatment group was stratified by participants who completed and did not complete the study and tested for baseline characteristic differences. The proportion of participants that did not complete the study at the 3-month assessment time point (IPT + TAU group) or at the 6-month assessment time point (TAU group) are reported, as well as the overall proportion of participants who did not complete each assessment. Continuous variables were described by means and compared by <italic>t</italic> tests and categorical variables were compared by chi-squared or Fisher exact tests.

The usual BDI cut score for likely clinical depression is 16; thus, the average group BDI scores correspond to moderate depressive symptoms and corroborate the diagnosis of MDD on the MINI. At baseline, both randomized groups had high mean PTSD symptoms on the PCL-C, the IPT+TAU group averaged 56.6 and the Wait List+TAU group 56.1, consistent with PTSD diagnosis (a validated cut score is 30).</p>

For the outcome of MDD, statistical significance was very robust to the missing data with only a single allocation not being statistically significant (allocating the missing Wait List+TAU to remission and none of the 13 in the IPT+TAU group to remission); even that allocation had a borderline <italic>p</italic>-value of 0.068. The analyses for PTSD and the combined MDD and PTSD outcomes were somewhat less robust. Using the observed rates, we would expect about a 50% chance of the Wait List+TAU missing data to be a remission and between 10 and 11 of the IPT+TAU group to achieve remission. If 8 or fewer of the IPT+TAU with missing data were allocated to be remitters, then statistical significance was lost.</p>

                  <p>We prespecified a feasibility benchmark of recruiting 220 participants by screening 300, or 36% more than enrolled. With the increased sample size that was used in the actual study (256), we screened 382 prospective participants, which is 50% more than enrolled—we had to screen more than we planned in order to obtain our target enrollment. Our next feasibility benchmark stated that completers would attend 80% or more of their IPT sessions. This benchmark was achieved. We expected attrition to be 50 participants or more with a sample size of 220. Using the same ratio, we would expect attrition of 58 with our actual sample size of 256. Our attrition was 90, 55% higher than expected. Last, we included a feasibility measure in regards to therapist attrition—the study would be considered feasible if fewer than one-half of therapists left the study. This benchmark was met—no therapists left the study.</p>

                  <p>IPT adherence was scored using a 10-point Likert scale assessing adherence in each of the 3 IPT phases. A score of “0” indicated “not at all” adherent, and “10” indicated “fully adherent.” Sessions were considered adherent to the IPT protocol if they averaged a score of 5 (moderate adherence) or higher and did not employ off-protocol interventions [<xref rid="pmed.1003468.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. All the study IPT sessions scored higher than 5 on adherence assessments. Of note, while audio sessions were recorded, due to unexpected expenses, the budget did not allow for a randomized 20% of sessions to be independently evaluated as planned. However, we initiated local peer IPT supervision as an adjunct to and countercheck of adherence (see “Interventions” for details).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>This study found IPT highly effective for comorbid MDD and PTSD among HIV–positive women affected by GBV, with high rates of remission, and clinically significant decrease of symptom severity for both disorders, with all improvements sustained over 6-month follow-up. Interestingly, the Wait List-TAU group decreased in MDD, PTSD, and corresponding symptoms between baseline and month 3, prior to receipt of IPT. This could be due to a number of reasons related to the study’s setting and population: (1) for many of these women, this study was the first time they had ever been asked about their emotions and experiences with GBV by a sympathetic and respectful person—this, alone, could have been cathartic; and (2) as mentioned above, almost none of these women had ever received any formal mental health care—the hope that was instilled by their enrollment in the study and upcoming IPT could have improved their mental health even before treatment started. The MDD outcome was robust to missing data analyses, while the PTSD outcome was somewhat less so. In secondary outcome analyses, IPT decreased health-related disability and apparently improved employment outcomes for IPT+TAU participants relative to Wait List+TAU controls. IPT was also associated with decrease in physical IPV for the study’s subset of partnered participants. Overall, the study showed that IPT effectiveness is strong in a “real-world” setting with delivery by local nonspecialists and integrated within existing HIV clinic operations.</p>
              <p>In regard to implementation outcomes, IPT adherence was strong and local peer IPT supervision group was feasible. Despite fairly rigorous prespecified feasibility benchmarks, the study met 2 of the 4, missing the screening/enrollment window slightly and experiencing higher than expected attrition (see Limitations). As described, the study provided 300ksh (approximately 3USD) to participants to cover travel costs, given the distance they traveled for weekly IPT sessions. In our view, this is not a limitation of the study, but rather an important consideration for implementation of psychotherapy in LMICs. We look forward to calculating these transport costs as part of the IPT intervention with our forthcoming economic analyses.</p>
              <p>The results contribute to our understanding of psychotherapy treatment outcomes among people living with HIV by showing that evidence-based IPT for depression and PTSD among HIV+GBV+ women can be feasibly integrated with HIV care and delivered in a patient-preferred setting with excellent mental health outcomes. Despite awareness of a high prevalence of depression among PLWH in East Africa, to our knowledge, this is one of fewer than 15 studies of depression treatment integrated with HIV care across SSA, the only study of integrated treatment for comorbid depression and trauma-related disorders, and the only study of mental health treatment for the large, heavily affected group of HIV+GBV+ women in SSA. While this study used a hybrid effectiveness-implementation design type I weighted toward evaluation of effectiveness outcomes, we used scalable strategies, including integration with existing HIV care and use of a readily available workforce of nonspecialists. Given the extensive network of similar HIV clinics across East Africa, this study provides support disseminating this scalable delivery setting and workforce for treating MDD and PTSD among care-engaged HIV+GBV+ women. A notable exception is our IPT adherence monitoring system, which included telephone supervision and adherence scoring of IPT sessions by a psychiatrist and IPT expert in Kenya or US (LO and SMM). Investigators sought to address this issue by initiating on-site group supervision during the study (supplementing ongoing individual supervision). The system worked well, and local group supervision had primarily replaced the need for investigator supervision of IPT by the time of study conclusion.</p>
              <p>In the setting of HIV clinical care, prior research shows that depression and PTSD have strong associations with decreased ART adherence and HIV treatment attrition [<xref rid="pmed.1003468.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003468.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. While the women in our study were engaged in HIV care, such research suggests that they faced elevated risk of ART default or attrition from care because of their psychiatric diagnoses. In this era of aggressive progress toward HIV epidemic control, we cannot afford to miss high-risk cases by failing to apply evidence-based, cost-effective solutions, such as the intervention in this study.</p>

                <title>Scaling East African mental healthcare for HIV–positive women affected by gender-based violence</title>
                <p>The HIV–positive women in this study were engaged in care at one of many SSA HIV clinics supported by The President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). In 2019, PEPFAR supported HIV care for an estimated 9.3 million women and girls. This is not only a huge number of treatment-engaged individuals, but an easy starting point in the delivery of efficient, effective mental healthcare for HIV–positive women with high GBV prevalence and associated depression and trauma disorders. HIV+GBV+ women engaged in ongoing care demonstrate courage and motivation by seeking HIV treatment for a heavily stigmatized disease, and they return regularly to the clinic when they are typically in a non-acute state of health. For HIV+GBV+ women with depression or trauma-related disorders, these characteristics make them ideal candidates for successful mental health treatment. Even if scaling up treatment for depression and PTSD treatment for HIV+ women affected by GBV in SSA were limited to those already engaged in HIV care—the easiest group to access—the public health impact would be substantial.</p>

              <title>Limitations</title>
              <p>This study had a relatively high rate of attrition. Approximately 29% of those who left the study cited relocation or transfer of HIV care as the reason for dropout. This might reflect the documented high prevalence of migration among HIV–positive women in SSA [<xref rid="pmed.1003468.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Another 27% of those who left the study reportedly could not attend sessions due to time constraints, commute, or work conflict. The large catchment area of the health center suggests that weekly IPT could have been an overly burdensome time commitment, particularly for women who lived far from the health center. While the primary outcomes and GBV exposure did not differ between completers and non-completers at baseline, it is possible that some participants responded more quickly than others, leading to premature study discontinuation among healthier participants, as their disability lifted and they pursued work opportunities, which often involve local migration. Attrition of healthier participants in the IPT group would bias toward the null hypothesis. There was greater attrition from the IPT+TAU group than the Wait List+TAU group between baseline and 3 months. This could reflect a degree of unacceptability of IPT for some participants.</p>
              <p>We intentionally restricted our study sample to women who were already engaged in HIV care. As such individuals are more likely to be motivated for treatment, IPT uptake may have been higher in our study than it would be for patients not yet engaged in HIV care. However, considering the many women with MDD and PTSD currently enrolled in HIV care, beginning scale up with this treatment-engaged group in urgent need of mental healthcare is a logical starting point that could prevent attrition from care and associated resources required to reengage.</p>
              <p>The meaning of TAU differs across studies. Here it refers to the usual psychosocial resources available through the FACES clinic, as described above. The study did not collect data on which TAU resources were accessed by the participants and therefore could not adjust for their effect. Given that TAU was available to all participants in both groups throughout the study and the randomized design, it is unlikely to have a significant effect on study results for IPT effect.</p>
              <p>The study was not able to determine why participants who received IPT+TAU were less likely to be in a violent intimate partnership, compared with controls. We note that the percentage of study participants who reported having intimate partners decreased from 43% at baseline to 16% at the final, 9-month assessment. If those in violent relationships were more likely to leave partners or leave the study, this could bias results toward decreased violence among those who completed the study. In addition, study participants experiencing physical IPV might have been more likely to leave IPT+TAU, which could account for the apparent effect of IPT on violence reduction. However, if study participants experiencing physical IPV were more likely to leave the study, then, given (1) the randomized design; (2) comparable baseline partner violence between IPT+TAU and Wait List-TAU (<xref rid="pmed.1003468.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>); and (3) comparable baseline partner violence between IPT+TAU completers and non-completers (appendix), we would not expect to find a significant effect of IPT+TAU on violence at 3 months. If study participants experiencing physical IPV were more likely to leave IPT+TAU (versus Wait List-TAU), we would not expect our finding of continued reduction of violence after IPT treatments (e.g., between months 6 and 9).</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>This study in western Kenya shows that local nonspecialists with high school–level education can be trained to successfully deliver IPT integrated with HIV clinic operations for MDD and PTSD among HIV+ women affected by GBV, with sustained benefit for recipients. While our model does not require prior mental health training for IPT providers, IPT training and practice with multiple levels of ongoing supervision did support the intervention. This type of training collaboration between mental health professionals and nonspecialists with cascading levels of supervision appears to be a promising strategy for scale up of care that might enlist national mental health professionals in leadership for scale up.</p>

              </p>
              <p>Dear Dr. Meffert,</p>
              <p>Thank you very much for submitting your manuscript "Effectiveness of Interpersonal Psychotherapy Delivered by Non-Specialists for Depression and Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Among Kenyan HIV-Positive Women Affected by Gender-based Violence" (PMEDICINE-D-20-02128R1) for consideration at PLOS Medicine. </p>
              <p>Your paper was evaluated by an academic editor with relevant expertise, and sent to independent reviewers, including a statistical reviewer. The reviews are appended at the bottom of this email and any accompanying reviewer attachments can be seen via the link below:</p>
              <p>[LINK]</p>
              <p>In light of these reviews, we will not be able to accept the manuscript for publication in the journal in its current form, but we would like to invite you to submit a revised version that addresses the reviewers' and editors' comments fully. You will appreciate that we cannot make a decision about publication until we have seen the revised manuscript and your response, and we expect to seek re-review by one or more of the reviewers. </p>
              <p>In revising the manuscript for further consideration, your revisions should address the specific points made by each reviewer and the editors. Please also check the guidelines for revised papers at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/revising-your-manuscript">http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/revising-your-manuscript</ext-link> for any that apply to your paper. In your rebuttal letter you should indicate your response to the reviewers' and editors' comments, the changes you have made in the manuscript, and include either an excerpt of the revised text or the location (eg: page and line number) where each change can be found. Please submit a clean version of the paper as the main article file; a version with changes marked should be uploaded as a marked up manuscript.</p>
              <p>In addition, we request that you upload any figures associated with your paper as individual TIF or EPS files with 300dpi resolution at resubmission; please read our figure guidelines for more information on our requirements: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/figures">http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/figures</ext-link>.

For data residing with a third party, authors are required to provide instructions with contact information for obtaining the data. PLOS journals do not allow statements supported by "data not shown" or "unpublished results." For such statements, authors must provide supporting data or cite public sources that include it. </p>
              <p>Please let me know if you have any questions. Otherwise, we look forward to receiving your revised manuscript in due course. </p>
              <p>Sincerely,</p>
              <p>Richard Turner, PhD</p>

              <p>
                <email>rturner@plos.org</email>
              </p>
              <p>-----------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>Requests from the editors:</p>
              <p>To your title, please add a study descriptor following a colon, e.g., "...: a randomized controlled trial".</p>
              <p>Please combine the "Methods" and "findings" section of your abstract, in accordance with journal style, and add a new final sentence to the new combined subsection quoting 2-3 of the study's main limitations. </p>
              <p>After the abstract, we will need to ask you to add a new and accessible "author summary" section in non-identical prose. You may find it helpful to consult one or two recent research papers published in PLOS Medicine to get a sense of the preferred style. </p>
              <p>To your methods section, please add some additional detail on study ethics approvals, e.g., date of approval and application numbers. Please state whether consent was written or verbal, and whether informed. </p>
              <p>Please remove the results of baseline statistical tests from table 1.</p>
              <p>Please remove the statement about data sharing from the end of the main text - this information will appear in the article metadata in the event of publication, via entries in the submission form. Please also consult our policy on data sharing - a non-author contact for inquiries about access to study data will be needed (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/data-availability">https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/data-availability</ext-link>). </p>
              <p>Please make that "sub-Saharan Africa" throughout. </p>
              <p>Please state exact p values or "p&lt;0.001".</p>
              <p>Throughout the text, please adapt reference call-outs to the following style: "... general population [1,2]." (i.e., no spaces within the square brackets). </p>
              <p>In your reference list, please convert italics into plain text. Where appropriate, 6 author names should be listed rather than 3, followed by "et al.".</p>
              <p>Please add a completed CONSORT checklist as a supplementary document, referred to in your methods section (e.g., "See S1_CONSORT_Checklist"). In the checklist, individual items should be referred to by section (e.g., "Methods") and paragraph number rather than by line or page numbers, as the latter generally change in the event of publication. </p>
              <p>Comments from the reviewers:</p>
              <p>*** Reviewer #1: </p>
              <p>This review relates to manuscript PMEDICINE-D-20-02128 about Effectiveness of Interpersonal Psychotherapy Delivered by Non-Specialists for Depression and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Among Kenyan HIV-Positive Women Affected by Gender-based Violence.</p>
              <p>I have listed my comments, major or minor, below.</p>
              <p>* Major comments:</p>
              <p>o I believe the flow of the manuscript could be improved. In particular, a lot of information included in the "Study design" section consists in background information. These two sections need to be reorganised. </p>
              <p>o I am concerned about potential multiplicity issues due to the number of primary outcomes. It is also unclear which outcomes should be considered primary. The outcome section list 4 'primary outcomes'. The authors also write that they used both continuous and dichotomous versions of MDD and PTSD. In other places only MDD and PTSD are listed as the two primary outcomes. Please clarify as well as discuss the potential multiplicity issue including how one might control the risk of false-positive results in light of the number of tests conducted.</p>
              <p>o Randomization: A colored Excel list was used as the randomisation sequence. If the study coordinator performing the randomisation has access to the Excel file, s/he was able to identify upcoming allocations. This lack of concealment comes with a potential high-risk of bias. Please clarify whether future allocations were concealed and if measures were in place to ensure no preferential allocation (e.g. skipping an allocation to 'force' a participant to be allocated to a specific group).</p>
              <p>o Given the substantial amount of participants with missing outcome data, I would suggest some sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of the findings under various assumptions about the missing data. For example, one could use a range of simple imputations to determine the tipping point, or the point at which the results are no longer consistent with the main (non-imputed) findings. Please refer to the following paper for example: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12483769/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12483769/</ext-link></p>
              <p>o I would strongly encourage all pre-specified study outcomes to be reported in this main manuscript. I would expect to see at least all primary and secondary outcomes as well as details of the intervention delivery and adherence. I believe a decision not to report all outcomes should be reported by strong justification.</p>
              <p>o Please attach the study protocol and/or statistical analysis plan as a supplement. The statistical analysis plan should clearly indicate which analyses were pre-specified vs post-hoc, i.e. decided after seeing unblinded results</p>
              <p>* Minor comments:</p>
              <p>o Abstract: please indicate the specific setting (e.g. city + country)</p>
              <p>o Abstract: please indicate the timing corresponding to the primary outcome results e.g. 3 months</p>
              <p>o Abstract: please correct typo in confidence interval for OR (0.0.60)</p>
              <p>o Objective section: please clarify what a "Type I trial" is. </p>
              <p>o Objective section: The authors write that "The diversity of secondary study outcomes exceeds the scope of a single manuscript". It may indeed be difficult to report all outcomes in a single manuscript; however, I would like to see a complete list of all pre-specified study outcomes listed accompanied by a clear indication of which ones are reported in the current manuscript. According to the ClinicalTrial.gov record, there is only a limited number of outcomes measures in which case I believe all should be reported in the current paper.</p>
              <p>o Please consider adding details of the intervention including its various components. This could be included as a supplement.</p>
              <p>o Methods: consider moving the sub-section labelled "HIV clinic setting" to the background section.</p>
              <p>o Methods, study design: the first paragraph repeats the objective sub-section. Please remove the repeated information from the objective sub-section and consolidate. I would suggest that the second paragraph (starting with "Wait List-TAU comparators for psychotherapy…") be moved to the background section.</p>
              <p>o Sample size: I note that the sample size was calculated to detect an effect size (Cohen's d) of 0.8 which is very large. Apart from the earlier study (reference 41) used as a reference, are there other sources supporting such a large effect?</p>
              <p>o Multivariate statistics: please add details about the main model. In particular, please clarify the multilevel components including what were the level(s) and how the structure (correlations) were accounted for. Please explicitly list all fixed and random effects included in the model. Was the baseline value of the outcome (MDD or PTSD) included as a covariate?</p>
              <p>o Please indicate the statistical software(s) used for the analyses</p>
              <p>o Please include a table comparing baseline characteristics of completers vs non-completers in the online supplement.</p>
              <p>o When reporting the effect of the intervention on outcomes, the authors talk about significant group by time interaction at specific timepoints. For example: "the only significant group by time interaction for MDD was at month three". In this case, it is not the interaction that is significant but the difference between intervention arms at a specific timepoint. The interaction measures the overall consistency of the intervention effect across the 3 timepoints. Please amend accordingly.</p>
              <p>o Please describe adherence to the intervention. For example, duration of the sessions, proportions attending each session, etc.</p>
              <p>o When reporting secondary outcomes (disability and absenteeism), the authors mention "controlling for the effect of time..". Please clarify what this means. Is this using a different model than for the primary outcome(s)?</p>

              <p>*** Reviewer #2: </p>
              <p>Dear Authors</p>
              <p>Thank you for the opportunity to review this manuscript reporting individually randomized 2-arm trial of an interpersonal psychotherapy for HIV-GBV+ women with co-morbid depression and PTSD in a low resource setting. Areas for improvement include explicitly reporting data as required by the CONSORT statement. For example, explicitly reporting the randomization ratio. I suggest the authors to revise the manuscript against the CONSORT checklist, add missing information and submit revised manuscript alongside completed CONSORT checklist. </p>
              <p>I have never come across "a hybrid effectiveness-implementation design type I weighted toward evaluation of effectiveness outcomes". To my view, this study is a standard individually randomized 2-arm trial. If the authors insist on the hybrid design, this choice should be justified and supported by relevant references.</p>
              <p>The follow up period of 6 months for the intervention arm and 3 months for the control arm is not enough to prove the sustainability of the intervention effect. Authors' claims about sustainable effect should be toned down. </p>
              <p>p. 13. It seems that some text slipped during formatting. Paragraph under Table 1 should be under Baseline Univariate Statistics not under Non-Completer Analyses.</p>
              <p>*** Reviewer #3: </p>
              <p>This study is an important contribution to the literature as it describes the results of a fully-powered RCT effectiveness-implementation hybrid design to test the effectiveness of IPT in addressing comorbid MDD and PTSD in GBV-affected HIV-positive women in Kenya, which is a highly understudied population. Moreover, the providers were non-specialists and treatment was delivered in HIV clinics, which makes it a novel and potentially more sustainable and scale-able intervention. </p>
              <p>Overall the manuscript is quite strong. I have listed comments below that may further strengthen this article.</p>
              <p>The authors chose to focus exclusively on improvement of mental health outcomes in the manuscript, but the study is framed specifically as an "effectiveness-implementation" trial. It would have been helpful to learn more about the implementation outcomes of the trial, in addition to changes in the mental health outcomes. For example, information on feasibility, fidelity, acceptability, satisfaction, and barriers and facilitators to treatment delivery would have been useful in understanding and interpreting the outcomes.</p>
              <p>Similarly, although the intervention specifically targets HIV+ women who have experienced GBV, changes in GBV and HIV adherence/viral load were not reported. The authors note that they have space limitations, but it would be helpful for the reader to have these outcomes reported.</p>
              <p>PARTICIPANTS: The authors note that participants were diagnosed using the MINI 5.0. Who conducted the assessments? What was their training? Were women currently experiencing GBV, and if so, how was risk of harm addressed during the study? Additionally, how were exclusion criteria of severe thought and mood disorder and current drug and alcohol dependence assessed and addressed? By whom? Did the participants receive any compensation for assessments, treatment visits, or transportation costs?</p>
              <p>RECRUITMENT. The authors state that "Patients were recruited through FACES HIV provider referral and self-referral following informational talks to FACES patients in the HIV clinic check-in and waiting areas. Consecutive HIV-positive women were consented and screened for inclusion from May 2015-July 2016." How many women were referred by providers out of the total case load? What criteria did providers use to determine whether referral was appropriate? How many women were given the informational talks? How many self-referred? Of the provider vs. self-referrals, how many met inclusion and exclusion criteria?</p>
              <p>How many prospective IPT therapists applied and how many went on to meet the requirements of being a therapist?</p>
              <p>RESULTS. Participants in the intervention group had significantly greater symptom and functional improvement compared to the TAU group. However, the TAU group also showed improvements on depression, PTSD, and functional impairment outcomes. The improvement is so marked that participants in TAU had PCL scores that were below the clinical cut-point before they received the intervention. This improvement in symptom change is particularly notable given that all participants met MINI criteria for MDD and PTSD at baseline. What do you think may be accounting for such improvement in the TAU condition?</p>
              <p>SMALL Typos:</p>
              <p>"At each assessment visit, BID and PCL were analyzed as numerical scores". Should be BDI</p>
              <p>"At month three, LFTU was higher in the IPT+TAU group than the Wait List+TAU (27.6% (34/123) vs. 12% (16/133), p&lt;0.01)." LFTU is not defined.</p>

              <p>------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>Requests from Editors:</p>
              <p>Please revisit your data statements, which seem inconsistent - likely the answer to the first query should be "No - there are some restrictions". Please substitute a non-author contact for readers interested in inquiring about access to study data, so as to comply with our data policy (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/data-availability">https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/data-availability</ext-link>).</p>
              <p>Please add a "Secondary outcomes included ..." sentence early in the "Methods and findings" subsection of your abstract.</p>
              <p>Please quote aggregate demographic details for study participants in your abstract.</p>
              <p>We ask you to revisit the presentation of your findings in the abstract. For example, to improve clarity "... had 74% lower odds of MDD (0.256, 95% CI [0.11 to 0.60], p=0.0020 ..." should be amended to "... had lower odds of MDD (odds ratio [OR] 0.256, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.60, p=0.002) and PTSD (0.35, 0.14 to 0.86, p=0.02) ...". </p>
              <p>As you know, the risk of type I error is likely to be increased in the determination of secondary outcome findings. Therefore, please use an element of caution in presenting these findings, e.g., "...IPT+TAU participants had an apparent reduction in disability ...". Please introduce similarly softened language into the author summary.</p>
              <p>We suggest adding an additional sentence, say, to the abstract to note the post 3 months follow-up points, and we imagine that you might wish to note the lack of difference in primary outcome measures post 3 months, as expected from the cross-over in provision of IPT.</p>
              <p>Please modify the relevant sentence of your abstract to begin "Study limitations included ..." and remove the numbering of individual points. </p>
              <p>Please ensure that findings are quoted consistently throughout the ms (e.g., abstract "...lower odds of MDD [0.256 ...]"; results section of main text "0.26").</p>
              <p>Please trim the "do and find" subsection of your author summary, limiting it to 3-4 short points. Many of the numbers here are also quoted in the abstract, and we suggest describing the findings in a narrative fashion in the author summary to avoid duplication. </p>
              <p>In the abstract, author summary and any other relevant points in the paper, please do not describe non-significant findings with the word "trend". </p>
              <p>You mention "space limitations" in your methods section. Technically, PLOS Medicine does not have space limitations (considering the option of supplementary information) and so we suggest removing this wording.</p>
              <p>Assuming this is the case, please note in the methods section (main text) that informed consent was sought, and by what means. </p>
              <p>At the start of the results section (main text), please avoid "approximately 90%" and "roughly 10%". Under "Effect of Interpersonal Psychotherapy ...", please substitute an exact number for "roughly 37% (95% CI 28.4 to 46.1%)" and similar quantities. </p>
              <p>On p.35 of the PDF, please correct "... was a significant group difference ... was at month 3 ...".</p>
              <p>Again in the results section of your main text, please remove the element of repetition in statements like "74% lower odds of MDD (OR 0.26 ...)", where "74% can be removed. </p>
              <p>In Fig 2, middle panel, "p=0.02" is quoted for "IPT+TAU vs TAU", yet what are presumably 95% CI appear to overlap. Why is this? A similar observation would seem to apply to the bottom panel. Incidentally, brief legends for figures 2 and 3 might be helpful to readers. </p>
              <p>Please refer to the attached CONSORT checklist at an appropriate point in your methods section (e.g., "See S1_CONSORT_Checklist"). </p>
              <p>Throughout the text, please adapt reference call-outs to precede punctuation consistently. </p>
              <p>Please remove periods from all subsection headings. </p>
              <p>Please remove all iterations of "[Internet]" from the reference list.</p>
              <p>Noting reference 5, please ensure that all references have full access information. </p>
              <p>Noting the appendix table, we understand that CONSORT discourages the presentation of statistical tests of baseline quantities. </p>
              <p>Please remove page numbers from your attached CONSORT checklist. Individual items should be referred to by section (e.g., "Methods") and paragraph number rather than by page or line numbers, as the latter generally change in the event of publication. </p>
              <p>Comments from Reviewers:</p>
              <p>*** Reviewer #1: </p>
              <p>My comments have been adequately addressed by the authors and I only have a few minor comments listed below:</p>
              <p>In the section describing the models, please indicate which visits were included (e.g. Month 3 only or Months 3, 6 and 9), indicating that the value collected at the baseline visit was included as part of the outcomes (rather than as a covariate).</p>
              <p>In the new supplemental table comparing completers vs non-completers, please consider combining the two randomised arms and compare all completers (both arms combined) to all non-completers (both arms combined). Given the relatively small sample size, I would also suggest not to rely solely on p-values to signal potential baseline imbalances.</p>
              <p>In the discussion, please consider including a comment about the results of the sensitivity analyses conducted to explore the potential impact of missing data.</p>
              <p>-Laurent Billot</p>
              <p>*** Reviewer #2: </p>
              <p>Dear authors, I revised your responses to my comments. This is to confirm that you adequately addressed all the comments I made. </p>
              <p>*** Reviewer #3: </p>

              </p>
              <p>Dear Dr. Meffert, </p>
              <p>On behalf of my colleagues and the academic editor, Dr. Vikram Patel, I am delighted to inform you that your manuscript entitled "Interpersonal Psychotherapy Delivered by Non-Specialists for Depression and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Among Kenyan HIV-Positive Women Affected by Gender-based Violence: Randomized Controlled Trial" (PMEDICINE-D-20-02128R3) has been accepted for publication in PLOS Medicine. </p>
              <p>PRODUCTION PROCESS</p>
              <p>Before publication you will see the copyedited word document (within 5 business days) and a PDF proof shortly after that. The copyeditor will be in touch shortly before sending you the copyedited Word document. We will make some revisions at copyediting stage to conform to our general style, and for clarification. When you receive this version you should check and revise it very carefully, including figures, tables, references, and supporting information, because corrections at the next stage (proofs) will be strictly limited to (1) errors in author names or affiliations, (2) errors of scientific fact that would cause misunderstandings to readers, and (3) printer's (introduced) errors. Please return the copyedited file within 2 business days in order to ensure timely delivery of the PDF proof. </p>
              <p>If you are likely to be away when either this document or the proof is sent, please ensure we have contact information of a second person, as we will need you to respond quickly at each point. Given the disruptions resulting from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, there may be delays in the production process. We apologise in advance for any inconvenience caused and will do our best to minimize impact as far as possible.</p>
              <p>EARLY VERSION</p>
              <p>Please note that an uncorrected proof of your manuscript will be published online ahead of the final version, unless you opted out when submitting your manuscript. If, for any reason, you do not want an earlier version of your manuscript published online, uncheck the box. Should you, your institution's press office or the journal office choose to press release your paper, you will automatically be opted out of early publication. We ask that you notify us as soon as possible if you or your institution is planning to press release the article.</p>
              <p>PRESS</p>
              <p>A selection of our articles each week are press released by the journal. You will be contacted nearer the time if we are press releasing your article in order to approve the content and check the contact information for journalists is correct. If your institution or institutions have a press office, please notify them about your upcoming paper at this point, to enable them to help maximize its impact. </p>
