                <title>Summary</title>
                <p>The live-attenuated oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV or Sabin vaccine) replicates in gut-associated tissues, eliciting mucosa and systemic immunity. OPV protects from disease and limits poliovirus spread. Accordingly, vaccination with OPV is the primary strategy used to end the circulation of all polioviruses. However, the ability of OPV to regain replication fitness and establish new epidemics represents a significant risk of polio re-emergence should immunization cease. Here, we report the development of a poliovirus type 2 vaccine strain (nOPV2) that is genetically more stable and less likely to regain virulence than the original Sabin2 strain. We introduced modifications within at the 5′ untranslated region of the Sabin2 genome to stabilize attenuation determinants, 2C coding region to prevent recombination, and 3D polymerase to limit viral adaptability. Prior work established that nOPV2 is immunogenic in preclinical and clinical studies, and thus may enable complete poliovirus eradication.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="p0030">Live-attenuated vaccines are highly effective in affording protection against disease and in stopping the epidemic spread of pathogenic viruses. However, developing safe and effective live-attenuated vaccines has been a challenging trial-and-error process. One of the most successful examples, Sabin’s anti-polio vaccine, has been used to nearly eradicate poliomyelitis. In 1988, an estimated 350,000 persons were paralyzed by wild polioviruses (WPVs). By 2019, the global incidence has been reduced by more than 99%, to only a few cases of WPV-related paralysis each year (112 cases in 2019) (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Polio Global Eradication Initiative, 2020</xref>). Global eradication of poliomyelitis is nearly within reach. The remaining cases occur in endemic countries and countries re-infected via importations. Failure to eradicate polio in the last remaining endemic hotspots could result in resurgence of the disease, with poliovirus spreading to cause outbreaks in polio-free countries around the world.</p>
              <p id="p0035">Three serotypes exist for poliovirus. Wild-type (WT) 2 (WPV2) and WT 3 (WPV3) are considered eradicated, but WPV1 still circulates, causing disease in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Nigeria (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Polio Global Eradication Initiative, 2020</xref>). Two vaccines, live-attenuated oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) and inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV), are used to protect against polio. In most countries, a combination of bivalent OPV (type 1 and type 3) and IPV is used. OPV is cheaper than IPV. It replicates in the recipient’s gut, eliciting superior primary intestinal immunity, compared with IPV, and thus is more effective to prevent transmission of wild viruses. OPV confers contact immunity through indirect immunization of unvaccinated persons from viruses shed by vaccinees (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Burns et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Guest et al., 2004</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Lauring et al., 2010</xref>), and it is administered in oral drops, which makes it easier to administer, store, and transport than IPV injections. Thus, OPV has been the central strategy used to end the circulation of all polioviruses.</p>
              <p id="p0040">Although OPV has been very effective in bringing WPVs to the brink of eradication (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Minor, 2012</xref>), the global eradication program might be at risk because OPV can evolve and regain transmissibility and virulence. In regions with low vaccine coverage, poliomyelitis outbreaks associated with circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPVs) have been reported over the past two decades (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Kew et al., 2002</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Kew et al., 2005</xref>, <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Stern et al., 2017</xref>). In 2019, more than 300 cases of paralytic poliomyelitis were reported (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Polio Global Eradication Initiative, 2020</xref>). Most of these incidents were caused by variants of Sabin type 2 (Sabin2), which rapidly spreads in settings of inadequate immunization coverage (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Roberts, 2018</xref>, <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Thompson and Kalkowska, 2019</xref>). Within days of vaccination, individuals shed pathogenic revertant viruses (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Dunn et al., 1990</xref>) that can be transmitted to susceptible contacts. Furthermore, virulent cVDPVs circulate and persist for years in the environment and the community, often sub-clinically, providing a dangerous, “silent” reservoir of virus (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Pallansch, 2018</xref>, <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Thompson and Kalkowska, 2019</xref>). The use of OPV can also result in vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP) in vaccine recipients and close contacts at an estimated rate of about 4.7 per million births (range: 2.4–9.7) globally (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Platt et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
              <p id="p0045">Importantly, since elective Sabin2 vaccinations were stopped in 2016, most of the world has remained free of Sabin2 viruses. However, 12 distinct cVDPV2 outbreaks and over 50 VDPV2 events occurred after global cessation of routine use of Sabin2 from areas with persistently low immunization rates (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Polio Global Eradication Initiative, 2020</xref>). Circulation of cVDPV2 constitutes a significant challenge to the eradication campaign and a major risk for global health, and has appropriately been designated as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Polio Global Eradication Initiative, 2020</xref>). On the other hand, IPV, an excellent tool to prevent paralytic poliomyelitis in vaccine recipients, is ineffective in preventing poliovirus transmission and combating epidemics in settings of poor hygiene and sanitation because it induces minimal intestinal mucosal immunity (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Bandyopadhyay et al., 2015</xref>). The current response strategy to cVDPV2 outbreaks is to vaccinate with monovalent OPV type 2 vaccine (mOPV2), stockpiled for this purpose. This approach, however, can itself generate new cVDPV2 strains, as recently observed in parts of Africa (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Blake et al., 2018</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Jorba et al., 2018</xref>). The current situation highlights the need to develop and deploy live-attenuated vaccines as a tool to combat epidemics.</p>
              <p id="p0050">To confront the challenge of the reversion of OPV to cVDPVs, we sought to develop a rational approach to design a safer vaccine. We drew on ideas and knowledge from molecular and evolutionary studies of viral virulence determinants and mechanisms (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Minor, 2012</xref>), as well our previous work, to understand to the molecular basis of attenuation and genetic instability of polio vaccines (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Macadam et al., 2006</xref>). We also determined how mutations that accumulate during type 2 cVDPV epidemics enhance the replication fitness of poliovirus and increase virulence (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Stern et al., 2017</xref>), thereby uncovering evolutionary pathways by which the Sabin vaccine strains become pathogenic. Additionally, we showed that adaptation and virulence are driven by the high error rate and recombination capacity of the viral polymerase (<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Vignuzzi et al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Xiao et al., 2017a</xref>, <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Xiao et al., 2017b</xref>). We harnessed all of these insights to engineer a vaccine strain that preserves the antigenic and immunogenic characteristics of Sabin2 while increasing its safety by stabilizing determinants of attenuation. These features should lead to a safer and effective vaccine strain.</p>

                <p id="p0055">Given the past success of the Sabin2 vaccine, our objective was to preserve its biological properties and to prevent its reversion to neurovirulence by restricting its evolutionary capacity. Accordingly, in designing a live-attenuated vaccine, we preserved its overall replication strength and thermo-sensitivity characteristics, and thus its fitness in vaccinees and immunogenicity. The genome of this polio vaccine candidate (herein nOPV2) carries five modifications of the Sabin2 genome, including two modifications within the 5′-untranslated region (UTR) (relocated <italic>cre</italic> and S15domV), synonymous mutations at eight nucleotide positions in the 2C coding region to inactivate the internal <italic>cre</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A) and two mutations in the 3D polymerase (D53N and K38R) to limit viral adaptability (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A). Each of these modifications, described below in detail, contributes to genetic stability and attenuation. Importantly, their combination prevents detectable reversion to neurovirulence by reducing the capacity of the virus to acquire mutations that increase replication fitness in neuronal tissues.<fig id="fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Predicted RNA Secondary Structures of 5′-UTR <italic>domV,</italic> Relocated <italic>cre</italic> and Mutated Internal <italic>cre</italic></p><p>(A) Schematic representation of the predicted RNA secondary structures of the following: (<italic>i</italic>) relocated <italic>cre</italic>, optimized base-pairs for temperature sensitivity and attenuation phenotypes are shown in red rectangles and “in-frame” STOP codons are shown in green rectangles; (<italic>ii</italic>) S15 <italic>domV</italic>, mutated bases to stabilize the RNA structure are shown in red; and (<italic>iii</italic>) mutated 2C-<italic>cre</italic> (2C<italic>cre</italic><sup><italic>mut</italic></sup><italic>)</italic>, shown as a predicted disrupted RNA secondary structure with nucleotide changes for 2C-<italic>cre</italic> function disruption are shown in red.

                <p id="p0060">The current type 2 vaccine is highly attenuated in both monkeys and poliovirus-susceptible mouse models (TgPVR mice). The major determinant of attenuation resides in the 5′ noncoding region (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Macadam et al., 1992</xref>). This mutation (nucleotide 481A) weakens the thermostability of an RNA stem-loop structure, known as domain V (Sabin2 <italic>domV</italic>; <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1</xref>A). A single A-to-G mutation at this position results in increased tolerance to temperature and makes the virus more neurovirulent (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Macadam et al., 1992</xref>, <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Macadam et al., 1994</xref>, <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Stern et al., 2017</xref>). All three Sabin strains carry critical determinants of attenuation within <italic>domV</italic>. <italic>DomV</italic> forms part of the internal ribosome entry site (IRES), and it is thought that destabilizing this structure reduces the efficiency of translation initiation (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Kauder and Racaniello, 2004</xref>, <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Macadam et al., 1994</xref>, <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Svitkin et al., 1990</xref>). OPV strains can revert to a form that causes paralysis in humans and can, under certain conditions, sustain circulation in the population. These viruses with regained virulence incorporate a number of mutations that increase the structural stability of <italic>domV</italic> (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Contreras et al., 1992</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Davis et al., 1977</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Dunn et al., 1990</xref>).</p>
                <p id="p0065">Soon after vaccination, the majority of vaccinees shed polioviruses with a high frequency of such mutations (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Evans et al., 1985</xref>, <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Stern et al., 2017</xref>), indicating that the structural stability of <italic>domV</italic> is under strong positive selection in the human gut. In all type 2 lineages in current outbreaks, the 481 A-to-G mutation preceded all other events leading to cVDPVs virulence (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Stern et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting its role as a “gate-keeper” in the reversion process, similar to driver mutations in cancer evolution (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Curigliano, 2018</xref>, <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Reddy et al., 2017</xref>, <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Temko et al., 2017</xref>). Accordingly, our approach was to maintain the sub-optimal thermodynamic stability of RNA <italic>domV</italic>, essential for the attenuation phenotype of Sabin2, but to manipulate the primary sequence in a way that prevents reversion by single-point mutations. Indeed, <italic>domV</italic> can be modified to alter viral virulence predictably and, at the same time, increase genetic stability to the extent that reversion is at undetectable levels (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Macadam et al., 2006</xref>). The possibility that a single-point mutation can increase the overall thermostability of the structure is prevented by eliminating G-U base pairs, a strategy that ensures any single mutation must decrease stability, and hence fitness will be subject to negative selection. Other CG and/or UA base-pair exchanges can be used to maintain the reduced thermodynamic stability of the attenuating <italic>domV</italic> RNA structure in vaccine stains. The mechanism of attenuation in engineered strains is, thus, the same as that in Sabin strains, so the effects on “take” and growth in the human gut are expected to be minimal.</p>
                <p id="p0070">A genetically stabilized <italic>domV</italic>, S15, was originally constructed based on the idea described above on an OPV3 background.

To identify Sabin2 variants with growth and attenuation properties equivalent to those of Sabin2 but with greater genetic stability, Sabin2 was engineered with three versions of <italic>domV</italic> that differed in the proportion of the Sabin2 sequence substituted with that of S15 (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1</xref>A). To examine the effects of these substitutions, we used a cell-culture assay that estimated temperature sensitivity, which is a characteristic correlating with attenuation in Vero cells (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Macadam et al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Stern et al., 2017</xref>), and a neurovirulence test in susceptible transgenic mice (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Stern et al., 2017</xref>). The temperature-sensitivity assay indicated that replacing the entire <italic>domV</italic> of Sabin2 with S15 had little or no effect on sensitivity at the tested temperatures (Sabin2 and S2/S15 <italic>domV</italic> in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>B and <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>B, respectively), whereas replacement of just stems a and b (S2/S15 a, b <italic>domV</italic> in <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1</xref>B) or a, b, c, and d including the joining loops (S2/S15 <italic>domV</italic>, S2 loop in <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1</xref>B) produced viruses that were more temperature sensitive (<italic>ts</italic>) than Sabin2 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>B and <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>B). The paralysis dose, 50% (PD<sub>50</sub>) for each of these mutant viruses was also determined to better understand their effects on neurovirulence. Similar to the <italic>ts</italic> phenotype, replacement of the entire <italic>domV</italic> (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1</xref>A, <italic>iii</italic>) had little effect on neurovirulence, whereas replacing S15 subdomains (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1</xref>, <italic>ii</italic> and <italic>iv</italic>) further attenuated Sabin2 neurovirulence phenotype (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>C and <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>C).

                <title>Relocating 2C-<italic>cre</italic> Structure to Prevent nOPV2 <italic>domV</italic> Replacement via Recombination</title>
                <p id="p0075">Epidemiological studies on cVDPV outbreaks identified recombination as an important molecular mechanism that leads to increased viral fitness and virulence. Recombination of an OPV strain with co-circulating enterovirus C species allowed the Sabin2 <italic>domV</italic> to be replaced by that of a WT co-circulating enterovirus to provide a thermostable structure, thereby restoring viral fitness (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Burns et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Stern et al., 2017</xref>). If this were to occur with nOPV2, it would render our genetic modification of <italic>domV</italic> ineffective. We thus introduced an additional design element to prevent such a potential <italic>domV</italic> reversion through recombination. Briefly, we disrupted the secondary structure of the essential <italic>cis</italic>-acting replication element (<italic>cre</italic>) located within the 2C gene (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Goodfellow et al., 2000</xref>, <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">McKnight and Lemon, 1996</xref>) without changing the coding sequence (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, <italic>iii</italic>) and introduced a new <italic>cre</italic> within the 5′-UTR (untranslated region) upstream of <italic>domV</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, <italic>i</italic>, and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A). The insertion of a new functional <italic>cre</italic> into the 5′-UTR between nucleotides 120 and 121 at the 5′-UTR yielded a poorly replicating, <italic>ts</italic> variant (<italic>cre1</italic>, <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figures S2</xref>A, S2B, and <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>A). We thus modified 5′ inserted <italic>cre</italic> by introducing mutations that increased thermostability of the structure at its new location. These modifications increased thermostability by converting U-G pairs into C-G pairs and by increasing the number of base-pairs at the bottom of the structure (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S2</xref>A, red boxes) and were able to rescue the poor replication ability of <italic>cre1</italic> (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S3</xref>A). Besides mutations increasing thermostability, two stop codons (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S2</xref>A, green boxes) were engineered into the new inserted <italic>cre</italic> to prevent generation of viable viruses via the relocated structure recombining back into its original 2C position. Accordingly, several <italic>cre</italic> candidate structures (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S2</xref>A, <italic>Cre1a-5</italic>) were constructed and examined with respect to their effect on replication and thermosensitivity. Engineered <italic>5′cre</italic> candidates tested in the presence of the S15 modification showed different levels of temperature sensitivity and reduced replication ability as compared with Sabin2 and S2/S15 <italic>domV</italic> (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S2</xref>B). Notably, relocation of <italic>cre</italic> further attenuated their virulence in the mouse transgenic model (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S2</xref>C). Among the new <italic>cre</italic> candidates, <italic>cre5</italic> restored replication ability and temperature sensitivity to levels comparable with that of Sabin2 (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figures S2</xref>B and S2C). Based on these results, we selected <italic>cre5,</italic> which is the most thermostable structure and maybe, therefore, genetically the most stable (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S2</xref>A). By relocating <italic>cre</italic> to the 5′ end of the genome, replacement of <italic>domV</italic> by recombination with a co-circulating enterovirus would require two consecutive recombination events at either side of <italic>domV</italic>, because a single event would also remove the <italic>cre5</italic>, resulting in loss of viability. By relocating the new <italic>cre5</italic> structure in proximity to <italic>domV</italic>, the frequency of such a double recombination event should be further reduced (see below as well as <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref> and <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6</xref>).</p>

Although lower virus titers were detected at 6 and 12 h post-infection from one-step growth analysis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B), virus production and temperature sensitivity of nOPV2 under all tested temperatures were not weakened by the combined modifications, as compared with Sabin2 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>C). Importantly, because each modification in nOPV2 (<italic>cre5</italic>, S15 <italic>domV</italic>, <italic>HiFi</italic>-D53N, and <italic>Rec1</italic>-K38R) contributes independently to attenuation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>C, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>I, <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>C, and <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5</xref>C–S5F), their combination in one virus vaccine strain creates a multilayer safety-net that reduces the likelihood of nOPV2 to regain fitness and neurovirulence. Accordingly, reversion to a pathogenic virus from the vaccine will require the accumulation of multiple independent mutation events, including low probability AU-to-GC double mutations in the 5′ <italic>Cre</italic>, double recombination event in the 5′-UTR to replace S15 <italic>domV</italic> and remain viable, and reversion of two polymerase modifications that do not reduce replication fitness. A critical feature of this virus vaccine design is that nOPV2 maintains its replicative capacity in tissues without causing disease, which is essential to elicit a robust life-long immune response.<fig id="fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Sabin2 Vaccine Candidate (nOPV2) Design and Growth Phenotype in Cell Culture</p><p>(A) Schematic of the nOPV2 genome showing modifications and their locations.

                <title>Genetic Stability of nOPV2</title>
                <p id="p0100">Next, we determined whether the re-designed nOPV2 is indeed more genetically stable than the current Sabin2 with a simple cell culture evolution paradigm (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A). The thermosensitive phenotype of Sabin2 is more pronounced in certain cell lines. For example, the serial passage of Sabin2 at 37°C in Vero cells, but not in Hep2C, promotes the rapid incorporation of mutations that increase both replicative fitness and thermotolerance (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Manor et al., 1999</xref>). These thermoresistant variants also display a significant increase in virulence (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Macadam et al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Stern et al., 2017</xref>). We thus carried out serial passage experiments using large viral population sizes and low multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) (10<sup>6</sup> plaque forming units [PFUs] and m.o.i. = 0.1), that further ensures rapid evolution (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Rouzine et al., 2001</xref>). Following 10 passages, we sequenced the virus population of both Sabin2 and the nOPV2 using next-generation sequencing to determine variant frequency. While the control Sabin2 vaccine strain acquired the neurovirulence determinant 481G within <italic>domV</italic> in approximately 20% of sequenced genomes, no nucleotide position with variant frequency of greater than 1% was identified within the regions of our five modifications (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A). In contrast, we observed accumulation of mutations, mostly in 2A region, at frequencies between 3%–17% in both Sabin2 and nOPV2 population (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A). These 2A mutations were reported to be associated with cell culture adaptation and have no effect on monkey neurovirulence (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Rowe et al., 2000</xref>). Similar findings were obtained when the passages were carried out at a high m.o.i. (data not shown).

On the other hand, nOPV2 was attenuated with no measurable neurovirulence at the highest tested dose (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>B). Thus, both deep sequencing and mouse neurovirulence testing confirmed that the designed vaccine candidate nOPV2 is more resistant to reversion to neurovirulence than Sabin2.</p>

PV3 virions were neutralized with serotype-specific polyclonal antibodies, and Sabin2-derived recombinants were selected by infection of L20B mouse cells at 37°C.

Substitutions at three positions were present at significant frequencies in viruses excreted by several subjects after about 2 weeks of replication: variation at VP1-143, the secondary attenuation site in Sabin2 (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Macadam et al., 1994</xref>), and nucleotide 459 (U-C) within IRES domain IV (<italic>domIV</italic>) were comparable with that for Sabin2 in a previous study (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Stern et al., 2017</xref>); mutations U123C or G179A at the base of the 5′ <italic>cre</italic> stem were also observed. Structural analysis suggests that U123C and G179A would strengthen the 5′cre by converting a U-G base pair at the base of the structure into a C-G or U-A base-pair (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S2</xref>). Mutation U459C (nucleotide 398 in Sabin2) was identified as a secondary adaptive mutation in cVDPV2 isolates and vaccinee isolates (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Stern et al., 2017</xref>). We also observed additional mutations within the capsid proteins (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>B, VP4-41 and VP1-33), but these mutations were not consistently present in all isolates, and we did not conduct further analyses on them. Based on the sequencing analysis, on average 7%–70% of shed virus isolated around 2 weeks post-vaccination had U123C/G179A, U459C, or VP1-I143T individual mutations. Thus, only a small proportion of shed viruses would carry all three of these mutations. Only after 8 weeks post-vaccination was an individual found to be shedding viruses that had fixed all three modifications (data not shown).</p>
                <p id="p0150">To determine if the mutations observed in the virus shed from vaccinees could increase their fitness and virulence, we engineered these mutations into the infectious cDNA clones corresponding to these viruses. We introduced into nOPV2 genome substitutions U123C (5′ <italic>cre)</italic>, U459C (<italic>domIV</italic>), and A2969G (VP1-I143V) into nOPV2 genome to generate an nOPV2 “triple mutant” (nOPV2) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>C). We also cloned A481G (<italic>domV</italic>) into the Sabin2 (Sabin2/A481G). The reconstructed nOPV2 (U123C, U459C, and VP1-I143V) virus is the “worst-case” scenario in which all the mutations that were selected in shed viruses after many weeks of replication had accumulated to 100% in a single genome, imparting the maximum increase of fitness (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Stern et al., 2017</xref>). Sabin/A481G represents the <italic>de facto</italic> case when Sabin2 is employed (i.e., a revertant virus excreted by most vaccinees within days of vaccination). We then evaluated neurovirulence of the reconstructed viruses in transgenic mice after intra-spinal inoculation. Introduction of A481G alone into the Sabin2 genome produced a neurovirulent virus with a PD<sub>50</sub> of 1.9 (log CCDI<sub>50</sub>), and the mutant nOPV2 had a PD<sub>50</sub> of 4.3 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>C). Thus, even in the unlikely event that nOPV2 accumulated all three changes in one genome, the strain would be at least 250 times more attenuated than the single-mutation Sabin2 revertant (Sabin2/481G), which is produced almost universally days after vaccination.</p>

              <p id="p0155">Here we describe the development of an attenuated poliovirus vaccine candidate, nOPV2, and show it possesses the fitness and immunogenicity of Sabin2, but, importantly, is genetically more stable than the current Sabin2 strain. Our approach was to leverage decades of basic research on the biology of picornaviruses into a rational design of a live-attenuated vaccine with improved safety and stability. Five modifications were introduced in the Sabin2 viral genome, based on our understanding of viral biology and pathogenesis. Our results from cell culture (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>B, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>H, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B, 3C, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>B, and <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5</xref>A), small animal models (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>C, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>I, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B, <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>C,<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>C,<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5</xref>C–S5F, and <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7</xref>), and an initial clinical trial (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>) all demonstrate that the concerted action of these modifications produces a vaccine candidate strain that, while replicating at similar levels as Sabin2, is less likely to evolve into a neurovirulent cVDPV or cause vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis. As oral live attenuated poliovirus vaccines are required to interrupt person-to-person transmission during outbreaks of the kind the world is currently witnessing (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Bandyopadhyay et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Manor et al., 1999</xref>), this strain may facilitate the control of poliomyelitis outbreaks around the world.</p>
              <p id="p0160">Our strategy introduced modifications in the 5′-UTR that prevent the reversion of a major “gatekeeper” attenuation determinant within <italic>domV</italic>. In Sabin2 a transition mutation therein, A481G, is rapidly fixed upon replication in vaccinees (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Neverov and Chumakov, 2010</xref>). Mutations at other positions in domain V are also strongly selected in Sabin1 and Sabin3 vaccines, and this is driven by increases in the RNA secondary structural stability of this domain (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Macadam et al., 1992</xref>). Temperature sensitivity and attenuation phenotypes of mutants with defined changes in domain V correlated well with predicted secondary-structure stabilities. Reversal of base-pair orientation had little effect, whereas stem disruption increased temperature sensitivity and revertants displayed mutations on either side of the stem. These observations suggested the strategy used in this study to stabilize attenuation, namely an engineered <italic>domV</italic> with an overall structural stability (ΔG) similar to that of attenuated Sabin strains, but using base-pairs that cannot increase stability by a single-point mutation (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Macadam et al., 2006</xref>). We observed no mutations accumulating in <italic>domV</italic> in cell-culture selection experiments (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A) or after replication in humans (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>A), indicating that the modifications introduced in <italic>domV</italic> in nOPV2 prevent the rapid evolution of this element.</p>
              <p id="p0165">We also relocated <italic>cre</italic> from its normal 2C location to the 5′-UTR to prevent the exchange of the entire nOPV2 <italic>domV</italic> with that from a co-circulating enterovirus C, such as PV3. After five rounds of co-infection in Hep2C cells, followed by extreme selection conditions (replication at 37°C in L20B cells), nOPV2 did not replace <italic>domV</italic> by recombination. The relocated <italic>cre5</italic> is close to <italic>domV</italic>, which is expected to reduce the recombination rate. Also, the probability of recombining out the modified 5′-UTR is even lower, given that the substitution of <italic>domV</italic> requires two simultaneous recombination events (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref> and <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6</xref>).</p>
              <p id="p0170">Two other modifications were introduced into viral RNA polymerase of nOPV2. The rapid adaptation of RNA viruses, which is linked to virulence (<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Vignuzzi et al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Xiao et al., 2017a</xref>), is enabled by virus population diversity, which increases the probability of accumulating beneficial and adaptation mutations (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Domingo and Holland, 1994</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Domingo et al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Lauring and Andino, 2010</xref>). Such genetic diversity, driven by the error-prone virus polymerase, provides an opportunity for individual beneficial alleles to be selected in a given host to circumvent environmental challenges, such as antiviral immune responses. However, diversity comes at a cost, because most mutations have deleterious effects. Thus, selection of beneficial mutations requires breaking the linkage between detrimental and beneficial mutations (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Chao, 1990</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Duarte et al., 1992</xref>) and avoiding competition between beneficial mutations (“clonal interference” effect) (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Fisher, 1930</xref>, <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Lenski et al., 1998</xref>, <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Roze and Barton, 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Worobey and Holmes, 1999</xref>). Recombination tends to oppose these negative effects by bringing beneficial mutations into the same genome and purging deleterious mutations (<xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Worobey and Holmes, 1999</xref>). This would allow putative beneficial alleles to be selected in a given host environment. Indeed, viral populations with reduced adaptation capacity yield viruses that are tissue restricted, and thus attenuated (<xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Xiao et al., 2017a</xref>, <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Xiao et al., 2016</xref>). One of our mutations enhanced the accuracy of the viral polymerase by increasing the fidelity of replication (<italic>HiFi</italic>, D53N), and the second reduced the rate of recombination (Rec1, K38R). Of note, either mutation individually or both in combination supported efficient virus replication in cell culture (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>H and <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5</xref>A). However, each further attenuated virulence of Sabin2 in transgenic mouse model (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>I and <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5</xref>B–S5F). These observations support previous experiments indicating that the diverse genetic composition of an RNA virus population is a virulence determinant that allows the virus to navigate dynamic environments.</p>
              <p id="p0175">The nOPV2 strain developed here appears to be more genetically stable than Sabin2. However, additional studies must examine the potential for the reversion of nOPV2. Longer timescales and a large population size will be needed to evaluate the long-term safety of the vaccine strain further. It will be very important to determine the phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of nOPV2-derived viruses isolated from individuals infected with the vaccine strain indirectly by contact with vaccinees.</p>
              <p id="p0180">Candidate vaccines that incorporate design elements coming from the molecular and epidemiological understanding of virus biology, such as the nOPV2 developed here and other alternative vaccine candidate designs developed in the context of our Bill and Melinda Gate Foundation Consortium (<xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">Konopka-Anstadt et al., 2020</xref>), should be a game-changer in the efforts to contribute to the complete and permanent global eradication of poliovirus type 2. Application of similar knowledge-based strategies to vaccine design should also enable us to rationally design live-attenuated vaccines for other polio-serotypes as well as related emerging pathogenic enteroviruses, including enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) and enterovirus A71 (EV-A71).</p>

Briefly, volunteers were recruited through local advertisement and screened with medical examination, laboratory testing, and also evaluated by two psychologists for mental fitness. Volunteers were excluded if they were previously vaccinated with OPV, any polio vaccine within 12 months, or any other vaccine within 28 days of the start of the study, or had any condition that the investigators believed would compromise participants’ health. Eligible volunteers were healthy men or women (aged 21-50 years) with IPV-only polio vaccination histories. Baseline blood and stool samples were collected at the screening visit, and the first three volunteers were enrolled in the first group subsequently. Fifteen volunteers were enrolled in each group and the first participant decided the vaccine strain to be received for that group by opening one of two envelops. The investigators considered the sample size of 15 per group reasonable and sufficient to evaluate the tested vaccine in a phase 1 trial, and was agreed by The Global Polio Eradication Initiative. The two groups were constituted with 13 males and 2 females with an average age of 31.1 ± 7.7 years (mean with SD), and 12 males and 3 females of 33.5 ± 10.9 years old, respectively. All participants provided written consent at enrolment. The study was conducted in accordance with Declaration of Helsinki and ICH Good Clinical Practice guidelines and was approved by the university and hospital institutional review boards. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Human Research Protection Office reviewed the study protocol. An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board oversaw the study.</p>

                  <title>Relocation and Optimization <italic>of cre</italic></title>
                  <p id="p0225">Recombination between species C enteroviruses that circulate in humans is very frequent (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Kew and Nottay, 1984</xref>). Therefore, in the long-term, the stabilized attenuating S15<italic>domV</italic> region could be exchanged with <italic>domV</italic> derived from viruses co-circulating <italic>in vivo</italic>. Several reports have documented that exchange in Sabin2-derived strains (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Kew and Nottay, 1984</xref>, <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Stern et al., 2017</xref>). To reduce the probability of loss of genetically stable, engineered S15<italic>domV</italic> by recombination, we relocated the essential <italic>cre</italic> element from its location in the 2C gene to a 5′ noncoding region location, upstream of <italic>domV</italic>. Removal of <italic>domV</italic> would then require two recombination events in the same genome, on either side of <italic>domV</italic>, since a single event would also remove the <italic>cre</italic>, resulting in loss of viability.</p>
                  <p id="p0230">Constructs were made with a disabled <italic>cre</italic> element (2C <italic>cre</italic> mutated) as described (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Goodfellow et al., 2000</xref>) with and without a re-located <italic>cre</italic> (5′<italic>cre</italic>)(<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S2</xref>A). The 2C <italic>cre</italic> mutated virus was non-viable, and blind passaging experiments confirmed that this alteration of 2C <italic>cre</italic> cannot revert to a functional structure (not shown); insertion of a new <italic>cre</italic>, identical to that in Sabin2 2C, between nucleotides 120 and 121 restored viability. However, this initial construct was significantly less fit as determined by the one-step growth curve (not shown) and plaque assay (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S3</xref>A), more temperature-sensitive in Vero cells (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S2</xref>B), and more attenuated than Sabin2 after intraspinal inoculation (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S2</xref>C). Selecting fitter variants in cell culture and analyzing sequence changes suggested the strength of the stem structure needed to be increased, possibly so that the functional structure was also the lowest energy fold after relocation within the 5′-UTR. A number of constructs were made and recovered, iteratively improving the design each time (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S2</xref>A) until a suitable construct (<italic>cre</italic>5) was produced that incorporated several features: a more favorable loop sequence, two strengthened base-pairs (U-G→C-G), a longer stem by four base-pairs, and two UAG (STOP) triplets which would be in-frame if the <italic>cre</italic> was somehow recombined into the original 2C location (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S2</xref>A).</p>
                  <p id="p0235">Initial <italic>cre</italic> mutants of Sabin2 and S2/S15<italic>domV</italic> were significantly more attenuated than Sabin2 as were <italic>cre</italic>2, <italic>cre</italic>3, and <italic>cre4</italic> mutants (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S2</xref>C). This was not unexpected as the viruses were also more temperature-sensitive than Sabin2 (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S2</xref>B). The <italic>cre</italic>5 mutant, despite showing similar temperature-sensitivity to Sabin, was also more attenuated in the TgPVR model. This suggested that <italic>cre</italic> relocation itself has an attenuating effect, at least in mice.</p>
                  <p id="p0240">One-step growth yields of <italic>cre</italic> mutants in Vero cells were lower for all mutants except S2/<italic>cre</italic>5/S15<italic>domV</italic> (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S3</xref>B). All mutants except S2/<italic>cre</italic>5/S15<italic>domV</italic> displaced a more pronounced temperature-sensitivity phenotype in Vero cells than Sabin2 (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figures S2</xref>B and S2C). Therefore, since S2/<italic>cre</italic>5/S15<italic>domV</italic> was similar to Sabin2, this virus was chosen to take forward to the next stage.</p>

Virus titers were determined with standard plaque-forming assay for the next passage. Eight passages were performed to generate virus populations of directed evolution (<bold>Fig. SA</bold>).

The plates were kept in a 33°C incubator for seven days. One row of wells on each 96-well plate was left uninfected as a negative control. The ratio of the number of GFP-positive wells (determined by ELISA plate reader) to CPE-positive wells (determined visually under a microscope) was monitored to evaluate GFP retention in virus populations. Viruses in GFP-positive wells were harvested, quantified by TCID<sub>50</sub> and used for subsequent passages. When GFP retention percentage reached 90%, viruses from GFP-positive wells were sequenced to identify candidate recombination defective determinants (five candidates were identified).</p>

A cell culture assay was designed to determine if <italic>cre</italic> relocation to a position in the 5′-UTR of PV2 upstream of <italic>domV</italic> inhibits the exchange of the <italic>domV</italic> S15 by recombination. Briefly, HEp2c cells were infected with nOPV variants and a potential donor of a wild-type <italic>domV</italic> under conditions permissive to both viruses (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref>A and <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6</xref>A).

In addition to the vaccine candidate precursor, which has the stabilized <italic>domV</italic> S15 and the relocated <italic>cre</italic>, two controls were used. One was Sabin2 and the other Sabin2 with a stabilized <italic>domV</italic> S15. Hep2c cells and culture conditions allowed replication of both viruses with minimal selection; the MOIs ensured the majority of cells were co-infected and that there was only a single round of replication.</p>
                  <p id="p0345">HEp2c cells in 25-cm flasks were co-infected with one of three type 2 viruses and the wild-type 3 virus Leon at an MOI = 10 for type 2 and an MOI = 1 for type 3. Type 2 viruses were Sabin2, S2/S15<italic>domV</italic> and S2/cre5/S15<italic>domV</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref>A and 5B). Infected cells were incubated at 35°C until 100% CPE was observed. Flasks were frozen at −20°C and thawed, contents were centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 10 min, and supernatants were removed and labeled P1. Subsequent passages in HEp2c cells were carried out in the same way with 1/100 dilutions of the harvest of the previous passage (labeled P2–P5).</p>
                  <p id="p0350">After each passage, type 2 viruses were selected by neutralization of a 1/100 dilution of the HEp2c harvest with high-titer polyclonal anti-type 3 serum, infection of L20B cells and incubation at 37°C until 100% CPE was observed, conditions known to select reversion in <italic>domV</italic> of Sabin2 (see below) (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Macadam et al., 2006</xref>). Supernatants were prepared as above and labeled “L1.” Subsequent passages in L20B cells were carried out in the same way with 1/100 dilutions of the harvest of the previous L20B passage (labeled L2). For example, a sample labeled “P3L2” was generated by three co-infections of HEp2c cells followed by 2 selection cycles in L20B cells.</p>

Products were obtained for each successive Hep2c/L20B passage for each of the virus pairs. The product for the <italic>cre</italic> mutant is larger by 61 nt, which is the size of the inserted <italic>cre5</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>B). Sanger sequencing of these products identified the predominant species in each mixture and revealed reversion and/or recombination frequency when it reaches 10% or more. The Sabin2 passage selected predominantly for 5′-UTR revertants: viruses with 481A-G. No recombination was apparent by this analysis. S15<italic>domV</italic> did not revert, consistent with published data on the genetic stability of S15 (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Macadam et al., 2006</xref>), but sequences showed gradual enrichment of a product with a Leon sequence. The S2/cre4/S15<italic>domV</italic> mutant was stable throughout.</p>
                  <p id="p0360">To identify recombinants specifically, we used PCR to amplify type 2 viruses with Leon 5′UTRs; the + sense primer was specific for Leon 5′UTR and – sense primer for Sabin2 capsid. Results for S15<italic>domV</italic> mirrored sequencing results. With Sabin2, it was clear that recombination and reversion had taken place, but the reversion frequency was higher than recombination frequency. Gradual enrichment of the recombinant suggested the recombinant was fitter than the revertant. Selection of Sabin2 revertants and S2/S15<italic>domV</italic> recombinants occurred at similar rates both for the first L20B passage (L1) and the second (L2) (not shown). No recombinants were detected in the co-culture of S2/cre4/S15<italic>domV</italic> and Leon. Therefore, the key attenuating determinants of this virus were genetically stable in terms of mutation and recombination.</p>

Student’s t tests were used to compare samples at each time, with correction for multiple comparisons. This analysis suggested significant differences in virus titer at 6 and 12 h (corrected p = 0.0080 and 0.0197, respectively) post-infection. (C) Student’s t tests were used to compare virus yield of Sabin2 and nOPV2 at tested temperatures. No significant difference in virus titers were identified (Corrected p = 0.0538, 0.2991, 0.8744, 0.2711, 0.0786 for 33, 35, 36, 37 and 39°C, respectively).</p>
