                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Evidence for the effectiveness of continuous quality improvement (CQI) in resource-poor settings is very limited. We aimed to establish the effects of CQI on quality of antenatal HIV care in primary care clinics in rural South Africa.</p>

                <sec id="sec002">
                  <title>Methods and findings</title>
                  <p>We conducted a stepped-wedge cluster-randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing CQI to usual standard of antenatal care (ANC) in 7 nurse-led, public-sector primary care clinics—combined into 6 clusters—over 8 steps and 19 months. Clusters randomly switched from comparator to intervention on pre-specified dates until all had rolled over to the CQI intervention. Investigators and clusters were blinded to randomisation until 2 weeks prior to each step. The intervention was delivered by trained CQI mentors and included standard CQI tools (process maps, fishbone diagrams, run charts, Plan-Do-Study-Act [PDSA] cycles, and action learning sessions). CQI mentors worked with health workers, including nurses and HIV lay counsellors. The mentors used the standard CQI tools flexibly, tailored to local clinic needs. Health workers were the direct recipients of the intervention, whereas the ultimate beneficiaries were pregnant women attending ANC. Our 2 registered primary endpoints were viral load (VL) monitoring (which is critical for elimination of mother-to-child transmission of HIV [eMTCT] and the health of pregnant women living with HIV) and repeat HIV testing (which is necessary to identify and treat women who seroconvert during pregnancy). All pregnant women who attended their first antenatal visit at one of the 7 study clinics and were ≥18 years old at delivery were eligible for endpoint assessment. We performed intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses using modified Poisson generalised linear mixed effects models. We estimated effect sizes with time-step fixed effects and clinic random effects (Model 1). In separate models, we added a nested random clinic–time step interaction term (Model 2) or individual random effects (Model 3). Between 15 July 2015 and 30 January 2017, 2,160 participants with 13,212 ANC visits (intervention <italic>n</italic> = 6,877, control <italic>n</italic> = 6,335) were eligible for ITT analysis. No adverse events were reported. Median age at first booking was 25 years (interquartile range [IQR] 21 to 30), and median parity was 1 (IQR 0 to 2). HIV prevalence was 47% (95% CI 42% to 53%). In Model 1, CQI significantly increased VL monitoring (relative risk [RR] 1.38, 95% CI 1.21 to 1.57, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) but did not improve repeat HIV testing (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.13, <italic>p</italic> = 0.958). These results remained essentially the same in both Model 2 and Model 3. Limitations of our study include that we did not establish impact beyond the duration of the relatively short study period of 19 months, and that transition steps may have been too short to achieve the full potential impact of the CQI intervention.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>We found that CQI can be effective at increasing quality of primary care in rural Africa. Policy makers should consider CQI as a routine intervention to boost quality of primary care in rural African communities. Implementation research should accompany future CQI use to elucidate mechanisms of action and to identify factors supporting long-term success.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Continuous quality improvement (CQI) is an important approach to improving quality of care and adherence to clinical guidelines in the health sector [<xref rid="pmed.1003150.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003150.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Originally developed to streamline production processes in the consumer industry [<xref rid="pmed.1003150.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], CQI was adopted in the 1990s by the healthcare sector to improve organisational systems to create better quality of care and health outcomes [<xref rid="pmed.1003150.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. CQI focuses on developing healthcare providers’ capacity to improve quality of care. It consists of a set of adaptable but systematic techniques to diagnose quality problems using real-time data [<xref rid="pmed.1003150.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003150.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and to address these problems with existing resources [<xref rid="pmed.1003150.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. These properties make CQI an attractive approach to improve primary care in resource-poor countries and communities, such as in sub-Saharan Africa [<xref rid="pmed.1003150.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Indeed, CQI is being increasingly rolled out at national scale in several countries in sub-Saharan Africa, with the aim to improve quality of care in primary care [<xref rid="pmed.1003150.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>–<xref rid="pmed.1003150.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The focus on quality improvement in primary care is important, because a primary care visit is often the first and only contact people have with their local health system when seeking care [<xref rid="pmed.1003150.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p>
              <p>To date, there have only been 2 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that have tested whether CQI improves quality of care in the primary care systems in sub-Saharan Africa, one in Malawi [<xref rid="pmed.1003150.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and the other one in Nigeria [<xref rid="pmed.1003150.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Both trials found CQI to be ineffective [<xref rid="pmed.1003150.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003150.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. One possible reason for the lack of effectiveness in these 2 trials is that the investigators evaluated CQI in terms of health or distal healthcare utilisation outcomes—neonatal and perinatal mortality rates in the study in Malawi [<xref rid="pmed.1003150.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and 6-month postpartum retention in the study in Nigeria [<xref rid="pmed.1003150.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. These endpoints are important, and they are rigorously assessed in the 2 studies. However, these endpoints are quite distal from the CQI activities that took place in the primary care clinics. The variability of these endpoints is therefore likely largely a function of factors outside the sphere of influence of CQI, such as emergency care availability, road infrastructure, and mothers’ educational attainment.</p>
              <p>For our RCT of CQI effectiveness, we thus decided to use 2 primary endpoints that are closely and directly linked to CQI activities. Our trial took place in an HIV hyperendemic community in rural South Africa, where antenatal care (ANC) in primary care fulfils 2 important HIV care–related functions: to ensure that all pregnant women living with HIV are (1) identified and (2) successfully treated with antiretroviral therapy (ART). We choose measures that capture the procedural quality of care of these 2 key ANC functions as primary endpoints: viral load (VL) monitoring and repeat HIV testing. Both endpoints are important measures of ANC quality and are necessary conditions for preventing mother-to-child transmission of HIV (MTCT) [<xref rid="pmed.1003150.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003150.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Ultimately, the purpose of healthcare is to improve health outcomes. Implementation science, however, focuses on the improvement of processes whose intermediate outcomes, such as testing coverage, can be directly influenced by changes to health services and are known to be strong determinants of health outcomes [<xref rid="pmed.1003150.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p>
              <p>To capture proximate effects of CQI relevant to successful ART, we chose VL monitoring, because VL is the marker of ART response—and MTCT risk—prescribed in the South African national guidelines for ART and for the elimination of MTCT (eMTCT) [<xref rid="pmed.1003150.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pmed.1003150.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Regular VL monitoring enables timely management of virologic failure to achieve eMTCT, including treatment switches and enhanced antiretroviral prophylaxis for HIV-exposed infants [<xref rid="pmed.1003150.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>–<xref rid="pmed.1003150.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Despite the importance of VL monitoring and clear stipulation in the national guidelines [<xref rid="pmed.1003150.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], most pregnant women on ART are not regularly monitored for VL [<xref rid="pmed.1003150.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003150.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p>
              <p>To capture proximate effects of CQI relevant to the detection of HIV infection, we chose repeat HIV testing, because incident HIV infection in pregnancy increases risk of MTCT as VL peaks shortly after infection [<xref rid="pmed.1003150.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In South Africa, where antenatal HIV incidence is high [<xref rid="pmed.1003150.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003150.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], early diagnosis of incident HIV through repeat testing during pregnancy is a critical step towards eMTCT [<xref rid="pmed.1003150.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Yet national guideline recommendations for retesting pregnant women who tested HIV negative during a prior HIV test in ANC are not well adhered to [<xref rid="pmed.1003150.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p>
              <p>Our stepped-wedge cluster RCT aimed to establish the effectiveness of CQI on important proximate indicators of the quality of HIV-related ANC in primary care. We hypothesised that a CQI intervention would be effective at improving (i) VL monitoring in pregnant women living with HIV and (ii) repeat HIV testing in pregnant women not living with HIV.</p>

                <p>The Africa Health Research Institute (AHRI) at Somkhele (previously known as the Africa Centre for Population Health) is located in a rural community in northern KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Our CQI intervention was conducted at 7 nurse-led South African National Department of Health (DoH) primary care clinics: 6 were located within the geographic bounds of the AHRI Population Intervention Platform Surveillance Area (PIPSA) South [<xref rid="pmed.1003150.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], and 1 clinic was located in the market town of Mtubatuba, which is often used by PIPSA residents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1003150.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Management of the primary care clinics is overseen by Hlabisa Hospital, the local district hospital. HIV prevalence amongst women of reproductive age in this area is approximately 37% [<xref rid="pmed.1003150.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].

The intervention was delivered by an external CQI team of mentors (including 2 isiZulu-speaking nurses) from the Centre for Rural Health (CRH) at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, who travelled to the study community (hereafter referred to as the CRH team). The mentors were closely supported by an improvement advisor (consultant obstetrician), a scientific advisor, and a data manager.</p>

Each clinic formed a cluster except for the 2 smallest clinics, which were merged into one cluster.

All clinics provided data continuously throughout the study period. Baseline data collection across all clinics occurred from 15 July 2015 to 28 September 2015 (Step 0). As ANC data were captured retrospectively at delivery, the total observation period exceeded the data collection period by approximately 6 months. Width of each step is proportional to the number of months under observation. The baseline period (pre-intervention, depicted in light blue) contributed approximately 8 months, and the endline (Step 7) contributed approximately 4.5 months [<xref rid="pmed.1003150.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].

                <p>Trial registration occurred after the baseline and the first step of this 8-step stepped-wedge RCT, on 10 December 2015.

                <p>We use the Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR) to describe the intervention in detail (<xref rid="pmed.1003150.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) [<xref rid="pmed.1003150.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Briefly, the intervention focused on developing the capacity of local ANC health workers in study clinics and aimed to improve implementation of the national eMTCT guidelines. The intervention was based on the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) breakthrough collaborative CQI model [<xref rid="pmed.1003150.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Clinical processes and resources were first ascertained during situational analyses conducted in the 2-week lead-up to intervention rollover. CQI tools provided a structured approach to improving process change with clearly defined goals and activities and were implemented flexibly based on need (<xref rid="pmed.1003150.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Patient care pathways in the clinic were documented using process maps [<xref rid="pmed.1003150.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] to identify areas for improvement (e.g., filing of VL results). Barriers and enablers of target endpoints (e.g., VL monitoring) were identified with fishbone diagrams [<xref rid="pmed.1003150.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], providing the opportunity for comprehensive, clinic-wide improvement. Improvement activities were reviewed using iterative Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles during which “one learns from taking action” in real time (tests of change), unlike awaiting the results of a formal research study [<xref rid="pmed.1003150.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Run charts—outcome time trends plotted during the course of improvement activities—provided visual feedback on whether any changes were likely due to the intervention [<xref rid="pmed.1003150.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. As part of the IHI breakthrough collaborative model, the CRH CQI mentors also conducted action learning sessions to consolidate learning, share experiences between healthcare facilities, and motivate collaboration.</p>

                  <title>Data sources</title>
                  <p>The data on our primary endpoints were sourced entirely from routine patient medical records (maternity case records) [<xref rid="pmed.1003150.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], which were photographed at delivery. All clusters provided pre-CQI, CQI implementation, and post-CQI data continuously throughout the study. As the maternity case records were first accessed after delivery, ANC data were captured retrospectively—this extended the baseline observation period by an additional 6 months, resulting in a total data collection period of 19 months and a total observation period of 25 months. The period after all clusters had received the CQI intervention was 4.5 months (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1003150.g002">Fig 2</xref>). We used a Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) study database for data entry [<xref rid="pmed.1003150.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. We collected outcome data continuously over the study at all 7 primary care clinics participating in this study. We also collected outcome data at Hlabisa Hospital maternity ward, because most women living in the study subdistrict deliver at this hospital.</p>
                  <p>We also conducted a process evaluation to better understand intervention delivery and explain our primary findings. For this, we sourced field notes and reports by the CRH team collated every 2 months. The reports described actual visit dates and type, results of the root-cause analyses, the improvement interventions (including PDSA cycles), successes and challenges, as well as other observations, including impressions of health worker receptivity to CQI (<xref rid="pmed.1003150.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). We further conducted semi-structured interviews with consenting health workers on their experiences of implementing CQI. We describe in detail the methods, data, and results of the process evaluation in an upcoming scientific publication.</p>

                  <title>Power calculation and sample size</title>
                  <p>As we describe in our protocol paper [<xref rid="pmed.1003150.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], we assumed for our baseline power calculation—informed by local routine data—that without CQI 40% of all pregnant women living with HIV would receive a test for VL monitoring and 65% of pregnant women not living with HIV would receive a repeat HIV test. We further assumed that half of all pregnant women would be HIV positive and that pregnant women would make 3 ANC visits. We assumed an intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.10, which is a conservative assumption compared to other ICCs measured in similar settings [<xref rid="pmed.1003150.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. We assumed missing data from 15% of enrolled women. If we enrolled a total of 1,260 pregnant women (i.e., 630 women living with HIV and 630 women not living with HIV), we estimated 80% power to detect at least a 15-percentage-point increase in our 2 primary endpoints at the 5% significance level [<xref rid="pmed.1003150.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In discussion with local stakeholders, we identified this minimum detectable difference over the course of a pregnancy as relevant for health policy and clinical practice.</p>

                  <title>Statistical analyses</title>
                  <p>We performed intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses based on the clinic attended at the first antenatal booking visit—individuals declared their “intention” to attend that same facility for the remainder of pregnancy. Although it is well established that the AHRI surveillance population is mobile [<xref rid="pmed.1003150.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], ITT assumes exposure to a single clinic for the entire duration of pregnancy regardless of actual attendance elsewhere. All participants were assigned CQI exposure status at each ANC visit (by the actual date of that visit) according to the exposure status of their clinic at that time. Participants whose assigned clinic rolled over to CQI during their ANC thus had 1 or more initial ANC visits that were CQI unexposed and 1 or more later visits that were CQI exposed. The beginning of each step (CQI rollover date) was defined as the date of the first actual CQI intervention visit in the randomised cluster.</p>
                  <p>The binary VL monitoring endpoint was measured in pregnant women living with HIV and defined as a documented VL test performed at a particular visit. Each ANC visit was eligible for an endpoint assessment on or after the first documented HIV-positive status irrespective of whether ART was initiated or continued in pregnancy and irrespective of actual VL results. This definition accounts for real-life imperfections in adherence to guidelines and documentation of ART prescriptions. Women who seroconverted from HIV-negative to HIV-positive status during the study were not included in the analysis of the VL monitoring endpoint.</p>
                  <p>The binary repeat HIV testing endpoint was measured in pregnant women not living with HIV and defined as a subsequent documented HIV test at a particular visit. Each ANC visit following the first documented negative HIV test was eligible for assessment of this endpoint. ANC visits among women who subsequently tested HIV positive were not eligible for the repeat HIV testing endpoint after the first documented HIV-positive test. We did not restrict our endpoint definitions by visit number or gestation, to allow for real-life imperfections in adherence to guidelines.</p>

                  <title>Primary analyses</title>
                  <p>The 2018 extension of the CONSORT statement for stepped-wedge cluster RCTs states that “in addition to reporting a relative measure of the effect of the intervention, it can be helpful to report an absolute measure of the effect” [<xref rid="pmed.1003150.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The reason for these recommendations are that “relative measures of the effects are often more stable across different populations” [<xref rid="pmed.1003150.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Relative measures are therefore more useful than absolute measures for policy makers considering transferring an intervention from one context to another one. In contrast, “absolute measures of effects are more easily understood” [<xref rid="pmed.1003150.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. We follow these recommendations and report and interpret both the relative and absolute effect sizes as our primary analyses.</p>
                  <p>For the primary analysis, we estimated the relative effect sizes using modified Poisson mixed effects generalised linear regression models. Modified Poisson regression has become a standard for the analysis of RCTs with binary outcomes [<xref rid="pmed.1003150.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003150.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] because it has advantages over logistic and log binomial regression models [<xref rid="pmed.1003150.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003150.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. One advantage of modified Poisson regression is that it directly generates risk ratios rather than the odds ratios that logistic regression generates. Risk ratios are easier to interpret than odds ratios and, unlike odds ratios, are collapsible [<xref rid="pmed.1003150.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>–<xref rid="pmed.1003150.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].</p>
                  <p>Another advantage of modified Poisson regression is that it does not suffer from the convergence problems that commonly arise with another approach to estimating risk ratios, log-binomial regression [<xref rid="pmed.1003150.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>–<xref rid="pmed.1003150.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. In addition, modified Poisson regression models are more robust to model misspecification than log-binomial regression models [<xref rid="pmed.1003150.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. A disadvantage of modified Poisson regression is that it can produce predicted probabilities greater than unity. However, several simulation studies have shown that modified Poisson regression provides risk ratio estimates equivalent to regression models that cannot produce such predicted probabilities, such as log-binomial regression [<xref rid="pmed.1003150.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003150.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>–<xref rid="pmed.1003150.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Modified Poisson regression models are thus a good choice for estimating risk ratios in RCTs [<xref rid="pmed.1003150.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. To measure absolute effect sizes, we used mixed effects linear probability regression models.</p>
                  <p>We used 3 models to estimate the effect of the CQI intervention. First, we used the standard Hussey and Hughes model, which includes time-step fixed effects and clinic random effects (Model 1) [<xref rid="pmed.1003150.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Second, we used an extension to this model with a nested random clinic–time step interaction term (Model 2). This extension is recommended by Hemming and colleagues [<xref rid="pmed.1003150.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], because it allows secular time trends to vary randomly by clinic. Third, we extended the standard Hussey and Hughes model with individual random effects nested within clinic random effects (Model 3). This model accounts not only for clustering of outcomes by clinic but also for clustering of outcomes within individual women across time steps. In all models, we used cluster robust standard errors to further adjust for clustering and model misspecification [<xref rid="pmed.1003150.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003150.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].</p>
                  <p>In addition to the per-visit effect sizes described earlier, we also computed the cumulative absolute probabilities of attaining our endpoints. For this purpose, we used the per-visit absolute effect sizes measured in each model and applied the exponential formula to estimate the cumulative probabilities across the median number of visits during a pregnancy [<xref rid="pmed.1003150.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>].</p>

We added (i) maternal age and parity; (ii) gestation at each ANC visit and total number of ANC visits attended in pregnancy; and (iii) maternal age, parity, gestation at each ANC visit, and total number of ANC visits.</p>

Engagement meetings were held with subdistrict and district-level DoH partners prior to study commencement to share our study objectives and introduce the intervention. Standard DoH approvals for commencing the study were also obtained as part of a Memorandum of Understanding between AHRI and the DoH. Following the analyses of our results and prior to the publication of this paper, we held engagement workshops with the sub-district and district-level DoH partners, as well as with the primary funders of this study (the Delegation of the European Commission to South Africa). During these workshops, we jointly interpreted our findings and derived policy recommendations.</p>

              <p>All 7 primary care clinics and Hlabisa Hospital maternity ward agreed to participate in the study. Maternity case records from 2,498 women who delivered between 15 July 2015 and 30 January 2017 were accessed. The clinic nurses and local DoH staff were continuous partners in this intervention throughout the study duration. No adverse events, complaints, or other deleterious effects of the CQI intervention were reported. The actual intervention rollover dates of clusters are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1003150.s003">S1 Table</xref>.</p>
              <p>The health workers appreciated the CQI intervention. For instance, the CRH team observed that the clinic health workers who participated in the CQI intervention were enthusiastic about their increased capacity to improve quality of services. Several clinic health workers expressed an interest in further training and mentoring on quality improvement tools and approaches. Finally, clinic health workers urged the CRH team to continue to work with them on quality improvement beyond the end of this study. We will report further details on these findings in an upcoming publication on the process evaluation that accompanied this trial. Preliminary results of situational analyses (conducted prior to intervention rollover) identified staffing shortages as well as lack of formal tracking systems for patients—and for test results—as potential impediments to the intervention activities described in <xref rid="pmed.1003150.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.</p>
              <p>Most maternity case records contained ANC clinical information. Among the 2,498 women recruited to this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1003150.g003">Fig 3</xref>), 5 had blank maternity case records because their previous records had been lost, and a further 19 had blank records because they never attended ANC. Of all women recorded in our study database, 2,160 participants were eligible for our primary ITT analysis (contributing 13,212 observations) during pregnancy: 338 women were excluded from our primary analysis because their HIV status at delivery was unknown, their first ANC clinic was not a study clinic, or their first ANC clinic was unknown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1003150.g003">Fig 3</xref>).</p>

              <p>We estimated the total number of women living with HIV who attended a study clinic at their first ANC visit to be 1,026 (1,011 with documented HIV status plus 15 women with unknown HIV status by delivery), of whom 99% were diagnosed HIV positive—and could therefore start ART.</p>
              <p>Median age at first booking was 25 (interquartile range [IQR] 21 to 30), and median gestation at first booking was 19 weeks (IQR 15 to 24). Median parity was 1 (IQR 0 to 2). Median number of antenatal visits was 6 (IQR 4 to 8), and 86.9% of women (95% CI 82.5% to 90.3%) attended at least 4 ANC visits during pregnancy. Around half the women (50.3%, 95% CI 45.1% to 55.4%) attended their first ANC visit before 20 weeks’ gestation. HIV prevalence at first ANC visit was 47.4% (95% CI 42.3% to 52.7%) and varied by age group (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1003150.s005">S1 Fig</xref>). There were no major differences in individual participant baseline variables by arm (<xref rid="pmed.1003150.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), i.e., the 2 arms were balanced on observed baseline characteristics. Among all eligible participants 822 of 2,160 (38.1%) were never exposed to CQI during their pregnancy (i.e., during all of their ANC clinic visits the clinic[s] had not yet received the CQI intervention), 870 of 2,160 (40.3%) were fully exposed to CQI (i.e., during all of their ANC clinic visits the clinic[s] had already received the CQI intervention), and the remaining participants were partially exposed (i.e., during initial ANC clinic visits the clinic[s] had not yet received the CQI intervention, while during later ANC clinic visits the clinic[s] had received the intervention).</p>

With a median of 6 ANC visits per pregnancy in this study, the absolute effect size per visit translates to a cumulative probability of receiving a VL test in pregnancy of 58% in the intervention arm compared to 46% in the control arm. With the recent WHO recommendations for at least 8 ANC visits [<xref rid="pmed.1003150.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], these values are equivalent to a cumulative probability of receiving a VL test of 69% in the intervention arm compared to 57% in the control arm.</p>

                  <p>CQI did not have a statistically significant effect on repeat HIV testing in any of our 3 primary analyses. The RRs ranged from 1.00 to 1.01, and the corresponding <italic>p</italic>-values ranged from 0.877 to 0.958 (<xref rid="pmed.1003150.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1003150.g004">Fig 4</xref>). These numbers are equivalent to an absolute change in the probability of receiving a repeat HIV test per ANC visit of 0.0 to 0.3 percentage points (all <italic>p</italic> ≥ 0.758, <xref rid="pmed.1003150.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). With a median of 6 ANC visits in this study, this effect size per visit translates to a 59% to 60% cumulative probability of receiving a repeat HIV test during pregnancy in both the intervention and the control arm. With the WHO-recommended 8 ANC visits, these numbers translate to 69% to 70% cumulative probability of receiving a repeat HIV test in both arms.</p>

                  <p>There was variability in CQI effect on VL monitoring with time since rollover to the intervention, in all 3 mixed effects models. Immediately after rolling over to the CQI intervention, the relative effect size was 1.17 (<italic>p</italic> = 0.071) in Model 1. After 2 months of CQI exposure (lag of 1 step) and 4 months (lag of 2 steps), the relative effect sizes were 1.42 (<italic>p</italic> = 0.021) and 1.45 (<italic>p</italic> = 0.015), respectively.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Our stepped-wedge cluster RCT conducted under real-life conditions in rural South Africa showed that CQI improved antenatal HIV VL monitoring but did not improve repeat HIV testing. To our knowledge, this is the first RCT to show that CQI can improve quality of primary care in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
              <p>The significant improvement in the first of our 2 primary endpoints—VL monitoring—suggests that CQI may indeed be a good approach to improve quality of care in primary care. This finding is important for policy: CQI is an attractive approach for resource-poor settings because it works with local health workers and within existing resources. Moreover, CQI is already commonly used to improve quality of care in many resource-poor countries and communities, including sub-Saharan Africa [<xref rid="pmed.1003150.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>–<xref rid="pmed.1003150.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Our trial provides evidence for these policies.</p>
              <p>Both relative and absolute effect sizes are important for policy. We found a large relative effect of the CQI intervention on VL monitoring: CQI caused an almost 40% increase in VL monitoring. Relative effect sizes are commonly more stable across populations with different baseline attainments of an endpoint [<xref rid="pmed.1003150.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. VL monitoring varies widely across ANC and HIV treatment programmes in sub-Saharan Africa [<xref rid="pmed.1003150.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003150.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Policy makers should therefore consider our relative effect size in the context of their health system’s achievement in measuring this critical indicator of success in interrupting transmission of HIV from mother to child. In absolute terms, our effect size was relatively small on a per-visit basis, about 4 percentage points per visit. However, it is well recognised that multiple ANC visits are required for maternal and neonatal health [<xref rid="pmed.1003150.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. For the median number of 6 ANC visits in this community, we estimate a cumulative absolute effect size of about 12 percentage points. This effect size is close to the threshold of 15 percentage points for clinically meaningful effects that we used in our power calculations.</p>
              <p>We also found heterogeneous effects of CQI on VL monitoring by duration of the cluster’s exposure to CQI: effects reached their maximum 2 to 4 months after intervention rollover and waned thereafter. The time pattern we see here can be explained by a “natural course” of innovation—initially health workers need to learn to implement innovations to maximum effectiveness; over time, the need for the innovations (e.g., novel processes supporting VL monitoring) declines as more and more patients have benefited. At the same time, the waning effects following a maximum could also indicate health worker fatigue in implementing an innovation that has now become routine. This latter explanation would argue for implementation research on approaches to maintain long-term innovation effects.</p>
              <p>However, our findings also emphasise that it is important to better understand the contextual determinants and potential mechanisms of CQI effects, because CQI did not have an effect on our second primary endpoint, repeat HIV testing. There are several plausible reasons for the difference in CQI effects. The first reason is perceptions of clinical impact. For VL monitoring, impact is likely very salient—lower maternal mortality, better maternal health, and reduced MTCT. In contrast, for repeat HIV testing, impact may be perceived as more “distal” to clinical outcomes and thus less important. CQI activities aimed at increasing repeat HIV testing may therefore not have resonated as strongly with health workers as did CQI activities aimed at improving VL monitoring. A related issue is patient perceptions or behaviours. For example, women not living with HIV may have less perceived risk of infection [<xref rid="pmed.1003150.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] or concerns about negative partner attitudes if they received a positive HIV diagnosis [<xref rid="pmed.1003150.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Presenting late to ANC for the first time may also have been a barrier to receiving a second HIV test for some women, because the guidelines stipulate an interval of 3 months between HIV tests.</p>
              <p>The second potential reason is the differential baseline attainment of our 2 primary endpoints—about one-third for VL monitoring and about two-thirds for repeat HIV testing. While our power calculations indicated that our trial was sufficiently powered to detect significant CQI effects on both primary endpoints, it might have been practically easier to identify and address problems in achieving high levels of coverage with VL monitoring compared to repeat HIV testing, because VL monitoring involves more processes and complexity than repeat HIV testing—thus, CQI that addresses process quality had fewer opportunities to change practice in repeat HIV testing. For instance, VL monitoring involved identifying women eligible for the test, phlebotomy, following up and documenting results, and retrospectively capturing routine ART clinic data onto the national monitoring and evaluation database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://TIER.Net">TIER.Net</ext-link>)—CQI could address flaws in most of these processes. During each visit, women living with HIV may have interacted with different staff cadres in the clinic—nurses for clinical management or lay counsellors for adherence counselling—with additional opportunities to identify eligible women for testing during the clinic appointment. Other staff (e.g., data capturers) may have also identified women eligible for VL monitoring while filing previous VL results or capturing routine data onto <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://TIER.Net">TIER.Net</ext-link> after the visit. Conversely, repeat HIV testing involved a simpler workflow: identifying eligible women, conducting the rapid test, and immediately documenting the result, with only one type of staff cadre involved (usually a lay counsellor).</p>
              <p>The final potential reason for the difference in CQI effects is that, during the study period, many of the HIV lay counsellors, who were carrying out HIV testing in primary care clinics, lost their employment in the public-sector health system in South Africa because of a lay counsellor re-deployment policy [<xref rid="pmed.1003150.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. The human resources for HIV testing in primary care were thus diminished over the study period. In contrast, nurses carried out VL monitoring in the South African health system, and their numbers remained stable over the study period. The differential CQI effectiveness on our 2 primary endpoints may thus have been caused by underlying differences in the availability of the human resources needed to effectively implement endpoint-specific CQI activities.</p>
              <p>The 2 other trials of CQI in primary care in sub-Saharan Africa did not find significant effects, likely due to selection of endpoints that were relatively distal to CQI activities. As alluded to previously, the variability of these endpoints—neonatal and perinatal mortality in Malawi [<xref rid="pmed.1003150.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] as well as a distal healthcare utilisation outcome, postpartum retention, in Nigeria [<xref rid="pmed.1003150.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]—may be a function of many factors that CQI cannot be expected to influence. Our endpoints were more proximate to CQI thereby making it easier to demonstrate a direct CQI effect.</p>
              <p>In general, however, the 2 prior studies and ours jointly point towards the need to ensure sufficient resources and sufficiently good underlying health systems processes for CQI to be effective. For instance, staff turnover or redeployment during CQI initiatives are likely to impede CQI effectiveness, whereas clinic health worker willingness to engage with CQI, sufficient protected time for clinic health workers to work with CQI mentors, and relevance of CQI initiatives to local needs are likely enablers of CQI effectiveness [<xref rid="pmed.1003150.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pmed.1003150.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pmed.1003150.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>].</p>
              <sec id="sec036">
                <title>CQI implementation and resource investments</title>
                <p>We observed that health workers maintained positive attitudes towards CQI and our CQI mentors during the study. In particular, health workers were enthusiastic to learn CQI tools and improve quality of services and were keen to continue working with the CRH team.</p>
                <p>CQI is a systematic process for identifying problems and devising, testing, and revising potential solutions to quality shortcomings. The different management techniques used during this process are highly standardised and time-tested, including process mapping, fishbone diagrams, and PDSA cycles. Deviations from the overall process and these individual techniques—by the CQI mentors implementing them or by clinic health workers utilising them—would imply low fidelity. Based on our observations, CQI mentors implemented the CQI intervention with high fidelity. However, clinic health workers’ implementation of the CQI process and techniques was of somewhat lower fidelity. Clinic health workers could not always participate in CQI meetings and failed to complete some of the CQI tasks, despite their general enthusiasm for the intervention. The reasons for these deviations were mostly rooted in structural capacity constraints in this rural South African health system, including staffing shortages, rapid staff turnover, and competing clinical commitments [<xref rid="pmed.1003150.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>].</p>
                <p>The CQI process and management techniques are intended to be the same across clinics and communities; the solutions that they identify, test, and revise are intended to be tailored to each clinic and will therefore differ across contexts. The solutions that each clinic identified and implemented did indeed differ, even though all participating clinics were located in the same district in rural KwaZulu-Natal. We will report further details on these results in an upcoming publication on the process evaluation that accompanied this trial.</p>
                <p>The key resource needed to implement CQI is CQI mentors’ and clinic health workers’ time. CQI mentors typically spent several hours per week training and supporting clinic health workers during the intensive phase of CQI; during the maintenance phase, the mentors spent substantially less time interacting with the clinic health workers, typically several hours per month. The training sessions at the very beginning of each step and the action learning sessions each required an entire day. CQI activities required time to (i) identify drivers of poor VL monitoring and repeat HIV testing, (ii) conduct group meetings to design clinic-specific solutions, (iii) implement those solutions (e.g., different methods to track women eligible for HIV care tests), and (iv) use clinic-based real-time data sources to test whether particular solutions improved testing rates.</p>
                <p>CQI mentors who are adaptable and relate professionally and culturally to health workers at target health facilities may be more successful at engaging health workers in CQI. Mentors must be adept at generating descriptive data and, ideally, be familiar with implementing the desired change in practice. Obtaining basic CQI certification may take between around 18 hours (online) [<xref rid="pmed.1003150.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>] to 3 days [<xref rid="pmed.1003150.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>] of coursework.</p>
                <p>In addition to the CQI mentors’ time and the health workers’ time, a so-called improvement advisor—a more highly qualified health professional than the CQI mentors with the ability to coach and lead the CQI mentors—is an integral part of the team to oversee CQI activities. In our experience, the improvement advisor would need to invest around 20% of their time for successful CQI support; in other settings, this would depend on the needs of the CQI mentors and participating clinics. Given these CQI resource needs, the time—and financial—costs of the intervention were overall low. Feasibility and scalability of CQI will, however, not only depend on resource requirements but also on clinic health workers’ motivation and mindset. CQI requires changes in individual behaviours and institutional practices, which in turn are determined by job satisfaction, ambition, experience, and local workplace culture and constraints [<xref rid="pmed.1003150.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p>
                <p>In our study, the CQI mentors typically held CQI meetings 2 to 3 times per week during the intensive 2-month step. For routine implementation at larger scale, alternative meeting frequencies may also work. For instance, it may be more practicable to conduct visits less frequently (e.g., once per week) but over a longer period of time (e.g., half a year). The optimal frequency of mentor visits will likely depend on how many clinic health workers are available for CQI activities and whether the clinic activities that the CQI team chose for improvement require additional support.</p>

                <p>Our pragmatic cluster-randomised stepped-wedge design rigorously tested the effectiveness of CQI in a real-world setting in rural South Africa while enabling all clinics to eventually receive the intervention. Our registered primary endpoints were not only important process indicators of HIV care quality expected to respond to CQI, but they were also essential clinical practice standards described in the national South African guidelines for HIV treatment and ANC. The intervention was implemented flexibly by adapting to local clinic needs, and individual participant inclusion criteria were broad. Our CQI implementation team of local CQI mentors, improvement advisor, data manager, and scientific partners were from the University of KwaZulu-Natal, had extensive experience implementing CQI elsewhere in South Africa, and spoke the vernacular language, isiZulu. The research was co-led by South African researchers, while most researchers in the wider scientific team have worked in rural South Africa for many years.</p>
                <p>Our study had several limitations. First, 2-month intervention steps may have been too short to catalyse the changes required to improve outcomes given that clinic resources in routine care are already overstretched. However, the monthly maintenance visits following the intervention steps may have compensated for the relatively short initial implementation period. Second, we measured our endpoints as documented in the maternity case records. Although most maternity case records contained clinical information, the poor documentation of VL results among women who had a VL test performed raises concerns about data quality overall. It is thus possible that actual repeat HIV testing and VL monitoring rates were higher than measured in our study albeit not documented. In this case, we would also expect that the effect sizes that we have measured are underestimates of the true effect sizes. Third, we were unable to measure long-term sustainability of CQI over several years, because our study duration was limited by our research budget.</p>

                <title>Other policy and future research implications</title>
                <p>In addition to the general policy relevance of our findings for health policies aiming to improve the quality of primary care in sub-Saharan Africa, our findings are of specific relevance to the goal of eMTCT. Universal coverage of the activities captured by our 2 primary endpoints—VL monitoring and repeat HIV testing in pregnancy—will be critical to achieve this goal [<xref rid="pmed.1003150.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In particular, VL monitoring close to delivery is key to ensuring maternal virologic suppression in the peripartum period [<xref rid="pmed.1003150.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], although VL monitoring and repeat HIV testing are crucial throughout pregnancy and breastfeeding to enable timely interventions for mother and baby. According to our findings, CQI could be a good addition to the set of interventions driving eMTCT in HIV hyperendemic settings.</p>
                <p>Improving clinical processes to achieve desired health systems and health outcomes requires changes in practice (behavioural changes), which depend on individual motivation, job satisfaction, and clinical knowledge and context [<xref rid="pmed.1003150.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. It is also unclear as to how far clinic health workers “normalise” CQI into their practice once the CQI mentors have completed an engagement, particularly given the human resource shortages and high staff turnover in the local health system. Knowledge of time to assimilation of CQI could inform future study designs that account for a suitable time lag before outcomes can be expected to change.</p>
                <p>An important question for future research is whether this CQI intervention “spilled over” to ANC activities outside HIV care and to primary care outside ANC. Such spill-over effects could be positive or negative. On the one hand, the clinic health workers trained in CQI may have applied their new skills to other clinical services, resulting in further quality improvements. On the other hand, health workers invested time and energy in this CQI and, as a result, may have neglected clinical services outside the scope of this intervention. In future research, we plan to measure the effects of CQI on a broader set of endpoints, which will capture the quality of a wide range of ANC functions.</p>
                <p>Outcome measures that lie on plausible causal pathways from an exposure to an outcome can be used to empirically confirm mechanistic hypotheses. CQI is an intervention that can work its way to outcomes through multiple pathways, because it empowers local health workers to identify and implement those health systems improvements and innovations that are most promising in the particular contexts in which they work. In this case—and other complex interventions—local health workers can identify likely mechanisms connecting an intervention to outcomes. In the case of HIV VL monitoring and repeat HIV testing, proximate endpoints that lie on the causal pathways from CQI could include availability of test kits, presence of systems for patient tracking and tracing, health worker motivation to test, and patient demand for testing.</p>
                <p>While our quality of care measures are good choices to test the effectiveness of a CQI intervention, the ultimate purpose of healthcare is to reduce morbidity and mortality. Future mathematical modelling studies should estimate the impact of CQI on health outcomes that could be achieved given the effect sizes we measured in this study and local estimates of VL monitoring in different communities in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
                <p>Our study findings are likely transferable to other resource-poor communities in southern and sub-Saharan Africa, where nurses are the primary providers of ANC and HIV treatment. Given the resource shortages and increasing demand on HIV services with rollout of universal ART for all people living with HIV, patient and laboratory results tracking are likely to become more challenging with paper-based methods. Conversely, access to electronic laboratory results would increase healthcare provider availability for direct clinical care while maximising opportunities for detecting and managing maternal HIV viraemia. It is thus plausible that technological innovations in clinic data and management systems could contribute to CQI effectiveness in improving HIV care.</p>

                <title>Conclusions</title>
                <p>We showed that CQI in primary care can be effective in rural South Africa. We found a significant CQI effect on one of our 2 primary endpoints, VL monitoring among pregnant women living with HIV. However, the fact that CQI failed to improve our second primary endpoint indicates that CQI success is sensitive to the particular health system processes it is intended to address. CQI should be considered as an intervention to improve quality of primary care in rural African communities. Its use should be closely monitored to ensure that we further improve our understanding of factors influencing its success.</p>

              </p>
              <p>Dear Dr. Yapa,</p>
              <p>Thank you very much for submitting your manuscript "Can Continuous Quality Improvement increase coverage of antenatal HIV care tests in rural South Africa? Results of a stepped-wedge cluster-randomised controlled implementation trial" (PMEDICINE-D-19-03348) for consideration at PLOS Medicine. </p>
              <p>Your paper was discussed among the editorial team and sent to independent reviewers, including a statistical reviewer. The reviews are appended at the bottom of this email and any accompanying reviewer attachments can be seen via the link below:</p>
              <p>[LINK]</p>
              <p>In light of these reviews, we will not be able to accept the manuscript for publication in the journal in its current form, but we would like to invite you to submit a revised version that fully addresses the reviewers' and editors' comments. You will appreciate that we cannot make a decision about publication until we have seen the revised manuscript and your response, and we expect to seek re-review by one or more of the reviewers. </p>
              <p>In revising the manuscript for further consideration, your revisions should address the specific points made by each reviewer and the editors. Please also check the guidelines for revised papers at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/revising-your-manuscript">http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/revising-your-manuscript</ext-link> for any that apply to your paper. In your rebuttal letter you should indicate your response to the reviewers' and editors' comments, the changes you have made in the manuscript, and include either an excerpt of the revised text or the location (eg: page and line number) where each change can be found.

              <p>Requests from the editors:</p>
              <p>In your data statement, rather than specifying "reasonable" requests please adapt the wording to "Requests from researchers who meet the criteria for access to confidential data ..." or similar. PLOS' data policy does not allow article authors to be the primary point of contact for data, so please modify the statement to note that contact should be made via the data repository. </p>
              <p>Please remove the rhetorical question from the title, and add a colon before the study descriptor.</p>
              <p>Please add summary demographic information for stud participants to your abstract. </p>
              <p>The final sentence of the "methods and findings" subsection of your abstract should summarize the study's main limitations. </p>
              <p>At line 32, please begin the "conclusions" subsection of your abstract with "In this study, we found that ..." or similar. </p>
              <p>After the abstract, we will need to ask you to add a new and accessible "author summary" section in non-identical prose. You may find it helpful to consult one or two recent research papers published in PLOS Medicine to get a sense of the preferred style. </p>
              <p>Please remove the sentence of discussion at line 102, or move this to the discussion section. </p>
              <p>To your methods section, please add a brief mention of ethics approval and the situation regarding informed consent. </p>
              <p>Please avoid making claims of your study being "the first", and where a claim of primacy is made please add "to our knowledge" or similar. </p>
              <p>We ask you to adapt the first paragraph of the discussion section of your main text so that this provides a summary of the study's findings. </p>
              <p>Please remove trade marks from your ms. </p>
              <p>Please revise your reference list so that all entries match journal style. Italics and boldface text should be converted into plain text, for example; a maximum of six author names should be listed followed by "et al.". </p>
              <p>Please abbreviate journal names consistently; and add full access information to reference 8. </p>
              <p>Please provide an update on the status of reference 39. </p>
              <p>We ask you to convert the Tidier checklist into an individual supplementary file, referred to in the main text. </p>
              <p>Please also convert your CONSORT checklist into an individual supplementary file, referred to in the methods section of your main text. In the checklist, individual items should be referred to by section (e.g. "Methods") and paragraph number rather than by page or line numbers, as the latter generally change in the event of publication. </p>
              <p>Comments from the reviewers:</p>
              <p>*** Reviewer #1: </p>
              <p>The process of evaluation of care (CQI) described here is extremely interesting and the authors / actors of this work should be congratulated for this approach. </p>
              <p>As a clinician, non-expert in this type of approach, I have only few "naive" questions:</p>
              <p>1 / the quantitative results of VL at baseline were satisfying. Are the additional VL made thanks to the CQI at the same level?</p>
              <p>2 / Why not choose the most important endpoint: "child infection" (or at least PCR positive at 6 weeks for example)?</p>
              <p>Concerning the CQI itself:</p>
              <p>3 / It is stated that the teams have welcomed the CQI procedure. Did the level of satisfaction remained similar after the CQI ?</p>
              <p>4 / It would be interesting to specify in more detail the time and human ressources required for these interventions, in order to appreciate the feasibility in other contexts.</p>
              <p>5 / Were the interventions homogeneous between the centers and during the study period ? Can we imagine a sort of "CQI of the CQI" ?</p>
              <p>6 / After this procedure, can we consider a simplified procedure of CQI to be more routinely implemented ? (at least for this specific question of HIV in ANC)</p>
              <p>7 / Did the CQI related improvement of care for HIV women, had an impact (favorable or deleterious or neutral) on other activities of ANC (outside HIV care )?</p>
              <p>*** Reviewer #2: </p>

              <p>*** Reviewer #3: </p>
              <p>This manuscript presents the results of a stepped-wedge cluster randomised trial in South Africa. The trial compared a CQI intervention to standard of care in nurse-led antenatal care facilities with the aim of improving viral load testing among women living with HIV, and repeat HIV testing among women who were HIV negative at presentation for antenatal care.</p>
              <p>This is a clearly thought out, pragmatic study which is well described in the paper. The findings show that CQI can improve the completion of viral load testing during pregnancy in low-resource and high-burden settings. The lack of effect of repeat HIV testing is clearly considered and raises important issues around the broader context within which CQI interventions are implemented.</p>
              <p>Overall, this is well written manuscript that offers important insights into both the potential for CQI interventions in primary care settings and the challenges with implementing and evaluating CQI interventions. I have a few minor comments and points of clarification.</p>
              <p>P7 line 115: Study setting: here you say 6 clinics but the abstract and description said 7 clinics (6 clusters - 2 small clinics combined)</p>
              <p>P11 data sources. If I understand correctly, both completion of maternal viral loads and repeat HIV testing were ascertained from the maternity case record retrospectively at the time of delivery. My experience is that the MCRs are very well completed but are there any concerns about data quality in these patient held records? What happened in the MCR was lost/had to be replaced and there was missing data for a period of the pregnancy? It might be useful to add something about the quality of the outcome data to the methods/discussion.</p>
              <p>P14 line300/301: Unsure what is meant by HIV diagnosis coverage of HIV-positive women?</p>
              <p>Line 306: Usually avoid starting sentence with number (50.3% …)</p>
              <p>Line 341: missing a bracket</p>
              <p>Discussion Line 364: I agree with the authors discussion of the providers perceived importance of repeat HIV testing compared to viral load. I wonder if there is also any differences from the patient side. Are there any issues with women refusing HIV testing or perhaps not being aware that it should happen so not asking if it isn't done? In contrast perhaps women living with HIV are more aware of the impact of having a viral load test.</p>
              <p>Line 371-374: Not sure I clearly understand what the authors mean here. Do you mean the CQI intervention was practically easier, with the barriers to viral load testing easier to identify and address than the barriers to repeat HIV testing. Perhaps the CQI intervention "favoured" the viral load testing outcome in this way in so far as it was the lower hanging fruit of things to address in the clinics?</p>
              <p>Lines 375-378: This is a really important issue. Staff turnover and buy-in pose a major threat to CQI interventions and this requires considering for the roll out of these interventions in low-resource health systems.</p>
              <p>Lines 394-405: The authors discuss here the issue of selecting a more proximal outcome measure. Do the authors have any suggestions here for future research based on your experiences? What sorts of outcomes might be important to consider when evaluating and monitoring the success of CQI interventions?</p>
              <p>Line 429/430: Is there a reason you do not account for a delay in intervention effect/time for the intervention to stabilise, perhaps in sensitivity analyses?</p>
              <p>Lastly, the inclusion of the TIDieR framework is really helpful to think about how this or similar interventions could be scaled. The success of the intervention is dependent on the skills of the CQI mentors who deliver the intervention and how they engage with the health providers. Some discussion on issues around identifying/training suitable CQI mentors when scaling/reproducing this sort of intervention might be useful.</p>

              <p>*** Reviewer #4: </p>
              <p>This reviewer did not review the original paper but two related things in my mind attenuate the potential impact of this manuscript. First, the CQI strategy is very sparsely described. The literature on QI across a large number of disease conditions (eg., stroke, HIV) as well as variety of settings and organizations is remarkably heterogenous in clinical effects. To advance the science of quality improvement strategies, research on such approaches must be crystal clear about the nature of the quality improvement intervention in order to make its effects (or absence therefore) interpretable. I did not see where in the manuscript enough detail on who the CRH team was composed of (credentials? training?), when were they supposed to goto the facilities (what was the dose?) and how much leeway they had; what the specific actions taken were (presumably training, mentoring, teaching etc). Second, the implementation outcomes are likewise underdeveloped particularly from a quantitative perspective. What fraction of intended mentoring or coaching visits were made? Who received the team? What evidence of implementation outcomes or process outcomes were present? Also, although not all of this is in the scope of perhaps this manuscript - implementation outcomes any all or any of these levels would not only be useful and interesting but indeed critical for making this study a contribution to the literature. Finally context is crutical 0 and although there are organizational scales that are difficult to use, even survey results like how leadership at the facility level perceived in QI activities could be useful. In addition to Proctors "specifying" implementation strategies guidance, this paper should also make use of standard for reporting quality improvement studies <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.squire-statement.org/">http://www.squire-statement.org/</ext-link> . So in short, while I applaud the rigorous design, the impact on the field in general and on the CQI literature would be enhance with these considerations in my view. I would encourage addition of these data to results if possible, and if not, discussion and consideration for a future submission on these outcomes alone.</p>

              <p>Dear Dr Yapa, </p>
              <p>On behalf of my colleagues and the academic editor, Dr. Elvin H. Geng, I am delighted to inform you that your manuscript entitled "The impact of Continuous Quality Improvement on coverage of antenatal HIV care tests in rural South Africa: results of a stepped-wedge cluster-randomised controlled implementation trial" (PMEDICINE-D-19-03348R2) has been accepted for publication in PLOS Medicine. </p>
              <p>PRODUCTION PROCESS</p>
              <p>Before publication you will see the copyedited word document (in around 1-2 weeks from now) and a PDF galley proof shortly after that. The copyeditor will be in touch shortly before sending you the copyedited Word document. We will make some revisions at the copyediting stage to conform to our general style, and for clarification. When you receive this version you should check and revise it very carefully, including figures, tables, references, and supporting information, because corrections at the next stage (proofs) will be strictly limited to (1) errors in author names or affiliations, (2) errors of scientific fact that would cause misunderstandings to readers, and (3) printer's (introduced) errors.</p>
              <p>If you are likely to be away when either this document or the proof is sent, please ensure we have contact information of a second person, as we will need you to respond quickly at each point.</p>
              <p>PRESS</p>
              <p>A selection of our articles each week are press released by the journal. You will be contacted nearer the time if we are press releasing your article in order to approve the content and check the contact information for journalists is correct. If your institution or institutions have a press office, please notify them about your upcoming paper at this point, to enable them to help maximize its impact. </p>
