                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Healthcare workers (HWs) have at least twice the risk of tuberculosis (TB) compared to the general population. There is growing emphasis on latent TB infection (LTBI) in high-risk populations. Yet we know little about HWs’ perspectives of LTBI testing and treatment to inform implementation in high-incidence settings. We developed a qualitative networked approach to analyze HWs’ perspectives on LTBI testing and treatment.</p>

                <sec id="sec002">
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>We conducted 22 in-depth interviews with nurse and physician stakeholders, who had been recruited as part of a larger study evaluating TB transmission risk in HWs at Tygerberg Hospital, Cape Town, South Africa. We performed open coding to identify emergent themes and selective coding to identify relevant text citations. We used thematic analysis to inductively derive the CARD (Constraints, Actions, Risks, Desires) framework.</p>

                <sec id="sec003">
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>All HWs desired to avoid developing TB but few felt this was actionable. Despite LTBI knowledge gaps, safety and cost concerns, most HWs reported hypothetical willingness to take LTBI treatment. The CARD framework showed that desire and action related to LTBI testing and treatment was clearly framed by the interactions between constraints, administrative action, and risk. The surprise HWs described on receiving a negative LTBI (Quantiferon-Plus) result suggests LTBI testing may recalibrate HWs’ perceptions regarding the futility of actions to reduce their TB risk.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="sec004">
                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>LTBI testing and treatment are acceptable to HWs and could counteract the perceived inevitability of occupational TB infection that currently may limit risk reduction action. This should be coupled with administrative leadership and infrastructural support. The CARD analytic framework is a helpful tool for implementation scientists to understand current practices within complex health systems. Application of CARD could facilitate the development of contextually-relevant interventions to address important public health problems such as occupational TB.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p>Tuberculosis (TB) is a leading infectious cause of death in South Africa and globally [<xref rid="pone.0254211.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. It is estimated that 1.7 billion individuals worldwide (one quarter of the global population) have latent TB infection (LTBI) [<xref rid="pone.0254211.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], which carries risk of progressing to active TB. The development of active TB can be prevented by administering TB preventive therapy (TPT) to people with LTBI [<xref rid="pone.0254211.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0254211.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Yet, TPT is poorly implemented even in groups with high risk, including people living with HIV (PLHIV) and child contacts of a person with infectious TB [<xref rid="pone.0254211.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p>
              <p>The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates healthcare workers (HWs) have at least twice the risk of active TB compared to the general population [<xref rid="pone.0254211.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], although the accuracy of these estimates is limited due to the lack of systematic reporting. Recommended screening for active TB in HWs is often not performed since occupational health systems in high-incidence countries are overburdened or absent [<xref rid="pone.0254211.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0254211.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Specific challenges include the lack of trained occupational medicine personnel and concerns about confidentiality [<xref rid="pone.0254211.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Internal and external stigma experienced by HWs affected by TB is a major care seeking barrier [<xref rid="pone.0254211.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0254211.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], especially if that care is offered through occupational mechanisms [<xref rid="pone.0254211.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0254211.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Systematic reviews demonstrate high rates of LTBI in HWs in low and middle-income countries [<xref rid="pone.0254211.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0254211.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], such as South Africa [<xref rid="pone.0254211.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0254211.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Since testing and treatment for LTBI in HWs is not currently implemented in high-incidence countries such as South Africa, the exact burden of LTBI in HWs is unknown.</p>
              <p>Systematic review data, predominantly from low-incidence settings, indicates large drop-offs in the LTBI care cascade (including for health professionals), starting from the implementation of testing to uptake and completion of treatment [<xref rid="pone.0254211.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Recent trials demonstrate the efficacy and safety of shor444ter TPT regimens [<xref rid="pone.0254211.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0254211.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], which have been incorporated into guidelines [<xref rid="pone.0254211.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Although there is a renewed focus on scaling up TPT as part of elimination efforts [<xref rid="pone.0254211.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], little is known about the willingness and barriers faced to access LTBI testing and TPT by high-risk asymptomatic populations in high-incidence settings like HWs. A pilot TPT implementation program in Swaziland reported that only 21% of eligible HWs started TPT, with barriers to acceptance including limited understanding of how TPT reduces TB risk, side effects, and access to medication (isoniazid in this study) [<xref rid="pone.0254211.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Given the growing emphasis on LTBI treatment in high-risk populations that include HWs [<xref rid="pone.0254211.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], there is an urgent need to understand HW perspectives and practices on LTBI testing and treatment to develop and implement guidelines.</p>
              <p>Studies examining HW clinical practice report a considerable gap between knowledge of a best practice and actually doing it, known as the “know-do gap” [<xref rid="pone.0254211.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0254211.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices (KAP) surveys and explanatory model interviews are typically the most prominent frames used to examine HWs’ actions and roles in health systems [<xref rid="pone.0254211.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0254211.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. KAP and other explanatory model studies assume reported belief or knowledge always guide clinical action but, like cognitive theories to understand individual behaviors such as the health belief model [<xref rid="pone.0254211.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and theory of planned behaviour [<xref rid="pone.0254211.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], they present limited insights into the contextual background and dynamic effects of structures like economic and health system factors on individual behaviors [<xref rid="pone.0254211.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0254211.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p>
              <p>A recent systematic review examining barriers and facilitators to TB infection control practices demonstrates that existing data focus on documenting poor TB infection control practices at the facility level and frequently frame the problem as being due to poor implementation of recommended guidelines by HWs, without consideration of the complex contextual factors including the lack of integrated occupational health efforts [<xref rid="pone.0254211.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. There is a critical need for analytic frameworks that capture interactions between individuals and the complex systems, in this case health facilities, in which they function to guide the design of interventions to reduce TB risk. A networked approach to qualitative research has been recommended to enable a deeper understanding of the linkages and multiple interactions between networked elements of TB care [<xref rid="pone.0254211.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], which can be used to develop these analytic frameworks.</p>
              <p>We conducted in-depth interviews with South African HWs in an observational study evaluating LTBI incidence. This qualitative research was done to understand linkages between drivers of HWs’ perspectives and their resultant behavior associated with occupational LTBI testing and treatment. Our overall aim was to develop an analytic framework to understand how HWs perceive occupational TB risk and how mitigating strategies such as TPT could ultimately inform intervention design.</p>

                <p>Our 22 interview participants were a subset of the 187 HWs in the parent SAFE study. For the parent study, medical and nursing staff were approached for participation using convenience sampling by our research nurse, who presented the study to groups of eligible HWs after departmental or ward meetings. For this qualitative study, participants were purposively sampled to achieve systematic representation of different HW professions across a range of departments and to have 50% of participants with a positive baseline LTBI result (based on Quantiferon-Plus testing) that was known to both participant and researcher. To achieve this, our purposive sampling strategy involved dividing participants into five departments: Medicine, Surgery, Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Paediatrics and Emergency and sub-dividing by job description: junior doctor (six), senior doctor (six), junior nurse (five) and senior nurse (five). We used a random number generator (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.randomizer.org" ext-link-type="uri">www.randomizer.org</ext-link>) to select subgroup participants, who would be contacted via telephone. If a participant was unavailable (n = 12: one refused, three were on maternity leave, two were no longer at Tygerberg Hospital, one did not have time, one did not wish interview to be recorded and four did not respond), the next randomly assigned participant for that subgroup was approached. 68% were female. We continued interviews until we reached thematic saturation based on iterative real-time data review.</p>

                <p>In-depth individual in-person interviews consisted of open-ended questions designed to elicit detailed knowledge of LTBI testing and treatment, and TB transmission. Questions addressed perceptions of personal occupational TB risk, individual and systems or infrastructural challenges related to TB transmission, knowledge of LTBI, and HW LTBI testing and treatment. We piloted our interview guide with two research nurses and made revisions to ensure our questions were clear and simply phrased. Interviews were conducted by a trained research team member (AvdW), who was a female medical student familiar with Tygerberg Hospital but was unfamiliar to participants. This combination of insider and outsider perspectives may have helped the interviewer to create rapport with participants. The interviews were conducted in English (spoken by all participants) in private locations on hospital premises between July 2<sup>nd</sup>-26<sup>th</sup> 2018. Participants did not receive reimbursement or incentives. Interviews averaged 45 minutes and were audio-recorded with permission. Field notes were used to contextualise findings. After each interview, a transcript was obtained using a professional transcriptionist and quality reviewed and corrected (AvdW, RRN). Transcripts were not returned to participants for review. Interview audio-recordings and transcripts were reviewed iteratively and adaptations were accordingly made to our interview guide (AvdW, RRN, AJM).</p>

                <title>Data analysis plan and Development of the TB-CARD framework</title>
                <p>When planning our analysis, we wanted to develop a dynamic framework that analyzed interactions between HW perceptions and behaviors within the complex hospital ecosystem. Our initial thematic analysis was inductive. All interview transcripts were coded to identify key recurring themes from within the data. Interrater reliability was maintained by having the data dually coded by two independent reviewers (RRN and AvdW), with themes reviewed by a third reviewer (AMcD). Four main themes were initially identified. They were: risk perception regarding occupational TB, perceptions related to HWs’ duty of care to patients, TB infection control, and individual versus hospital responsibility for HW protection.</p>
                <p>We then used a networked approach to consider different roles, resources and health systems factors related to occupational TB risk and risk reduction [<xref rid="pone.0254211.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Using risk, care, information, and protection as categories to analyze and organize the themes a second time, we described four revised domains that included 1) individual and systemic constraints and 2) actions that HWs and health systems took in anticipation and as a result of 3) HWs’ risk of occupational TB. Examining all references to constraint and action in a final level of data analysis we noted that a final domain, 4) desire, helped integrate the previous iterations of analysis. In this category we included the ways HWs talked about their desires as related to risk, action, care, and responsibility. Finally, we combined overlapping themes to identify four central domains related to occupational TB risk reduction by HWs, Constraints, Actions, Risks, Desires, or CARD.</p>
                <p>The CARD domains were identified based on our inductive data analysis process. They provide a dynamic, multifactorial analytical frame with which to systematically and represent the dynamic relationship between these broader structures (constraints, risk) with the hospital and interpret HW behavior (actions, desire). Combining individual and systemic factors in a single analytical frame, the CARD framework schematizes and describes the interaction of parts within the networked ecosystem in which HWs function to contextualize and interpret their perspectives about and behavior around LTBI infection and treatment. The authors conducting the analysis are either clinician researchers or anthropologists who are well versed in biomedical data demonstrating the benefits of TPT. Though we worked to bracket these frames, they may have influenced our methods and analysis.</p>

                <p>This HW, along with others, mentioned that they thought progression to active TB generally occurred due to the failure of the immune system to control it, although they acknowledged that people without immune deficiencies could develop TB. This perception may limit uptake of LTBI to only those at highest risk such as PLHIV.</p>
                <p>Most participants were unsure if LTBI could be treated or thought that this should only be done in child contacts of someone with infectious TB.</p>

                <p>Concerns about cost were raised in the context of the risk of re-exposure leading to re-infection, which was perceived to be high. This could affect perceptions about the efficacy of LTBI treatment and trepidation for an endless loop of treatment and re-exposure.</p>
                <p>HWs reported their ability to implement TB infection control was constrained by the nature of their work, technological and hospital infrastructure, education, and cost.

HWs also expressed a desire for more action at the hospital-level to decrease TB transmission.</p>

                <p>Several HWs cited the concern of transmitting TB to patients as a reason for receiving HW testing. All agreed that active TB testing should be provided by the hospital given the increased occupational risk. Some mentioned long-term benefits to the hospital regarding reducing the impact of HW illness on staffing. This linked with health worker expectations of having a safe healthcare environment–both to work in–and for patients to receive care in. Occupational health services that provide active and latent TB testing and treatment were described as a prerequisite for this.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Our study provides an in-depth examination of HWs’ perspectives on LTBI testing and treatment, in the context of unusually high occupational risk in a high TB incidence setting and global impetus for LTBI treatment programs. We derived the novel CARD framework using inductive data analysis and a dynamic and social science informed network model of human behavior to analyze our qualitative data, with a view to informing implementation planning. We demonstrate that LTBI testing and treatment are acceptable and indeed desirable to HWs. Our results suggest HW TB testing and treatment could counteract the perceived inevitability of occupational TB infection that may currently limit risk reduction. We recommend occupational LTBI testing and treatment programmes should be coupled with efforts to strengthen TB infection control, which will reduce HW re-exposure risk. Our CARD analysis highlights the central importance of administrative leadership and infrastructural support, rather than focusing only on HW behaviour change.</p>
              <p>The CARD analytic framework can enable implementation scientists to systematically document the interactions between individual behaviors, social aspirations, knowledge and risks, in the context of the structural, infrastructural, and systemic barriers that shape them (see <bold><xref rid="pone.0254211.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref></bold>). CARD analysis showed that HWs in our interview cohort had a strong desire to prevent themselves from developing TB. They demonstrated acting on this desire by undertaking their own active TB testing privately and seeking care based on the LTBI-positive results obtained through the parent study. CARD also revealed that the majority of HWs in our interview cohort were potentially willing to take TPT if it was recommended and safe. Several HWs cited concerns about their potential risk to patients should they develop TB as a rationale for testing and treatment. This duty of care felt by HWs towards patients may be a source of motivation to emphasize as part of behavior change strategies. Many HWs expressed resignation regarding their perceived intrinsic and inevitable risk of acquiring TB. HWs who discovered that they were not, in fact, infected at baseline were surprised. This suggests that a LTBI testing program may calibrate HWs’ risk perceptions and provide a powerful argument against the futility of efforts to decrease risk (such efforts could include TPT and system-wide TB infection control efforts).</p>
              <p>A key strength of this tool, unlike KAP surveys, is that CARD can capture <italic toggle="yes">desire</italic> and perception of <italic toggle="yes">risk</italic> as well as reported <italic toggle="yes">action</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">constraints</italic>; thereby informing interventions that are more likely to improve health outcomes without stigmatizing HW or blaming implementation challenges on their behavior. We provide an example of how themes from inductive thematic analysis can be categorized into CARD domains and applied to develop actionable strategies based on context-specific data, at the individual and health system level, that can inform the design and implementation of interventions (<bold><xref rid="pone.0254211.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>). The CARD framework also highlighted important potential barriers to LTBI testing and treatment. HWs expressed concerns about side effects of LTBI treatment, which may have been impacted by seeing patients experience side effects of TB drugs. Knowledge of shorter regimens with better safety profiles was also limited. HWs’ desire to reduce their TB risk and willingness to consider TPT was tempered by the broader view of the high risk of re-exposure given current workplace constraints, which many HWs were concerned could compromise long-term treatment efficacy. When HWs sought medical evaluation after obtaining a positive LTBI test result, their physician care providers did not recommend LTBI treatment. This may reflect a training gap for physicians in high incidence settings regarding the perceived efficacy of LTBI treatment and perception that this should only be offered to people with HIV or child contacts. Although people with LTBI have a significantly lower risk (79%) of progressive TB after reinfection than those who are initially uninfected [<xref rid="pone.0254211.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], we are not aware of evidence that suggests LTBI treatment may mitigate this lower risk. TPT has demonstrated a durable effect even in medium and high incidence settings [<xref rid="pone.0254211.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0254211.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0254211.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Several large trials, that included sites in high TB incidence countries, have determined the efficacy and safety of shorter TPT regimens [<xref rid="pone.0254211.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0254211.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0254211.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Use of the CARD framework can thus strengthen the design of evidence based interventions, such as LTBI testing and treatment, by identifying potential barriers (constraints, actions, risks) and enablers (actions, risks, desires). We emphasize that CARD can illuminate the overlap between potential intervention components and highlight the need for multi-pronged approaches to address this type of complex global health problem.</p>
              <p>Several doctors mentioned budgetary constraints as a barrier to HW LTBI testing. This suggests their training exposed them to the lack of adequate funding for high-quality healthcare, with the implication that they appeared to prioritize the potential short-term economic cost to the health system over their personal health. Yet, overwhelmingly the HWs interviewed acknowledged the need for the hospital system to do more to create safe environments for both themselves and patients. Reprioritizing the importance of managerial and administrative measures, which are at the top of the TB infection control hierarchy yet were rarely mentioned by HWs, remains a challenge for TB infection control implementation efforts. We acknowledge the challenges of implementing LTBI testing and treatment in real world hospital settings in high incidence countries, where resources for implementing other TB infection control measures such as expanded triage, airborne isolation capacity, and ventilation, are limited. Nonetheless, we think there is an imperative to reduce the unacceptable risk of occupational TB faced by HWs [<xref rid="pone.0254211.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], which can be mitigated by comprehensive approaches that include LTBI testing and treatment [<xref rid="pone.0254211.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. TB transmission prevention interventions should not focus on changing HW actions alone but must be coupled with administrative and infrastructural support. This could facilitate implementation of recommended TB infection control measures, in conjunction with LTBI testing and TPT as part of an occupational health program, which HWs thought was the responsibility of the hospital to provide. Adopting a multi-pronged approach to addressing HW TB is a necessary component of TB transmission prevention strategies. Incorporating TB infection control within broader health systems strengthening efforts can further these goals [<xref rid="pone.0254211.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].</p>
              <p>It is important to note that HWs’ TB risk in this setting was not simply occupational. HWs’ understood their risk as high due to living in a high transmission setting. HWs’ perception of intrinsic risk likely constrains both individual and administrative action because of its inferred futility. Although our CARD analysis did not reveal major differences in risk perception based on HW profession, it was apparent that for predominantly nurses, risk reduction at the hospital is only one part of a broader urgently needed risk reduction strategy that includes community transmission prevention measures. In contrast, for doctors, risk reduction at the hospital would significantly lower exposure risk. This is reflective of differing individual socio-economic determinants that impact TB risk. This underscores the importance of innovative and comprehensive strategies to reduce TB risk in affected communities, which should similarly include testing and treatment for LTBI.</p>
              <p>Our study was limited to doctors and nurses who chose to enroll in the parent study and may not be representative of all HWs in the academic hospital setting or indeed other settings. Research with HWs in primary care facilities and community health posts is also urgently needed, along with data that elicits perspectives from health system administrators. Since LTBI treatment was not offered as part of the study, HWs reported willingness for TPT was hypothetical. However, the intent of our analysis is to generate an account of perceptions and practices related to HW LTBI testing and treatment intent in a high incidence setting, which we think may have transferability to different practice settings. We hope that this will lead to an iterative process to use the CARD framework to inform data collection about implementation challenges such as the development of occupational health LTBI testing and treatment strategies in conjunction with improved TB transmission prevention measures. Of note, our study was performed prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding the potential impact of COVID-19 on practices related to TB infection control, including the use of PPE, will be important for intervention design. We propose that our study findings, including the development of the CARD framework, may provide critical information to support broader implementation of airborne infection control measures and begin to create a dynamic, analytical approach to qualitative research on interventions such as LTBI testing and treatment.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>Derivation and application of CARD enabled us to understand the desire of HWs in a high incidence setting in a manner that informs their actions to reduce occupational TB high risk in the context of individual- and system-level constraints. Our data suggest that LTBI testing and treatment are acceptable to HWs in high incidence settings and could help to counteract the perceived inevitability of occupational TB infection that currently limits risk reduction action. This must be coupled with efforts to decrease re-exposure through administrative leadership at the facility level to provide infrastructural support for TB infection control implementation and national leadership to decrease TB risk in communities. We propose the CARD analytic framework can be used by implementation scientists to facilitate the development of contextually relevant interventions to address complex global health problems, such as occupational TB.</p>

              <p>Reviewer #1: Complete review has been attached</p>
              <p>The author has not made the data underlying the findings fully available, due to participant narrations in transcripts potentially jeopardizing their anonymity.</p>
              <p>The manuscript has been written in an intelligible fashion and in standard English, but some sentences require minor restructuring.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: This qualitative research study looks at clinician perceptions of occupational health risk of TB infection (LTBI) and disease and the use of TB preventive therapy (TPT) at a teaching hospital in Cape Town, South Africa. The subject is of primary importance, as risk of TB infection and disease is high in this setting, and health workers are at twice the risk compared to the general population given their routine exposure. Based on 22 in-depth interviews with nurses and doctors with both positive and negative LTBI results across 5 hospital departments, the authors make a number of conclusions, most notably, that knowing LTBI status may provide the impetus for clinicians to take TPT and that system-level constraints may prevent this from coming to fruition. In addition, the authors present a unified framework that encourages the consideration of systemic barriers and facilitators in the uptake of interventions among health workers of use to future researchers. The manuscript is very well organised and written, and findings provide important evidence to advocate for routine TB screening and prophylaxis in high-burden clinical settings. There are some concerns with the certainty with which the authors present the findings and the presence of bias toward TPT implementation at all cost, which can be tempered with some additions and revisions to the findings and discussion sections.</p>
              <p>Major suggestions are as follows:</p>
              <p>The methods would benefit from additional information on the authors who conducted the analysis. It should be clear to readers that data is viewed from a biomedical perspective where TPT is of benefit.</p>
              <p>I would caution the authors to shy away from definitive statements around the findings. For example “we demonstrate that LTBI testing and treatment are acceptable and desirable to HWs” (Line 442-443); “CARD analysis demonstrated that HWs have a strong desire to prevent themselves from developing TB” (line 453-4) and discussing what “the majority” of health workers reported with regard to TPT willingness in the study, as these statements misrepresent what can be concluded based on a very small set of data. Qualitative research is intended to provide a deeper understanding of a phenomenon, often from multiple perspectives, not to draw far reaching conclusions for the broader population from which the sample was drawn. The wording around these findings should be softened to reflect the study design. It can be helpful to intersperse limitations within the discussion, as relevant, rather than leaving these for a section at the end, as is typically done in quantitative research. It may also help to touch on the transferability of findings (as opposed to generalisability – line 492), so as not to miss the importance of what has been found.</p>
              <p>The authors present a lot of rich data on barriers and facilitators, some of which is not adequately discussed. Table 1 contains a lot of information, some of which is not presented in text (e.g. stigma) and some for which solutions are oversimplified (e.g. senior physicians should model use of PPE). Rather than try to tackle all of these data in one paper/table, it may be more suitable to discuss the main findings (e.g. knowing LTBI status may improve TPT uptake among HWs) in-depth, while acknowledging the complexity of other factors, and how they might affect uptake. The authors must be cautious not to confuse complex concerns with “training gaps” or “gaps in latent TB understanding.” This displays a bias toward TPT-use without considering the genuine concerns and lived experience of clinicians in this setting.</p>
              <p>For example:</p>
              <p>As TB is endemic and comparatively harder to catch than COVID, it may not be realistic to expect doctors and nurses to wear PPE all the time, especially for those who are also at a high risk outside the hospital environment. It is important to acknowledge that there are real limitations to current infection control practices in this setting, and suggests we need better long-term solutions. This could make TPT even more attractive as an intervention at the institution level.</p>
              <p>Re-exposure is also a reality in this setting. We don’t fully understand how TPT may affect innate immunity, and this concerns some of the clinical staff. It is important to acknowledge these concerns which suggest that not all HWs will opt for TPT until better evidence is available.</p>
              <p>Similarly, side effects of the regimen are a concern, regardless of whether it is IPT, 3HP, or some other regimen. Nurses especially would be familiar with the hardships of side effects based on patient experience. Other research has suggested that this prevents health workers and patients from opting for prophylaxis, which may limit uptake.</p>
              <p>It would also be helpful to readers from outside LMICs to provide some context around cost concerns. What does a TB ward look like? Are negative pressure rooms available? What other competing risks to patients and HWs are present? How might we go about advocating for systemic changes to prevent TB and other nosocomial infections in light of limited resources?</p>
              <p>Minor comments:</p>
              <p>Introduction:</p>
              <p>There are a lot of acronyms introduced that may be unfamiliar to readers outside the field of TB. I would suggest spelling out infection control and Tygerberg hospital to reduce the number of acronyms.</p>
              <p>Line 94: Please reword this sentence, as hypothesis testing is not appropriate for qualitative data, as the findings are inductively derived.</p>
              <p>Methods:</p>
              <p>Was a particular methodological orientation used in this study (e.g. ethnography, grounded theory)?</p>
              <p>Line 144: Who was the interview guide pilot tested on, and were any revisions made? It would be helpful to share the interview guide in a supplement. In particular it would be interesting to note in the findings whether any of the interviewees had previously had TB or lost a colleague to TB.</p>
              <p>Information on gender of participants should be included in methods or findings.</p>
              <p>Lines 164: This section intersperses a lot of findings in the methods. Perhaps this detail would be better shared as a table or graph in the beginning of findings. I leave this to the authors to decide.</p>
              <p>Line 167: It would be helpful to add a line or two explaining a network approach for those who are unfamiliar.</p>
              <p>Lines 172-174: this sentence was a bit confusing and could benefit from rewording.</p>
              <p>Lines 184-85: Is it relevant that these data were analysed in parallel with SAFE study results? Did one inform the other?</p>
              <p>Findings:</p>
              <p>Lines 374-377: This sentence is long and difficult to follow. Please consider rewording.</p>
              <p>Discussion:</p>
              <p>Lines 438-439: I would advise rewording this sentence, as this is not the first study to look at perceptions of TPT in HWs in a high-incidence setting; however, the findings are very relevant.</p>
              <p>Lines 499-501: This is a very important finding and a strength of your approach.</p>

              <p>“If I've got latent TB, I would like to get rid of it”: Derivation of the CARD (Constraints, Actions, Risks, and Desires) Framework informed by South African healthcare worker perspectives on latent tuberculosis treatment.</p>
              <p>Thank you for the opportunity to read and review your manuscript. I particularly enjoyed reading the manuscript, as it is a qualitative study looking at latent TB, which is particularly relevant and a large problem in South Africa. Overall, the author has made compelling points from the perspective of Healthcare workers. However, some revisions are needed. Overall, it is recommended that the author goes back to the manuscript to rephrase or break up certain sentences that are long. Fixing the structure of the sentences will help the overall flow or provide clarity in their statements. It would also be helpful if the author gave some further clarity on some of the challenges or limitations with TB screening given the nature of the occupational health systems, as per the available literature, to further support this statement provided in the introduction. The author makes use of the COREQ guidelines, offering additional detail on the qualitative methodology used. The author also uses an analytical framework which guides and structures the analysis process and results. Thank you for using an innovative and creative approach (as per Figure 1 and Table 1), to address the gaps and issues as discussed in this manuscript. </p>
              <p>1.1 Thank you. We have revised the manuscript for clarity, striving for shorter sentence structure to improve readability.</p>
              <p>Our responses to reviewer comments are in bold with revised text provided in italics. Line references refer to the manuscript version with tracked changes.</p>
              <p>1.2 We have added a sentence about specific challenges for TB screening in line 58-59 including the lack of trained occupational medicine personnel and concerns about confidentiality.</p>

              <p>Additional revision recommendations have been listed below;</p>
              <p>ABSTRACT</p>
              <p>1.3 Line 13: Consider changing starting the sentence with ‘we did’, as this currently sounds more informal, to ‘we conducted’.</p>

              <p> We have made this revision.</p>
              <p>INTRODUCTION</p>
              <p>1.5 Line 88-89: This statement may come through stronger if more clarity was provided</p>
              <p>We edited this statement for clarity:</p>
              <p>There is a critical need for analytic frameworks that capture interactions between individuals and the complex systems, in this case health facilities, in which they function to guide the design of interventions to reduce TB risk.</p>
              <p>1.6 Line 83-97: Suggestion would be to rephrase this sentence to provide further clarity</p>
              <p>We revised this section for clarity:</p>
              <p>We conducted in-depth interviews with South African HWs in an observational study evaluating LTBI incidence. This qualitative research was done to understand linkages between drivers of HWs’ perspectives and their resultant behavior associated with occupational LTBI testing and treatment. Our overall aim was to develop an analytic framework to understand how HWs perceive occupational TB risk and how mitigating strategies such as TPT could ultimately inform intervention design.</p>
              <p>METHODS</p>
              <p>1.7 Line 115-118: ‘For this qualitative study, participants were purposively sampled to achieve systematic representation of a variety of perspectives and have 50% of participants with a positive baseline LTBI result (based on Quantiferon-Plus testing) that was known to both participant and researcher’. Considering including and ‘to have 50%’ so the sentence flows better. </p>
              <p>We have made this revision.</p>
              <p>1.8 As per the COREQ guidelines, could you provide more information on the interviewers training? Were they part of the parent study, or were they unfamiliar to the participants?</p>
              <p>We have clarified in line 177 that the interviewer was unfamiliar to the participants.</p>
              <p>Interviews were conducted by a trained research team member (AvdW), who was a female medical student familiar with Tygerberg Hospital but was unfamiliar to participants.</p>
              <p>1.9 Line 151-154 needs rephrasing </p>
              <p>We have revised this text in lines 185-186 as follows:</p>
              <p>Interview audio-recordings and transcripts were reviewed iteratively and adaptations were accordingly made to our interview guide (AvdW, RRN, AJM).</p>
              <p>1.10 Line 170 – is missing a ‘,’ after context</p>
              <p>We removed this clause as part of our revisions.</p>
              <p>1.11 The author indicates, ‘To interpret HW perspectives in context our initial coding included four main themes: risk perception, regarding occupational TB, perceptions related to HWs’ duty of care to patients, TB-IC, and individual versus hospital responsibility for HW protection’, how were these themes derived? Could the author operationalize this process and how the themes were selected/emerged?</p>
              <p>We have revised this section extensively in response to comments from both reviewers which we hope clarifies this question regarding the identification of themes, please see lines 197-241.</p>
              <p>1.12 Line 164: Please introduce here that the section pertains to the initial analysis that guided the development of the CARD framework, as initially it seems like the author is already presenting some results, which are then later applied to the data for analysis.</p>
              <p>We have revised this section extensively, which we hope clarifies that this is part of our methodology for developing the CARD framework, please see lines 198-247. </p>
              <p>1.13 As per the COREQ guidelines, were transcripts returned to participants for review? Did any participants receive a reimbursement or incentive? How was interrater reliability maintained or final presented themes evaluated amongst the team? </p>
              <p>We have added the following text in lines 180-181 and 184-185 respectively:</p>
              <p>Participants did not receive reimbursement or incentives. </p>
              <p>Transcripts were not returned to participants for review.</p>
              <p>We added the following text in lines 200-202 regarding interrater reliability:</p>
              <p>Interrater reliability was maintained by having the data dually coded by two independent reviewers (RRN and AvdW), with themes reviewed by a third reviewer (AMcD).</p>
              <p>RESULTS</p>
              <p>1.14 The author presents a statement and a quote for each topic, under each theme. It would strengthen the manuscript, if the author offered some clarification or interpretation of the statements and quotations, to strengthen and further represent the sub-theme.</p>
              <p>We have now made revisions throughout the results section such that there is text below and after the quotes that illustrate the themes identified from thematic analysis. This has enabled us to provide additional interpretation of the chosen quotes and statements as requested by the reviewer. We provide an example here:</p>
              <p>Although most HWs had some understanding of LTBI, responses identified knowledge gaps that could constrain future demand and uptake of LTBI testing and treatment. </p>
              <p>Latent TB means you do have TB, but it’s in a dormant, latent phase. So you’re not actually infected yet, but if your immune system would somehow become compromised, it could mean that that latent TB that’s lying there dormant becomes active TB. </p>
              <p>Participant 82: junior nurse, medicine</p>
              <p>This HW, along with others, mentioned that they thought progression to active TB generally occurred due to the failure of the immune system to control it, although they acknowledged that people without immune deficiencies could develop TB. This perception may limit uptake of LTBI to only those at highest risk such as PLHIV.</p>
              <p>1.15 Typo: Line 250 missing a full-stop at the end</p>
              <p>We have made this revision.</p>
              <p>1.16 Could the author unpack or provide more clarity to the following statement: ‘Many reported discomfort, stigma, and potential negative impact on the clinician-patient relationship made it challenging to wear either a mask or a N95 respirator for prolonged periods’.</p>
              <p>We have revised this statement in lines 391-394 for clarity:</p>
              <p>Many HWs reflected on the challenges of wearing either a mask or a N95 respirator for prolonged periods. While these included physical discomfort for the HWs themselves, several raised concerns about the potential negative impact of stigma on the clinician-patient relationship.</p>
              <p>1.17 Consider rephrasing line 289 – 291.</p>
              <p>We have revised these statements in lines 455-456 and 463-464 as suggested:</p>
              <p>No participants reported prior testing for active TB through a health facility based occupational health program. </p>
              <p>Several mentioned making their own decision to undertake private testing with chest radiographs once yearly, due to their concerns about their occupational TB risk. </p>
              <p>1.18 Line 374-377: Consider breaking into smaller sentences.</p>
              <p>We have revised this section in lines 516-519 as suggested:</p>
              <p>Several HWs thought LTBI testing should be offered to staff given the potential benefits of HWs knowing whether they had been infected, which may lead to improved implementation of TB infection control. Others mentioned the importance of being able to provide effective treatment for a testing programme to be worthwhile. </p>
              <p>DISCUSSION</p>
              <p>1.19 Line 439 – 442: The ‘social science informed network model of human behavior’ was not mentioned in the methodology until in the discussion.</p>
              <p>Thank you – we have now clarified this in the methodology in lines 219-220:</p>
              <p>We then used a networked approach to consider different roles, resources and health systems factors related to occupational TB risk and risk reduction[37]. </p>
              <p>1.20 Line 460 – 462: Requires rephrasing </p>
              <p>We have revised these statements in lines 716-719 as suggested:</p>
              <p>Many HWs expressed resignation regarding their perceived intrinsic and inevitable risk of acquiring TB. HWs who discovered that they were not, in fact, infected at baseline were surprised. </p>
              <p>1.21 Line 469 – 475: How are these conclusions regarding the tool derived from the data presented? </p>
              <p>We clarify in lines 726-729 that these are not conclusions but describe how themes identified from thematic analysis can be analyzed using the CARD framework, which enables intervention design to be informed by context-specific data and demonstrate an example of this in Table 1.</p>
              <p>We provide an example of how themes from inductive thematic analysis can be categorized into CARD domains and applied to develop actionable strategies based on context-specific data, at the individual and health system level, that can inform the design and implementation of interventions (Table 1).</p>
              <p>1.22 Line 488 – 492: This longer sentence needs to be broken up; lacks clarity</p>
              <p>We have removed this sentence. </p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: This qualitative research study looks at clinician perceptions of occupational health risk of TB infection (LTBI) and disease and the use of TB preventive therapy (TPT) at a teaching hospital in Cape Town, South Africa. The subject is of primary importance, as risk of TB infection and disease is high in this setting, and health workers are at twice the risk compared to the general population given their routine exposure. Based on 22 in-depth interviews with nurses and doctors with both positive and negative LTBI results across 5 hospital departments, the authors make a number of conclusions, most notably, that knowing LTBI status may provide the impetus for clinicians to take TPT and that system-level constraints may prevent this from coming to fruition. In addition, the authors present a unified framework that encourages the consideration of systemic barriers and facilitators in the uptake of interventions among health workers of use to future researchers. The manuscript is very well organised and written, and findings provide important evidence to advocate for routine TB screening and prophylaxis in high-burden clinical settings. There are some concerns with the certainty with which the authors present the findings and the presence of bias toward TPT implementation at all cost, which can be tempered with some additions and revisions to the findings and discussion sections.</p>
              <p>2.1 Thank you. We have softened the language throughout to address the concern about bias towards TPT implementation and acknowledged the real world challenges of addressing LTBI testing and treatment in HWs, given the constraints in high incidence countries. We have incorporated these suggestions as outlined in more detail below.</p>
              <p>Major suggestions are as follows:</p>
              <p>2.2 The methods would benefit from additional information on the authors who conducted the analysis. It should be clear to readers that data is viewed from a biomedical perspective where TPT is of benefit.</p>
              <p>We have added the following statement in the Methods, lines 238-241 to address this point:</p>
              <p>The authors conducting the analysis are either clinician researchers or anthropologists who are well versed in biomedical data demonstrating the benefits of TPT. Though we worked to bracket these frames, they may have influenced our methods and analysis.</p>
              <p>2.3 I would caution the authors to shy away from definitive statements around the findings. For example “we demonstrate that LTBI testing and treatment are acceptable and desirable to HWs” (Line 442-443); “CARD analysis demonstrated that HWs have a strong desire to prevent themselves from developing TB” (line 453-4) and discussing what “the majority” of health workers reported with regard to TPT willingness in the study, as these statements misrepresent what can be concluded based on a very small set of data. Qualitative research is intended to provide a deeper understanding of a phenomenon, often from multiple perspectives, not to draw far reaching conclusions for the broader population from which the sample was drawn. The wording around these findings should be softened to reflect the study design. It can be helpful to intersperse limitations within the discussion, as relevant, rather than leaving these for a section at the end, as is typically done in quantitative research. It may also help to touch on the transferability of findings (as opposed to generalisability – line 492), so as not to miss the importance of what has been found.</p>
              <p>Thank you. We have softened language throughout. We have also clarified that these statements refer to HWs in our interview cohort (lines 705 and 709) to avoid misrepresentation of these findings to HWs more widely based on limited data.</p>
              <p>We have removed the sentence with the comment about generalizability. We think this comment still applies, since the population studied have a higher than average rate of reinfection which limits study generalizability. We appreciate the suggestions regarding transferability rather than generalizability of our findings and have added text accordingly in lines 859-862:</p>
              <p>However, the intent of our analysis is to generate an account of perceptions and practices related to HW LTBI testing and treatment intent in a high incidence setting, which we think may have transferability to different practice settings.</p>
              <p>2.4 The authors present a lot of rich data on barriers and facilitators, some of which is not adequately discussed. Table 1 contains a lot of information, some of which is not presented in text (e.g. stigma) and some for which solutions are oversimplified (e.g. senior physicians should model use of PPE). Rather than try to tackle all of these data in one paper/table, it may be more suitable to discuss the main findings (e.g. knowing LTBI status may improve TPT uptake among HWs) in-depth, while acknowledging the complexity of other factors, and how they might affect uptake. The authors must be cautious not to confuse complex concerns with “training gaps” or “gaps in latent TB understanding.” This displays a bias toward TPT-use without considering the genuine concerns and lived experience of clinicians in this setting.</p>
              <p>Thank you. Table 1 is intended to be a comprehensive summary table that demonstrates example components of a multi-pronged intervention to address HW TB with a focus on LTBI testing and treatment, based on context-specific data. We think that this will help implementation scientists to consider how the CARD framework can be applied to develop contextually relevant approaches to complex implementation problems such as occupational TB. We sought to address the concerns about oversimplification of solutions by highlighting the need for multi-pronged approaches (lines 748-751) and emphasize that a combination of solutions that are not only focused on individual behavior change (lines 832-834) will be needed:</p>
              <p>We emphasize that CARD can illuminate the overlap between potential intervention components and highlight the need for multi-pronged approaches to address this type of complex global health problem.</p>
              <p>TB transmission prevention interventions should not focus on changing HW actions alone but must be coupled with administrative and infrastructural support.</p>
              <p>We have revised Table 1 to ensure all its contents are appropriately discussed in the text without and distilled the information to avoid unnecessary duplication and improve clarity, while noting that the use of the CARD framework identified overlapping themes with potentially overlapping solutions. We also note that Reviewer 1 found Table 1 to be helpful and informative (comment 1.1).</p>
              <p>We have also added language to acknowledge the genuine concerns and lived experiences of clinicians in this setting regarding the complexity of LTBI testing and treatment, please see response to 2.4.4.</p>
              <p>For example:</p>
              <p>2.4.1 As TB is endemic and comparatively harder to catch than COVID, it may not be realistic to expect doctors and nurses to wear PPE all the time, especially for those who are also at a high risk outside the hospital environment. It is important to acknowledge that there are real limitations to current infection control practices in this setting, and suggests we need better long-term solutions. This could make TPT even more attractive as an intervention at the institution level.</p>
              <p>- We have revised text to address these points in lines 758-761 and 832-836:</p>
              <p>Reprioritizing the importance of managerial and administrative measures, which are at the top of the TB infection control hierarchy yet were rarely mentioned by HWs, remains a challenge for TB infection control implementation efforts.</p>
              <p>TB transmission prevention interventions should not focus on changing HW actions alone but must be coupled with administrative and infrastructural support, in conjunction with LTBI testing and TPT as part of an occupational health program.</p>
              <p>2.4.2 Re-exposure is also a reality in this setting. We don’t fully understand how TPT may affect innate immunity, and this concerns some of the clinical staff. It is important to acknowledge these concerns which suggest that not all HWs will opt for TPT until better evidence is available.</p>
              <p>We are aware of the concerns about the effect of TPT on innate immunity and specifically asked about this as part of our interview guide. However the participants in our interview cohort did not express this concern.</p>
              <p>We also thought it was very important to report that HWs raised re-exposure as a concern, please see lines 732-736:</p>
              <p>HWs desire to reduce their TB risk and willingness to consider TPT was tempered by the broader view of the high risk of re-exposure given current workplace constraints, which many HWs were concerned could compromise long-term treatment efficacy.</p>
              <p>2.4.3 Similarly, side effects of the regimen are a concern, regardless of whether it is IPT, 3HP, or some other regimen. Nurses especially would be familiar with the hardships of side effects based on patient experience. Other research has suggested that this prevents health workers and patients from opting for prophylaxis, which may limit uptake.</p>
              <p>- We have added text to address this in lines 731-733:</p>
              <p>We note that HWs expressed concerns about side effects, which may have been impacted by seeing patients experience side effects of TB drugs. Knowledge of shorter regimens with better safety profiles was also limited.</p>
              <p>2.4.4 It would also be helpful to readers from outside LMICs to provide some context around cost concerns. What does a TB ward look like? Are negative pressure rooms available? What other competing risks to patients and HWs are present? How might we go about advocating for systemic changes to prevent TB and other nosocomial infections in light of limited resources?</p>
              <p>Cost concerns are undoubtedly a major challenge for TB care delivery as increased resources are critical to enable systemic changes to prevent TB and other nosocomial infections. We have revised and added to the text in lines 761-840 as follows, which includes the importance of aligning disease specific efforts within broader health systems strengthening initiatives:</p>
              <p>We acknowledge the challenges of implementing LTBI testing and treatment in real world hospital settings in high incidence countries, where resources for implementing other TB infection control measures such as expanded triage, airborne isolation capacity, and ventilation, are limited. Nonetheless, we think there is an imperative to reduce the unacceptable risk of occupational TB faced by HWs, which can be mitigated by comprehensive approaches that include LTBI testing and treatment. Interventions should not focus on changing HW actions alone but must be coupled with administrative and infrastructural support. This could facilitate implementation of recommended TB infection control measures, in conjunction with LTBI testing and TPT as part of an occupational health programme, which HWs thought was the responsibility of the hospital to provide. Adopting a multi-pronged approach to addressing HW TB is necessary to prioritize the importance of TB transmission prevention. Incorporating TB infection control within broader health systems strengthening efforts can further these goals[46].</p>
              <p>Minor comments:</p>
              <p>2.5 Introduction:</p>
              <p>There are a lot of acronyms introduced that may be unfamiliar to readers outside the field of TB. I would suggest spelling out infection control and Tygerberg hospital to reduce the number of acronyms.</p>
              <p>We have spelled out Tygerberg hospital and TB infection control as suggested.</p>
              <p>2.6 Line 94: Please reword this sentence, as hypothesis testing is not appropriate for qualitative data, as the findings are inductively derived.</p>
              <p>We rephrased this as ‘We aimed to use’.</p>
              <p>Methods:</p>
              <p>2.7 Was a particular methodological orientation used in this study (e.g. ethnography, grounded theory)?</p>
              <p>We used an inductive approach to analyzing our data and reference thematic analysis (see line 189).</p>
              <p>2.8 Line 144: Who was the interview guide pilot tested on, and were any revisions made? It would be helpful to share the interview guide in a supplement. In particular it would be interesting to note in the findings whether any of the interviewees had previously had TB or lost a colleague to TB.</p>
              <p>We revised the text in lines 174-175 as follows:</p>
              <p>We piloted our interview guide with two research nurses and made revisions to ensure our questions were clearly and simply phrased.</p>
              <p>2.9 Information on gender of participants should be included in methods or findings.</p>
              <p>We included this in line 157 of the methods.</p>
              <p>2.10 Lines 164: This section intersperses a lot of findings in the methods. Perhaps this detail would be better shared as a table or graph in the beginning of findings. I leave this to the authors to decide.</p>
              <p>Thank you, we have revised this section extensively to clarify that this is part of the methods, please see lines 197-241.</p>
              <p>2.1.1 Line 167: It would be helpful to add a line or two explaining a network approach for those who are unfamiliar.</p>
              <p>We added the following text in lines 219-220:</p>
              <p>..used a networked approach to consider different roles, resources and health systems factors related to occupational TB risk and risk reduction.</p>
              <p>2.1.2 Lines 172-174: this sentence was a bit confusing and could benefit from rewording.</p>
              <p>We revised this text in lines 220-226 as suggested:</p>
              <p>Using risk, care, information, and protection as categories to analyze and organize the themes a second time, we described four revised domains that included 1) individual and systemic constraints and 2) actions that HWs and health systems took in anticipation and as a result of 3) HWs’ risk of occupational TB. Examining all references to constraint and action in a final level of data analysis we noted that a final domain, 4) desire, helped integrate the previous iterations of analysis.</p>
              <p>2.1.3 Lines 184-85: Is it relevant that these data were analysed in parallel with SAFE study results? Did one inform the other?</p>
              <p>We have removed this sentence.</p>
              <p>Findings:</p>
              <p>2.1.4 Lines 374-377: This sentence is long and difficult to follow. Please consider rewording.</p>
              <p>We have revised this text in lines 616-619 for clarity:</p>
              <p>Several HWs thought LTBI testing should be offered to staff given the potential benefits of HWs knowing whether they had been infected, which may lead to improved implementation of TB-IC measures. Others mentioned the importance of being able to provide effective treatment for a testing programme to be worthwhile.</p>
              <p>Discussion:</p>
              <p>2.1.5 Lines 438-439: I would advise rewording this sentence, as this is not the first study to look at perceptions of TPT in HWs in a high-incidence setting; however, the findings are very relevant.</p>
              <p>We have revised this sentence in lines 689-691 as suggested:</p>
              <p>Our study provides an in-depth examination of HWs’ perspectives on LTBI testing and treatment, in the context of unusually high occupational risk in a high TB incidence setting and global impetus for LTBI treatment programs.</p>
              <p>2.1.6 Lines 499-501: This is a very important finding and a strength of your approach.</p>
              <p>Thank you. </p>
