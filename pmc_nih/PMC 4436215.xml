                  <p>Euglycemic clamps were used to measure insulin sensitivity and muscle biopsies were done at rest and 30 minutes after a single acute exercise bout in 14 healthy participants. Changes in mRNA expression were assessed using microarrays, and miRNA analysis was performed in a subset of 6 of the participants using sequencing techniques. Following exercise, 215 mRNAs were changed at the probe level (Bonferroni-corrected P&lt;0.00000115). Pathway and Gene Ontology analysis showed enrichment in MAP kinase signaling, transcriptional regulation and DNA binding. Changes in several transcription factor mRNAs were correlated with insulin sensitivity, including MYC, r=0.71; SNF1LK, r=0.69; and ATF3, r= 0.61 (5 corrected for false discovery rate). Enrichment in the 5â-UTRs of exercise-responsive genes suggested regulation by common transcription factors, especially EGR1. miRNA species of interest that changed after exercise included miR-378, which is located in an intron of the PPARGC1B gene.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>The global gene expression response of skeletal muscle to acute exercise has been characterized recently in healthy men [<xref rid="pone.0127089.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In the immediate post-exercise period, many genes are increased in expression, and among these are transcription factors (NR4A, EGR1, JUNB, FOS), angiogenic factors such as CYR61, proteins involved in extracellular matrix turnover such as ADAMTS4, and genes in the MAP kinase signaling pathway. The enrichment of transcription factors in exercise early-responsive genes suggests that there is a coordinated transcriptional response that regulates gene expression responses to acute exercise and exercise training, including increases in expression of genes involved in mitochondrial function and aerobic metabolism, which are linked to insulin action [<xref rid="pone.0127089.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p>
              <p>Skeletal muscle contraction and insulin action are inter-twined [<xref rid="pone.0127089.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127089.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Acute exercise and exercise training have a variety of effects on gene expression, ranging from effects on GLUT4 expression to mitochondrial biogenesis and adaptations in structural proteins [<xref rid="pone.0127089.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0127089.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In addition to its effects on aerobic capacity and performance, exercise improves insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle. However, it has become clear that greater insulin sensitivity itself also influences the acute gene expression response of skeletal muscle to exercise [<xref rid="pone.0127089.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], potentially leading to a feed-forward virtuous cycle.</p>
              <p>There is a broad range of insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle in healthy humans [<xref rid="pone.0127089.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. We have shown that even among healthy, nondiabetic individuals, those on the lower end of the distribution of insulin action have lower gene expression responses to exercise [<xref rid="pone.0127089.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This pattern of expression differences suggests that there may be different transcription factor responses to exercise that are related to insulin sensitivity in healthy individuals. Previous studies have shown that PGC-1Î± mRNA and protein responses to exercise may in part be responsible for some of these differences [<xref rid="pone.0127089.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. To date, however, there has been no global, unbiased analysis that has identified an array of exercise-induced transcription factors and other genes that might be related to insulin sensitivity. Therefore, the primary purpose of this study was to determine whether in healthy individuals there is insulin sensitivity-based variation in exercise-induced early response of skeletal muscle genes, particularly those coding for transcription factors.</p>
              <p>It also has become evident that not only does gene expression in muscle change after acute exercise, but the expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) also can be affected by endurance exercise [<xref rid="pone.0127089.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] resistance exercise [<xref rid="pone.0127089.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], aging [<xref rid="pone.0127089.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and plays a role in muscle plasticity [<xref rid="pone.0127089.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. miRNAs are small, 22â25 nt RNA species that are widespread throughout the genome. They reside in introns of genes or in other noncoding regions and act by binding to the 3âUTR of messages to decrease translation or mRNA stability [<xref rid="pone.0127089.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. When miRNAs are present within introns, they often participate in regulation of the pathways involving the âparentâ gene. Although miRNAs generally reduce abundance of proteins coded by the mRNAs with which they interact, they also can increase protein and mRNA abundance when they target inhibitors of transcription. Several miRNAs respond to exercise [<xref rid="pone.0127089.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127089.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], although no unbiased, global analysis has been done, and there is very little known about this or whether miRNA expression after exercise might be related to insulin sensitivity. Therefore, the second purpose of this study was to characterize the global miRNA response to acute exercise in muscle from healthy volunteers with a wide range of insulin sensitivity.</p>

                <p>Fourteen normoglycemic volunteers took part in this study, which was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Arizona State University. All studies were conducted at the Clinical Research Unit at ASU. Informed, written consent was obtained from all subjects. All of the volunteers were sedentary, and no one reported having a change in body weight for at least 6 months before participating in this study. Subjects were instructed not to exercise for 48 hours before study and to maintain their usual diet. All subjects were sedentary and did not report a family history of type 2 diabetes. A medical history, physical examination, 12-lead electrocardiogram, and a complete chemistry panel were obtained, and a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test was performed using American Diabetes Association criteria. No one was taking any medication known to affect glucose metabolism. The design of the study is shown in <xref rid="pone.0127089.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>.</p>

On a day separated from exercise tests by at least one week, and after a 10-h overnight fast, a percutaneous biopsy of the <italic>vastus lateralis</italic> muscle was obtained with a Bergstrom cannula under local anesthesia one hour before the start of insulin infusion. This biopsy served as the resting, non-exercised control. An insulin infusion rate of 80 mUÂ·m<sup>-2</sup> Â·min<sup>-1</sup> was used. The rate of glucose infusion required to maintain euglycemia during the last 30 minutes of the insulin infusion was taken as an estimate of insulin-stimulated glucose disposal, since this insulin infusion rate effectively suppresses endogenous glucose production [<xref rid="pone.0127089.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p>

                  <p>All subjects underwent a single bout of aerobic exercise (<xref rid="pone.0127089.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>), which was conducted on a separate day after determination of VO<sub>2peak</sub>, as described previously [<xref rid="pone.0127089.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], and at least 1 week after the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp. Subjects reported to the Clinical Research Unit at about 7 AM after fasting overnight and exercised on a stationary bicycle. Immediately after completing exercise, the subject had a biopsy of the <italic>vastus lateralis</italic> muscle within 30 min of the end of exercise. The total length of the exercise bout was 48 minutes, consisting of 4 sets, each composed of 8 minutes of cycling at 70% peak heart rate, 2 minutes at 90% peak, and 2 minutes rest.</p>

                  <p>For miRNA analysis, RNA was isolated from frozen muscle using the miRNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Small RNA libraries were prepared according to manufacturerâs instructions for the NEBNext Multiplex Small RNA Kit (New England Biolabs; Ipswich, MA). miRNA sequencing was performed on Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencers (Illumina, San Diego, CA) using Illuminaâs standard protocol using the Illumina cBot and cBot Paired end cluster kit version 3. A total of 2227 miRNAs were sequenced; 16.0% of these probes were present in all specimens, 26.4% were present in greater than one half of subjects. In total, miRNA sequences were positively called for 27.3% of all 2227 possible sequences. The raw data files, metadata and matrix table were deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (GSE66334).</p>

                  <p>Gene expression values were compared at the probe level. Expression values for each probe on the array were log transformed. Pre and post exercise gene expression values in all subjects were compared by paired t-test, and P values were adjusted using the Bonferroni correction (P &lt; 0.00000115). To test the hypothesis that insulin sensitivity is correlated with exercise-induced changes in gene expression, probe signals for mRNAs that significantly responded to exercise (stringent Bonferroni corrected P value) were correlated with rates of insulin stimulated glucose disposal determined with the euglycemic clamps, using the Pearson product moment method (significance set at P&lt;0.05). The raw data files, metadata and matrix table were deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE43219">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE43219</ext-link>).</p>
                  <p>Analysis of the 5â untranslated regions (UTR) of genes responsive to exercise was conducted using PScan software [<xref rid="pone.0127089.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], using both the JASPAR [<xref rid="pone.0127089.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and TRANSFAC databases [<xref rid="pone.0127089.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. We used the -950 to +50 5â UTR region of genes in PScan as the control for statistical analysis and used the stringent Bonferroni P values to determine significance of enrichment of response elements in promoters. Transcription factor binding motif enrichment concordant using both databases was considered significant. For miRNA sequencing, SCS version 1.4.8 data collection software was used. Base-calling was performed using Illuminaâs RTA version 1.12.4.2. A miRNA data analysis pipeline using Casava 1.8 and Flicker 3.0 was used to generate miRNA gene list counts. miRNA target analysis was performed using the microT-CDS tool available through Diana Tools (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://diana.imis.athena-innovation.gr/DianaTools/index.php?r=site/index">http://diana.imis.athena-innovation.gr/DianaTools/index.php?r=site/index</ext-link>) [<xref rid="pone.0127089.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127089.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://david.niaid.nih.gov/">http://david.niaid.nih.gov</ext-link>) was used for all KEGG pathway and Gene Ontology (GO) analysis.</p>

                <title>Effects of exercise on gene expression in skeletal muscle</title>
                <p>Changes in gene expression were assessed using RNA isolated from muscle samples taken under resting conditions and 30 minutes after the completion of exercise. In all subjects, exercise altered mRNA expression significantly for 215 probes (<xref rid="pone.0127089.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>, Bonferroni corrected P &lt; 0.00000115). The majority of these probes, nearly 200, increased in expression. Prominent among the genes represented by the probes that increased in expression were transcription factors (54/215 significant probes), including MYC, JUN, FOS, ATF3, ID1-3, and CTGF. Probes for chemokines and related genes also were well represented (16/215), and included CX3CL1, CCL2, and two metallopeptidases, ADAMTS4 and ADAMTS1. Probes for genes involved in regulation of cell cycle (9/215) included GADD45B and RASSF1. Probes for genes encoding proteins involved in angiogenesis also were represented, including CYR61 and VEGFa. Although mRNA for only one gene encoding a mitochondrial protein was increased significantly (SLC25A25, mitochondrial phosphate carrier), a number of others increased but did not achieve the Bonferroni cutoff. Among these were several Complex I and ATP synthase subunits, SLC2A4, or GLUT4 (P = 0.005) and PPARGC1B (P = 0.039). Only 17 mRNAs decreased significantly by the Bonferroni criterion. Among these were isoforms 1,4,6,7, and 8 of the GIMAP family of nucleotide binding proteins with GTPase activity. David analysis of the probes that had Bonferroni significant changes after exercise in all subjects showed 4.0 and 7.7-fold enrichment (false discovery rate â¤ 5%) in MAP kinase and TGFÎ² signaling pathways (<xref rid="pone.0127089.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Table</xref>). Enrichment in GO molecular function terms was significant for regulation of transcription and GTP binding in the 215 probes entered into DAVID for analysis.</p>

                  <p>To understand which transcription factors might be responsible for the exercise-induced responses of the 130 exercise-induced genes represented by the 215 probes, we analyzed the promoter regions (-950 to +50 bp) of these genes for enrichment in transcription factor response element binding motifs using PScan [<xref rid="pone.0127089.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. We used response element profiles available in both the JASPAR [<xref rid="pone.0127089.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and TRANSFAC [<xref rid="pone.0127089.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] databases.

                <p>To determine the relationships between insulin sensitivity and significant gene expression changes after exercise, fold changes in Bonferroni significant gene expression were correlated with rates of insulin stimulated glucose disposal during a euglycemic clamp. The comparison was done at the probe level, using P values corrected for a false discovery rate of 0.25 using the Benjamini Hochberg method. The results for the three significant correlations are shown in <xref rid="pone.0127089.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>, and included MYC, ATF3, and SNF1LK.</p>

                  <title>Effects of exercise on miRNA expression</title>
                  <p>To quantify miRNA expression, we isolated RNA separately (see <xref rid="sec005" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>) from a subset of 6 individuals who had sufficient muscle biopsy material remaining after mRNA analyses. miRNA expression was quantified using next generation sequencing techniques from biopsies taken basally and 30 minutes after completion of the exercise bout. Data, expressed as normalized reads and log<sub>2</sub> (fold increase with exercise) are given in <xref rid="pone.0127089.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Thirteen miRNA species were altered significantly (Bonferroni corrected P value) after exercise; all of these increased. Among these, several miRNAs in the miR-378 family, namely miR-378a-3p, -378a-5p, -378f, -378g, and -378i all increased. In general, â-3pâ species of miRNAs from a stem loop sequence are more abundant than the â-5pâ species, being selectively included in the RISC complex [<xref rid="pone.0127089.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In keeping with this, miR-378a-3p was dramatically more abundant than miR-378a-5p. miR-30a-5p and miR-30d-5p also significantly increased. Only two miRNAs decreased after exercise, miR-144-5p and -144-3p, but these decreases were not statistically significant. Changes in miRNA were not correlated with insulin sensitivity. Several miRNAs were in introns of genes involved in metabolic events, including miR-378a-3p and miR-378-5p (intron 1 of PPARGC1B, which also increased after exercise) and miR-378f (within the CNR2, cannabinoid receptor 2 gene). We also searched predicted mRNA targets of miRNAs that changed after exercise to determine overlap between those targets and any exercise-induced mRNA changes. Only GIMAP8 and NRF4A3 mRNAs, predicted targets of hsa-miR-10a-5p, also were exercise-responsive (<xref rid="pone.0127089.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Table</xref>).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>A number of studies have examined how acute exercise alters gene expression in skeletal muscle [<xref rid="pone.0127089.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127089.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127089.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. A recent global analysis showed that acute endurance exercise conducted by healthy, middle-aged men has profound effects on gene expression in exercising muscle [<xref rid="pone.0127089.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Among the genes most profoundly increased in that study were NR4A family members, ADAMST1 (involved in extracellular matrix metabolism), and additional transcription factors including FOS, JUNB, and EGR1 [<xref rid="pone.0127089.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. We confirmed here the previously reported exercise response for many of those genes. However, we had shown previously that the period immediately following an exercise bout is critical for defining the exercise response particularly in relationship to insulin action [<xref rid="pone.0127089.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], and we proposed that lower gene expression responses to exercise in individuals with insulin sensitivity on the lower end of the normal range might exacerbate a poor response to insulin. Therefore, the primary purpose of this study was to extend and enhance previous studies by determining how exercise-induced gene expression is influenced by insulin sensitivity in a global, unbiased manner.</p>
              <p>To accomplish this, we performed microarray analysis of RNA isolated from muscle biopsies taken at rest and 30 minutes after completion of exercise in 14 healthy subjects who also had euglycemic clamps to measure insulin sensitivity. This analysis revealed that, at the probe level, 215 mRNAs were altered significantly (Bonferroni corrected P &lt; 0.0000015) by exercise. The vast majority of these mRNAs (198) were increased following exercise. Genes encoding transcription factor or DNA binding proteins were the most represented (about 25%). Also represented were chemokines, cell cycle regulators, genes involved in angiogenesis, and extracellular matrix formation. Genes coding cell-signaling proteins also were represented, with the beta 2 adrenergic receptor and a proton-sensing G-protein coupled receptor (GPR4) increasing, along with mRNA for an orphan receptor, GPR157. Changes in mRNA of representative genes were in general confirmed by Q-rt-PCR, as we noted previously [<xref rid="pone.0127089.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Pathway and GO term analysis using DAVID (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://david.niaid.nih.gov/">http://david.niaid.nih.gov</ext-link>) confirmed that transcriptional regulation and DNA binding GO terms were highly enriched. The MAP kinase pathway also was highly enriched, again reinforcing the notion that the immediate post-exercise period is characterized in healthy muscle by a broad response of transcription factors, stress response, growth and differentiation genes, and angiogenic factors. These early exercise-induced changes are likely to coordinate a longer term pattern of response. In this respect, the present findings confirm earlier results [<xref rid="pone.0127089.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p>
              <p>Because of the preponderance of transcription factors in exercise-responsive genes, we further extended previous findings [<xref rid="pone.0127089.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and our earlier results [<xref rid="pone.0127089.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] by analyzing the 5â-UTRs of all exercise responsive genes to determine whether there might be a pattern of common exercise-enhanced transcription factors that could be candidates for âmasterâ regulators of the immediate post-exercise response. One of the more intriguing transcription factors that had a binding motif significantly enriched in exercise-responsive genes was EGR1, or early growth response 1 [<xref rid="pone.0127089.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. EGR1 itself had an 11.4-fold increase in expression after exercise. EGR1 is expressed in response to a variety of stimuli [<xref rid="pone.0127089.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and is induced in electrically-contracted mouse muscle within 30 minutes [<xref rid="pone.0127089.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Other studies show that EGR1 is responsive to MAP kinase signaling [<xref rid="pone.0127089.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], which is interesting in light of the effect of exercise on MAP kinase pathway members. EGR1 also is involved in VEGF signaling [<xref rid="pone.0127089.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. These analyses, taken together with our earlier data and previous findings, suggest the possibility that EGR1, through MAP kinase and VEGF signaling pathways, may integrate the early gene expression response to exercise.</p>
              <p>However, the primary purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between insulin sensitivity in muscle and the gene expression response to exercise. It is commonly accepted that otherwise healthy individuals display a wide range of insulin action in muscle [<xref rid="pone.0127089.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. We and others reported previously that in healthy people muscle that has lower insulin sensitivity also exhibits characteristics of âexercise resistanceâ, in that there are differences in gene expression responses to exercise that might subsequently contribute to even lower insulin sensitivity or altered mitochondrial function [<xref rid="pone.0127089.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127089.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127089.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127089.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127089.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. To address this question we correlated exercise-induced changes in mRNA expression at the probe level with insulin sensitivity determined using a euglycemic clamp. To minimize false positives, for this analysis we only used probes that were changed at the Bonferroni significant level of 0.00000115. Among the genes that had Bonferroni-significant exercise-induced changes that were correlated with insulin sensitivity were transcription factors such as MYC and ATF3. These transcription factors are common to many genes, and therefore if their expression after exercise is dependent upon the level of insulin sensitivity, even in healthy individuals, this suggests that there could be a widespread effect of insulin sensitivity on the exercise response. Since these effects were seen merely 30 minutes after exercise, they likely are mediating differences at later time points, compelling a thorough, global time course analysis of gene expression after exercise that is beyond the scope of the present study. Another gene, SNF1LK, also had changes that were correlated with insulin sensitivity. This genes is involved in muscle development and differentiation. SNF1LK is a CREB dependent gene that phosphorylates HDAC4 and HDAC5, which promotes expression of MEF2 isoforms and their downstream genes that mediate growth and differentiation in skeletal muscle [<xref rid="pone.0127089.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Therefore, key exercise-induced processes involved in muscle gene expression, growth, and differentiation appear to be affected by the level of insulin sensitivity in healthy individuals, with those on the lower end of the insulin action spectrum having lower responses. These findings reinforce and extend previous studies showing that responses to exercise are related to insulin sensitivity. Blunted responses at the lower end of the insulin action spectrum that have been observed include effects on whole body or leg glucose uptake [<xref rid="pone.0127089.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], mitochondrial response [<xref rid="pone.0127089.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], and PGC-1Î± and downstream genes [<xref rid="pone.0127089.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127089.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127089.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. These findings lead to the working hypothesis that lower insulin sensitivity leads to lower exercise-induced gene expression response and less muscle adaptation to exercise, which could in turn lead to lower insulin action.</p>
              <p>A second reason for performing this study was to characterize the microRNA response to exercise in healthy people in an unbiased manner by using sequencing techniques. As was the case for mRNA changes, a number of miRNAs responded briskly within 30 minutes of the end of exercise. Among these, members of the miR-30, miR-128, and miR-378 families were well represented and abundant in human muscle. Next generation sequencing techniques allowed for high specificity of quantification. The known and predicted targets of these miRNAs include several mRNAs that directly pertain to both exercise-induced mRNA responses and muscle insulin sensitivity. For example, there are multiple predicted miR-378 and miR-30 sites in the 3âUTR of the PPARA gene. Also pertinent may be that miR-378 and miR-30 have interaction sites in the 3â-UTR regions of both PPARGC1A and PPARGC1B. Because miR-378a is located within intron 1 of the PPARGC1B gene, these data support the idea that there may be a regulatory network consisting of PPARs, PGC-1 isoforms, and micro RNAs that participate in the exercise-induced gene expression response. It is conceivable that dysregulation of expression of miRNA-378 could be a component of insulin resistance in skeletal muscle and might be responsible for the decreased PGC-1Î± response seen after exercise in insulin resistant skeletal muscle, possibly by a feedback mechanism [<xref rid="pone.0127089.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Recently, miR-378 isoforms have been implicated in the control of mitochondrial function and energy balance in mice [<xref rid="pone.0127089.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Carrer and colleagues used a mouse that had miR-378-3p and -5p deleted, while leaving the PPARGC1B gene intact [<xref rid="pone.0127089.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. These mice were resistant to diet-induced obesity, possibly due to effects in liver. Thus, the changes seen in miR-378 in muscle following exercise could also have effects on mitochondrial function, metabolism or insulin sensitivity. Further studies are required to define these effects. We also searched predicted mRNA targets for miRNAs that were responsive to exercise. Of these, only hsa-miR-10a-5p and predicted mRNA targets GIMAP8 and NRF4A3 stood out as being involved in exercise responses. GIMAP8 expression was one of the few mRNAs that decreased after exercise (along with other GIMAP isoforms), and so it may be significant that hsa-miR-10a-5p expression that increased. However, the changes in GIMAP expression with respect to either exercise or skeletal muscle itself are unclear, as these genes do not have a described function in muscle. Finally, since miRNA responses were not related to insulin sensitivity, it can be concluded that alterations in these responses are not involved in the phenomenon of âexercise resistanceâ [<xref rid="pone.0127089.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Nevertheless, it is becoming more evident that miRNA expression plays a role in muscle plasticity in response to aging or exercise [<xref rid="pone.0127089.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127089.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p>
              <p>Several other studies in addition to that by Catoire <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0127089.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] have examined gene expression or protein abundance responses to an exercise bout, but have not addressed insulin sensitivity-related differences. Mahoney and colleagues studied mRNA changes in muscle from young, healthy subjects 3 after an hour of high intensity and found a number of transcription factors and genes coding mitochondrial proteins to be increased [<xref rid="pone.0127089.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Using rats that exercised for 2 hours, McKenzie <italic>et al</italic>. found mRNA for a number of transcription factors and signal transduction proteins to be increased one hour after exercise, including ATF3, agreeing with the current results [<xref rid="pone.0127089.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Jozsi <italic>et al</italic>. compared the response to a single bout of resistance exercise in young and healthy older men [<xref rid="pone.0127089.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In general, the older men had greatly reduced gene expression responses, with the transcription factor EGR-1 showing an increase in older subjects and a decrease in the young men, while other genes involved in angiogenesis (VEGF) or c-jun, increased similarly. Using mice, Safdar and colleagues examined the expression of mRNAs for selected genes, including PGC-1Î±, after a single bout of exercise [<xref rid="pone.0127089.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. As others have shown in rodents and humans, PGC-1Î± mRNA increased after exercise [<xref rid="pone.0127089.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127089.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. A number of other investigators have examined how exercise training, as opposed to a single bout of exercise, alters gene expression or protein abundance in skeletal muscle. These studies have used designs comparing trained and sedentary individuals, or comparing the same individuals before and after training. In general, the studies that use training [<xref rid="pone.0127089.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0127089.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] show more consistent increases in genes coding for mitochondrial proteins or proteins involved in metabolism than were found in the current study.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, a single bout of exercise robustly alters skeletal muscle gene expression in a manner that is related to insulin sensitivity. The response of transcription factor gene expression to exercise, especially those transcription factors that have insulin sensitivity-related responses provides avenues of research that may help to explain this phenomenon and its relevance. This study in humans may indicate the importance of the altered exercise response in insulin resistance, and point to MAP kinase and VEGF signaling, possibly through EGR1 and a limited number of transcription factors.</p>
