              <abstract>
                <p>The Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor S100A1 is essential for proper endothelial cell (EC) nitric oxide (NO) synthase (eNOS) activation. S100A1 levels are greatly reduced in primary human microvascular ECs subjected to hypoxia, rendering them dysfunctional. However mechanisms that regulate S100A1 levels in ECs are unknown. Here we show that ECs transfected with a S100A1–3′ untranslated region (UTR) luciferase reporter construct display significantly reduced gene expression when subjected to low oxygen levels or chemical hypoxia. Bioinformatic analysis suggested that microRNA -138 (MiR-138) could target the 3′UTR of S100A1. Patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI) or mice subjected to femoral artery resection (FAR) displayed increased MiR-138 levels and decreased S100A1 protein expression. Consistent with this finding, hypoxia greatly increased MiR-138 levels in ECs, but not in skeletal muscle C2C12 myoblasts or differentiated myotubes or primary human vascular smooth muscle cells. Transfection of a MiR-138 mimic into ECs reduced S100A1–3 ‘UTR reporter gene expression, while transfection of an anti MiR-138 prevented the hypoxia-induced downregulation of the reporter gene. Deletion of the 22 nucleotide putative MiR-138 target site abolished the hypoxia-induced loss of reporter gene expression. Knockdown of Hif1-α mediated by siRNA prevented loss of hypoxia-induced reporter gene expression. Conversely, specific activation of Hif1-α by a selective prolyl-hydroxylase inhibitor (IOX2) reduced reporter gene expression even in the absence of hypoxia. Finally, primary ECs transfected with a MiR-138 mimic displayed reduced tube formation when plated onto Matrigel matrix and expressed less NO when stimulated with VEGF. These effects were reversed by gene transfer of S100A1 using recombinant adenovirus. We conclude that hypoxia-induced MiR-138 is an essential mediator of EC dysfunction via its ability to target the 3′UTR of S100A1.</p>

              <p>Lack of agonist-induced eNOS activation leads to endothelial dysfunction and predisposes to a host of cardiovascular pathologies <xref rid="pone.0078684-Forstermann1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. We have recently identified the small EF-hand Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding protein S100A1 as part of an important molecular toolkit that relays intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations and regulates vascular tone. Patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI) are known to have impaired vasodilatory responses <xref rid="pone.0078684-Brevetti1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, and present with greatly reduced levels of S100A1 in ischemic muscle tissue <xref rid="pone.0078684-Most1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. We were able to show that S100A1 directly interacts with eNOS, prevents PKC-mediated phosphorylation of the inhibitory Thr-495 site on eNOS and augments eNOS enzymatic activity in ECs <xref rid="pone.0078684-Most1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Loss of S100A1 attenuates induction of angiogenesis in response to acute tissue ischemia, thereby preventing relief of tissue malperfusion. Thus mice genetically deficient in S100A1 suffer limb loss when subjected to femoral artery resection (FAR) <xref rid="pone.0078684-Most1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. S100A1 levels in ECs are rapidly lost upon exposure to hypoxia and this correlates with a loss of stimulus-induced NO production <xref rid="pone.0078684-Most1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Given the importance of S100A1 to the regulation of eNOS activity and overall EC physiology, we set out to investigate ischemia-induced mechanisms that regulate S100A1 expression levels in ECs. Rapid downregulation of S100A1 specifically in ECs suggested existence of post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms, possibly involving microRNAs (MiRs). MiRs are short, ≈22 nucleotide long regulatory RNAs that suppress gene expression by binding to the 3′ untranslated region (3′UTR) of target mRNAs, inhibiting their translation and/or augmenting mRNA degradation <xref rid="pone.0078684-Nelson1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Here we report that MiR-138 targets the 3′UTR of S100A1 and regulates its expression in a hypoxia-dependent manner specifically in ECs.</p>

The hypoxia reporter plasmid of the P4HA2 gene promoter (cat # S721928) was used to confirm the induction of hypoxia. 3′UTR control plasmid (cat # S804753) with SV40 T antigen 3′UTR and β-actin control plasmid (cat # S717678) with β-actin promoter were used as controls for transfection efficiency. A 3′UTR control reporter having the same promoter (RPL10) but linked to the SV40 T antigen 3′UTR gave high expression, that did not decrease upon treatment with gas or chemical hypoxia, while a hypoxia reporter construct that employed the P4HA2 promoter and SV40-3′UTR displayed about 4.8 (±1.2) fold induction upon exposure to CoCl<sub>2</sub> (not shown). A gene block (IDT) comprising the entire S100A1 3′UTR, but lacking specifically the 22 nucleotide putative MiR-138 target site, was subcloned NheI to XhoI into the luciferase reporter vector to generate the ΔMiR-138 construct. All constructs were verified by sequencing using Jefferson’s genomics facility.</p>

S100A1 protein expression in primary human microvascular ECs is drastically repressed by chemical hypoxia (CoCl<sub>2</sub>, 250 µmol/L, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078684-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), the rapidity of which suggested involvement of post-transcriptional mechanisms, possibly involving micro-RNAs (MiRs). MiRs typically bind to the 3′UTR of target mRNAs, repressing their translation or leading to their degradation <xref rid="pone.0078684-Nelson1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. In order to specifically examine the role of the 3′UTR in the potential regulation of S100A1 protein expression, we assessed expression of a S100A1-3′UTR luciferase reporter gene in human EA.hy926 ECs, subjected to low oxygen (1%O<sub>2</sub>) or chemical hypoxia (CoCl<sub>2</sub> or Desferroxamine, Des).

                <p>Regulation of gene expression by the 3′UTR suggested possible involvement of a regulatory microRNA <xref rid="pone.0078684-Nelson1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The 3′UTR of S100A1 is relatively short (196 bases for the human and 186 bases for the murine isoform). Since both human and murine S100A1 genes appear subject to the same degree of hypoxia-induced downregulation <xref rid="pone.0078684-Most1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, we reasoned it likely that a conserved micro RNA would target a species-conserved region of the 3′UTR. Using MiRanda (at microrna.org) <xref rid="pone.0078684-Betel1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> we conducted a database search for conserved micro RNAs that would target both the human and mouse S100A1 3′UTR. The only micro RNA that registered a “hit” for S100A1–3′UTR of both species was microRNA–138 (MiR-138). This micro RNA is encoded by two different intergenic loci on chromosomes 3 and 16 for hsa-MiR-138-1 and hsa-MiR-138-2 respectively (mouse chromosomes 9 and 8 resp.). Deep sequencing reads overwhelmingly detect only the 5p segment of both MiR-138-1 and MiR-138-2 <xref rid="pone.0078684-Bar1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0078684-Stark1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. The mature MiR-138 is conserved between human and mouse and alignment of the human and mouse S100A1–3′UTRs with MiR-138 shows the binding site of this micro RNA to be in the most conserved region of the 3′UTR (95% identical) whereas the rest of the S100A1-3′UTR shares ∼70% identity between the two species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0078684.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Indeed hypoxia (induced by either low oxygen or chemical reagents) drastically increased expression of MiR-138 in both EA.hy926 as well as primary microvascular ECs (HMVEC, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078684-g001">Figure 1C</xref>).</p>
                <p>In order to verify the potential targeting of S100A1 by MiR-138, we co-transfected a MiR-138 mimic (Dharmacon) together with the S100A1–3′UTR reporter into EA.hy926 cells. The MiR-138 mimic reduced reporter gene expression by over 95% after 24 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078684-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). When transfected into primary HMVECs the mimic significantly reduced S100A1 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078684-g002">Figure 2B</xref>), reminiscent of that achieved by chemical hypoxia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078684-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), while transfection with a scrambled control mimic did not change reporter gene expression. Confirmation of the role of MiR-138 in the regulation of S100A1 was obtained by deleting the putative 22 nucleotide MiR-138 target site within the S100A1–3′UTR of the luciferase reporter. This construct (ΔMiR-138), in all other elements identical to the wild-type (WT) S100A1–3′UTR reporter, showed no reduction of gene expression when transfected into EA.hy926 cells subjected to chemical hypoxia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078684-g002">Figure 2C</xref>).</p>

Transfection of the antagomir-138 completely prevented the loss of S100A1 protein expression, while a scramble control antagomir had no effect on the hypoxia-induced downregulation of S100A1 expression in HMVECs. This indicates that hypoxia regulates S100A1 expression in ECs predominantly via MiR-138 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078684-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Confirmation of this was also obtained by co-transfecting a hairpin anti-MiR-138 (antimir-138, Dharmacon) into EA.hy926 ECs together with the S100A1-3′UTR reporter.

In support of a crucial role of MiR-138 in the regulation of endothelial S100A1 expression, we found that levels of MiR-138 were significantly increased in samples taken from both human patients with CLI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078684-g006">Figure 6A</xref>) and ischemic mouse gastrocnemius muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078684-g006">Figure 6B</xref>), while expression of housekeeping small nucleolar RNAs RD44 and RD47 did not change, demonstrating that tissue ischemia leads to an increase in MiR-138 that could potentially be responsible for the observed downregulation of S100A1. It is likely that the majority of the observed increase in MiR-138 under this pathological condition is attributable to the EC compartment, given that both skeletal muscle cells as well as vascular smooth muscle cells do not demonstrate a significant increase of MiR-138 when subjected to hypoxia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078684-g003">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078684-g004">4</xref>).</p>

                <p>The hypoxia-induced increase in MiR-138 led us to examine the contribution of the transcription factor hypoxia-induced factor 1-α (Hif1-α) to the regulation of MiR-138 expression.

The critical role of Hif1-α in the induction of MiR-138 in ECs was proven by siRNA-induced silencing of Hif1-α, which completely prevented the hypoxia-induced downregulation of reporter gene activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078684-g007">Figure 7D</xref>).</p>

                <p>In order to examine the physiological relevance of increased EC MiR-138 expression we transfected primary HMVEC with the MiR-138 mimic and tested the ability of these cells to form capillary-like tube networks on Matrigel matrix. Tube formation was greatly reduced in MiR-138 mimic transfected cells, coincident with greatly reduced levels of S100A1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078684-g008">Figures 8A, B</xref>, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0078684.s003">Figure S3</xref> for the original, non-digitized, photo-micrographs). Infection with recombinant adenovirus expressing S100A1 <xref rid="pone.0078684-Brinks1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> re-established S100A1 levels to near normal in MiR-138 mimic transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078684-g008">Figure 8B</xref>), and re-established tube formation capability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078684-g008">Figure 8A</xref>).

While total eNOS levels remained unchanged in MiR-138 mimic transfected ECs, the reduction of S100A1 greatly increased eNOS phosphorylation on Thr-495, a demonstrated eNOS inhibitory site <xref rid="pone.0078684-Fleming1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078684-g008">Figure 8B</xref>). This change in eNOS phosphorylation also was normalized upon re-expression of physiologic levels of S100A1, even in the continued presence of the MiR-138 mimic. Physiologically, the increased phosphorylation of Thr-495 induced by the MiR-138 mimic abolished VEGF stimulated NO production in ECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078684-g009">Figure 9</xref>). Restoration of physiological levels of S100A1, even in the presence of MiR-138 mimic, normalized the VEGF-stimulated NO production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078684-g009">Figure 9</xref>). Both capillary network formation on matrigel matrix and stimulus induced NO formation are considered hallmarks of healthy endothelial cell function. Since NO production contributes to the pro-angiogenic actions of VEGF <xref rid="pone.0078684-Papapetropoulos1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, these experiments provide conclusive evidence for the pathophysiological relevancy of increased MiR-138 expression and subsequent suppression of S100A1 in ECs.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Appropriate expression of S100A1 appears essential for correct intracellular signaling in large variety of different cell types. On a cellular level, S100A1 expression is highest in cardiomyocytes where this Ca<sup>2+</sup>- binding EF-hand protein orchestrates the complex Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluxes required for optimal excitation–contraction coupling <xref rid="pone.0078684-Most2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, however this protein is also found in significant quantities in skeletal muscle myofibers <xref rid="pone.0078684-Prosser1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, neurons <xref rid="pone.0078684-Benfenati1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, and ECs <xref rid="pone.0078684-Most1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0078684-Pleger1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, amongst others. First evidence of an important contribution of S100A1 to EC physiology was gleaned from the hypertensive phenotype of S100A1 gene deficient mice, which presented with impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation <xref rid="pone.0078684-Pleger1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Subsequently we showed that S100A1 is an essential activator of eNOS and is required for post-natal vascular angiogenesis in response to ischemia <xref rid="pone.0078684-Most1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Pathophysiologic relevance may be derived from the observation that S100A1 levels are severely downregulated <xref rid="pone.0078684-Most1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, while MiR-138 levels are increased, in both human muscle biopsies procured from patients with CLI, as well as mice with induced limb ischemia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078684-g006">Figure 6</xref>). It is now clear that distinct regulatory mechanisms govern expression of S100A1 in different cell types. First evidence of this was obtained in isolated ECs and myofibers where hypoxia induces a rapid loss of S100A1 selectively in ECs <xref rid="pone.0078684-Most1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p>
              <p>Here we report, for the first time, on the mechanisms by which S100A1 expression is selectively regulated in ECs (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078684-g010">Figure 10</xref> for a proposed scheme). The most important finding of our work is the identification of MiR-138 as a crucial determinant of S100A1 expression in ECs subjected to hypoxia. It is clear that MiR-138 itself is dynamically regulated in response to low oxygen levels in a cell-type specific manner. It is tempting to speculate that one or both of the MiR-138 genes may be direct targets of Hif1-α, since we have shown here that this transcription factor is indispensable for the hypoxia-induced expression of MiR-138 and the subsequent repression of S100A1. In this light it is interesting to note that MiR-138 has been reported to directly target Hif1-α in cultured cells <xref rid="pone.0078684-Song1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0078684-Yeh1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, potentially allowing for feed-back control of MiR-138 expression during hypoxia. However, we can not rule out other ways by which MiR-138 expression is controlled since processing of the mature MiR-138 from the pre-MiR-138 also appears to be a regulated step in some tissues <xref rid="pone.0078684-Obernosterer1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Furthermore it is clear that hypoxia, <italic>per se</italic>, does not increase MiR-138 levels in all cells, as we have shown that C2C12 skeletal muscle cells, while expressing both MiR-138 and S100A1, do neither increase MiR-138, nor decrease S100A1 when subjected to hypoxia. While a recent report by Li et al. demonstrated a hypoxia-induced increase of MiR-138 in airway smooth muscle cells <xref rid="pone.0078684-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, we did not observe a significant hypoxia-induced change in either MiR-138 or S100A1 expression in primary human vascular smooth muscle cells, however it is likely that the significant differences in smooth muscle cell type (airway vs. microvascular) and the different species (rat in the study by Li et al. vs human in ours) are at least partly responsible for the observed differences.</p>

                  <p>(<bold>1</bold>) Under normal oxygen tension, the transcription factor Hif1-α is continuously hydroxylated by the action of cellular prolyl-hydroxylases (PHDs) in a reaction that requires Fe<sup>2+</sup> and O<sub>2</sub> as co-factors. (<bold>2</bold>) Hydroxylation of Hif1-α promotes binding of the Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)-E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, promoting poly-ubiquitination and (<bold>3</bold>) degradation via the 26S proteasome complex. The action of PHDs are inhibited directly by IOX2 and Cobalt and indirectly by iron chelators, such as Desferroxamine (Des) as well as low oxygen levels. (<bold>4</bold>) Under low oxygen tension the Hif1-α protein becomes stabilized in the nucleus and promotes transcription of the pro-angiogenic vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene. VEGF promotes activation of eNOS by signaling through VEGFR2, promoting phosphorylation of the stimulatory Ser-1177 site. Increased eNOS activity raises nitric oxide (NO) production, which inhibits PHDs, further promoting Hif1-α stabilization in a positive feed-back loop. (<bold>5</bold>) To maintain cellular homeostasis, stabilization of Hif1-α also promotes increased production of MiR-138, (<bold>6</bold>) which binds to the 3′UTR of the S100A1 mRNA, leading to drastically reduced S100A1 levels and reduction of eNOS activity by promoting phosphorylation of the inhibitory Thr-495 site (<bold>7</bold>), in a counterbalancing negative feed-back loop. Endothelial dysfunction develops when these carefully balanced multiple feedback loops become dysregulated allowing for prolonged MiR-138 expression with consequent loss of S100A1 and reduced eNOS activity.</p>
