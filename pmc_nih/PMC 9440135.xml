                <p id="Par1">In this phase I dose-escalation trial, we assess the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Bermekimab in combination with Nanoliposomal Irinotecan (Nal-Iri) and 5-Fluorouracil/Folinic Acid (5-FU/FA). Secondarily, we investigate effects on weight, lean body mass, quality-of-life, the gut microbiome composition, inflammatory biomarkers, progression-free survival, and overall survival. This was a single-arm, open-label adaptive Bayesian dose-escalation study of Bermekimab combined with Nal-Iri and 5FU/FA in patients with advanced or locally advanced PDAC who failed gemcitabine-based chemotherapy. 22 patients enrolled between 2017 and 2019. 3 of 21 patients experienced dose-limiting toxicities attributable to the chemotherapy backbone. 58% (10/17) of patients exhibited weight stability. Physical performance status was preserved among all subjects. Patients reported improvements in quality-of-life metrics via QLQ-PAN26 questioner (−3.6, p = 0.18) and functional well-being (1.78, p = 0.02). Subjects exhibited a decrease in inflammatory cytokines, notably, vascular endothelial growth factor (−0.86, p = 0.017) with Bermekimab. Bermekimab treatment was associated with an increased abundance of gut health-promoting bacterial genera <italic>Akkermansia,</italic> with 3.82 Log2-fold change from baseline. In sum, Bermekimab is safe to be used in conjunction with Nal-Iri and 5-FU/FA chemotherapy. This benign toxicological profile warrants further Phase I/II investigation of Bermekimab in combinatorial strategies, and the impact of anti-IL-1α antibodies on the gut microbiome.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="Par3">Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has a 5-year survival of 10% and is projected to be the second leading cause of cancer mortality in the United States by 2030<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Unfortunately, the recent advances in precision medicine and immunotherapeutics are not applicable to most patients with PDAC. The molecular landscape of pancreatic cancer (PC) is governed by a preponderance of KRAS alterations (92%-93%), limiting the scope of targeted strategies in PC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. An exception is in KRAS wild-type patients where RAF alterations, NRG fusions, NTRK fusions are potentially actionable<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Immunotherapeutics have been generally unsuccessful as PDAC is characterized by low tumor mutation burden and lack of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes.</p>
              <p id="Par4">PDAC is also characterized by weight loss (WL) attributable to anorexia, malabsorption, and cancer cachexia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. At presentation, 80% of PDAC patients will have clinically significant weight loss and meet the definition of cancer cachexia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Cachexia is a multifactorial syndrome characterized by progressive involuntary WL, loss of skeletal muscle mass, and systemic inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Weight loss and decreased lean body mass are associated with a poor prognosis, increased toxicity, post-op infections, and decreased therapeutic intensity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par5">Systemic inflammation in PDAC has been linked to tumor proliferation and its associated cachexia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Oncogenic KRAS activates STAT3 and Nuclear Factor-κB (NF-κB) by inflammatory cytokines, including Interleukin-1α, in an autocrine and paracrine manner leading to cancer initiation, metastases, and an inflammatory tumor micro-environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Elevations in c-reactive protein, in the neutrophil-to lymphocyte ratio, and pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha, IL-1α, and Interleukin-6 have been associated with pancreatic cancer cachexia, poor response to treatment, and poor outcomes such as decreased overall survival<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par6">Bermekimab (formerly known as MABp1) is a true human monoclonal antibody that specifically targets IL-1α. Bermekimab was cloned directly from a human B cell (Epstein-Barr virus-immortalized) that was isolated from a person with endogenous anti-IL-1α antibodies. In a phase 1 trial of solid tumor patients, there were no dose limiting toxicities and improvements in lean body mass were identified<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. In a randomized phase 3 trial in colorectal cancer, Bermekimab treated patients were more like to reach a composite endpoint of stable or increased lean body mass and stability or improvement in two of three symptoms (pain, fatigue, or anorexia) at week 8<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. The significance or reaching this novel endpoint was unclear, however these results warranted further development of IL-1α antagonism for the palliation of end-stage cancer patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par7">The present study aims to first establish the safety and the recommended phase 2 dose of the IL-1α antagonist (Bermekimab) in combination with Nanoliposomal Irinotecan (Nal-Iri) and 5-Fluorouracil (5FU)/Folinic Acid (FA) in patients with advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma and cachexia who have failed gemcitabine-based chemotherapy. Secondarily, we aimed to assess the effects on weight, body composition, physical performance, and patient reported outcomes.</p>

                <p id="Par9">The primary objective was to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Bermekimab in combination with Nal-Iri and 5FU/FA using Bayesian adaptive design based on dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) in the first cycle. The MTD was defined as the dose such that the probability of DLTs at MTD is θ = 0.33. Dose levels of Bermekimab at 3.75 mg/kg, 7.5 mg/kg, or 12.0 mg/kg intravenous (IV) every other week, Nal-Iri at 50 mg/m<sup>2</sup> or 70 mg/m<sup>2</sup> IV day 1 and 15, and 5FU 2000 mg/m<sup>2</sup> or 2400 mg/m<sup>2</sup> day 1 and 15, every 4-week cycles, were employed for the dose finding schema. Initially, the trial was designed to explore four dose levels described in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and a new dose level 3 would be added by increasing the dose of Bermekimab to 12.0 mg/kg if there is statistical evidence that the probability of DLT at dose level 2 is below the target θ by 10%, using the extended escalation with overdose control (EWOC) algorithm with a flexible range of doses described in Tighiouart et al. 2018<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>.

At the end of the trial, the MTD was estimated as the median of the posterior distribution of the MTD given data on all evaluable patients, and dose level 3 was recommended as the MTD. Efficacy including overall response rates were assessed as per RECIST 1.1 criteria. Demographics, baseline characteristics, and safety variables were summarized by descriptive statistics; categorical variables were reported as frequency (percentage, %) and continuous variables were reported as mean (standard deviation, SD) or median (interquartile range, IQR). Paired sample t-test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used, as appropriate, to examine differences in lean body mass, grip strength, gait speed, and daily activity and sleep from trial initiation to 2 months (cycle 3). Changes in inflammatory cytokines markers over 12 months from trial initiation were examined using a generalized additive model for location, scale and shape (GAMLSS) with patient as a random effect and using a log normal distribution with an identity link function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>.

P-values were adjusted for multiple tests using the Holm procedure. Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as time in months from the date of consent to progressive disease or death. Overall survival (OS) was defined as time in months from the date of consent to death. Survival functions were estimated by the Kaplan–Meier method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>.

Significance of differences in alpha diversity pre- vs. post- intervention were determined by paired t-test. Differentially abundant taxa (filtered to remove those with less than 25% prevalence) were identified using DESeq2, which implements a Bayesian approach towards shrinking dispersion and fitting non-rarified abundance counts to a negative binomial model. Measurements of differential relative abundance in terms of log2-fold change were generated while retaining the measure of normalized mean relative abundance as a proportion of total estimated counts of taxa. P-values for differential abundance were adjusted by the Benjamini–Hochberg method to control false discovery rate (Padj &lt; 0.05 was considered significant).</p>

Out of 16 evaluable subjects in this study, we observed a promising five partial responses (31%) with the combination of Nal-Iri and Bermekimab.</p>
              <p id="Par26">In this dose escalation study, we did not encounter DLTs attributable to the addition of Bermekimab. Of the 22 patients enrolled, three experienced DLTs which include grade 3 fatigue, vomiting, diarrhea, and anorexia. However, these DLTs are thought to be associated with the chemotherapeutic backbone. Overall, the regimen was well tolerated in a group of refractory pancreatic cancer patients. However, fatigue was found in 24% of participants, which compares unfavorably to the landmark NAPOLI-1 trial. This could be explained by the inclusion of only cachectic cancer patients but should be examined in more detail in future studies.</p>
              <p id="Par27">When compared with the NAPOLI-1 trial, where 5FU and Nal-Iri was compared to 5FU alone, the toxicity experienced in this phase 1 combination trial was generally favorable<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. There were no appreciable differences in hematologic toxicity with all grade anemia and neutropenia being similar between 30 and 40% in both cohorts and thrombocytopenia did not occur in either study. All grade fatigue and anorexia were also common across both cohorts. Although all-grade diarrhea was common in our cohort 15/21 (71%) grade 3/4 diarrhea was uncommon 1/21 (5%) and not dose limiting. In the NAPOLI-1 trial, gastrointestinal toxicity resulted in dose reductions for 33% of patients receiving the combination of 5-fluorouracil and Nal-Iri.</p>
              <p id="Par28">Chemotherapy associated intestinal mucositis is currently understood to include the generation of reactive oxygen species, activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor (TNF), IL-6, and IL1b<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. In mouse models of 5-fluorouracil induced intestinal mucositis, administration of IL-1Ra eliminated severe diarrhea and accelerated body weight recovery by blocking the destructive effect of IL-1β and reducing apoptosis in the small intestinal crypt after chemotherapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par29">Additionally, we identified a novel finding in that Bermekimab treatment was associated with greater abundance of <italic>Akkermansia</italic> in gut microbiome analyses. <italic>Akkermansia</italic>, particularly <italic>Akkermansia</italic>
<italic>muciniphila</italic>, is a well-characterized microbe that plays a central role in promoting gut health and maintaining integrity of the gut barrier<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. <italic>A.</italic>
<italic>muciniphila</italic> regulates mucin production, a major component of the mucous layer that serves as the protective lining of the gastrointestinal mucosa. Disruption of the gut barrier results in “leaky gut” and diffusion of immune-activating substances that can result in systemic inflammation with implications across a host of metabolic diseases and cancer. Through regulation of the mucin layer and production of active metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), <italic>A.</italic>
<italic>muciniphila</italic> has been shown to reduce the risk of obesity, improve glucose tolerance, modulate immune responses, reduce systemic inflammation, and improve lipid metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. Notably, there are growing efforts to increase abundance of <italic>A.</italic>
<italic>muciniphila</italic> through diet and probiotics, fecal microbiata transplantation, and antimetabolic drugs to enhance the efficacy of metabolic and cancer therapies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. We are among the first to show that treatment over time with Bermekimab, which targets IL-1α, was associated with higher abundance of <italic>Akkermansia</italic>. We also demonstrated that patients with a post-treatment reduction in circulating IL-1α levels exhibited higher <italic>Akkermansia</italic> abundance than those without IL-1α reduction, in addition to higher abundance of 14 other genera belonging to phylum Firmicutes, among which <italic>Ruminococcus</italic> and <italic>Dialister</italic> are prominent SCFA producers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. This data supports a microbiome shift corresponding to the reduction of IL-1α following treatment with Bermekimab. These findings, in addition to our remarkably lower levels of G3/4 gastrointestinal toxicity in this cohort compared to NAPOLI-1, are hypothesis-generating and warrant further investigation into the Bermekimab and <italic>Akkermansia</italic> relationship, particularly as a means to ameliorate chemotherapy associated-diarrhea and promote gut health to mitigate systemic inflammation in randomized trials.</p>
              <p id="Par30">Notably, we observed significant reductions in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels over time with combination Nal-Iri, 5FU/FA, and Bermekimab. This is a novel finding and uncovers an additional mechanism of action to potentially exploit with Bermekimab. VEGF signaling is considered a canonical angiogenesis promoter for multiple tumors whereby targeting VEGF has been established broadly in the treatment landscape of oncology from other gastrointestinal cancers such as colorectal and hepatocellular carcinoma to genitourinary cancers such as renal cell carcinoma where combination of anti-VEGF therapies with immunotherapy are foundational treatments. As such, it would be prudent to further examine the anticancer mechanisms of Bermekimab and anti-IL-1α therapy through its potential as an anti-angiogenic. Given the exquisite safety and tolerability of Bermekimab with no real overlapping toxicities with many systemic anticancer agents commonly used, Bermekimab remains an attractive agent for combinatorial strategies across multiple tumor types in this regard.</p>
              <p id="Par31">Weight stability in this cohort of refractory patients was common and encouraging. Despite the majority (10/17) experiencing weight stability, there were significant decrements in both lean body mass and fat body mass based on body composition analysis. This is in contrast to another phase 1 trial of anti-IL-1α monotherapy in treatment-refractory solid tumor patients, where lean body mass increased in 30 patients; the majority of whom were losing weight in the 6 months before enrollment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Fat mass in this study did decrease as well by a median of −4.4% but of note, only 2 (4%) patients in this trial had PDAC. Presence of IL-1α monocytes in peripheral blood decreased over time with anti-IL-1α monotherapy, which was used as a pharmacodynamic measure in this study. We similarly observed a decrease in IL-1α levels over time, but notably, IL-1RA levels and IL-4 levels decreased as well. IL-1 receptor signaling has been shown to mediate cachexia, but IL-1RA is a natural inhibitor of the pro-inflammatory effect and has been used to treat certain autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. IL-4 is generally thought to be an anti-inflammatory cytokine as well<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. We observed a decrease in IL-6 levels over time with combination treatment in our cohort, which historically has been elevated in cancers that induce cachexia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. Therefore, although we observed decreases in IL-1α, IL-4, and IL-6 that would putatively promote an anti-inflammatory phenotype and mitigate cachexia, it is unclear whether the counter-effect of decreased IL-1RA plays a role in such discrepancies with lean body mass across studies.</p>
              <p id="Par32">Body composition analysis is not commonly described in prospective studies of refractory pancreatic cancer patients receiving an intervention. We recently conducted a prospective observational study evaluating the impact of enteral tube feeding on weight stability and body composition in a similar cohort of pancreatic cancer patients with cachexia. Weight stability was achieved and increases in lean body mass and appendicular lean mass were observed as well as decreases in fat mass in this small sample of patients who completed three cycles of tube feeding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. However, this study was limited by small sample size and heterogeneity in the chemotherapy regimen used. Still, findings from this study, taken together with findings from our Bermekimab trial, suggest alterations in gut microbiome secondary to chemotherapy and nutritional intervention may benefit weight preservation in advanced cancer. This warrants further investigation into each of these mechanisms to characterize patients suffering from cachexia who would stand to benefit most from one approach over another.</p>
              <p id="Par33">Additionally, previously reported retrospective studies have demonstrated that loss of lean body mass and fat mass are common among PDAC patients, independent of body mass index (BMI), associated with poor outcomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>. Notably loss of lean body mass has also been correlated with increased dose limiting toxicities and neuropathy for PDAC patients receiving gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par34">In our cohort, our measures for patient physical performance were stable over a 12-week period (C1–3). Hand-grip strength, step count, and walking speed were notably unchanged despite general loss of lean body mass in this cohort. These measures have not been similarly assessed in a refractory pancreatic cancer protocol and therefore it is difficult to benchmark our findings. However, these measures were easy to implement in our outpatient clinic and the information gathered could help evaluate the effects of our interventions—intended or otherwise. We have previously noted that physical function and the autonomy to perform daily and social activities is highly prioritized in pancreatic cancer patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>. Further development of our measures for patient performance are therefore needed.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p id="Par35">In this phase I trial, the addition of Bermekimab (formerly known as MABp1), a monoclonal antibody that specifically targets IL-1α, to Nal-Iri and 5FU/FA in advanced PDAC patients who have previously been treated with gemcitabine-based therapies demonstrated promising efficacy and was well tolerated. We observed weight stability in over half of the patients and changes in select cytokines involved with inflammatory cascades and the cachexia process that are hypothesis generating and warrant further understanding. Notably, study treatment significantly reduced VEGF levels uncovering a mechanism to exploit as a potentially novel anti-angiogenic with Bermekimab. This is provocative given the safety and tolerability of this drug and the fact that multiple tumor types have been targetable through VEGF blockade as monotherapy or in combination systemic therapies. The relationship between Bermekimab, targeting IL-1α, and promotion of gut health through impact on the gut microbiome also warrant further study.</p>
