                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, public health measures limited social interactions as an effective and protective intervention for all. For many, however, this social isolation exacerbated mental health symptoms. People who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) were already at elevated risk of anxiety and depression, relative to cisgender and heterosexual populations, and pandemic-related social isolation likely heightened these disparities. In our prior work with sexual and gender minorities, we developed and established feasibility and acceptability of a novel acceptance-based behavioral therapy (ABBT) intervention for HIV treatment. ABBT showed promise in improving social support and reducing mental health symptoms. In the current study, we investigate the efficacy of ABBT, compared to a treatment-as-usual control condition, in a full-scale randomized controlled trial to improve social support for LGBTQ+ persons living with anxiety and depression.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Two hundred forty LGBTQ+ adults with anxiety and/or depressive symptoms will be recruited and equally randomized to receive: (a) the ABBT intervention, consisting of two 30–40 min sessions plus treatment-as-usual (TAU), or (b) TAU only. Primary outcomes are interviewer-assessed anxiety and depressive symptoms. Secondary outcomes are self-reported anxiety and depressive symptoms. Experiential avoidance and social support are hypothesized mediators and presence of an anxiety and/or depressive disorder is a hypothesized moderator.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>ABBT represents a novel, identify-affirming real-world approach to promoting social support as a means of improving mental health among individuals who identify as LGBTQ+. This study will contribute actionable data establishing the impact, mediational mechanisms, and effect modifiers of ABBT.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="p0030">In the United States (U.S.), individuals who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) demonstrate significantly higher rates of mental illness compared to cisgender and heterosexual populations [<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. A national survey found that 37% of sexual minority adults had mental illness in 2015, compared to 17% among heterosexual adults [<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. According to minority stress theory, these disparities might be explained by the chronic and unique stressors (e.g., discrimination, stigma, prejudice) that many LGBTQ+ individuals experience. These stressors impact coping methods, emotion regulation, and interpersonal connections [<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Moreover, greater minority stress is associated with lower social support, which in turn is associated with more mental health problems [<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In sum, LGBTQ+ persons are at elevated risk of anxiety and depression, which is likely related to the social stressors they face.</p>
              <p id="p0035">The COVID-19 pandemic significantly worsened mental health in the U.S. Public health measures, specifically limits on social interaction and isolation and quarantine, contributed to loneliness, anxiety, depression, insomnia, self-harm or suicidal behavior, and substance use [<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. For individuals who lost social connections or were unable to adapt to maintain their connections, social support decreased and loneliness worsened [<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], putting them at elevated risk of anxiety and depressive symptoms. These social challenges were amplified in the LGBTQ+ community [<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Data demonstrated that the already vulnerable LGBTQ+ population was harder hit by the pandemic in terms of mental health and quality of life [<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In a large cross-sectional survey of sexual and gender minority and cisgender heterosexual respondents during the first three months of the COVID-19 pandemic, LGBTQ+ individuals were significantly more likely to have anxiety and depressive symptoms and they were particularly affected by the social isolation [<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In sum, the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to an exacerbation of pre-existing mental health disparities in the LGBTQ+ community due to social disruptions [<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p>
              <p id="p0040">Although LGBTQ+ persons are more likely to seek mental health services compared to the general population [<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], this group consistently demonstrates unmet mental health treatment needs [<xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Prior to the onset of the pandemic, LGBTQ+ individuals reported inadequate care due to having stigmatizing experiences in health care settings [<xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and lack of provider knowledge about their unique health care needs [<xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Importantly, LGBTQ+ persons often report a lack of access to affirming care [<xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Efforts focused on mental health and the LGBTQ+ population are urgently needed to develop accessible, identity-affirming, and culturally-tailored interventions. Unfortunately, current approaches for mental health care often do not respond to these challenges as the traditional treatment delivery model of psychotherapy – weekly sessions for several months at an outpatient clinic – may be impractical and logistically challenging for many people.</p>
              <p id="p0045">Acceptance-based behavior therapy (ABBT) is an empirically supported treatment approach for depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and chronic pain [<xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and has been successfully applied to various medical conditions and sub-syndromal concerns, such as stigma [<xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Results from meta-analyses and systematic reviews show that ABBT approaches can have large effects on anxiety and depression [<xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>]. Additionally, data show that ABBT can improve social support [<xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>]. However, to our knowledge, only one ABBT intervention specifically targeted social supports, and it was among traumatized military veterans [<xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p>
              <p id="p0050">ABBT helps patients overcome forms of avoidance that can lead to problems, particularly avoidance of uncomfortable internal states and the situations that trigger such states. We suggest that having skills related to accepting life's challenges while pursing value-driven goals are well-suited to coping with life during the pandemic. As shown in <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>
, we hypothesize that ABBT can help LGBTQ+ persons overcome the social isolation and loneliness that are associated with minority stress experiences, in addition to the pandemic, through active social behaviors, including support-seeking. However, a recent review of ABBT interventions among LGBTQ+ samples identified only five studies, of which only three were randomized trials [<xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Thus, further investigations of ABBT among LGBTQ+ samples are needed.<fig id="f0005"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Acceptance-based model of LGBTQ+ social isolation &amp; loneliness.</p></caption><alt-text id="al0005">Fig. 1</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr1_lrg"/></fig></p>
              <p id="p0055">The current study protocol is among the first to evaluate a brief (2-session) ABBT intervention's effects on anxiety and depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic era among LGBTQ+ persons in a fully powered, randomized controlled trial (RCT). We hypothesize that compared to treatment-as-usual (TAU) alone, ABBT will lead to greater reductions in anxiety and depressive symptoms, as measured by interviewer assessment (primary outcomes) and self-report (secondary outcomes). We also hypothesize that compared to TAU, ABBT will lead to improved experiential avoidance and social support (mediators). Finally, we expect that ABBT's effects will be moderated by presence of a psychiatric diagnosis (anxiety or mood disorder vs. no psychiatric disorder) as determined in clinical interview with the Quick Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 Disorders (QuickSCID-5 [<xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>];).</p>

                <p id="p0060">In this 3-year Phase II RCT, we will recruit 240 LGBTQ+ individuals who self-report anxiety and/or depressive symptoms at presentation for medical services at a community health center. Participants will undergo a baseline assessment to characterize their mental health, protective factors (e.g., social support), and factors that might worsen their symptoms (e.g., experiences of discrimination). Participants will then be randomized to either the 2-session ABBT and treatment-as-usual (TAU), or TAU alone. Regardless of treatment or control arm, all participants receive TAU services at the clinic. These services include referrals to psychiatric care, substance misuse counseling, and medication evaluations, if indicated. We will conduct follow-up research study assessments at 3-, 6-, and 9-months post-baseline. This study will have a data and safety monitoring board comprised of three external experts.</p>

Patients at Open Door Health are highly diverse. Thirty-six percent of patients identify as female. Additionally, 23% percent of patients self-identify as Hispanic/Latinx. Racially, 25% identify as Black/African American, 4% as Asian, and 70% as non-Latinx White.</p>

                <p id="p0070">Based on reported efficacy of acceptance-based treatments for anxiety and depression in a large systematic review and meta-analysis [<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], the feasibility of recruitment at our site, as well as statistical power considerations, we plan to enroll a sample of 240 participants. Öst [<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] reports meta-analytic effect size estimates for ABBT relative to TAU in the medium range (i.e., <italic>Hedge's g</italic> = 0.55 for posttreatment effects and <italic>g</italic> = 0.48 for follow-up effects). Based on power calculations for a repeated measures analysis of variance, we are well powered (&gt;80%) to detect small effects in the treatment by time interaction across a range of samples sizes. We anticipate a 10–15% attrition rate, leaving us with about 210 study completers. With a final sample of 210, we are powered to detect effects as low as f = 0.08, which corresponds to a <italic>Cohen's d</italic> = 0.16, far below those observed in prior meta-analyses.</p>
                <p id="p0075">To increase external validity, we set a minimal inclusion threshold of “mild” anxiety and/or depressive symptoms to capture individuals who would likely benefit from our intervention. Inclusion criteria are: (a) receive services at the recruitment site; (b) identify as LGBTQ+; (c) self-reported ≥ mild anxiety and/or depressive symptoms, based on the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7 [<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>];) and/or the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9 [<xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>];); (d) 18 years or older; (e) ability to speak and read English; and, (f) have telephone access. This study does not have any exclusion criteria, beyond not meeting the above criteria. Although receipt of external mental health treatment (e.g., outpatient psychotherapy) could impact effects, we decided to measure external treatment without making it an exclusion criterion; however, we will account for it in analyses. Because our brief ABBT is not a traditional mental health intervention, we suggest that it can be complementary to other treatment approaches.</p>

                  <p id="p0105">In the first session, the interventionist will introduce the concept of acceptance and its possible benefits in the context of life values and participant-identified struggles, such as stigma related to identifying as LGBTQ+ and/or coping with social isolation. As discussed in our published papers [<xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], we seek to create a foundation for acceptance at the first session via experiential exercises, using metaphors developed in the acceptance-based literature [<xref rid="bb0180" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Interventionists will use the “Quicksand” metaphor, in which struggling with life's challenges is compared to struggling with quicksand: the more we try to resist and push away from uncomfortable feelings like anxiety, the stronger they become. Session #1 will conclude with a discussion of types of social support, motivation to change or enhance support, and the development of a social support action plan.</p>
                  <p id="p0110">To elicit life values in Session #2, interventionists will use a “Growing Old” exercise, in which participants are asked to reflect on what they would want their life to stand for, observing their history at an older age. To complement content from Session #2, types of social support will be reviewed and goals related to further social activity will be developed. As needed, interventionists will troubleshoot barriers to social activity, including role plays to aid social skill development.</p>

To counter experiential avoidance of life's challenges, ABBT uses acceptance and committed action towards valued life areas. Experiential avoidance will be measured by the self-report Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-2 (AAQ-2 [<xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>];). Social support is also a proposed mediator of this intervention, as we hypothesize that improved social support will lead to improved mental health.

At the conclusion of the RCT, two trained postdoctoral students who are not part of the study will rate 50% of the randomly selected ABBT sessions. Fidelity rating training will entail reviewing the intervention manuals with the study investigator, listening to sessions as a group to practice coding, and then independently coding sessions and comparing them to ratings conducted by the investigator to refine coding practices. Once these steps are completed, the two raters will rate a random selection of ABBT sessions until adequate reliability is achieved (ICC &gt; 0.80). Adherence to the treatment manual will be assessed in a previously developed coding system used in the pilot work. This system focuses on adherence to the intervention manual, allowing raters to note if each topic in the manual was delivered/administered, “yes, no, or partially.” A percent adherent statistic will then be calculated for each rated session.</p>

A linear mixed effect model will be used if the residuals from such a model are normally distributed; otherwise, an alternative link function will be used. Given these design parameters, the hypothesis that the active treatment condition (ABBT) results in greater reduction of depression/anxiety symptoms relative to TAU at month 9 will be tested with the sign and signifcance of the treatment group indicator, and expressed using marginal effects [<xref rid="bb0215" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. We will also follow-up this approach with a generalization of the ANCOVA (Analysis of Covariance) [<xref rid="bb0220" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] in which we will test each study follow-up separately, while controlling for a time factor and baseline scores.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="p0180">This will be among the first studies to evaluate a brief ABBT intervention focused on improving mental health among the LGBTQ+ population following the COVID-19 pandemic. Community health clinics are an ideal venue to deliver brief, evidence-based interventions to support the mental health of patients, including those who identify as LGBTQ+. Yet, limited attention has been paid to developing and implementing sustainable behavioral health services in community health clinics, particularly interventions that can address social support. A meta-analysis of 125 studies on outpatient psychotherapy in the general population found that 40% of patients terminated treatment after the first or second visit [<xref rid="bb0240" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. In fact, because high attrition rates are a known problem in psychotherapy, some have argued that the term “gold-standard” evidence-based treatment must be reserved for interventions that not only show positive effects in RCTs, but also show feasibility and strong retention rates in clinical settings [<xref rid="bb0245" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. These data coalesce to emphasize the importance of novel, brief treatment approaches that could be relevant to LGBTQ+ persons.</p>
              <p id="p0185">Until recently, efforts to address mental health in the LGBTQ+ population have been hampered by a lack of culturally-competent mental health care services [<xref rid="bb0250" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Efforts focused on mental health and the LGBTQ+ population during COVID-19 are urgently needed and these approaches must be accessible, identity-affirming, and culturally-tailored. Taken together, these data lay the groundwork for the present study.</p>

                <title>Strengths</title>
                <p id="p0190">The few identity-affirming and currently available interventions for improving mental health in LGBTQ+ populations can be efficacious [<xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], but often are not routinely deployed in real-world, community-based clinical settings due to barriers related to feasibility, cost, and access. Moreover, limited attention has been paid to improving social support as an essential mechanism for emotional health and well-being among LGBTQ+. Social support is particularly relevant given the way in which minority stress can increase isolation for LGBTQ+ individuals, which has become more pronounced as individuals cope with the widespread and damaging effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Telehealth, as a treatment delivery option, is emerging as a means of streamlining access to urgent services and providing real-time assessment and intervention in more efficient ways. However, there are notable gaps in existing research.</p>
                <p id="p0195">The proposed research is innovative for a number of reasons: (a) We focus on LGBTQ+ individuals who are at significantly high risk of mental health challenges, in general, and specifically as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic; (b) We integrate brief, “real-world” behavioral health services into routine care at a community health clinic; (c) We apply an intervention that has been shown to specifically engage a pandemic-affected mechanism (social support); and, (d) We use an experimental therapeutic approach to examine mechanisms of change (experiential avoidance, social support) that are consistent with the theoretical underpinnings of our ABBT intervention.</p>

                <title>Challenges</title>
                <p id="p0200">Given our broad eligibility criteria, we do not expect to exclude many potential participants from our recruitment site. However, it is possible that we would not recruit a sufficient sample to meet our aims. The investigative team will regularly monitor if the study is meeting recruitment targets. If not, we would consider expanding to another recruitment site or recruiting from the community. Retention might be a challenge as well; however, we anticipate that our methods to retain individuals in this study (e.g., financial remuneration for study assessment) will mitigate this concern.</p>
                <p id="p0205">We recognize that in community-based clinics, the use of the QIDS-C and HAM-A is unlikely. However, to maintain scientific rigor and to be consistent with prior studies that provided effect sizes to power our RCT, we selected these interviewer-assessed measures as our primary outcomes. The GAD-7 and PHQ-9 self-reports were selected as secondary outcomes. We plan to cross-validate these measures and expect that if they are strongly correlated (<italic>r</italic> ≥ 0.50) with the QIDS-C and HAM-A in this sample, we would use them as primary outcomes in future trials.</p>
                <p id="p0210">We acknowledge that comorbid alcohol or other substance use could relate to patients' mental health, coping with the pandemic, and social supports. Yet, our prior data do not show that ABBT's effects vary depending on comorbid substance use. As such, we do not heavily emphasize substances in this study as our intervention is not designed to address these issues. However, we will assess these variables at baseline to characterize the sample and could analyze if intervention response depends on the presence of substance use problems.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p id="p0215">Our preliminary data strongly suggest that the use of ABBT to support mental health for LGBTQ+ patients with anxiety and/or depressive symptoms will be feasible, acceptable, and effective. By providing data in the first study of its kind, we will lay the groundwork for further use of ABBT in community health settings to address the urgent social support needs of people who identify as LGBTQ+. At the conclusion of this trial, we anticipate demonstrating that ABBT, a simple and easily replicable intervention, can effectively improve mental health among LGBTQ+ persons.</p>
