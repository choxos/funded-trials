Here we developed a clinical-grade approach based on CRISPR–Cas9 non-viral precision genome-editing to simultaneously knockout the two endogenous TCR genes <italic>TRAC</italic> (which encodes TCRα) and <italic>TRBC</italic> (which encodes TCRβ). We also inserted into the <italic>TRAC</italic> locus two chains of a neoantigen-specific TCR (neoTCR) isolated from circulating T cells of patients. The neoTCRs were isolated using a personalized library of soluble predicted neoantigen–HLA capture reagents. Sixteen patients with different refractory solid cancers received up to three distinct neoTCR transgenic cell products. Each product expressed a patient-specific neoTCR and was administered in a cell-dose-escalation, first-in-human phase I clinical trial (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03970382">NCT03970382</ext-link>). One patient had grade 1 cytokine release syndrome and one patient had grade 3 encephalitis. All participants had the expected side effects from the lymphodepleting chemotherapy. Five patients had stable disease and the other eleven had disease progression as the best response on the therapy. neoTCR transgenic T cells were detected in tumour biopsy samples after infusion at frequencies higher than the native TCRs before infusion. This study demonstrates the feasibility of isolating and cloning multiple TCRs that recognize mutational neoantigens. Moreover, simultaneous knockout of the endogenous TCR and knock-in of neoTCRs using single-step, non-viral precision genome-editing are achieved. The manufacture of neoTCR engineered T cells at clinical grade, the safety of infusing up to three gene-edited neoTCR T cell products and the ability of the transgenic T cells to traffic to the tumours of patients are also demonstrated.</p>

              <p id="Par3">The ultimate goal of any cancer therapy is to target and kill cancer cells while sparing normal cells. The human immune system is suited to achieve this goal owing to the specificity of TCRs. These receptors can distinguish single point mutations in the cancer genome that change the amino acid sequences of peptides presented by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on the cell surface of cancer cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Mutational neoantigens provide the main target for the activity of adoptive cell transfer (ACT) therapeutics involving tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes, antitumour T cells stimulated by immune checkpoint blockade or cancer-specific vaccines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Development of a clinical-grade approach to efficiently isolate multiple TCRs would open a new way to potentially treat refractory cancers. Specifically, these TCRs would recognize mutated peptides presented by any of the six human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I alleles in a patient and then be subsequently engineered back into autologous T cells for ACT therapy. However, this goal has been limited by the diversity of HLA class I alleles in the human population, with over 24,000 alleles currently recorded<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Moreover, the polymorphic nature of most of the mutational antigenic determinants recognized by T cells is a challenge<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. These are some of the reasons why most current TCR-engineered T cell therapies are limited to patients with the HLA-A:02*01 haplotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. The generation of arrays of mutated peptide–HLA TCR-binding reagents and single-cell cloning of the paired TCR chains provided a new approach to isolate neoTCRs across multiple HLA alleles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Furthermore, previous engineering of human T cells has relied on the use of recombinant viral vectors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, but it is unfeasible to generate multiple personalized clinical-grade vectors for every patient. The advent of nuclease-based precision gene-editing has enabled the development of approaches that use targeted insertion of transgenes into human T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> and has paved the way to achieve stable integration without requiring the use of viral vectors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Precision gene-editing using techniques such as CRISPR–Cas9 enables the simultaneous knockout of endogenous TCR chains while inserting the transgenic TCR under the control of the physiological TCR promoter. This strategy has been reported in some settings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, but not all<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, to provide advantages over the same transgenes expressed under the control of constitutive viral vector promoters.</p>
              <p id="Par4">In the current study, we describe an approach that enables efficient isolation of multiple TCRs specific for mutational neoantigens. This strategy uses personalized libraries of hundreds of predicted neoantigen peptide sequences presented by HLA class I alleles of an individual patient and a targeted, non-viral gene-editing method to reconstitute the specificity of the isolated neoTCRs. Overall, this time-efficient process is able to generate clinical-grade neoTCR transgenic T cell preparations for ACT (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). Using these technologies, 16 patients with different solid cancers received up to three unique lots of gene-engineered T cells.

Screening begins with the identification of patient tumour-specific mutations based on sequencing data and bioinformatics prediction of mutated neoantigen peptides. Native CD8 T cells that bind neoantigen targets are captured from blood using barcoded and fluorescently labelled peptide–HLA multimers. neoTCR sequences are cloned from captured T cells and functionally characterized in healthy donor T cells before product selection. HR DNA plasmid (or plasmids) encoding the selected neoTCR sequence (or sequences) are then manufactured for subsequent clinical GMP T cell manufacture. Patients are enrolled into the study after product selection. Manufacturing begins with apheresis of the patient’s blood followed by enrichment of CD8 and CD4 T cells.

              <p id="Par5">Patients provided consent to undergo a tumour biopsy and donate peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as part of the screening step for the selection of personalized neoTCR products (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). Germline DNA from PBMCs was compared with tumour DNA using whole exome sequencing (WES) for the identification of patient-specific tumour mutations. In addition, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed to determine the expression level of genes with cancer-specific mutations. For the 16 patients who received treatment in the clinical trial, a median of 102 (range of 31–488) non-synonymous somatic mutations (NSMs) and a median of 35 (range of 20–236) expressed mutations were identified for each patient (Extended Data Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Using this information, we prioritized a list of up to 352 neoantigen peptide–HLA candidates per patient (median of 352, range of 86–352, for a total of 5,302 peptide–HLA candidates with peptide lengths of 8–11 amino acids) across the available HLA class I alleles for that patient. Libraries of peptide–HLA complexes were produced in 293 cells as single-chain trimers, for which neoantigen peptides were fused in sequence to β<sub>2</sub> microglobulin (B2M) domains and HLA. Of these, a median of 104 (range of 49–262) patient-specific peptide–HLA proteins were successfully synthesized (yield of ≥2.7 µg) per patient for a total of 1,841 peptide–HLA proteins produced (Extended Data Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). These covered a total of 34 unique HLAs of the 64 HLA alleles represented in the screening process (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>), with a median of 5 (range of 2–6) HLA alleles covered per patient (Extended Data Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The peptide–HLA proteins were then DNA barcoded, fluorescently labelled and multimerized. CD8 T cells enriched from PBMCs of the patient were then stained using the patient-specific peptide–HLA multimer library to isolate rare peripheral blood-circulating T cells for any of the predicted mutations and HLA complexes. Single-cell sorting with high sensitivity and specificity was then performed. T cell isolation included CD95 cell surface staining to exclude CD8 T cells with a naive phenotype. Using this approach, we identified a median of 8 (range of 3–30) specific TCRs from T cells of varying frequency per patient, which resulted in a total of 175 TCRs for the 16 patients in the clinical trial. These TCRs recognized a median of 5 (range of 3–11) unique NSMs for a total of 83 neoantigen mutations (examples of typical data readouts are given in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b,c</xref>).</p>

              <p id="Par6">The biological and potential therapeutic relevance of the captured candidate TCRs against the tumour neoantigens was then corroborated using precision genome-engineering of healthy donor T cells with each of the patient-isolated neoTCR candidates. The <italic>TRAC</italic> and <italic>TRBC</italic> genes from each captured T cell were single-cell sequenced and cloned into homologous recombination (HR) DNA plasmids.

Each neoTCR candidate was then tested for recognition of the cognate neoantigen or the mismatched neoantigen controls to confirm neoantigen peptide–HLA-specific binding and interferon-γ (IFNγ) cytokine secretion. Binding of the reconstituted neoTCR to the soluble peptide–HLA complex demonstrated that 73 out of the 127 tested TCRs (57%) were specific and sufficiently functional neoTCRs for product selection (Extended Data Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). This result highlights the value of testing candidate neoTCRs before proceeding with clinical-grade manufacturing of the neoTCR gene-modified T cell product.

              <title>Non-viral precision TCR replacement</title>
              <p id="Par8">Patients with relapsed or refractory metastatic solid tumours and the following criteria were considered for enrolment: disease progression with standard-of-care treatment options for their cancer; adequate performance status; and evidence of measurable disease and fulfilling eligibility criteria. These participants were considered for leukapheresis when up to three neoTCRs had been selected using the personalized prediction and isolation of neoTCRs from their PBMCs and tumour biopsy samples. Patients underwent leukapheresis at their local institution, and the leukapheresis product was shipped to the sponsor (PACT Pharma) for manufacture. CD4 and CD8 T cells were isolated using automated magnetic separation cell sorting and activated for 2 days. Next, cells were electroporated to introduce Cas9 protein, guide RNAs to knockout the endogenous <italic>TRAC</italic> and <italic>TRBC</italic> genes and a HR template plasmid encoding the transgenic neoTCR. T cells were placed back in culture for expansion for 11 days, and the final cell product was cryopreserved on day 13 for infusion on a flexible schedule (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>).</p>
              <p id="Par9">The single-step precision genome-engineering process results in the replacement of the endogenous TCR with the patient’s native sequence neoTCR, the expression of which is placed under the regulation of the endogenous promoter (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). Infused CD8 and CD4 T cells expressing the neoTCRs were detected by flow cytometry analysis using the cognate fluorescently labelled peptide–HLA multimer. These cells constituted 1.9–46.8% of the live cell product (Extended Data Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The remaining cell product consisted of T cells that had the endogenous TCR knocked out but no knock-in of the neoTCR or wild-type T cells still expressing the endogenous TCR. Relative neoTCR affinity was determined by the ability of the cognate peptide–HLA multimer to bind the neoTCR expressed by CD8 or CD4 T cells. Higher affinity neoTCRs can bind the peptide–HLA target in the absence of the CD8 co-receptor, whereas lower affinity TCRs need CD8 co-receptor stabilization. On the basis of this information, TCRs can be classified as CD8-dependent or CD8-independent binders (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). Both CD8 and CD4 T cells showed insertion of the transgenes, as detected by intracellular staining for the 2A peptide that separates the neoTCR α-chain and the β-chain (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref> and Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). Assessment of the clinical cell products using targeted locus amplification confirmed on-target integration of the transgenic TCR cassette (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>). Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses indicated a slight increase (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0137) in chromosomal aberrations at the target sites of chromosomes 7 and 14 (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>), which indicated the presence of <italic>TRAC:TRBC</italic> translocations. However, other studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> have shown that cells harbouring translocations, including cells with <italic>TRAC:TRBC</italic> translocations, do not exhibit a growth advantage, and the frequency of these translocations decreased over time.</p>
              <p id="Par10">The potency of the final cell product was assessed through ELISAs to measure IFNγ secretion from neoTCR gene-edited T cells exposed to the cognate peptide–HLA multimer. The results were highly correlated (Pearson’s <italic>r</italic> = 0.8412, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001) with IFNγ responses measured by cytokine bead array (CBA) of the same neoTCR in healthy donor cells generated at small-scale for initial product selection (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). These data provide further validation of the neoTCR product selection process. In addition to IFNγ secretion, cells displayed a polyfunctional cytokine secretion profile in response to mutational neoantigen peptide–HLA complexes, expressing CD107a on the cell surface and producing tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-2 (IL-2) (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). neoTCR T cells proliferated in a dose-dependent manner in response to neoantigen peptide-HLA stimulation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref> and Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">2b,c</xref>). Wild-type cells (defined as having no evidence of CRISPR knockout or knock-in of the TCR) proliferated in response to positive control T cell stimulation using anti-CD3 and anti-CD28, but not with the cognate neoantigen peptide–HLA complexes. Cells in which <italic>TRAC</italic> and <italic>TRBC</italic> are knocked out do not have a TCR in complex with CD3 chains on their surface. Consequently, these cells did not proliferate in response to stimulation with either the anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 positive control stimulation or with cognate neoantigen peptide–HLA-specific stimulation. Additional characterization revealed that the T cell phenotype shifted from a predominantly T effector-like cell phenotype in the incoming leukapheresis product to a predominantly T memory stem cell and T central memory cell phenotype for each lot of neoTCR cell product (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). There was infrequent expression of the co-stimulatory and co-inhibitory surface markers 4-1BB (also known as CD137), LAG-3 and PD-1 (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). There was frequent expression of TIM-3, which has been previously related to the presence of γ-chain cytokines in cell culture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. CD73 and CD39, which are upregulated on T cells during activation and differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, were also expressed by the manufactured cell product.</p>
              <p id="Par11">During the course of the clinical trial, the formulation of the culture medium was changed to improve cell growth and editing efficiency of the clinical-grade preparations (cell manufacture version 2.0 (v.2.0) to v.2.1), and we also changed the electroporation device (cell manufacture v.2.1 to v.3.0; Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). The change in culture medium affected the quality and quantity of the clinical-grade preparations, with an increase in neoTCR knock-in efficiency from 13.4% to 23.0% (range of 1.9–28.3% and 11.4–46.8% for cell manufacture v.2.0 and v.2.1, respectively) and increases in the total number of neoTCR transgenic T cells manufactured (1.08 × 10<sup>9</sup> to 1.78 × 10<sup>9</sup>).

A total of 187 patients provided informed consent to initiate the process of personalized neoTCR discovery. After successfully obtaining the appropriate quality of baseline biopsy samples and PBMCs for DNA sequencing and RNA-seq, 88 patients (47%) participated in the neoTCR discovery process. Of these participants, 46 (52%) met the requirements for successful product selection for clinical manufacture (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). Twenty-eight patients underwent apheresis, and data from 16 patients who received the neoTCR transgenic T cell products produced using the v.2.0, v.2.1 or v.3.0 manufacturing process are reported here. Patients had a median age of 47 years (range of 36–70 years) and had received a median of 5 previous lines of therapy (range of 2–9) at the time of consent. The following number of patients with cancer histologies across the tumour mutation burden spectrum were enrolled: 11 patients with microsatellite stable-colorectal cancer; 2 with hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer; 1 with ovarian cancer; 1 with melanoma; and 1 with lung cancer (Extended Data Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>).

An additional four patients who received the first two dose levels also received subcutaneous IL-2 after infusion. Per the protocol, IL-2 could be added to the regimen once at least three patients had received that dosage regimen and demonstrated safety. Nine patients received cell products with three neoTCRs, three with two neoTCRs and four with one neoTCR each. The four patients who were assigned to the dose level 1 group received a lymphodepleting conditioning regimen of 300 mg m<sup>–2</sup> of cyclophosphamide and 30 mg m<sup>–2</sup> of fludarabine for 3 days. This led to suboptimal depletion on the basis of absolute lymphocyte counts. The regimen was modified for the remainder of the study and was increased to 600 mg m<sup>–2</sup> of cyclophosphamide for 3 days and 30 mg m<sup>–2</sup> of fludarabine for 4 days (Extended Data Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> and Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>).

After selection of the neoTCRs, patients were eligible for enrolment into the clinical trial, with a median time of 102 days between enrolment and dosing. This time period included the manufacture of plasmids (median 11 days) and neoTCR transgenic T cells (13 days), and testing of the lot released (28 days).

              <p id="Par13">We performed repeated peripheral blood sampling from patients to study the engraftment and expansion of the neoTCR transgenic T cells after infusion over time. The peak of total neoTCR transgenic T cells detected in blood samples from patients increased with the increase in cell dose. The increase occurred at a median time of 2 days after infusion (range of 1–15 days) for the 16 patients who received treatment. Moreover, the per cent of neoTCR<sup>+</sup> cells in the infused product correlated with the pharmacokinetic area under the curve up to day 7 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref> and Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">4c,d</xref>). For dose level 1, with the original lymphodepleting regimen, the median peak of neoTCR transgenic cells was 1.9% (range of 0.9–3.3%), which increased to a median of 10.0% (range of 7.7–12.1%) and 15.0% (range of 12.0–37.7%) for dose level 2 and level 3, respectively, in patients who received the modified conditioning chemotherapy regimen. With the original conditioning chemotherapy regimen, patients had absolute lymphocyte counts of fewer than 100 cells per μl for a median of 1.5 days (range of 0–3). This increased to a median of 4 days (range of 1–10) with the modified conditioning regimen (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). The addition of subcutaneous IL-2 resulted in a peak of neoTCR transgenic T cells of 7.3% and 6.3% in two patients in the dose level 1 group (patients 0604 and 0411, respectively). Patient 0026 (assigned to the dose level 2 group and receiving cells manufactured using v.2.0 of the process) received IL-2 and had a peak of 9.5% neoTCR transgenic T cells. Two patients who received cell products generated using v.3.0 of the manufacturing process had the highest levels of circulating neoTCR transgenic T cells, peaking at 20.8% for patient 1003 with dose level 2 and the addition of subcutaneous IL-2, and at 37.3% for patient 0417 with dose level 3. Overall, increasing the chemotherapy concentration in the lymphodepleting regimen, adding IL-2 and increasing the number of neoTCR<sup>+</sup> cells while decreasing the number of wild-type cells in the final cell product each may have contributed to improving the maximum concentration and prolonging the exposure of neoTCR T cells detected in the peripheral blood (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref> and Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">4a,c,d</xref>).</p>
              <p id="Par14">One role of the lymphodepleting conditioning regimen is to increase the availability of the T cell homeostatic expansion cytokines IL-7 and IL-15 in serum, which favours the expansion of the infused T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Increased IL-7 and IL-15 levels were observed in serum from patients in the clinical trial, with peak concentrations primarily observed at the time of infusion (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>).

There was no clear relationship between these levels and toxicities, and the levels were much lower than serum levels of these cytokines observed in cases of cytokine release syndrome in other clinical trials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Circulating IL-2 could only be detected in the patients who received supplemental subcutaneous IL-2 (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>).</p>
              <p id="Par15">neoTCR transgenic T cells recovered from blood after infusion generally maintained the phenotypes of the infusion product, and T memory stem cells and T effector-like cells were the predominant phenotypes (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>). There were infrequent increases in the surface expression of CD73, LAG-3 and PD-1, whereas CD137 remained low (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>). Expression of TIM-3 and CD39 were decreased in the neoTCR transgenic T cells recovered from patients after infusion compared with before infusion. This result indicates that the expression of these factors in the infusion product was due to activation on day 2 and the presence of exogenous cytokines during the manufacturing process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>.</p>

              <title>neoTCR T cells in tumour biopsy samples after treatment</title>
              <p id="Par16">In addition to the biopsy sample provided at screening for neoantigen prediction and identification, patients provided a baseline biopsy sample (day 5–7 before lymphodepletion) to assess continued neoantigen gene expression, and a biopsy sample after infusion (day 5–7 or day 28) to analyse for neoTCR transgenic T cell infiltration. Of the eight patients with longitudinal biopsy samples available for analyses, 13 out of the 19 predicted truncal neoantigen targets were detected from biopsy samples provided at the screening and baseline steps (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>). Patient 0010 was the only patient whose targeted mutations were not detected in the longitudinal baseline sample or the sample after infusion (<italic>n</italic> = 3). This result can be explained by this patient having a cancer with a strong APOBEC somatic mutation signature (retrospective analysis; Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>), which has previously been reported to drive extreme tumour heterogeneity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Patient 0605 had a neoTCR targeting a neoepitope that was predicted to be a subclonal mutation in <italic>GPSM2</italic>, which was absent in follow-up biopsy samples. Patient 0506 had a neoepitope mutation in <italic>PREP</italic> that was undetectable in longitudinal tumour biopsy samples but was detectable using a bespoke circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) assay at both subsequent time points (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">6c</xref>). This result suggests that ctDNA may be complimentary to tissue biopsy samples for the accurate identification of subclonal mutations. In addition, we performed retrospective HLA loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analyses on biopsy samples from patients who received the infusions. The analyses showed that LOH of the specific HLA allele presenting a selected neoantigen epitope had occurred before treatment in 3 patients, which affected 4 out of the 37 TCRs that were selected and infused (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">7a</xref>). Hence, a subset of the neoantigen mutations presented by specific HLA alleles that had been targeted by the dosed neoTCRs were not presented at the time of infusion. This finding demonstrates both the importance of HLA LOH analysis for TCR T cell therapies and the value of identifying sets of therapeutic TCRs that are not limited by specificity against neoantigens presented by a single HLA allele.</p>
              <p id="Par17">Sequence quantification of the TCR complementary-determining region 3 (CDR3) was performed on tumour biopsy samples taken before and after infusion (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a,b</xref> and Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">7b</xref>). The genetically introduced neoTCRs were frequently among the top represented TCR CDR3 sequences in these biopsy samples. In detail, 12 of the infused neoTCR sequences were among the top 4% CDR3 sequences found in the samples after infusion, 6 of which were from patients who were in the dose level 3 group (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref> and Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">7b</xref>). Immediately flanking the CDR3 sequence is a short codon-optimized constant region that can serve as a barcode to differentiate between the native neoTCR and the transgenic neoTCR CDR3 sequences (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">7c</xref>). This enabled us to distinguish the neoantigen-specific native T cells from neoTCR transgenic T cells and to quantify the infiltration of neoTCR transgenic T cells into tumours after infusion. Using this approach, 22 separate populations of infused neoTCR transgenic T cells were detected in the tumours. Notably, only 2 out of the 22 populations (TCR913 and TCR441) of neoantigen-specific native T cells were evident in pre-infusion tumour biopsy samples. TCR441 was present at a high frequency in the blood at the time of product selection for patient 0010 (145 per 168,000 CD8 cells; Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>), constituting 0.09% of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the blood. In both the biopsy samples taken at baseline and after infusion, the TCR441 barcode could not be detected directly. However, the native sequence was detected, which suggests the presence of native but not transgenic TCR441. TCR913 (from patient 0612) was detected in the pre-infusion and after infusion biopsy samples, and detection of the TCR913 barcode in the sample after infusion suggests the presence of the infused TCR913 transgenic T cells. TCRs with a lower IFNγ EC<sub>50</sub> value or higher affinity score (a measure of CD8-independent binding) were more likely to be found in the tumour. Specifically, 16 out of the 22 individual T cell populations were detected in the analysed biopsy samples taken after infusion from the 8 patients with samples available for analyses (Extended data Fig. <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">7d</xref>; *<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). For patient 0503, who received an infusion containing three neoTCR products, the presence of the neoTCRs was inferred by the flanking barcode sequence (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a,b</xref>), but the CDR3 sequence for the specific neoTCR could not be resolved.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><title>Trafficking of neoTCR transgenic T cells as detected in tumour biopsies.</title><p><bold>a</bold>, Analysis of all available biopsy samples at baseline (Before) and after infusion (After) for the presence of infused neoTCRs from detected CDR3α and barcoded reads for DL1, DL2 and DL3 with or without IL-2.

              <p id="Par18">The presence of neoTCR transgenic T cells in the biopsy samples after infusion was additionally confirmed by fluorescence microscopy using RNAscope in situ hybridization (ISH) probes that were developed to specifically detect the mRNA sequences of the neoTCR knock-in construct. Using this approach for four of the biopsy samples taken after dosing, we directly visualized the intratumoural presence of the neoTCR transgenic T cells. These cells were frequently in contact with cancer cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>), which demonstrates that the infused neoTCR transgenic T cells trafficked to solid tumour metastases. The neoTCR transgenic T cell frequency determined from these images showed good correlation with the neoTCR transgene sequencing read counts (Pearson’s coefficient of 0.8; Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">7e</xref>).</p>

              <title>Toxicities, responses and patient outcomes</title>
              <p id="Par19">All patients experienced grade 3–4 pancytopaenia, which is an expected toxicity owing to the lymphodepletion conditioning regimen. There were two events of toxicities that were possibly attributed to the neoTCR transgenic T cell therapy (Extended Data Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Patient 0613 developed grade 1 cytokine release syndrome, which occurred in the setting of febrile neutropaenia. Patient 1003, who had a history of treated brain metastases, developed grade 3 encephalitis, which presented as difficulty in walking, and tremulous and difficulty in writing on day 7 after infusion. Treatment of patient 1003 with high-dose corticosteroids for 4 days led to resolution of the symptoms. Eleven patients had disease progression and five patients had stable disease as their best response at their first tumour assessment (day 28 after infusion; Extended Data Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> and Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">7f</xref>). Two of these patients had decreases in size of some of the target lesions. This included the first patient in the clinical trial, 0010 in the dose level 1 group, who had a 17% decrease in size of the sum of maximum diameter of target lesions on day 28. This patient had metastatic breast cancer and had received seven previous lines of therapy, but it could be argued that this cancer may have responded to high doses of cyclophosphamide from the preconditioning regimen, as there was limited in vivo expansion of the infused neoTCR transgenic T cells, an APOBEC signature with loss of the targeted neoantigens and HLA LOH for one of the targeted alleles detected retrospectively. Patient 1003, the last patient enrolled into the clinical trial, had metastatic non-small cell lung cancer and had received six previous lines of therapy (three at the time of informed consent and three more before neoTCR transgenic T cell infusion). This patient had stable disease on day 28 scans, with an overall sum of target lesions of −2% from baseline scans. Target lesions in the liver, lymph nodes and ovary were decreased (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">7g</xref>), but there was a concomitant increase in the size of metastatic lesions at other metastatic sites. Although no post-treatment biopsy samples were available to look for T cell infiltration or detection of the targeted neoantigens, the high percentage of neoTCR transgenic T cells detected in the periphery and the decrease in some, but not all, target lesions suggests that the therapy may have had an effect.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par20">Here we developed and utilized several technologies to achieve the following: efficiently define the landscape of T cell responses to mutational neoantigens presented by over 60 HLA class I alleles; clone neoTCR genes from individual T cells circulating in peripheral blood; and genetically engineer them back into autologous T cells using non-viral gene-editing techniques. In doing so, we demonstrated that it is feasible to generate personalized T cell therapies with neoantigen-specific TCRs for ACT. When infused into patients, these neoTCR transgenic T cells circulate through the blood and were detected in tumour metastases at frequencies higher than baseline native T cells with the same neoantigen-specific TCRs.</p>
              <p id="Par21">The technology described herein also demonstrated the feasibility and safety of non-viral precision genome-engineering for the manufacture of clinical-grade gene-engineered ACT products. A similar approach has been recently used to insert a CD19 chimeric antigen receptor into the <italic>PD1</italic> locus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Infusions of this product into patients with B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma led to high levels of antitumour activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. The use of a HR template plasmid instead of a virus for the delivery of the inserted payload enabled rapid and personalized vector generation for both prototype testing of neoTCR candidates and the generation of plasmid material at good manufacturing practice (GMP) grade. This in turn enabled clinical-grade cell manufacture. Using this strategy, we overcame the hurdles of lengthy and expensive generation of virus-based vectors to deliver the genetic payload, which hampers their use for personalized ACT. The cloning and GMP manufacture of the HR template plasmid is rapid and cost-effective, and the precision-targeted integration in the T cell genome affords an extra level of safety compared to random integration associated with viral vectors. A further advantage of using HR plasmids is the ability to integrate payloads that exceed the packaging limits of adeno-associated viruses and other viral vectors.</p>
              <p id="Par22">The clinical trial approach described herein has several limitations. A major challenge of an approach that uses targeted personalized neoantigens is the limited ability and time to characterize each of them for protein expression and neoepitope presentation. Here we assessed gene expression and mutation truncality parameters to select neoantigens for targeting. Favouring mutations induced by oncogenic events in the first cancer clone (for example, from carcinogens such as tobacco or ultraviolet light) should result in truncal mutations, as opposed to targeting mutations induced by DNA repair syndromes or APOBEC, which have a higher likelihood for divergent heterogeneous evolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. We consider targeting truncal mutations whenever possible; however, truncality determinations from a single biopsy are not perfect and additional samples, for example, in the form of ctDNA are desirable. In addition, retrospective analysis of the biopsy samples taken at the time of screening demonstrated that four of the selected neoTCRs were restricted by a HLA exhibiting LOH. This finding highlights the need for the inclusion of LOH analysis in the screening protocol before deciding which neoantigens to target<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Given the potential for immunoediting of highly immunogenic neoantigens, biopsy samples taken at baseline should be analysed for the status of antigen-presenting machinery molecules to rule out LOH of <italic>HLA</italic> alleles and alterations in <italic>TAP</italic> transporters or <italic>B2M</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par23">Another complexity of the personalized approach results from the different affinities of the neoTCRs selected for each patient. In the current work, we initially cast a wide net based on literature that suggested that low-affinity TCRs on T cells could be beneficial in chronic viral infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. To provide a benchmark for TCRs used in ACT therapies for the treatment of solid cancers, we directly compared the activity of neoTCRs used in our clinical trial with previously well-characterized TCRs to shared antigens such as MART-1, KRAS-G12D, HPV E6 and E7, mutated p53 or NY ESO-1, for which clinical data were available<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. These TCRs had EC<sub>50</sub> activities below 10 ng ml<sup>–1</sup>, with the exception of the HPV-E6 TCR, which had an EC<sub>50</sub> of 63 ng ml<sup>–1</sup>. By comparison, only 8 out of the 37 TCRs that were selected for cell product manufacture in our neoTCR clinical trial had IFNγ EC<sub>50</sub> values below 10 ng ml<sup>–1</sup>. As we learned from our own data about neoTCR T cell trafficking into the tumour and as more clinical data became available<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>, we narrowed the TCR affinity criteria for product selection in favour of higher affinity TCRs. These criteria were applied to the last two patients (0417 and 1003) who received the treatment in the current clinical trial.</p>
              <p id="Par24">Last, the personalized neoTCR isolation, cloning, validation and selection steps resulted in a lengthy process that was heavily dependent on the quality of the tumour and PBMC samples available for analyses. The time taken to obtain additional samples and repeated analyses, particularly for screening of TCRs, delayed the ability to infuse the neoTCR cell products into patients. This could be mitigated in the future through streamlined sample acquisition and process automation. A potential solution for issues regarding TCR and neoantigen variability and the lengthy product selection process would be to use the same technology for TCR discovery and validation to generate a pre-established library of TCRs specific for common mutations and viral antigens that would cover multiple HLA specificities.</p>
              <p id="Par25">Limited in vivo expansion of the infused neoTCR gene-edited T cells was observed in participants who received the original conditioning chemotherapy and cell products manufactured using processes v.2.0 and v.2.1 and the two low-cell doses. This in turn probably resulted in a low probability of clinical benefit. The dose-escalation study started with cell doses that may be lower than would be needed for the potential of a clinical response, especially if we consider that the total transgenic cell dose was divided by the three TCRs in many patients. In the solid tumour setting, TCR transgenic T cell clinical trials conducted by other groups have shown clinical activity in the 5–10 × 10<sup>9</sup> per TCR range, with no clear dose response beyond 10 billion cells per TCR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. The improvements in the manufacturing process during the conduct of the trial and progressing through the cell doses led to better in vivo expansion in the last patients who received treatment, getting closer to the levels that would be therapeutic in other studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par26">In conclusion, we demonstrated the ability to use CRISPR-based, non-viral knockout and knock-in editing to genetically redirect T cells to mutational neoantigens in humans. This work builds on research on the use of genome editing to redirect T cell specificity with transgenic TCR engineering<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup> to generate a widely applicable, tumour-specific, personalized T cell therapy for patients with solid cancers. Substitution of the endogenous TCR with a neoTCR results in T cells that only react to the mutation presented by a specific HLA, thereby providing a safe target for T cell engineering and redirection to cancer cells. With our demonstration of the feasibility and safety of this approach, neoTCR engineered T cells could be further genetically engineered to increase their functionality. The versatility of the non-viral gene-editing approach, which in a single step enables the knocking out and knocking in of several genes, predicts that future clinical approaches will be able to incorporate additional gene edits that improve T cell function and avoid T cell exhaustion. Other advances include edits that permit T cells to continue to react to antigen despite repeated antigen encounters, avoid immune suppressive factors in the solid tumour microenvironment and allow in vivo expansion without the need for lymphodepleting conditioning chemotherapy. Many potential targets have been identified from T cell biology studies in the past decades, T cell functional analyses from knockout mice, recent CRISPR screens and engineering of synthetic receptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. Together, such research will provide a path to generate neoTCR engineered T cell therapies with the ability to control in vivo expansion and avoid T cell exhaustion, thereby hopefully resulting in complete and durable responses for patients with solid tumours.</p>

Safety and feasibility were assessed for the infusion of up to three distinct neoTCR T cell products for each patient. Patients were treated with neoTCR<sup>+</sup> T cells at doses of 4 × 10<sup>8</sup> (dose level 1, 1.3 × 10<sup>8</sup>–4 × 10<sup>8</sup> cells per TCR), 1.3 × 10<sup>9</sup> (dose level 2, 4 × 10<sup>8</sup>–1.3 × 10<sup>9</sup> cells per TCR) or 4 × 10<sup>9</sup> (dose level 3, 1.3 × 10<sup>9</sup>–4 × 10<sup>9</sup> cells per TCR). The total number of gene-edited cells at a given dose level remained the same regardless of the number of neoTCR T cell products infused (level 1, 2 or 3).

In brief, WES and RNA-seq from a recent tumour sample in a FFPE section and PBMCs were performed using an Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform or a NovaSeq 6000 platform (Illumina). First, WES sequences were aligned to the human reference genome build 37 (GRCh37/hg19) using BWA-MEM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. NSMs identified by at least two mutation callers among VarScan2 and MuTect or MuTect2, VarDictJava and Strelka2 were retained as potential neoantigens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>.

In v.3 of the software, OptiType alignment with RNA-seq reads to individual restricting HLAs to access expression levels were routinely reported. For v.1, netMHCpan 3.0 was used, whereas v.2 used netMHCpan 4.0 and v.3 used netMHCpan 4.1 (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>). In addition, the truncality and cancer cellular fraction of the detected NSMs were predicted on the basis of the WES results and were available at the time of product selection, with preference given to truncal NSMs. In brief, the read alignment files from WES of tumour biopsy samples and matched PBMCs generated previously were used as input for copy number segmentation, ploidy and tumour purity estimation, and allelic copy number profiling using Sequenza<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>. This step was followed by PyClone analysis as previously described for NSM truncality estimation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>. Finally, the HLA–peptide complexes with predicted binding affinities among the top 2% ranking with respect to each HLA were selected, and only the peptides with confirmed expression by RNA-seq were included. A maximum of 352 selections were made per patient. In v.3 of the software, the first five epitopes chosen consisted of recurrent driver mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup> regardless of ranking if they were present and expressed. Prioritized HLA–peptide complexes were used to generate protein reagents. Neoepitopes that were derived from recurrent driver mutations were noted at the time of product selection.</p>

The TCRα and TCRβ CDR3 sequences in the tumour biopsy samples were identified and compared with neoTCR CDR3 sequences. Five distinct base changes in a short stretch of a codon-optimized constant region served as an effective barcode for identifying specific neoTCRs.

                <p id="Par35">HLA LOH was analysed using both WES and RNA-seq data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref></sup> using two complimentary approaches. First, WES data were used to access allelic copy number at HLA loci using Sequenza<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>, with a copy number state of zero denoting putative LOH. To determine which HLA allele was lost, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) frequencies between alleles were compared with a binomial generalized linear model, and the allele with the lower SNP frequency was assigned to the lower copy number state. Unique SNPs for HLA alleles were derived from IMGT (v.3.40.3)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup>. Second, the allelic imbalance at 26 HLA loci was calculated in DNA and RNA, for which the allelic imbalance is the normalized ratio of sequencing depth at SNP positions between alleles at a locus. A higher allelic imbalance in DNA corresponds to a greater difference in copy number between alleles, whereas a higher allelic imbalance in RNA represent a greater difference in the expression of one allele relative to the other. Samples with LOH are expected to have higher allelic imbalance in DNA and RNA because LOH reduces the sequencing depth at SNP positions for the lost allele. Allelic copy number and allelic imbalance in DNA and RNA were then manually reviewed to confirm the HLA LOH classification.</p>

Healthy donor T cells engineered to express a neoTCR from the blood of a patient with colorectal cancer targeting the COX6C-R20Q mutation, cocultured with either the parental SW620 cell line (without R20Q mutation), or with SW620-COX6C R20Q. <bold>c</bold>) Potency (IFNγ EC<sub>50</sub>) of neoTCRs isolated from the 16 patients compared with seven clinically active TCRs. <bold>d</bold>) Example gene editing (as measured by staining for 2A peptide) and neoTCR binding on CD4 and CD8 T cells for the three TCRs in a manufactured cell product. TCR1036 showed 2A expression and neoTCR binding of dextramer in CD4 and CD8 T cells, considered CD8-independent. TCR1033 and TCR1037 showed only 2A expression but no neoTCR binding by dextramer when transfected into CD4 T cells, considered CD8-dependent. <bold>e</bold>) Targeted locus amplification (TLA) was performed on 0010 TCR445 drug product. Primers specific for transgene and integrated transgene were used to amplify TLA processed genomic DNA. High coverage at the chromosome 14 integration site was observed (blue circle), indicating on-target <italic>TRAC</italic> transgene integration. A similar peak was not observed at chromosome 7, the site of TRBC knockout. <bold>f</bold>) Six clinical drug products from three patients were analysed using fluorescent <italic>in-situ</italic> hybridization (FISH) for chromosomal anomalies involving chromosome 7 and chromosome 14. All abnormal signals from each drug product tested were summed and compared to the total number of abnormal signals found in unedited cells from 10 separate donors. A p value was generated using an unpaired two-tailed t-test.</p>

              <p>S.P.F., K.J., T.H., Z.P., E.S., C.L.W., W.L., A.V.R., S.J.M. and A.R. wrote the first draft of the manuscript. A.V.R., R.F., A.S. and T.S.-S. designed, initiated and ran the clinical study protocol. A.V.R., A.S., D.A.B., D.Y.O., B.C., M.A., Y.Y., A.J.S., J.A.S. and S.M.L. enrolled, treated and cared for patients on the clinical study protocol. Z.P., E.S., Y.M., K.M.C. and C.S. performed and interpreted bioinformatics analysis. M.T.B., O.D., K.H. and M.C.Y. developed or conducted work related to peptide–HLA protein synthesis. C.L.W., S.P., M.T.B., D. An., B.Y. and B.B.Q. created the process, acquired and/or analysed data for neoTCR T cell isolation. K.J., W.L. and R.M. developed the method or performed and analysed the studies for non-viral precision TCR replacement. A.J.L. developed and conducted the functional cytotoxicity experiments. B.S., A.C. and J.M. developed the methods, performed studies and analysed or interpreted data for product selection. Cell and plasmid manufacturing processes were created and supervised by I.M., D. Anaya. and L.D. Flow cytometry was performed, analysed or supervised by S.P.F., T.H., S.G., E.Y.-H.H., A.H., M.K., W.W., L.S., E.H., V.M. and B.P. (for the final cell product) and S.P.F., T.H., S.G., E.H. and A.H. (after infusion). T.H. analysed serum cytokines. A.H.C.N. and Y.L. performed fluorescence microscopy and together with J.R.H. scored and interpreted the staining results. S.P., M.T.B., A.F., S.J.M., D.B., J.R.H. and A.R. conceived the initial idea and provided scientific input for neoTCR cell isolation for personalized adoptive cell therapy. All authors proofread and approved the final manuscript.</p>
