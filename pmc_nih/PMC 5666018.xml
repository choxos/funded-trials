                <p id="Par1">Exosomes, small (30–150 nm) extracellular vesicles (EVs) isolated from plasma of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) carry leukemia-associated antigens and multiple inhibitory molecules. Circulating exosomes can deliver suppressive cargos to immune recipient cells, inhibiting anti-tumor activities. Pre-therapy plasma of refractory/relapsed AML patients contains elevated levels of immunosuppressive exosomes which interfere with anti-leukemia functions of activated immune cells. We show that exosomes isolated from pre-therapy plasma of the AML patients receiving adoptive NK-92 cell therapy block anti-leukemia cytotoxicity of NK-92 cells and other NK-92 cell functions. NK-92 cells do not internalize AML exosomes. Instead, signaling via surface receptors expressed on NK-92 cells, AML exosomes simultaneously deliver multiple inhibitory ligands to the cognate receptors. The signals are processed downstream and activate multiple suppressive pathways in NK-92 cells. AML exosomes reprogram NK-92 cells, interfering with their anti-leukemia functions and reducing the therapeutic potential of adoptive cell transfers. Plasma-derived exosomes interfere with immune cells used for adoptive cell therapy and may limit expected therapeutic benefits of adoptive cell therapy.</p>

              <p id="Par2">Adoptive cell therapy (ACT), including transfer of activated NK cells, is currently under active investigation for patients with refractory/relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Administration of ACT to AML patients is based on the rationale that adoptively- transferred NK cells will eliminate leukemic blasts in the periphery as well as in the bone marrow and will promote recovery of anti-leukemia immunity compromised by the progressing disease and/or chemotherapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Immunological dysfunction in patients with AML, including deficits in NK-cell numbers and activity, elevation in the number of circulating regulatory T cells (Treg) and dysregulation in the cytokine profiles could contribute to leukemia relapse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par3">In hope of restoring, at least in part, anti-leukemia immunity in patients with relapsed/refractory AML, we recently completed a phase 1 clinical trial of ACT with NK-92 cells (a human IL-2 dependent NK-cell line FDA-approved for human ACT)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par4">The ACT was well tolerated, but no immunological recovery and no complete responces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. These disappointing results could be attributed to profoundly immunosuppressive microenvironment in relapsed/refractor AML patients. Among many potential mechanisms responsible for impaired anti-leukemia activity in AML that could also interfere with adoptively transferred NK-92 cells is exosome-mediated immune suppression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par5">Exosomes are the smallest (30–150 mm) of extracellular vesicles (EVs) circulating freely throughout the body and serving as an efficient communication system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. We have reported that blast-derived exosomes carrying immunosuppressive cargos accumulate in plasma of AML patients and include dysfunction of immune cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. The pre-ACT levels of plasma-derived exosomes were highly elevated in the patients enrolled in the trial. Therefore, we hypothesized that NK-92 cells transferred into the environment dominated by immunosuppressive exosomes failed to mediate anti-leukemia activity. To test the hypothesis, we isolated exosomes from the pre-therapy plasma specimens of AML patients enrolled in the trial and studied their effects on NK-92 cell functions. We show that exosomes isolated from pre-therapy plasma of these patients inhibited various NK-92 cell functions <italic>ex vivo</italic> and interfered with anti-leukemia activity of these cells. Further, the <italic>ex vivo</italic> blockade of exosome-mediated suppression in part restored NK-92 cell functions. These results suggest that in malignancy, plasma-derived exosomes can interfere with immune cells used for ACT and may limit expected therapeutic benefits of ACT.</p>

                <title>Characterization of AML exosomes</title>
                <p id="Par6">Transmission electron microscopy of exosomes isolated from pre-therapy plasma of patients with relapsed/refractory AML showed the presence of vesicles sized at 30–150 nm (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a,b</xref>) and similar to vesicles present in plasma of all other AML patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. The mean exosome protein levels were significantly elevated in patients’ versus HD’s plasma and remained persistently elevated following ACT (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). The pre-therapy exosome protein levels in plasma of the 7 AML patients receiving ACT were equally as high (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). The molecular profiles of AML exosomes isolated from pre-therapy plasma were enriched in leukemia associated antigens (LAAs) and in proteins that mediate immune suppression, such as TGF-β1/LAP, CD39/CD73 ectoenzymes, PD1/PD-L1 or Fas/FasL (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). Notably, the exosome protein profiles were distinct for each of the 7 AML patients. In semi-quantitative density analyses of Western blots, AML exosomes carried significantly higher levels of immunoinhibitory proteins than exosomes of HDs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). Furthermore, the molecular profile of exosomes isolated from AML plasma following ACT on day 7 or 21 remained enriched in immunoinhibitory proteins (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b,c,d</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Characteristics and plasma levels of AML exosomes.

                <p id="Par7">The effect of AML exosomes on NK-92 cell proliferation was examined. In Supplementary Figure <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1A</xref>, NK-92 cells cultured in X-VIVO medium are seen to form large, well-defined clusters, which shrink in size upon exosome addition, releasing single cells. At higher exosome concentrations, the cell clusters shrink further in size, and numbers of single cells increase. Proliferation of NK-92 cells measured in MTT assays, was significantly decreased upon addition of exosomes (Supplementary Figure <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1B</xref>). However, NK-92 cells were resistant to apoptosis, did not bind Annexin V and were PI negative following co-incubation with AML exosomes (Supplementary Figure <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1C</xref>).</p>

                <title>AML exosomes inhibit NKG2D expression and cytolytic activity of NK-92 cells</title>
                <p id="Par8">NK-92, similar to primary activated NK (aNK) cells express high levels of NKG2D (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). In addition, NK-92 express TGFβRI and TGFβRII and CD95 (Fas). They do not express PD-1. Exosomes isolated from pre-ACT plasma of AML patients carry ligands for these receptors (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a,b</xref>). Co-incubation of NK-92 cells with PKH67-labeled exosomes isolated from pre-therapy plasma significantly reduced expression levels of NKG2D on the NK-92 cell surface (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). Downregulation of NKG2D expression was measured by flow cytometry using exosomes isolated from plasma of four AML patients at diagnosis or from supernatants of leukemia cell lines, Kasumi-1 or ML-2 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>; Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Also, exosomes isolated from plasma of 3 AML patients obtained pre-ACT or on day 7 or 21 after ACT similarly down-regulated NKG2D expression levels in NK-92 cells. The data for NKG2D expression after co-incubation of NK-92 cells of 4 AML patients are shown in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. The data indicate that the mean % inhibition of NKG2D expression on NK-92 cells by AML exosomes was 40%. Interestingly, exosomes from post-ACT plasma (days 7 or 21) were less inhibitory than pre-ACT exosomes (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>NKG2D receptor downregulation in NK-92 cells and inhibition of NK-92 cytotoxicity by pre-therapy AML exosomes.

AML exosomes alone or in combination with rhTGFβ1 downregulated expression of Tbet transcription factor in NK-92 cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b2</xref>). Also, when TGFβ alone or AML exosomes alone were co-incubated with primary aNK cells, SMAD2/3 phosphorylation increased, but this increase was enhanced upon a combined treatment with TGFβ and AML exosomes.

              <p id="Par16">Adoptive cellular therapy (ACT) with various <italic>in vitro</italic> modified or engineered immune cells is rapidly emerging as a desirable experimental immune-based treatment for cancer. ACT is a potentially curable treatment for patients with cancer, especially for patients with hematological malignancies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Patients with AML who are candidates for receiving ACTs generally had not responded to conventional therapies, experience drug resistance and have recurrent disease. From a therapeutic viewpoint, these patients represent an appropriate population for infusion of immune effector cells with potent anti-tumor activities. On the other hand, immune suppression and immune tumor escape are likely to be a significant barrier to the success of ACT in patients with advanced, refractory or drug-resistant malignancies. NK-92 cells selected for ACT are maintained as an IL-2 dependent cell line, proliferate rapidly <italic>ex vivo</italic>, are highly cytotoxic against leukemic targets and are resistant to apoptosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. NK-92 cells are resistant to irradiation obligatory prior to their therapeutic use, remain viable and retain high levels of anti-leukemia cytolytic activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. ACT with NK-92 cells in patients with relapsed/refractory AML was well tolerated and free of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Extensive immunological monitoring before, during and after ACT showed an absence of immune recovery and no long-term clinical responses. Levels of exosomes of immunosuppressive proteins were highly elevated in the patients’ plasma prior to ACT and remained elevated during and after therapy. These exosomes had profound inhibitory effects on anti-leukemia activity of transferred NK92 cells. They carried LAA and immunosuppressive proteins, including TGF-β and inhibited cytotoxicity, differentiation, proliferation and leukemia-directed migration of NK-92 cells used for therapy. AML exosomes did not induce apoptosis of NK-92 cells perhaps because they activated anti-apoptotic genes in these cells. AML exosomes induced phenotypic changes in NK-92 cells, including downregulation of an activating receptor, NKG2D or of CXCR4 involved in cell migration. The cytokine/chemokine production profile was altered in NK-92 cells co-incubated with AML exosomes, with a targeted loss in the levels of MIP1α (CCL3), MIP1β (CCL4) and RANTES (CCL5), the chemokines which modulate cell migration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Production of soluble immuno-inhibitory factors, such as adenosine, inosine and hypoxanthine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> by NK-92 cells was significantly elevated upon co-incubation with AML exosomes, suggesting that autocrine inhibition of NK-92 functions via up-regulated A<sub>2A</sub>R contributed to their functional paralysis. Exosomes isolated from post-ACT plasma retained the immunosuppressive profile and the ability to down-regulate of NK-92 cells used for therapy. The NK-92 cells re-programmed by AML exosomes were viable but unable to migrate or mediate anti-leukemia cytotoxicity.</p>
              <p id="Par17">Reprogramming of NK-92 cell functions by AML exosomes did not require exosome uptake by recipient NK-92 cells. Although primary aNK cells internalize tumor-derived exosomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, NK-92 cells failed to do so even after prolonged co-incubation with AML exosomes. PKH26 dye-labeled AML exosomes accumulated on the surface but not in the cytosol of NK-92 cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>), while primary aNK cells rapidly internalized AML exosomes under the same experimental conditions. Thus, AML exosome-driven reprogramming of NK-92 cells was mediated through signals delivered to the cell surface. Among the signals delivered by AML exosomes that inhibited NK-92 cell cytotoxicity, TGFβ1 was an obvious candidate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Neutralizing Abs specific for TGFβ in part reversed exosome-mediated inhibition of NK-92 cytotoxicity (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>). AML exosomes enhanced TGFβ1 signaling via TGFβRI/II on the surface of primary aNK or NK-92 cells as evidenced by increased phosphorylation of SMAD 2/3 and its down-regulation by LY2109761, an inhibitor of TGFβ receptor signaling. TGFβ in the presence of AML exosomes downregulated expression levels of T-bet in NK-92 cells. These data suggest that AML exosomes re-program NK-92 cells using surface receptor-ligand signaling that translates into altered cellular responses.</p>
              <p id="Par18">In addition to TGFβ, AML exosomes carry multiple other inhibitory receptor/ligands and may deliver them as a “bundle” to the surface of immune or other recipient cells. NK-92 cells transferred into the circulation of AML patients are likely to encounter masses of circulating exosomes, all decorated with “bundles” of the immunosuppressive cargo (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). These exosomes simultaneously deliver multiple inhibitory signals to recipient NK-92 cells, which upon translating these signals downstream become unable to mediate anti-leukemia activities. The molecular pathways engaged by exosome-mediated signaling are dependent on ligands in the exosome cargo and receptors expressed on the surface of the recipient cell. As NK-92 cells do not express PD-1, AML exosomes decorated by PD-L1 are unlikely to engage the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway in NK-92 recipient cells. Instead, the TGFβ/TGFβRI/II pathway, and other common molecular pathways, e.g., adenosine pathway, become activated by exosomes carrying cognate ligands and are responsible for downstream reprogramming. This type of reprogramming introduces a novel and so far underestimated mechanism of immune suppression existing in patients with advanced malignancies in the form of tumor-derived exosomes that may interfere with cellular adoptive therapies.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>A hypothetical diagram of an NK-92 cell in the peripheral circulation of a patient with relapsed/refractory AML. The adoptively transferred NK-92 cell (similar to endogenous NK cells) is surrounded by masses of circulating exosomes, which carry immunosuppressive cargos, including various inhibitory ligands. Binding to cognate receptors on the NK-92 cell surface, these ligands, simultaneously activate multiple inhibitory pathways in the recipient cell. Exosome-driven negative signaling leads to a loss of NK92 cell functions.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41598_2017_14661_Fig6_HTML" id="d29e1307"/></fig>

Changes in NK-92 functions following co-incubation with exosomes were measured using the exosomes isolated from pre-therapy plasma of the AML patients treated with ACT. As volumes of banked pre-therapy plasma were limited, we could not obtain sufficient quantity of exosomes from all patients for all functional assays and had to perform some experiments with exosomes isolated from plasma of relapsed/refractory AML patients who were not enrolled in the clinical trial. This is justifiable as exosomes from plasma of all relapsed/ refractory AML patients carry numerous inhibitory ligands and mediate suppression of immune cells <italic>in vitro</italic>
