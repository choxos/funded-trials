                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) is a human papillomavirus (HPV) driven neoplastic disorder of the upper aerodigestive tract that causes significant morbidity and can lead to fatal airway obstruction. Prior clinical study demonstrated clinical benefit with the programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) monoclonal antibody avelumab. Bintrafusp alfa is a bifunctional inhibitor of PD-L1 and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-b) that has shown clinical activity in several cancer types.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>We conducted a phase II clinical trial evaluating bintrafusp alfa in adults with RRP. Papilloma samples before and after treatment with bintrafusp alfa were assessed for correlates of response with multiplex immunofluorescence as well as immunological and genomic analyses. Post hoc analyses of papilloma samples before and after treatment with avelumab were assessed for comparison.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Dual PD-L1/TGF-b inhibition failed to abrogate papilloma growth in most subjects and increased the frequency of clinically indicated interventions after treatment in four of eight subjects based on each subject’s own historical control. TGF-b neutralization consistently decreased pSMAD3 and p21 and increased Ki67 expression within the basal layers of papillomas, indicating that TGF-b restrained proliferation. These alterations were not observed in papillomas treated with PD-L1 blockade alone. Dual PD-L1/TGF-b inhibition did not enhance anti-HPV immunity within papillomas beyond that observed with PD-L1 blockade. Genomic alterations in TGF-b superfamily genes were infrequent in papillomas and normal mucosa but present in a significant fraction of head and neck carcinomas.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>Intact TGF-b signaling restrains proliferation within papillomas, and the use of clinical agents that abrogate this pathway should be avoided in patients with RRP.</p>

Within normal stratified squamous epithelia, TGF-b regulates cellular proliferation.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> In the context specific of genetic or epigenetic aberrations affecting canonical antiproliferative signaling pathways, TGF-b may promote tumor development or progression.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 3</xref> TGF-b is potently immunosuppressive, at least through immune cell exclusion from the tumor microenvironment and direct suppression of T lymphocyte and natural killer cell cytotoxic function.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4–7</xref> Additionally, TGF-b drives epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in malignant cells.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Neutralization or blockade of TGF-b signaling can lead to tumor growth inhibition both through direct tumor cell effects as well as through tumor cell independent alteration of the tumor microenvironment and enhancement of antitumor immunity.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 10</xref> Patients with relapsed high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) associated carcinoma benefit from treatment with agents that block TGF-b, including bintrafusp alfa, a bifunctional fusion protein linking a PD-L1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) with a TGF-b trap to neutralize soluble TGF-b.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p>
              <p>Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) is caused by chronic infection with low-risk HPV types 6 or 11 and manifests as papillomatous growths in the upper and sometimes lower respiratory tract that can disrupt voice and breathing. Patients with RRP benefit from PD-L1 blockade with the PD-L1 mAb avelumab, with treatment-associated reduction in disease burden and the need for fewer surgical interventions after completion of treatment.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Given promising clinical data in patients with relapsed HPV-associated malignancy, we hypothesized that patients with RRP would further clinically benefit from dual PD-L1 and TGF-b blockade with bintrafusp alfa. Here, we report the clinical results of a phase II study of bintrafusp alfa in adult subjects with RRP. Correlative studies of papilloma tissues from patients treated with dual PD-L1/TGF-b inhibition were performed alongside papillomas from patients treated with PD-L1 blockade alone as a comparison.</p>

                <p>Subjects aged 18 years or greater with a pathologically confirmed diagnosis of papilloma and with a clinical diagnosis of recurrent respiratory papillomatosis were eligible for both studies. Eligible subjects were required to have tracheal disease, or laryngeal disease with an anatomic Derkay score of 10 or greater, that required two or more clinically indicated interventions in the prior 12 months. Inclusion criteria included adequate organ function as measured by standard laboratory tests and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1. Exclusion criteria included evidence of infection with HIV, hepatis B or C, history of solid organ or bone marrow transplant, autoimmune disease or immunosuppression.</p>

                <title>Study design and oversight</title>
                <p>Both phase II studies, Avelumab for People with Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis (NCT 02859454) and M7824 for People with Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis (NCT03427411) were approved by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Institutional Review Board, and informed consent was obtained from all subjects. Treatment consistent of intravenous avelumab (10 mg/kg) or intravenous bintrafusp alfa (1200 mg) administered every 2 weeks. On-treatment disease response was assessed by clinical endoscopic examination every 2 weeks for the duration of the study. Papilloma disease burden was quantified via calculation of an anatomic Derkay score,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> a validated objective disease measurement tool. At any point, if a subject developed clear disease progression, treatment was halted and surgical debridement of papilloma was performed. If subjects achieved a partial response after three doses, as defined by a reduction in anatomic Derkay score of 30% or greater, subjects received an additional three doses for a maximum of six doses. Adverse events were graded according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events V.4.03. Papilloma and normal mucosa biopsies for correlative studies were obtained before treatment and at the time of surgical debridement following treatment with either avelumab or bintrafusp alfa. Both avelumab and M7824 were provided by EMD Serono through a Cooperative Research and Drug Agreement with the NCI. Following completion of treatment with avelumab or bintrafusp alfa, all subjects underwent surgical debridement of papilloma with standard-of-care techniques and returned to their referring otolaryngologist to resume care. Instruction was given to each referring specialist to resume standard of care after the clinical trial, with decisions of when to proceed with a clinically indicate intervention after the trial to occur in a similar fashion as before the clinical trial. Documentation of clinically indicated interventions before and after each clinical trial was determined from medical records obtained from referring centers for each patient following consent.</p>

Briefly, primary antibody was applied for 60 min, secondary HRP-conjugated antibody was applied for 10 min and tyramide signal amplification was used to amplify fluorescent signal for each protein target sequentially. Primary antibodies included pSMAD2<sup>S465/S467</sup> (Bioss Antibodies #bs-3419R; 1:100 dilution), pSMAD3<sup>S423/S425</sup> (Abcam #ab5293; 1:200), p21 (Cell Signaling Technology #2947; 1:50), Ki67 (Ventana #790–4286; 1:1) and cytokeratin (Santa Cruz #sc81714, 1:400). Secondary antibody staining was performed with ImmPRESS HRP anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG Polymer detection kits (Vector MP-7451; MP-7402) per manufacturer recommendations. Staining was performed with OPAL-480,–520, −570 to –620 and −690 conjugates. Individual subject pretreatment and post-treatment samples were always stained in the same batch with appropriate positive and negative controls. All individual staining and multiplex conditions were optimized on human tonsil sections.</p>

                <p>Nine subjects with RRP were treated with the dual PD-L1/TGF-b inhibitor bintrafusp alfa (<xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental table 1</xref>). Based on frequent clinical endoscopic examination, subjects experienced initial disease regression after the first treatment, then papilloma regrowth (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1A</xref>). In five of nine subjects, the rate of papilloma growth from 2 to 4 or 6 weeks after treatment was greater than the rate of papilloma growth in the 4 weeks prior to starting treatment (<xref rid="SP3" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental figure 1</xref>). A previously reported clinical trial treated a similar patient population with the PD-L1 mAb avelumab following the same treatment schedule.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Comparing clinical endoscopy results from these two separate clinical trials revealed that treatment with dual PD-L1/TGF-b inhibition in the currently reported trial controlled the growth or papillomas to a lesser degree compared with treatment with PD-L1 blockade alone in the previously completed trial (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1B, C</xref>). Peripheral TGF-b levels were significantly reduced following treatment with PD-L1/TGF-b inhibition but not PD-L1 blockade alone (<xref rid="SP3" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental figure 2</xref>). Based on a follow-up period of 1 year after completion of the trial, four of eight (50%) evaluable subjects treated with dual PD-L1/TGF-b inhibition required more frequent surgical intervention compared with the 1 year prior to the study (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1D</xref>). In comparison, 11 of 12 (92%) subjects treated with PD-L1 blockade alone experienced durable responses with increased intersurgery interval after completion of treatment in the previously completed trial. These data indicated that the addition of TGF-b neutralization to PD-L1 blockade abrogated the clinical benefit observed with PD-L1 blockade alone and was associated with reduced papilloma growth control in adult subjects with recurrent respiratory papillomatosis.</p>

                <p>Given the discordant clinical outcomes observed with the addition of TGF-b neutralization to PD-L1 blockade in these two similar clinical studies, correlative analysis of pretreatment and post-treatment papillomas treated with dual PD-L1/TGF-b inhibition was performed. As a comparison, post hoc analysis of papillomas treated with PD-L1 blockade alone in a previous clinical trial was performed concurrently. To determine if canonical TGF-b signaling was intact within papilloma cells and possibly altered by TGF-b neutralization, changes in expression or phosphorylation of key signaling components was assessed in samples from subjects treated with dual PD-L1/TGF-b inhibition or PD-L1 blockade alone via multiplex immunofluorescence (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">figure 2A</xref>). Clear differences in histologic architecture, expression of TGF-b signaling components and proliferative state were evident between the basal and suprabasal layers within papillomas. Basal and suprabasal layers within each papilloma were separately annotated and digitally scored for immunofluorescence positivity and intensity (<xref rid="SP3" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental figure 3</xref>). The basal layers of post-treatment papillomas from subjects treated with dual PD-L1/TGF-b inhibition consistently demonstrated increased expression of the proliferation marker Ki67, decreased p21 cell cycle checkpoint and decreased pSMAD3 compared with pretreatment (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">figure 2B</xref>). One subject with slightly decreased basal layer Ki67 also demonstrated slightly increased basal layer p21. Increased post-treatment basal Ki67 positively correlated with increased papilloma disease burden (Derkay score) in subjects treated with PD-L1 blockade with or without TGF-b neutralization (<xref rid="SP3" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental figure 4</xref>). Basal Ki67 decreased in 10 of 12 (83%) subjects treated with PD-L1 blockade alone. No consistent changes in basal p21 or pSMAD3 were measured in these samples (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">figure 2C</xref>). Furthermore, no consistent changes in basal pSMAD2 or suprabasal Ki67, p21, pSMAD3 or pSMAD2 were observed in papillomas from subjects treated with or without TGF-b neutralization (<xref rid="SP2" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental figure 5</xref>). These data indicated that TGF-b signaling is intact and may be restraining proliferation within basal layer papilloma cells and that TGF-b neutralization correlates with decreased cell cycle checkpoint expression and increased papilloma cell proliferation.</p>

Determined by T lymphocyte IHC (<xref rid="SP3" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental figure 6</xref>), papillomas from patients treated with dual PD-L1/TGF-b inhibition did not consistently increase CD8 or CD4 T lymphocyte infiltration into papillomas (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">figure 3A</xref>). No subjects harbored HPV specific T lymphocytes pretreatment, and treatment with bintrafusp alfa induced HPV immunity in one of eight (13%) evaluable subjects. In comparison, papillomas from subjects treated with PD-L1 blockade alone revealed significantly increased papilloma accumulation of CD8 T lymphocytes and a trend toward increased accumulation of CD4 T lymphocytes (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">figure 3B</xref>). Assessment of specificity of cultured papilloma infiltrating lymphocytes for HPV type specific E2, E6 or E7 revealed that no subjects harbored HPV specific T lymphocytes pretreatment, and treatment with avelumab induced HPV immunity in 3 of 11 (27%) evaluable subjects. These data indicated that dual PD-L1/TGF-b inhibition did not enhance HPV specific immunity beyond that observed with PD-L1 blockade alone within the papillomas of subjects with recurrent respiratory papillomatosis.</p>

First, total somatic SNVs and small insertions and deletions (INDELs) were quantified in pretreatment papillomas (n=21) and laryngeal normal mucosa (n=8) using peripheral leukocytes as a germline reference and compared with HPV-positive HNSCC (n=74) and HPV-negative HNSCC (n=314) from TCGA.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Both HNSCC cohorts harbored a greater number of mutations compared with mucosa or papilloma (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">figure 4A</xref>).

These data revealed that genetic alterations in TGF-b superfamily genes are infrequent events in normal mucosa or papilloma consistent with intact antiproliferative TGF-b signaling.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Clinical and laboratory correlative data are presented from a clinical study treating adult subjects with recurrent respiratory papillomatosis with the bifunctional PD-L1 mAb/TGF-b trap compound bintrafusp alfa. Concurrent correlative analysis of papillomas from a previously reported clinical trial treating a similar population with the PD-L1 mAb avelumab was performed for comparison. This approach allowed assignment of differential clinical and correlative outcomes in this specific population of subjects to TGF-b neutralization. Subjects treated with dual PD-L1/TGF-b inhibition did not experience the degree of papilloma growth control observed with PD-L1 blockade alone, and half of the subjects treated with dual PD-L1/TGF-b inhibition need for more frequent interventions after completion of treatment compared with before treatment. Protein level analysis revealed that TGF-b neutralization inhibited basal papilloma cell specific SMAD3/p21 and increased cell proliferation as measured by Ki67, suggesting that antiproliferative TGF-b signaling is intact within papilloma cells and is reversed by TGF-b neutralization. Therapeutic agents that block TGF-b signaling should not be used clinically in patients with recurrent respiratory papillomatosis.</p>
              <p>TGF-b plays multiple distinct roles within the complex microenvironment of epithelial neoplasms, including epithelial cell dependent and independent effects.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Within normal skin and mucosa, TGF-b signaling results in inhibition of epithelial cell proliferation through defined mechanisms.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> During tumor progression and possibly tumorigenesis, genetic and epigenetic changes appear to lead to a switch in TGF-b signaling from antiproliferative to tumor promoting through mechanisms that appear to be cancer-type dependent.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27–30</xref> This appears to be particularly true for HPV-associated carcinomas, where genome-wide association studies have identified dysregulated <italic toggle="yes">TGFBR1</italic> expression across cancers associated with high-risk HPV infection.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Accordingly, patients with relapsed high-risk HPV-associated malignancies experience clinical benefit from treatment with bintrafusp alfa.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26 32</xref> Data presented here suggest that this is not the case in patients with neoplasms driven by infection with low-risk HPV, such as recurrent respiratory papillomatosis.</p>
              <p>The rationale to use bintrafusp alfa in a clinical study for subjects with recurrent respiratory papillomatosis was also based on the presence of TGF-b within papillomas<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12 33</xref> and the established role of TGF-b in mediating immunosuppression and resistance to immune checkpoint blockade efficacy in patients with cancer.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 4 5 11 32</xref> Deal PD-L1/TGF-b inhibition failed to enhance HPV-specific immunity beyond that observed with PD-L1 blockade alone. It is possible that immune enhancement beyond PD-L1 blockade following TGF-b neutralization indeed occurred within papillomas but was overcome by papilloma-mediated effects resulting from increased cellular proliferation. Whether TGF-b mediates immunosuppression within the microenvironment of papillomas remains unclear. TGF-b is also known to play a role in the transition of normal fibroblasts to cancer associated fibroblasts that support the development of neoplasms.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> The role of fibroblasts exposed to TGF-b within papillomas is poorly studied, and whether neutralization of TGF-b alters the function of fibroblasts within papillomas requires further study.</p>
              <p>Parallels can be drawn between the enhanced proliferation and growth of papillomas and the development of skin lesions such as keratoacanthomas following TGF-b neutralization. Roughly one-quarter of patients treated with agents that disrupt TGF-b signaling develop keratoacanthomas,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26 35</xref> and loss-of-function TGFBR1 mutations have been causally linked to a familial keratoacanthoma syndrome.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> The development of hyperproliferative lesions with TGF-b neutralization appears localized to skin as patients receiving such treatment do not develop mucosal lesions. This suggests that upper aerodigestive tract mucosa may harbor one or more mechanisms independent of TGF-b to limit uncontrolled proliferation and that infection with low-risk HPV may abrogate one or more of these mechanisms to sensitize papillomas to uncontrolled proliferation following TGF-b neutralization. Disruption of p53 or retinoblastoma function by E6 and E7 respectively are clear possibilities. Further study of these concepts may provide new insights into the biology of how chronic infection with low-risk HPV perturbs control of epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation within aerodigestive tract mucosa.</p>
              <p>The lack of genomic alterations in key TGF-b signaling genes and intact TGF-b signaling within papilloma cells as measured by immunofluorescence provides a plausible explanation for why TGF-b neutralization accelerated papilloma growth. The high frequency of genomic alterations in these same TGF-b superfamily genes may help explain the clinical benefit observed with bintrafusp alfa treatment in patients with HPV-associated carcinomas.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26 32</xref> The overall outcome of TGF-b signaling disruption may reflect effects on both tumor cells and non-tumor cells of the immune microenvironment within complex heterogeneous tumors. In papillomas where epithelial compartment TGF-b signaling is intact and antiproliferative, the net result of TGF-b neutralization could be accelerated proliferation, as was observed in papillomas. In lesions such as carcinoma where TGF-b signaling is already disrupted within the malignant cell compartment due to the presence of genomic alterations, and antiproliferative function may be lost and inhibition of TGF-b may not lead to increased proliferation. In this context, effects on the immune compartment may dominate, resulting in clinical benefit. This leads to the intriguing hypothesis that the presence of one or more genomic alterations in TGF-b superfamily genes correlates with response to bintrafusp alfa in patients with relapsed HPV-associated carcinoma. This hypothesis requires further study.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, genomically and functionally intact TGF-b signaling appears to retrain cellular proliferation within papillomas associated with low-risk HPV infection, and clinical agents that disrupt TGF-b signaling should be avoided in patients with recurrent respiratory papillomatosis. Whether or not a beneficial clinical response to bintrafusp alfa in patients with high-risk HPV-associated carcinomas is correlated with the presence of genomic alterations in TGF-b superfamily genes should be studied prospectively.</p>
