              <abstract>
                <p>Research in animals has shown that early life experience, particularly parenting behaviors, influences later-life stress reactivity. Despite the tremendous relevance of this finding to human development and brain function, it has not been tested prospectively in humans. In this study two aspects of parenting were measured at age 4 in a sample of healthy, low socioeconomic status, African American children, and stress reactivity was measured in the same children 11–14 years later using a modified version of the Trier Social Stress Test (<italic>n</italic> = 55). Salivary cortisol was measured before, during and after the stressor and data were analyzed using piecewise hierarchical linear modeling. Parental responsivity, independent of the use of physical discipline, was positively related to cortisol reactivity. Effects were independent of subjective appraisals of the stressor and were also independent of other environmental risk factors and current psychosocial functioning. Therefore this study demonstrates in a novel and precise fashion that early childhood parental responsivity prospectively and independently predicts stress reactivity in adolescence.</p>

              <p>Parental effects on cognitive and socioemotional development are hypothesized to be due, in part, to the influence of early childhood parental care on stress reactivity <xref rid="pone.0058250-Hackman1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0058250-Loman1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. In addition, by shaping the nature of the response to stress and challenge, such an influence is also likely to determine the impact of other environmental factors across development <xref rid="pone.0058250-Ellis1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> and thus have a broad and enduring influence across time. However, despite the importance of the hypothesis that early parenting influences later-life stress reactivity in humans, support is indirect.</p>
              <p>The limbic hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is one such stress response system which mobilizes in response to physical or psychological threats to well-being and facilitates homeostatic regulation through change <xref rid="pone.0058250-Loman1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0058250-Gunnar1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0058250-McEwen1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Stressful events activating the HPA axis result in a molecular cascade that eventually increases circulating glucocorticoids, cortisol in humans, which in turn provide a signal for deactivation of the system through receptors in the hippocampus. In contrast with the sympathetic adrenomedullary system, which rapidly mobilizes resources and facilitates the fight or flight response, the HPA axis is mobilized more slowly in response to acute stressors and induces longer term changes, in part through changes in gene expression that broadly influence the brain and other organ systems.</p>
              <p>Animal research has demonstrated lasting effects of parenting on later-life stress reactivity. Indeed, these effects are sometimes referred to as “programming,” a term that emphasizes the critical, lasting effects of early parenting behaviors <xref rid="pone.0058250-Hackman1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0058250-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0058250-Levine1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. In rodents, the offspring of mothers who exhibit high levels of licking, grooming and arched-back nursing (which facilitates pups' access to milk) show increased hippocampal glucocorticoid receptor expression, enhanced negative feedback regulation, decreased hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) expression, more modest HPA-axis responses to stress, and less fearful behavior. Maternal care is a causal factor in this case, as demonstrated by cross-fostering studies <xref rid="pone.0058250-Hackman1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0058250-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0058250-Levine1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Studies with nonhuman primates in which maternal responsiveness is experimentally decreased find higher levels of CRF in the offspring <xref rid="pone.0058250-Coplan1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Although identifying a human analogue of these behaviors is challenging, they are often considered analogues of affective components of caregiving, such as sensitivity and responsivity <xref rid="pone.0058250-Loman1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. However, differences between species as well as the difficulty in extrapolating parenting characteristics across species highlights the need to investigate this question in humans.</p>
              <p>Evidence in humans shows that a range of atypical rearing experiences are related to HPA-axis reactivity to stress. These experiences include abuse or maltreatment <xref rid="pone.0058250-Fisher1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0058250-Carpenter1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, maternal depression <xref rid="pone.0058250-Gump1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> and experiences of parenting in the context of parental death <xref rid="pone.0058250-Tyrka1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. This literature, however, is complex and yields contradictory findings <xref rid="pone.0058250-Heim2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, suggesting the effects of exposures to adversity and caregiving on stress reactivity are non-linear in nature <xref rid="pone.0058250-Ellis1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0058250-DelGiudice1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. If true, then a focus on atypical caregiving, such as abuse and psychopathology, cannot provide a full account of the effects of parenting on reactivity. We must also study the effects of parenting behaviors across a broad range of typical parenting behaviors. Moreover, it is such variation in typical caregiving behaviors related to warmth and responsivity that has been the focus of the animal literature just cited <xref rid="pone.0058250-Loman1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p>
              <p>In order to test the hypothesis that parental responsivity and sensitivity have an enduring relationship with HPA-axis reactivity to stress, a prospective longitudinal study is necessary. This is because cross sectional studies, in which parenting behavior and stress reactivity are assessed at the same stage of development <xref rid="pone.0058250-Albers1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0058250-SturgeApple1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, and very short-term prospective designs <xref rid="pone.0058250-Bugental1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0058250-Blair1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> do not distinguish between effects of parenting on the concurrent and near-term state of the child's stress physiology and the programming phenomenon revealed by animal research. The same limitations apply to the effect of parenting interventions assessed in the near-term with preschoolers <xref rid="pone.0058250-Brotman1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0058250-Dozier1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Although retrospective assessments of parenting concurrent with a later-life measurement of stress reactivity avoid that problem <xref rid="pone.0058250-Engert1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0058250-Luecken2" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, they instead encounter the problem of retrospective bias, whereby individuals with less well regulated stress systems may be more inclined to remember their parents in a negative light.</p>
              <p>The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that variation in a broader range of typical parenting behaviors in early childhood has a lasting relationship with HPA axis reactivity to stress. In particular, this study aimed to test the hypothesis that those behaviors related to warmth and responsivity, independently from other parenting behaviors such as behavioral control and physical discipline <xref rid="pone.0058250-Cummings1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, have a specific and enduring association with stress reactivity. We therefore took advantage of an on-going longitudinal study of a cohort of low-socioeconomic status (SES), African Americans who have been studied from birth through adolescence <xref rid="pone.0058250-Hurt1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. The Parental Responsivity and Acceptance of Child subscales from the Early Childhood Home Observation Measurement of the Environment (HOME scale), administered when the children were 4 years old, were used as indicators of caregiver warmth and responsiveness and discipline <xref rid="pone.0058250-Caldwell1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref> and chosen as indices of the affective and control components of caregiving <xref rid="pone.0058250-Cummings1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Between the ages of 15 and 18, participants underwent exposure to a mild social stressor, a modified version of the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) <xref rid="pone.0058250-Kirschbaum1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0058250-VonDawans1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, while salivary cortisol was measured across the protocol. To assess the specificity of the effect of parental responsivity, independent of correlated factors, analyses include other measures of early experience, life stress, and psychosocial development that were collected between birth and adolescence. Consequently, this study is uniquely positioned to determine, prospectively, if parental responsivity has an enduring and independent association with stress reactivity.</p>

                <p>Participants were 55 African-American adolescents from the control group of a larger longitudinal study of prenatal cocaine exposure who participated in the stress reactivity protocol <xref rid="pone.0058250-Hurt1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0058250-Hurt2" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Participants were recruited at birth from a single inner-city hospital, born at or near term (≥ 34 weeks) with no serious medical conditions. Mothers were native English speakers and had no past or present indication of major psychiatric illness as determined by medical chart review and interview at time of enrollment. None of the children were exposed prenatally to cocaine as confirmed by maternal self-report, medical chart review, and maternal and infant urine drug screens. Women were excluded if they used substances other than cigarettes, marijuana or alcohol. None of the infants had Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. All families were receiving public assistance and mothers had a high school education or less at the time of birth. Since enrollment, participants have completed semi-annual evaluations.</p>
                <p>The characteristics of the sample are depicted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0058250-t001">Table 1</xref>. Four participants who completed the stressor protocol were excluded due to missing data on aspects of early parenting. One participant did not sleep the night before and was thus excluded from the analysis, while another was excluded because cortisol values were greater than 3 <italic>SD</italic> above the mean of the other measurements on 6 of 9 samples. Analyses thus included a total of 49 participants (28 female, 57.1%) between the ages of 15 and 18 (<italic>M</italic> = 16.7, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.1). Written consent was obtained from participants aged 18 and older or from the parents or guardians of participating children, who also gave assent to participate. The Institutional Review Boards of the University of Pennsylvania and The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia approved the project.</p>

                <p>Parenting behavior was assessed using subscales from the Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment (HOME) <xref rid="pone.0058250-Caldwell1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, administered at age 4 (<italic>M</italic> = 4.1, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.1). The HOME is a 1-hour semi-structured interview and observation that generates eight subscales. The current analysis focused on two subscales from the HOME that best measure the affective and control aspects of parenting in contrast to the type of environmental enrichment offered in the household: the Parental Responsivity subscale (e.g. ‘parent holds child close 10–15 minutes per day,’ ‘parent converses with child at least twice during visit’, ‘parent caresses, kisses, or cuddles child during visit’, ‘parent answers child’s questions or requests verbally’) as well as the Acceptance of Child subscale, which primarily measures the use of physical discipline (e.g. ‘parent does not scold or derogate child more than once,’ ‘parent neither slaps nor spanks child during visit’, ‘no more than one instance of physical punishment during past week’). <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0058250-t001">Table 1</xref> reports the total and subscale scores for the HOME. Parental Responsivity and Acceptance at age 4 were not correlated (<italic>r</italic> = .22, <italic>p</italic> = .13), indicating that these subscales measure distinct aspects of early experience. At the time of assessment most participants (91.8%) were in the care of their mother (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0058250-t001">Table 1</xref>). To examine differential attrition, HOME subscale scores for those in the stress protocol were compared with the 18 control participants who completed the HOME scale but were lost to follow-up by the time of the stress protocol. There were no differences in the Parental Responsivity subscale, <italic>t</italic>(67) =  −1.33, <italic>p</italic> = .19; however, there was a differences in scores on the Acceptance subscale, <italic>t</italic>(65.8) = 2.49, <italic>p</italic> = .02. Notably, Acceptance subscale scores had greater variability and were lower overall in those who participated in the stress protocol. Consequently, there was greater use of physical discipline and variability in this behavior in those who remained in the study than in those who did not complete the protocol.</p>

                <p>Upon arrival, participants were greeted by the experimenter and directed to sit in a semi-private room where they were able to interact with an experimenter but not with other participants. After completion of the consent process, experimenters conducted a short interview to assess participant compliance with pre-appointment instructions and to survey use of prescribed and non prescribed medications. To establish a baseline prior to stress induction and prior to the first collection of a saliva sample, participants watched a video with minimally arousing content for 25 minutes. Participants then performed stressor tasks in a testing room with other group members and an unfamiliar experimenter dressed in a lab coat acting as a judge and directing the testing room activities. To further enhance the social evaluative component of the stressor <xref rid="pone.0058250-Dickerson1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0058250-Gunnar3" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref> participants were told their performance was being videotaped and scored. They were all simultaneously given 6 minutes to prepare a 3-minute speech promoting their candidacy for a summer job, and they each gave their speech facing the video camera, the other participants, and the judge. After all participants completed their speech, they were subsequently instructed to perform serial subtraction by eights, aloud, for 3 minutes, in front of the same audience. Individuals were given unique four-digit numbers as starting points. If subtraction mistakes were made they were told to re-start from the beginning. Order of participation for each task, relative to the other participants in the group, was determined randomly. The duration of the stressor was thus 6 minutes shorter for those in groups of 2 as opposed to 3. After all participants completed the stressor task they returned to the semi-private room for a 75 minute recovery period where they watched the remainder of the videotape started during baseline. After the recovery period, questionnaires were completed via audio computer assisted self-interview (ACASI) using MediaLab 2004.3.24 (Empirisoft Software, New York, NY).</p>

The test uses 25 µl of saliva per determination, has a lower limit of sensitivity of 0.003 µg/dl and standard curve range from 0.012 to 3.0 µg/dl. Intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation were 3.5% and 5.1% respectively. Assays were conducted in duplicate and average cortisol concentrations were used. To correct for skewed distributions the natural log of the average cortisol concentration was our outcome measure.</p>
                <p>Subjective responses during the stressor as well as retrospective appraisals were also assessed. Participants rated their anxiety level using a seven-point Likert-type scale (1 =  very calm and relaxed; 3 = feeling pretty calm and relaxed; 5 = a little bit nervous, but not too bad; 7 = very nervous or stressed) concurrent with the collection of saliva samples. After completion of the stressor, participants were asked how stressful and challenging they found the speech and math tasks, with response choices structured along a seven-point Likert type scale (1 = Not at all challenging or stressful, 7 = Extremely challenging or stressful).</p>

                <title>Data Analysis</title>
                <p>Our primary analytic strategy was piecewise hierarchical linear modeling, a strategy that allows distinct modeling of different phases of change over time, thus permitting the separate modeling of reactivity and recovery phases following administration of a stressor <xref rid="pone.0058250-Bernard1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0058250-Llabre1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. With a piecewise approach, a Level-1 model is estimated that represents the individual change in salivary cortisol across the protocol and includes both fixed components and random components (intercept and slopes) that are permitted to vary across individuals. Time was recoded into two separate Level-1 components to create a two-piece linear model. The first component represents time linearly from baseline through the measures of cortisol taken ten minutes after the completion of the stressor (minute 45), capturing the episode of reactivity to the stressor given both the duration of the stressor and the delay between stress response and the secretion of cortisol into saliva. Saliva collection times outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0058250-g001">Figure 1</xref> for the reactivity episode were thus coded, in minutes, as 0, 10, 35, 45, 45, 45, 45, 45, and 45. The second linear component represents the episode of recovery from the stressor, the time from 10 minutes after the completion of the stressor through the end of the protocol. Saliva collection times for the recovery episode were thus coded as 0, 0, 0, 0, 10, 20, 35, 50, and 65. This results in the following Level-1 model: <disp-formula id="pone.0058250.e001"><graphic xlink:href="pone.0058250.e001.jpg" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></disp-formula>
</p>
                <p>In this model, the outcome is the natural log of salivary cortisol, and π<sub>0i</sub> represents the intercept, π<sub>1i</sub> represents the slope during the reactivity episode and π<sub>2i</sub> represents the slope during the recovery episode. Due to the coding scheme employed the intercept, π<sub>0i</sub> is an estimate of baseline salivary cortisol before administration of the stressor.</p>
                <p>Several steps were taken to ensure that the piecewise modeling approach fit the data well and was not biased. Different group sizes and differences in task participation order, influencing both stressor duration and onset/offset, might result in systematic differences in the timing of peak cortisol levels. However, employing Fisher's Exact Test (due to small cell sizes), there was no relationship between the time of peak cortisol and either group size (<italic>p</italic> = .68) or order of participation in tasks (<italic>p</italic> = .85). Second, the linear piecewise model was compared to a quadratic model of change, using both the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). In the quadratic model participant-specific collection times were used, such that each individual's unique collection profile and stressor duration was accounted for, without assumptions about the timing of reactivity and recovery. Should a piecewise model be mis-specified due to systematic differences in collection times and timing for reactivity and recovery, this alternative quadratic model should be a better fit for the data. However, this was not the case – the piecewise model was superior to the quadratic model. First, a quadratic model was only able to converge with a random intercept, linear component and fixed quadratic effect, while a piecewise model included a random component for recovery. Consequently, only the piecewise model allowed prediction of individual differences in recovery in addition to reactivity and baseline. Second, the piecewise model was a better fit to the data as measured by both AIC (piecewise = 229.1, quadratic = 351.1) and BIC (piecewise = 242.4, quadratic = 358.6). In summary, the piecewise model fits the data well and does not appear to suffer from any systematic mis-specification.</p>
                <p>Employing the piecewise model, Level-2 models were also estimated in which the variance in the intercept and slope parameters at Level-1 are predicted by person-level predictors that do not vary across the time of the stressor protocol. The Parental Responsivity and Acceptance subscales were the primary independent variables examined for all Level-2 equations:<disp-formula id="pone.0058250.e002"><graphic xlink:href="pone.0058250.e002.jpg" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></disp-formula>

                <p>Analyses were conducted in HLM6 <xref rid="pone.0058250-Raudenbush1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref> using full maximum likelihood estimation. All Level-2 variables included in analyses were grand-mean centered. Forty-six participants (93.9%) had complete data for salivary cortisol at Level 1, as 3 participants each were missing one data point, for a total of 438 observations at Level 1.</p>
                <p>The first step in analyses was to establish if there was significant variability across individuals in the random effects for the intercept, slope during reactivity, and slope during recovery that warranted prediction by person-level predictors, such as the Parental Responsivity and Acceptance subscales. To do so an unconditional linear piecewise growth model was created, that accounts for within-individual clustering of cortisol across time without additional second-level predictors, to determine if there is variability across individuals in the parameter estimates for the intercept and slopes during reactivity and recovery. Subsequently, the independent variables, the Parental Responsivity and Acceptance subscales, were added to the model. To identify potential control variables we employed a step-wise procedure, adding variables individually to this model and noting each variable which was significant at a trend level of p&lt;.10 and for which the fit of the prediction model was improved <xref rid="pone.0058250-Singer1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>. These variables were sex, age, group size, task performance order, current cigarette smoking, hours of sleep the night before, hours since awakening, prenatal substance exposure, birth weight, gestational age, and use of oral contraceptives. Next, we created a prediction model including all variables identified in the previous step and then removed non-significant (p&gt;.05) control variables sequentially starting with the highest p-value, until only significant control variables remained. Subsequent analyses utilized the resulting model to determine if findings were independent of the environmental risk factors and aspects of psychosocial functioning noted above and in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0058250-t002">Table 2</xref>.

These effects are also independent of the hours since awakening when the first sample was taken, which was a significant predictor of the intercept when included alone (<italic>B</italic> = −0.08, <italic>p</italic> = .02, <italic>r<sub>effect</sub></italic> = .36) but was not significant (<italic>B</italic> = −0.05, <italic>p</italic> = .09, <italic>r<sub>effect</sub></italic> = .26) when age and sex were included in the model. Neither the Parental Responsivity nor Acceptance subscales were predictors of the intercept (all <italic>p</italic>&gt;.32) or slope during recovery (all <italic>p</italic>&gt;.11). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0058250-g002">Figure 2</xref> is based on Model A and depicts the relationship between the Parental Responsivity subscale and cortisol reactivity and recovery. Following Aiken and West <xref rid="pone.0058250-Aiken1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>, we selected values of Parental Responsivity that are 1.5 <italic>SD</italic>'s above and below the grand mean to illustrate this effect in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0058250-g002">Figure 2:</xref> Lower scores on the Parental Responsivity subscale, in contrast with higher scores, predict little or no cortisol response across the protocol.</p>

                <p>In all such models the Parental Responsivity subscale remained a significant predictor of slope during the reactivity period (all <italic>p</italic>≤.04), indicating that the effects were specific.

              <p>This prospective study demonstrates that parental responsivity in early childhood has an enduring association with reactivity to stress. Lower levels of parental responsivity during early childhood were associated with blunted cortisol reactivity to a laboratory stressor in adolescence. To our knowledge this is the first longitudinal study to test the specific association between typical early caregiving experiences, and parental responsivity in particular, and later-life stress reactivity in adolescence or beyond.</p>
              <p>The association between parental responsivity and cortisol reactivity is highly specific, as indicated by five aspects of the results. First, behaviors that communicate responsivity and warmth, such as responding verbally to a child's speech and holding the child close 10–15 minutes per day, predict cortisol reactivity while aspects of parental control and a physical approach to discipline, as indicated by items such as scolding, slapping or spanking the child during the visit, do not. Second, the effect of parental responsivity is independent of other significant predictors of the stress response or HPA function in general, such as sex <xref rid="pone.0058250-Kirschbaum2" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, age, cigarette smoking <xref rid="pone.0058250-Rohleder1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>, sleep <xref rid="pone.0058250-VanCauter1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>, group size and order of task performance during the stressor protocol. Third, the effect of parental responsivity is not explained by differences in the subjective appraisal of the stressor. Fourth, the effect is independent of other markers for early adverse experience, such as birth weight and gestational age <xref rid="pone.0058250-Wust1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>, prenatal substance exposure <xref rid="pone.0058250-Fisher1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, childhood abuse or neglect as reported by the child or primary caregiver <xref rid="pone.0058250-Fisher1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0058250-Carpenter1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0058250-Heim2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, as well as other possible environmental risks, including violence exposure and current life stress. Fifth, the effect of parental responsivity on cortisol reactivity is not a function of current psychosocial functioning, including depressive symptoms <xref rid="pone.0058250-Burke1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>, internalizing or externalizing behavior <xref rid="pone.0058250-Alink1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>, mastery, or coping style <xref rid="pone.0058250-Bento1" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>. Parental responsivity in early childhood, over and above these potential alternative pathways, is thus a specific predictor of the cortisol response to stress.</p>
              <p>Blunted cortisol reactivity likely increases risk for poor psychosocial outcomes in the future. Blunted or reduced reactivity is a predictor of externalizing behavior and poorer executive function <xref rid="pone.0058250-Alink1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0058250-Blair2" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>. Parenting interventions that reduce aggressive behavior are mediated, at least in part, via increases in cortisol reactivity to stress <xref rid="pone.0058250-ONeal1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. In addition, acutely elevated cortisol is important for mobilizing resources to effectively cope with stress <xref rid="pone.0058250-Gunnar1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, and thus a blunted response suggests such resources are not being mobilized.</p>
              <p>The finding that low levels of parental responsivity predict a blunted cortisol response is consistent with the attenuation hypothesis, which posits that chronic stress results in the eventual down-regulation of stress response systems, placing individuals at risk for socioemotional difficulties <xref rid="pone.0058250-Repetti1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. However, in the absence of repeated measures over time in the current study we cannot know whether down-regulation has taken place. The direction of the association between parental responsivity and cortisol reactivity is also consistent with the theory of Biological Sensitivity to Context and the Adapative Calibration Model of stress responsivity <xref rid="pone.0058250-Ellis1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0058250-DelGiudice1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. According to these accounts, very high levels of support and enrichment as well as very high levels of conflict and adversity promote biological reactivity to context, while moderate support and stress promote lower levels of reactivity. In this study high levels of parental responsivity may be interpreted as buffering the effect of a moderately stressful, low-SES environment. High support in the context of a moderately stressful environment promotes reactivity to the environment as compared with moderate support in the context of moderate stress. It is this difference in severity of risk and support that may explain the discrepancy between the direction of the effects found in this study, which are consistent with those found in some observational and intervention studies <xref rid="pone.0058250-SturgeApple1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0058250-Blair1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0058250-ONeal1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0058250-Taylor1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> but not others <xref rid="pone.0058250-Bernard1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0058250-Gunnar2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Nevertheless, interpretations in the context of such non-linear models require considerable caution, as there is no consensus on what types of support or adversity should be considered as “exposures”, if these exposures should be combined additively or interactively, or what constitutes high, moderate, or low levels of exposure.</p>
              <p>Consistent with the animal literature, we found an association between early life parental responsivity and later stress reactivity. However, the direction of this relationship is opposite to that typically reported in the animal literature. In rodent models longer separations and decreased maternal nurturing behaviors typically predict increased reactivity, while brief separations and manipulations that increase sensitive, nurturing caregiving promote decreased, but not blunted reactivity <xref rid="pone.0058250-Hackman1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0058250-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0058250-Levine1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, though this is not always the case <xref rid="pone.0058250-Roman1" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref>. There are a number of reasons for such inconsistency.</p>
              <p>First, equating parental behaviors across species is challenging, not only because of differences in the behaviors themselves, but also because of differences the timing, length, and severity of exposure possible with experimental animal studies and longitudinal observational human studies <xref rid="pone.0058250-Levine1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Differences between dimensions of human parenting <xref rid="pone.0058250-Cummings1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> such as sensitivity and responsivity as compared to control and discipline are difficult to translate into animal behavior. Second, human studies have the limitation that important characteristics of the environment and social context are correlated with parental behavior. Some of these characteristics, such as enrichment and unpredictability, are known to influence stress reactivity in animals <xref rid="pone.0058250-Welberg1" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>. Third, gene-environment interactions <xref rid="pone.0058250-Mueller1" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref> may render comparisons across genetically controlled animal models and typical human samples difficult. Fourth, differences may also arise due to the differences in stressor paradigms used, and the degree to which they evoke stress responses. In humans, the most effective stressor paradigms incorporate an aspect of social evaluation in addition to uncontrollability <xref rid="pone.0058250-Dickerson1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref> that does not have a ready analogue in animal stressor paradigms. Fifth, it may be that the nature of such effects genuinely differ across species, as effects are not all consistent across different animal models <xref rid="pone.0058250-Levine1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Consequently, extrapolation of inferences from animal models to humans must be done very cautiously and with an awareness of both the methodological and intrinsic differences between the study of animal and human parenting.</p>
              <p>A limitation of the present study is that all the adolescents were from low-SES African-American families, raising questions concerning generalizability. African-Americans often demonstrate less robust responses to laboratory-based stressors <xref rid="pone.0058250-Chong1" ref-type="bibr">[70]</xref>, suggesting that studies in other racial and ethnic groups may have even greater power to detect variance in reactivity. SES correlates with many childhood experiences that may influence HPA axis function, such as cumulative stress <xref rid="pone.0058250-Evans1" ref-type="bibr">[71]</xref>. However, the effect of parental responsivity on stress reactivity in this study was independent of indices of early health and development, such as birth weight, as well as self-reported life stress and violence exposure. Consequently, it is unlikely that the effect of parental responsivity on cortisol reactivity is limited only to this population. Nevertheless, future studies are needed to determine if this effect remains in middle- or high-SES families, as both aspects of social support and environmental adversity are likely to influence reactivity <xref rid="pone.0058250-Ellis1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p>
              <p>As with all observational studies, it is impossible to firmly establish the direction of causality. It remains possible that genetic differences in stress reactivity influence parenting behaviors, with more reactive individuals also being more responsive parents and transmitting higher cortisol reactivity to their children genetically. However, multiple lines of evidence suggest that parental responsivity is a causal factor. First, although elevated reactivity in children predicts aspects of maternal control and discipline prospectively, it does not predict warmth <xref rid="pone.0058250-SturgeApple2" ref-type="bibr">[72]</xref>, and the present study found that aspects of parenting related to responsivity and warmth but not control and discipline predicted cortisol reactivity. Moreover, early reactivity in childhood does not predict later attachment <xref rid="pone.0058250-Gunnar2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Second, animal literature experimentally demonstrates the effect of environment on stress reactivity <xref rid="pone.0058250-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, though as noted above, extrapolations across species must be undertaken with caution. Third, a parenting intervention has, in randomized controlled trial, demonstrated that change in parenting can impact cortisol reactivity in offspring in the short-term <xref rid="pone.0058250-ONeal1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Lastly, twin studies suggest that environmental factors are the significant primary determinants of the stress response to the first exposure to a stressor <xref rid="pone.0058250-Steptoe1" ref-type="bibr">[73]</xref>. Consequently, it is likely that parental responsivity is influencing offspring stress reactivity.</p>
              <p>In summary, early childhood parental responsivity selectively predicts cortisol reactivity to a social stressor in adolescence, over and above the effects of discipline, early developmental markers, life stress, violence exposure, and current psychosocial functioning. To our knowledge, this study provides the first prospective evidence in humans that early parental responsivity can predict stress reactivity more than a decade later. The present findings converge with experimental evidence from animal models and suggest that parental responsivity has enduring effects on neurobiological development that may have lasting consequences for cognitive and socioemotional development.</p>
