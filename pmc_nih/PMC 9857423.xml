              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Since retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) was first described by Terry<sup><xref rid="zoi221468r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> in 1942, both understanding of the disease and treatment options have continuously developed. With laser coagulation and anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) drugs, 2 treatment approaches have evolved as the current standard of care for ROP.<sup><xref rid="zoi221468r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="zoi221468r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="zoi221468r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="zoi221468r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Advantages of anti-VEGF drugs over laser coagulation include the potential for complete vascularization of the peripheral retina and a lower risk of myopia.<sup><xref rid="zoi221468r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="zoi221468r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="zoi221468r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="zoi221468r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="zoi221468r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> On the other hand, late recurrences can occur after anti-VEGF treatment that need to be detected using a close and long-term follow-up regimen.<sup><xref rid="zoi221468r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="zoi221468r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="zoi221468r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Thus, with the advent of anti-VEGF drugs for ROP care, a second screening phase begins after treatment: screening for ROP reactivation requiring retreatment.<sup><xref rid="zoi221468r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup></p>
              <p>To improve the quality and accessibility of primary ROP screening (ie, before treatment is given), several tools using artificial intelligence (AI) have been developed. Most of these tools focus on posterior pole vascular changes that are associated with ROP reactivation requiring retreatment. The International Classification of Retinopathy of Prematurity refers to such posterior pole vascular changes as the spectrum of plus disease (with plus disease defined as abnormal tortuosity and dilation of the posterior retinal blood vessels).<sup><xref rid="zoi221468r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> One of the established AI tools to quantify posterior pole vascular changes in ROP is the Images and Informatics in Retinopathy of Prematurity (i-ROP) deep learning (DL) algorithm.<sup><xref rid="zoi221468r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Several ROP screening studies have found that the i-ROP algorithm has the ability to detect plus disease with a reliability that is comparable with human ROP experts<sup><xref rid="zoi221468r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="zoi221468r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> and therefore has potential to detect ROP reactivation requiring retreatment.<sup><xref rid="zoi221468r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="zoi221468r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="zoi221468r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> The output of the i-ROP DL system can be converted to a vascular severity score (VSS) reflecting the spectrum of plus disease and has been found to be useful for primary ROP screening, monitoring of disease progression, and response to treatment.<sup><xref rid="zoi221468r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="zoi221468r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="zoi221468r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup></p>
              <p>In the current study, we examined the still-unanswered question regarding whether the VSS might be useful not only for primary ROP screening but for secondary ROP screening (ie, screening for ROP reactivation after anti-VEGF treatment). This analysis was conducted using the complete image set from the Comparing Alternative Ranibizumab Dosages for Safety and Efficacy in Retinopathy of Prematurity (CARE-ROP) study, a multicenter randomized clinical trial comparing 2 different doses of ranibizumab for the treatment of ROP.<sup><xref rid="zoi221468r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="zoi221468r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p>

              <title>Methods</title>
              <p>This prognostic study was a secondary analysis of posterior pole fundus images collected during the prospective multicenter double-blind phase 2 CARE-ROP randomized clinical trial, which screened and enrolled infants between September 5, 2014, and July 14, 2016. The current analyses of VSS were performed between January 20, 2021, and November 18, 2022. This study followed the Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/stard/" ext-link-type="uri">STARD</ext-link>) reporting guideline for prognostic studies.<sup><xref rid="zoi221468r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> The CARE-ROP study was approved by the institutional review boards at the coordinating center (University Medical Center Freiburg) and each of the 9 study centers and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.<sup><xref rid="zoi221468r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Written informed consent was obtained from parents of all enrolled infants.</p>

                <title>Data Set</title>
                <p>All retinal images and clinical information for the current study were extracted from the CARE-ROP trial. Between September 2014 and July 2016, 20 infants were screened according to current German guidelines: (1) gestational age (GA) of less than 32 weeks or birth weight of less than 1500 g or (2) GA of 32 weeks or greater but with more than 3 days of oxygen supplementation or relevant comorbidities. The first ROP screening was at 6 weeks’ postnatal age but not before 31 weeks’ 0 days’ GA. A total of 19 infants with bilateral ROP in zone 1 (stages 1 or 2 with plus disease, stage 3 with or without plus disease, or aggressive posterior ROP) or posterior zone 2 (stage 3 with plus disease or aggressive posterior ROP) were enrolled in the trial and received either 0.12 mg or 0.20 mg of ranibizumab.<sup><xref rid="zoi221468r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p>
                <p>The CARE-ROP was also the first trial that allowed reinjection of the same study dose; if ROP status initially improved but ROP reactivated after at least 28 days posttreatment to a stage requiring retreatment, a reinjection of the same ranibizumab dose was permitted without unblinding the physician. If the disease did not initially improve after treatment or reactivated within 28 days after treatment, the treating physician was unblinded and patients received rescue treatment. The primary end point of the CARE-ROP study was the number of infants who did not require rescue therapy until 24 weeks after baseline. In the CARE-ROP trial, 8 eyes (4 eyes in each treatment arm) received per protocol retreatment, and 2 infants (1 eye each) needed rescue treatment. Further information about study design, results of the core study, and 2-year follow-up have been published previously.<sup><xref rid="zoi221468r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="zoi221468r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p>
                <p>At predefined time points during the study (baseline [before injection] and 1 week, 4 weeks, and 24 weeks after treatment), ROP was digitally documented using an ophthalmic camera (RetCam; Natus Medical). Additional images were obtained from retreated infants at the time of retreatment as well as 1 week and 4 weeks after retreatment. Per protocol, centers were required to obtain 10 images per eye at each visit (details are provided in eFigure 1 in <xref rid="note-ZOI221468-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 1</xref>). A full image set was not always possible to obtain, but a total of 1413 images were acquired during the trial. After manual exclusion of 367 images due to poor quality or missing optic nerve head, the final data set for the current study contained 1046 images (details are provided in eFigure 2 in <xref rid="note-ZOI221468-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 1</xref>).</p>

                <title>Statistical Analysis</title>
                <p>All images were analyzed using the i-ROP DL algorithm, with the output of a VSS (range, 1-9) for each image. The median VSS (evaluated using methods previously published<sup><xref rid="zoi221468r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>) of all images available for an eye per examination was determined separately for the left and right eye. Two eyes of 2 patients who required rescue treatment were excluded from all analyses (eFigure 2 in <xref rid="note-ZOI221468-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 1</xref>).</p>
                <p>Using generalized estimating equations (GEEs) to account for intereye correlations and Bonferroni correction, we first evaluated whether there were significant differences between VSS in the 2 treatment groups (0.12 mg vs 0.20 mg of ranibizumab) at each time point. Subsequently, differences between the mean VSS of all eyes at different time points were compared using GEEs and multiple comparisons (Tukey contrasts) at baseline, week 1, week 4, week 24, and immediately before retreatment (if applicable). With Bonferroni correction, 2-sided <italic>t</italic> tests were used to compare VSS differences between ranibizumab dose groups and between infants who received retreatment vs those who did not at each time point. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to assess the correlations between VSS at baseline and (1) VSS at the time of retreatment and (2) time until retreatment. A GEE was also used to analyze the change in VSS from baseline to week 1 between infants who received retreatment and those who did not.</p>
                <p>Analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics software, version 28 (IBM Corporation), and graphic images were produced using Prism software, version 8.4.3 (GraphPad Software). The threshold for statistical significance was 2-sided <italic>P</italic> ≤ .05.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>This prognostic study was a post hoc analysis of the CARE-ROP randomized clinical trial. It was a pilot study to evaluate the potential role of an AI-derived screening method in identifying disease reactivation after anti-VEGF treatment for ROP. The key findings of this analysis were (1) VSS corresponded well with clinical disease evolution in response to treatment and the need for retreatment; (2) the magnitude of VSS change during the first week after anti-VEGF treatment was associated with a higher probability of later requiring retreatment; (3) in eyes requiring retreatment, high VSS at baseline was associated with earlier retreatment; and (4) the 2 ranibizumab doses did not differ regarding VSS change after treatment.</p>
              <p>Previous work has described the use of i-ROP VSS for the assessment of overall ROP severity,<sup><xref rid="zoi221468r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="zoi221468r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> screening for type 1 ROP,<sup><xref rid="zoi221468r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="zoi221468r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="zoi221468r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> monitoring of disease progression,<sup><xref rid="zoi221468r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="zoi221468r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> and monitoring of initial response to treatment after laser or anti-VEGF therapy.<sup><xref rid="zoi221468r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> The results of our current analysis suggest that VSS may be useful for screening of ROP reactivation requiring retreatment after anti-VEGF therapy. Our results revealed that baseline VSS values (before anti-VEGF treatment) were significantly higher compared with VSS values at 1 week after treatment and that, in each case of ROP reactivation requiring retreatment, VSS increased around the time when the CARE-ROP investigators clinically noted ROP reactivation requiring retreatment (<xref rid="zoi221468f3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). In the 1 participant who required 2 reinjections of ranibizumab (dark blue lines in <xref rid="zoi221468f3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A), VSS peaked at both reinjection time points.</p>
              <p>When using anti-VEGF treatment for ROP, close posttreatment monitoring is necessary to detect reactivation of the disease that requires retreatment.<sup><xref rid="zoi221468r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="zoi221468r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> It would be helpful to develop strategies for early identification of infants who have a high risk of ROP reactivation, particularly because late reactivations can occur months after treatment, and strict adherence to follow-up regimens can be difficult.<sup><xref rid="zoi221468r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="zoi221468r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="zoi221468r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="zoi221468r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="zoi221468r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> In this study, eyes with reactivated ROP had a larger change in VSS between baseline and 1 week after injection compared with eyes that did not have reactivated ROP in the subsequent study period (<xref rid="zoi221468f5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). There are several potential explanations for this finding. One explanation is that there was a ceiling or floor effect, and eyes with higher VSS at baseline had more capacity to change after treatment. Previous work<sup><xref rid="zoi221468r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> found that higher VSS was associated with more posterior zone and higher stage and extent of stage 3 disease. We did not observe a statistically significant difference in VSS at baseline, but higher mean VSS was observed in eyes that later required retreatment, and the time of retreatment was earlier for eyes with higher VSS at baseline (<xref rid="zoi221468f3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B). This finding is consistent with previous work<sup><xref rid="zoi221468r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> suggesting more posterior disease is more likely to reactivate. It is conceivable that this greater likelihood of reactivation may be explained by characteristics found in eyes that can change quickly; for instance, eyes with more extensive or flat neovascularization that is faster to respond to anti-VEGF treatment compared with eyes with more classic stage 3 disease may be more likely to reactivate. Our findings suggested that eyes that later reactivated were more likely to have higher VSS at baseline and lower VSS at week 1 than eyes that did not reactivate later (<xref rid="zoi221468f4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>); these results could support this hypothesis (ie, eyes that change quickly have characteristics that make them more likely to reactivate) but need to be further evaluated in future studies. In addition, the significant correlation between time of reactivation and baseline VSS observed in this study will have to be validated in a larger sample. If confirmed, such a potential estimate of when to expect a reactivation would have important implications in clinical practice and may help improve scheduling of follow-up visits after anti-VEGF treatment.</p>

                <title>Strengths and Limitations</title>
                <p>This study has strengths. All data were obtained from the CARE-ROP study, a well-documented prospective randomized clinical trial. In addition, more than 1000 images were available for analysis.</p>
                <p>This study also has limitations. The main limitation is the small number of eyes available for analysis, and the results from this pilot study need to be further investigated in larger studies. In a larger study population, alternative analytic strategies, such as time to retreatment with VSS as a time-varying covariate or logistic modeling including treatment group as a covariate, could be performed. When interpreting VSS at the time of retreatment, it must be considered that the decision to provide retreatment during the study was not based on a VSS threshold but was determined clinically; thus, the VSS contains a subjective component from the treating physicians. Another limitation is that images were obtained only at prespecified intervals. Therefore, no images were available from time points before baseline injection (ie, the primary ROP screening phase), between week 4 and week 24 (except for participants requiring retreatment), or beyond week 24. The lack of photographic documentation during these periods limits assessment of disease trajectories but suggests that consistent photographic documentation and assessment of vascular severity might help with monitoring of disease reactivation. This documentation and assessment is important because ophthalmoscopy with scleral depression to visualize peripheral disease becomes increasingly challenging as children grow older. If future work confirms that monitoring for vascular severity near the posterior pole is highly sensitive to the presence of peripheral reactivation, then monitoring for reactivation using photography may supplement the challenging ophthalmoscopic examination. It has to be considered that the i-ROP algorithm was trained on images captured by a specific type of ophthalmic camera (RetCam), and the same type of camera was also used during the CARE-ROP trial. Generalizability to other fundus cameras will need to be evaluated.<sup><xref rid="zoi221468r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup></p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>The results of this prognostic study suggested that the use of an AI-derived VSS may have utility in the detection of disease reactivation after anti-VEGF treatment for ROP. The data further suggested that the magnitude of early response to treatment (between baseline and week 1) may be associated with the risk of later ROP reactivation and, in eyes requiring retreatment, VSS at baseline might be used to estimate the time of retreatment. The explanation for these findings as well as their validation will be the target of future studies. If confirmed, an improved ability to identify infants at high risk of ROP reactivation and the ability to individually estimate the most likely time window for such a reactivation may improve the safety profile of ROP treatment.</p>
