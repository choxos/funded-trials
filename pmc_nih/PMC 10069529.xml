                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Early phase dose-finding (EPDF) studies are critical for the development of new treatments, directly influencing whether compounds or interventions can be investigated in further trials to confirm their safety and efficacy. There exists guidance for clinical trial protocols and reporting of completed trials in the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) 2013 and CONsolidated Standards Of Reporting Randomised Trials (CONSORT) 2010 statements. However, neither the original statements nor their extensions adequately cover the specific features of EPDF trials. The DEFINE (DosE-FIndiNg Extensions) study aims to enhance transparency, completeness, reproducibility and interpretation of EPDF trial protocols (SPIRIT-DEFINE) and their reports once completed (CONSORT-DEFINE), across all disease areas, building on the original SPIRIT 2013 and CONSORT 2010 statements.</p>

                  <p>A methodological review of published EPDF trials will be conducted to identify features and deficiencies in reporting and inform the initial generation of the candidate items. The early draft checklists will be enriched through a review of published and grey literature, real-world examples analysis, citation and reference searches and consultation with international experts, including regulators and journal editors. Development of CONSORT-DEFINE commenced in March 2021, followed by SPIRIT-DEFINE from January 2022. A modified Delphi process, involving worldwide, multidisciplinary and cross-sector key stakeholders, will be run to refine the checklists. An international consensus meeting in autumn 2022 will finalise the list of items to be included in both guidance extensions.</p>

              <sec id="s1-1">
                <title>Background</title>
                <p>Early phase dose-finding (EPDF) or dose-escalation trials, also referred to as phase I or phase I/II, are critical in clinical therapy development. Depending on the drug and endpoint of interest, the studies may be conducted in healthy volunteers or patients with the condition or disease. These studies involve interim dose decisions and may provide data on safety, adverse effects, pharmacokinetics (characterisation of a drug’s absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion), pharmacodynamics, biomarker activity, clinical activity and other information needed to choose a suitable dosage range and/or administration schedule to inform further studies. Results from these trials directly influence decisions on further development and whether the selected doses and schedules are sufficiently safe and have promising results on activity.</p>
                <p>A clinical trial protocol is a vital document that details the study rationale, methods, organisation and ethical considerations.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> By providing the details to guide the conduct of a high-quality study, a well-written protocol is a shared central reference for the study teams<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 3</xref> and facilitates appraisal of its scientific, methodological, safety and ethical rigour by external reviewers. However, protocols can vary greatly in content and quality despite their importance.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 3</xref> To address this, the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) 2013<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> statement was established to provide evidence-based guidance for the minimum essential content of clinical trial protocols and is widely endorsed as the international standard for trial protocols. Although the considerations of SPIRIT 2013 are largely applicable across many types of trials, some circumstances require additional items.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Guidance on content specific to EPDF trials, including dose and schedule determination based on safety/tolerability either alone or with one or more pharmacokinetic or activity markers, is lacking. Examples of features unique to such trials include:</p>

                  </list-item>
                </list>
                <p>Incomplete or unclear information on the design, conduct and analysis in EPDF trial protocols and reporting papers hinders the interpretability and reproducibility of the results from such studies, which may impact the overall clinical development timeline, lead to erroneous conclusions on safety and efficacy, and compromise the safety of trial participants.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p>
                <p>This is particularly relevant as a considerable number of early phase trials are sponsored and run by academic institutions or publicly funded organisations with funding from non-commercial sources, including Research Councils and medical charities (eg, Cancer Research UK, Wellcome Trust, US National Cancer Institute). In the UK, 159 out of 1157 (14%) phase I clinical trials, started in 2014–2018, had non-industry sponsors (data from ClinicalTrials.gov). This emphasises the importance of this research to public research institutions and industry alike. Based on results from ClinicalTrials.gov of trials in all countries, there are substantially more phase I trials than phase III trials (13 826 phase I vs 9501 phase III which started in 2014–2018). Data from pharmaceutical trials in the USA in 2004–2012 show that the estimated average cost of a phase I trial across all therapeutic areas ranged from US$1.4 to US$6.6 million<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>; such high costs reinforce the importance of managing resources efficiently. The attrition rate throughout the drug development process is high, and the success rate between phase I studies and marketing authorisation has been reported as between 9.8% and 13.8%,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 7</xref> with failure being primarily attributable to either poor tolerability or lack of biological activity (79% of failed studies over the period 2016–2018).<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> In this context, EPDF trial results must be assessed accurately to avoid poor dose selection, which will often lead to failed trials (phases II and phase III), delays in regulatory submissions, additional postmarketing commitments or dose changes postapproval due to excessive toxicities or lack of efficacy.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p>
                <p>The use of more complex dose-escalation designs such as model-assisted or model-based designs is rising: 1.6% (20/1235 phase I published cancer trials) in 1991–2006<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> to 6.4% (11/172) by 2012–2014.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Such designs are more complex to implement<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12–14</xref> and require the specification of more design features.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Further transparency and reporting demands are needed in such protocols and trial reports to facilitate understanding of the design, ensure the methods and results are reproducible, and explain how dose decisions will be and have been made.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16–18</xref></p>
                <p>More than 580 biomedical journals now require that trial reports conform to the CONsolidated Standards Of Reporting Randomised Trials (CONSORT) 2010 reporting guidelines for randomised parallel group clinical trials or an appropriate CONSORT extension to improve transparency, reproducibility, consistency and accuracy in reporting.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19–21</xref> A total of 153 journals, as well as a growing number of commercial and non-commercial funders, regulators, trial organisations and patient groups, have also endorsed SPIRIT.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> A systematic review based on more than 16 000 trials published in 2012 showed that journal endorsement of the CONSORT guidelines was associated with more completely reported randomised trials.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></p>
                <p>Neither the original guidance, SPIRIT 2013 and CONSORT 2010, nor their extensions adequately cover the features of EPDF trials. The DosE-FIndiNg Extensions (DEFINE) study aims to enhance transparency, completeness, reproducibility and interpretation of EPDF trial protocols and their reporting of results, across all disease areas, and to build on the checklists outlined in the SPIRIT 2013 and CONSORT 2010 statements.</p>

The review will also serve in providing a sampling frame for some of the stakeholder categories for the Delphi survey (see the ‘Stage 2: Delphi survey section’). A random sample of 476 papers in EPDF trials published between 2011 and 2020, stratified by setting (oncology/non-oncology), will be evaluated. This sample size will provide a two-sided 95% CI for the reporting frequency of an individual item with a width of at most 9% (±4.5%) based on a conservative sample proportion of 0.5 (which gives the largest variance). To standardise the process, a detailed data extraction form and comprehensive guidance will be generated, and agreement between reviewers assessed.</p>

                  <p>An initial draft of the SPIRIT-DEFINE candidate items will be prepared, building on the original SPIRIT 2013, and enriched by the candidate items identified as specific to EPDF trials from the CONSORT-DEFINE development work. The list will be refined through expert opinions from the Executive Committee, grey literature, including regulatory and industry guidance documents and protocol templates by professional groups. Key stakeholder groups identified in the CONSORT-DEFINE development protocol (clinical trials units, including Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency-accredited phase I units, funders and ethics committees) and experts from other protocol standard initiatives relevant to EPDF trials (eg, from trial registries) will be consulted and their templates included.</p>
                  <p>Building on the review conducted for CONSORT-DEFINE, the search strategy will be updated to identify protocol recommendations in peer-reviewed literature. Relevant literature not picked up by the search strategy but recommended by experts will be included. Citation and reference searches of key articles will also be conducted.

                <p>The draft candidate items for the SPIRIT-DEFINE and CONSORT-DEFINE checklists will be submitted for feedback to a wider stakeholder group through a Delphi survey. The Delphi process will be conducted according to existing methodological guidance<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29–31</xref> and involves inviting participants to complete iterative rounds of a web-based survey, where results from earlier rounds will inform the design of subsequent rounds. Each candidate item will be scored on a 9-point Likert scale relating to the participant’s opinion of its importance, grouped into three categories: (1–3) ‘not important’, (4–6) ‘important but not critical’ and (7–9) ‘important and critical’. An option ‘unable to rate’ will be provided for participants who are unable to give their rating opinions for any reason. Free text fields will also be used to elicit comments on the candidate items, and in round 1, participants will also have the opportunity to suggest additional items.</p>
                <p>The Executive Committee will discuss the results between each round and agree on any required changes (see the ‘Analysis’ section).

                  <p>As this is a prospective exercise and a multi-faceted survey, the sample size was decided on pragmatically, to be both achievable and ensure a meaningful representation of all the stakeholder categories. The survey will seek to obtain responses from at least 15 participants in each of the identified stakeholder categories, giving an overall target of at least 90 participants. To achieve this, as many potential participants as possible will be approached, identified through the authors list from the methodological review, approaches from professionals following professional meetings and presentations, as well as recommendations from the Executive Committee and independent expert panel. The registration and survey response rates, overall and by stakeholder category and country, will be monitored by the Executive Committee. If a low rate of intake or response is observed, targeted further approaches will be made as appropriate.</p>

Selected consumer representatives with substantial experience will be approached to take part in the pilot, and their feedback will be sought to ensure the survey is accessible.

                  <p>The response observed to the initial approaches will be explored in a narrative summary. Following each round, the response rate will be calculated based on the number of participants who registered and completed the survey. A descriptive summary analysis of the responding population will be presented based on the background characteristics data collected. For each item, the distribution of scores as well as summary statistics (median, IQR, minimum and maximum) will be computed and presented. Summary statistics will be presented by the key stakeholder categories defined in the ‘Identification of participants’ section and overall. Geographical and professional background characteristics data may be used to explore the data further.</p>
                  <p>Qualitative data from the free text section of the survey will be thematically analysed to identify potential new items for inclusion.</p>
                  <p>After each round, members of the Executive Committee will discuss the output and any changes required. Items scored 1–3 ‘not important’ by at least 80% of the participants may be dropped between rounds, subject to confirmation by the Executive Committee. Notes will also be made on any feedback relevant to the development of the explanation and elaboration (E&amp;E) documents.</p>
                  <p>Participants will also be presented with the distribution of ratings, their ratings from the previous round, as well as feedback on how suggestions and comments from the free text fields were dealt with.</p>
                  <p>At further rounds, participants will be given the opportunity to change their ratings, and such changes will be monitored. The change in participants’ ratings between subsequent rounds will be analysed at item level and interest will be on participants who moved from one category to another (eg, from not ‘important’ to ‘important but not critical’).</p>
                  <p>For each reporting item, the distribution of the changes in rating scores and proportion below 15% change will be reported.</p>

Following the discussion, consensus group members will anonymously be given an opportunity to make individual decisions about the inclusion of a specific item; ‘keep’, ‘discard’, and ‘unsure or no opinion’. A decision to retain a reporting item will be based on achieving at least 50% support from group members deciding/wishing to keep the item; however, the Executive Committee will retain the prerogative to discuss and make final decisions for low-scoring items or items where a consensus is difficult to achieve. The rationale to guide decisions will be whether the item addresses elements unique to EPDF trials and whether they belong in a minimum reporting set of items. Notes will be taken, and the discussions audiorecorded, with the participants’ consent. Particular attention will be paid to any feedback or discussion requiring inclusion in the E&amp;E document.</p>
                  <p>Following the meeting, a summary report will be produced and shared with the meeting attendees as well as the Delphi survey participants.</p>

                <title>Stage 4: development of a reporting guidance and explanatory support document</title>
                <p>The objectives of this stage are to finalise the SPIRIT-DEFINE and CONSORT-DEFINE guidance and supporting documentation, including the corresponding E&amp;E documents.</p>
                <p>After the consensus meeting, the Executive Committee will continue refining the content and wording of both guidelines, and the E&amp;E documents, intended to provide explanations on the rationale and elaboration of the items, as well as evidence and examples applied in the literature. Feedback from the Delphi survey and the consensus meeting will be checked for any information relevant for inclusion in the E&amp;E document.</p>
                <p>Both guidelines will be piloted with real-world examples by a selection of key stakeholders with expertise in developing and reporting EPDF trials to test their usability and provide insight into issues that should be addressed in the E&amp;E documents. The committee will discuss feedback from the pilot and decide on further modifications, either to the checklist itself or the E&amp;E document.</p>
