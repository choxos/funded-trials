                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Integrating palliative care (PC) early in the illness course for patients with serious cancers improves their outcomes and is recommended by national organisations such as the American Society of Clinical Oncology. However, monthly visits with PC clinicians from the time of diagnosis can be challenging to implement due to the lack of specialty-trained PC clinicians and resources. Therefore, we developed a stepped care model to triage PC service based on patients’ needs.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>We are conducting a non-blinded, randomised trial to evaluate the non-inferiority of a stepped PC model compared with an early integrated PC model for improving patients’ quality of life (QOL) at 24 weeks (primary outcome). Patients assigned to early integrated PC meet with PC every 4 weeks throughout their illness. Patients assigned to stepped PC have PC visits only at clinically significant points in their illness (eg, cancer progression) unless their QOL decreases, at which time they are ‘stepped up’ and meet with PC every 4 weeks throughout the remainder of their illness. Secondary aims include assessing whether stepped PC is non-inferior to early integrated PC regarding patient-clinician communication about end of life care and length of stay on hospice as well as comparing resource utilisation. Patients are recruited from the Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, Boston, Massachusetts; Duke Cancer Center, Durham, North Carolina and University of Pennsylvania Abramson Cancer Center, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The target sample size is 510 patients.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Integrating palliative care (PC) and oncology care early in the course of disease for patients with advanced cancer improves their quality of life (QOL), depression symptoms, prognostic understanding and quality of care at the end of life (EOL) as demonstrated by numerous trials over the past decade.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1–8</xref> These findings were the basis for the 2017 American Society of Clinical Oncology Practice Guidelines, which recommended that patients with advanced cancer in both the inpatient and outpatient settings are offered PC early in the disease trajectory and in conjunction with cancer therapy.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> The National Comprehensive Cancer Network also endorses screening all oncology patients for their PC needs at their initial oncology consultation as well as at critical time points along their cancer care continuum.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p>
              <p>Despite the benefits of integrating palliative and oncology care, adequate numbers of specialty-trained PC clinicians as well as PC infrastructure and resources are lacking to care for all patients diagnosed with advanced cancer.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 12</xref> Thus, healthcare systems are generally unable to implement this evidence-based, early integrated palliative and oncology care model for their patients in a longitudinal fashion. Studies are needed to examine the potential benefits of alternative approaches to longitudinal PC delivery, such as a stepped PC model in which patients are ‘stepped up’ to more frequent PC contact based on their clinical needs. Specifically, in a stepped care model, all patients receive care for their condition with a minimum level of required contact with a clinician, and patients are periodically monitored and stepped up to more intensive treatment if the minimal level of engagement with clinicians does not achieve a sufficient health benefit. Stepped care models, which have been successfully used to manage depression,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> addiction,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> obesity,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> hypertension,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> chronic pain<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> and distress in patients with cancer,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18–20</xref> have the potential to achieve similar outcomes and be more cost-effective, feasible and generalisable than traditional models of care.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 21 22</xref> Additionally, a stepped PC model is aligned with the shift towards personalised cancer care in that the frequency of PC visits reflects the patients’ individual needs throughout their disease course.</p>
              <p>The current report outlines the details of an ongoing multisite, randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing a stepped PC model to an early integrated PC model (entailing monthly contact with a PC clinician) in patients with advanced lung cancer. We seek to demonstrate the non-inferiority of a stepped PC model to the more resource-intensive early integrated PC model, thus establishing a role for this more accessible, adaptable and patient-centred approach to PC.</p>
              <p>The primary objective of this study is to determine if stepped PC is non-inferior to early integrated PC in improving patients’ QOL at 24 weeks as measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Lung (FACT-L).<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> The secondary aims are to: (1) assess whether stepped PC is non-inferior to early integrated PC with respect to patient–clinician communication about EOL care preferences and length of stay (LOS) on hospice, (2) compare the superiority of stepped PC versus early integrated PC with respect to resource utilisation and (3) determine whether stepped PC is non-inferior to early integrated PC in improving patients’ QOL longitudinally up to 48 weeks.</p>

                  <title>Intervention delivery</title>
                  <p>Early integrated PC: patients randomised to early integrated PC are scheduled to meet with a PC clinician within 4 weeks of enrolment and at least every 4 weeks throughout their disease course. PC visits occur in person or via secure videoconference. If a patient misses a scheduled visit or is unable to be scheduled within 4 weeks of their last PC visit, a PC clinician attempts to call them by telephone to maintain contact at least every 4 weeks and reschedules the visit as soon as possible. The inpatient PC team follows patients who are admitted to a study site hospital.</p>
                  <p>Stepped PC: patients randomised to stepped PC are scheduled for an initial visit with a PC clinician within 4 weeks of enrolment. During step 1, further visits with a PC clinician are scheduled at clinically significant points in the patient’s illness, including within 4 weeks of (1) a change in cancer treatment (due to either progression or toxicity) or (2) hospital discharge. PC visits occur in person or via secure videoconference. After each visit, the PC clinician communicates with the oncology clinician(s) either by telephone, email or in person. If a patient misses a scheduled visit or is unable to be scheduled for a PC visit, the PC clinician attempts to contact them by telephone and reschedules the visit as soon as possible. Patients assigned to stepped PC complete the FACT-L every 6 weeks during the first 18 months of study participation (see <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>). Those whose scores decrease by ≥10 points from baseline are ‘stepped up’ to step 2 and follow the same protocol as those randomised to the early integrated PC arm. Specifically, they meet with a PC clinician at least every 4 weeks for the remainder of their illness and if they are hospitalised.</p>

                  <p>Training: we standardised the training procedures for site principal investigators (PI) and study staff including the development of a PC intervention guide and study standard operating procedures. The lead study site (MGH) completed a full day, in-person training with the site PIs prior to the study start. The site PIs then trained the participating PC clinicians at their respective institutions using the information they learnt during the in-person training. All participating PC clinicians also reviewed the PC intervention guide and watched training videos developed by the MGH investigative team regarding the intervention delivery and study procedures.</p>
                  <p>Intervention delivery: PC clinicians complete an electronic survey after each intervention visit to record the topics addressed during the encounter. Two study staff review these electronic surveys quarterly to ensure intervention fidelity and consistency between sites in addressing the domains and topics as specified by the intervention manual. Finally, trained study staff review PC notes in the EHR to ensure adherence to the intervention guide content and provide feedback to clinicians on a quarterly basis. All the site PIs and study staff meet monthly to review intervention delivery and fidelity data.</p>

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p>We will use intention-to-treat analyses for all randomised subjects. All non-inferiority comparisons will be based on 0.05-level one-sided tests and all superiority comparisons will be based on 0.05-level two-sided tests.</p>
                <p>The primary endpoint is to demonstrate the non-inferiority of stepped PC versus early integrated PC in improving patients’ QOL at 24 weeks, as measured by the FACT-L. The primary endpoint will be analysed between the study groups using a linear regression model controlling for baseline values and demographic and clinical factors and a non-inferiority margin of 4.5 points (SD=17.5). We will also evaluate the frequency of PC visits between study arms to determine if the stepped PC model leads to a reduction in PC visits. We will employ linear mixed models of longitudinal data to control for demographic and clinical factors and to account for dependency among means over time when evaluating change in QOL between groups across multiple time points.</p>
                <p>The secondary end points of this RCT are to assess whether stepped PC is non-inferior to early integrated PC with respect to communication about EOL care and LOS in hospice. Specifically, we will use the following item from the PTPQ to examine patient reports of discussing EOL care preferences with their clinicians: ‘Have you and your doctors discussed any particular wishes you have about the care you would want to receive if you were dying?’ We will use either the week 48 assessment or the final assessment before death for this analysis, whichever comes first. We will evaluate differences in patients reporting ‘yes’ to this item using a Fisher’s exact test, and a non-inferiority margin of 10%. If there are important imbalances between groups at baseline, we will use a logistic regression model controlling for any demographic and clinical factors that are imbalanced to assess differences between groups.</p>
                <p>We will assess the non-inferiority of hospice LOS between stepped PC and early integrated PC. We will use linear regression modelling controlling for selected clinical and demographic factors and a non-inferiority margin of 7 days.</p>
                <p>We will compare PC resource utilisation and cost-effectiveness between study groups. Costs considered in this analysis will include PC visits, other outpatient care, emergency department use, inpatient care and pharmaceuticals (chemotherapeutics and other pharmaceuticals evaluated separately).<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33 34</xref> To collect outpatient and inpatient hospital costs, we will query the hospital cost accounting system at study sites.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> To compare the superiority of stepped PC versus early integrated PC with respect to PC resource utilisation, we will collect the number and duration of outpatient PC visits from our REDCap database as well as data on the inpatient and telephone PC encounters from the EHR. Both total cost as well as category-specific costs (such as inpatient care, emergency department use and pharmaceuticals) will be evaluated to determine how resource utilisation differs between stepped PC and early integrated PC. Direct healthcare costs and indirect costs (such as time) incurred by patients throughout their life spans while enrolled in this study will be included in this analysis.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> We will compare the mean number of outpatient and inpatient PC visits between the two groups using a two-sample t test. We will assess the cost-effectiveness of early integrated PC as compared with stepped PC from a societal perspective using the average cost and quality-adjusted life years (QALY) accrued under each study arm. As such, a $50 000 US dollars QALY will be considered cost effective.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></p>
                <p>To examine prognostic understanding for non-inferiority between stepped PC and early integrated PC at week 24, we will analyse select items from the PTPQ using the appropriate test (eg, Fisher’s exact test). Additionally, we will examine coping strategies (Brief Cope) and depression symptoms (PHQ-9) at week 24 between groups using linear regression models controlling for baseline values and selected demographic and clinical factors. Linear mixed models will also be used as described above to examine changes in these outcomes between groups across multiple time points.</p>
                <p>We will explore potential moderators of the interventions to ensure generalisability and identify whether certain groups benefit more from one of the two PC models. We will create interaction terms for the regression and linear mixed models to examine whether differences in outcomes are moderated by patient factors (age, gender and race) or study site.</p>
                <p>Finally, we will employ multiple imputation methods when data can reasonably be assumed to be missing at random. In settings where data are likely missing <italic toggle="yes">not</italic> at random (eg, due to progressive illness), we will employ pattern mixture modelling or terminal decline joint modelling to address missing data.</p>

To account for potential missing data and ensure adequate power to assess for non-inferiority, we increased our sample size to 255 per group for a total sample size of 510 participants.</p>

                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p>The current trial has several potential limitations. First, we are only enrolling patients with advanced lung cancer receiving care at three large academic medical centres, limiting generalisation of the results to patients with different cancer types or stages of disease as well as those receiving treatment in other oncology care settings. However, existing data support early integrated PC in patients with advanced lung cancer,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 19 38</xref> making this an ideal population in which to compare different PC models. Second, we are only enrolling English and Spanish-speaking patients due to the availability of study questionnaires in these languages. In future studies, investigators could consider study procedures to enrol patients who speak languages other than English or Spanish. Third, both the participating study clinicians and patients are aware of the study group assignments, potentially introducing bias. However, the frequency and timing of intervention visits precluded blinding PC clinicians or patients to the study group assignments. Finally, we do not prevent patients in the stepped PC group from having additional appointments with their PC clinicians if requested by either the patient or the clinician, which could also influence study findings. However, denying PC services for patients with advanced cancer would neither be feasible nor acceptable.</p>
