                  <p>Approximately 70% of Black/African American family members report no contact with mental health providers prior to initial diagnosis and the receipt of services for early psychosis. Black families often encounter barriers and experience delays on the pathway to coordinated specialty care programmes for early psychosis.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>This mixed-methods study will (1) develop and refine a family peer navigator (FPN) for Black families designed to increase access and engagement in coordinated specialty care and (2) pilot-test FPN for Black families with 40 family members with loved ones at risk for psychosis in a randomised trial to assess the acceptability and feasibility. Families will be randomised to FPN (n=20) or a low-intensive care coordination (n=20). Other outcomes include proposed treatment targets (eg, knowledge, social connectedness), preliminary impact outcomes (time to coordinated specialty care programmes, initial family engagement), and implementation outcomes (acceptability, feasibility, appropriateness).</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p>The pathway to care for early psychosis is a critical time period that involves various contacts with organisations, experiences and events that can impact the timely access to much needed services (eg, coordinated specialty care; CSC) and has residual impacts on treatment outcomes once the appropriate mental health services have been initiated.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> Often times, family members/support persons have a key role in the help-seeking process, pathways to care and during the treatment process for their loved one.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3–5</xref> The duration of untreated psychosis, which has been defined as the onset of psychosis to the initation of CSC, is associated with pathways to care. Research has found that a longer duration of untreated psychosis is associated with poorer clinical and functional outcomes in CSC, the gold standard of treatment for first episode psychosis (FEP) in the USA.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> While, CSC has demonstrated positive impacts on treatment outcomes among youth in the early stages of psychosis,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> many families, especially Black families, are faced with inequities along the pathway to CSC that contributes to known racial disparities in service utilisation.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 9</xref>
</p>
              <p>Black families experience unique difficulties on the pathway to CSC or other mental health services for psychosis.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 10</xref> Perpetuated by or a response to inequitable practices,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> these experiences often includes involuntary hospitalisation, multiple contacts with medical providers, interactions with law enforcement, seeking support from informal resources (eg, friends, family, religious leaders), all of which is shrouded by a lack of clarity and uncertainty.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 10</xref> Further, roughly 30% of Black family members reported having contact with a mental health provider prior reaching CSC.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> The lack of contact with a mental health provider was seen to have a residual impact on quality of life among Black youth receiving services from CSC.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Research has also shed light on racial disparities at intake, which serves as an indicator of experiences and events on the pathway to care where Black individuals in the early stages of psychosis start treatment with more severe psychiatric symptoms compared with their white counterparts.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> While receiving services, less than 40% of family members/support persons participate in CSC (ie, family education and support component) and Black family members/support persons engaged in CSC at significantly lower rates than white families.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13 14</xref> Connecting with Black families earlier and providing services are needed to increase access to services and improve initial engagement, which would potentially reduce disparities in service utilisation in CSC.</p>
              <p>Family-focused navigator models emphasise connecting families to needed services while also providing support and resources to families. The availability of peer navigation for youth and their families is associated with the alleviation of barriers, increased access to appropriate mental health services, and reduced racial disparities in service utilisation.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15–19</xref> However, a systematic review on peer-led interventions identified that peer support or navigation interventions have not emphasised cultural factors.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Despite the proven utility of navigator models in other fields (eg, diabetes, cancer), family navigator models have been underutilised in mental health settings and subsequently there have been limited studies in this area.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20–22</xref> Three studies identified core functions necessary for a family navigation process that include (1) assessment and treatment in a timely manner; (2) availability of guidance on services; (3) provision of at least some evidence-based treatment; (4) tracking and evaluating and (5) frequent communication.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16 23 24</xref>
</p>
              <p>While the focus has generally been placed on providing navigator services during care, there is very little research on community-based navigator services prior to intake and on models that actively integrate culturally assessment tools.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Thus, the purpose of this protocol is to describe the process of developing and refining a family peer navigator (FPN) programme to identify, screen and link community-dwelling Black families at clinical high risk for psychosis to CSC or appropriate mental health services. The feasibility, acceptability and preliminary impact of the FPN programme for Black families in a randomised pilot trial will also be evaluated.</p>

                <p>This hybrid type 1 feasibility trial aims to develop, implement and evaluate a culturally informed FPN programme in the Black community across three phases. The proposed study commenced in May 2022 and will end April 2025. Hybrid type 1 designed feasibility trials are suggested as a way to expedite the dissemination of information and bridge the gap from research to practice,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> especially when addressing inequities and disparities in care. In collaboration with a community advisory board (CAB), our development phases I and II use an exploratory sequentially mixed-methods design (qual→QUANT) to develop and refine the FPN for Psychosis programme and implementation strategy. Phase III uses an embedded designed (QUANT+qual) randomised pilot trial that will recruit 40 Black families at risk for psychosis. Phases II and III are registered on the ClinicalTrials.gov database (NCT05284721).</p>

                <p>Prior to the start of the study family members and/or support persons were not involved in the development of the research question, study design and outcomes selected. We will establish a well-rounded CAB, composed of 3–5 family members, who identify as Black and/or African American, with a loved one who had experienced FEP and enrolled in CSC to form the family advisory group. The family advisory group of the CAB will provide feedback on the cultural appropriateness to ensure relevance and to further modify the model after the prepilot. The family advisory board will be joined by 7–10 individuals involved with community-based organisations that often make referrals for mental health services and who serve Black families. The CAB will advise the research team and develop community support for the FPN programme, inform the development and modifications to the FPN programme and its implementation, assist in pragmatic solutions to address potential challenges experienced by families and FPNs, and collaborate in the dissemination of our findings. Monthly meetings will be held virtually or in-person. All CAB members will be compensated US$50 for each meeting attended.</p>

                  <p>Extensive community outreach component involves assertive virtual and in-person outreach activities. In collaboration with the CAB, dissemination materials (flyers, infographics) will be developed covering topics deemed as important by the CAB and relevant to the Black community (eg, available resources, signs and symptoms of psychosis, de-escalation), and deployed to community-based organisations. Community presentations will be offered and delivered to inform organisations and individuals about pathways to care for Black families (evidence and need), resources offered by the FPN programme and making referrals (ie, recruitment). In-person tables will also be set up at one-time community events or regular table-set ups will be coordinated with interested community partners to bring awareness to psychosis and make referrals to FPNs.</p>

                  <p>Family navigation and support component includes: (1) Introduction and assessment will occur over two phone or in-person sessions (based on family member preference). A modified cultural formulation interview for family members/support persons will be used and delivered longitudinally, to identify specific factors unique to each family. (2) Individual psychoeducation will occur over four sessions and supplemented with printed and digital materials. The sessions will focus on defining psychosis using terminology consistent with how the family originally defined psychosis during the first two sessions, coping skills that match those identified in prior sessions, introduction to CSC and other available mental health services, and re-emphasise the benefits to family involvement. (3) Brief check-in sessions will occur in weeks between psychoeducation sessions and occur using family member’s preferred method (ie, text message, email or phone). The purpose of the brief check-ins will capitalise on the strength of peer navigators’ roles and will allow the FPN to engage families,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> inquire about potential barriers and changes made after individual sessions, and provide updates on care coordination efforts. Individuals will be hired as FPNs if they: (1) have a family member with lived experience, caring for and managing a loved one who has experienced psychosis and (2) self-identify as Black and/or African American. On hire, FPNs will be enrolled in the 5 days certified peer counsellor training provided by Washington State Health Care Authority.</p>

                <p>Training will include an initial online self-paced training course covering the prior research that informed the development of FPN and overall goals, FPN programme components (extensive community outreach, family navigation and support, documentation), introduction of CSC, and an overview of commonly used software (eg, outlook, scheduling). To increase integration with CSC, training will also include an introduction to the New Journeys network data platform developed in REDCap, which will also be used for documentation and tracking. A comprehensive manual will also be provided to supplement the online training. FPNs will then participate in two 1:1 coaching calls for the delivery of the modified cultural formulation interview. After coaching calls, FPNs will be asked to identify an individual not related to them to participate in a live recording for them delivering the cultural formulation interview. Recordings will be reviewed by the principal investigator and trained research staff to assess readiness. Weekly consultation meetings with the principal investigator will occur to monitor adherence to programme components of (eg, cultural formulation interview) using a developed fidelity checklist, cover strategies to overcome potential barriers, the use of the REDCap-based informatics tool and data accuracy, and technical assistance.</p>

                  <p>During phase I, we will conduct semistructured qualitative interviews and focus groups with approximately 25 key informants (eg, CSC providers and directors, community leaders, community organisations, family members) to understand programme/agency-level factors and community-level factors. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) will be used as the organisational framework for the development of semistructured interview guide to identify barriers, facilitators and additional needs associated with the integration of the FPN programme in CSC (CFIR domains: inner setting, individual, process) and within the community (CFIR domains: outer setting, individual, process, intervention). Interview guide can be seen in <xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental materials</xref>.

                  <p>We will conduct a 4-month open trial with 10 help-seeking Black families who have mental health concerns, specifically psychosis, about their loved one. Inclusion criteria for participants include: (1) ≥18 years of age; (2) loved one who meets criteria for risk of psychosis with a total score of ≥3 on the Prodromal Questionnaire-Brief Version and (3) identify as Black and/or African American. Exclusion criteria include: (1) family member who have difficulties understanding the consent process that impact their ability to provide consent; (2) non-English-speaking adults without support person to translate and (3) Black and/or African American families who have already been determined eligible for services by CSC. FPNs and research staff will conduct extensive community outreach, described above, to recruit participants for the open trial. Each participant will be screened and if eligible, research staff will explain the study, that participation is voluntary, and address questions that may arise. Participants that agree to continue will be asked to sign an informed consent form and complete the baseline assessments.</p>

On completion of the baseline appointment with research staff, participants will be scheduled for their first session with an FPN. Participants will complete monthly measures to preliminarily assess changes in potential treatment targets, described below and complete an open-ended feedback questionnaire to assess what worked and did not work to inform potential changes. All project-specific data will be collected using REDCap.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>

                  <p>Phone-based exit interviews will be conducted with all participants in week 12, to explore treatment targets and potentially identify other mechanisms of change. Using a semistructured guide, we will explore experiences (eg, satisfaction, modifications) with FPN and providers, as well as contextual factors at multiple levels that may be barriers or facilitators to the model and implementation. At the completion of the randomised pilot trial, qualitative interviews will be conducted with CSC providers and administrators, and FPNs to assess the acceptability, feasibility and appropriateness of implementation processes and fit. All interviews will be audiorecorded, transcribed, reviewed for accuracy and uploaded to ATLAS.ti.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>

                  <title>Quantitative data analysis</title>
                  <p>Primary outcomes for the randomised pilot are feasibility and acceptability. Acceptability will be analysed descriptively by computing means, SDs and 95% CIs of the scores on selected measures. Mean differences in satisfaction scores between treatment groups at the 12 weeks will also be compared using independent samples t-tests. Feasibility will be examined by calculating rates of engagement and retention across 12 weeks. Reasons for disengagement will also be examined. Feasibility of study procedures will be characterised using N’s and percentages for recruitment processes, completion and reliability of measure responses, and follow-up rates. We will use an intention-to-treat approach, where all participants are included in analyses. All tests will be two sided with critical value α=0.05. Necessary steps will be taken to ensure data completeness, however, ‘missing at random’ approaches (ie, multiple imputation, maximum likelihood) will be invoked if needed.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32 33</xref>
</p>
                  <p>Secondary outcomes are preliminary effectiveness and treatment targets. For preliminary effectiveness (initial family engagement and access), a series of mixed effects linear and logistic regression models with a fixed intercept for CSC to account for nesting of repeated measures and participants within CSC will be fit. Random participant and fixed site-level intercepts will be included to account for the nested data structure and to estimate intraclass correlation coefficients that characterise the proportion of variability in study outcomes accounted for at each level of analysis.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> An effect of time, a group-by-time interaction, and site will be added to each model to determine if the outcomes vary over time and differentially over time by group and site. Separate effect sizes and 95% CI will be calculated for number of appointments attended and number of contacts made between the participant and FPN. A Cox regression will be used to preliminary examine the number of days between referral to the FPN and the first CSC appointment. For each treatment target (knowledge, social connectedness, self-efficacy, alliance/communication, cultural sensitivity), we will explore the effect of the FPN programme on targets by calculating the effect sizes and 95% CI. Separate mixed linear models will be used to preliminarily test differences between conditions, baseline scores on each measure will be included as a covariate.</p>

              <p>The study was approved by Washington State University Institutional Review Board (phase I #19362 and phase II #19599). Consistent with funders’ policy, a data safety monitoring board will oversee the trial and any adverse events. Informed consent to participate will be obtained from all participants at each phase. The National Institute of Mental health (NIMH) data archive will be used as the permanent repository for the final dataset, to be shared with qualified investigators for research via the terms and process established by the NIMH. Anonymised data from the study will be available from the authors after the trial has ended.</p>
              <p>While there has been prior research to improve dissemination and access for mental health services for early psychosis among other historically underserved communities,<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41 42</xref> this study will provide critical information on the level of dissemination and community engagement and evidence on the benefits of a culturally responsive FPN model. This model is designed to address known factors that contribute to inequities (eg, limited access, lack of representation) in the utilisation of mental health services in the Black community. Findings will be disseminated through one or more publications in peer-reviewed journals.
