                <p>To examine the contributions of impaired gut microbial community development to childhood undernutrition, we combined metabolomic and proteomic analyses of plasma samples with metagenomic analyses of fecal samples to characterize the biological state of Bangladeshi children with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) as they transitioned, after standard treatment, to moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) with persistent microbiota immaturity. Host and microbial effects of microbiota-directed complementary food (MDCF) prototypes targeting weaning-phase bacterial taxa underrepresented in SAM and MAM microbiota were characterized in gnotobiotic mice and gnotobiotic piglets colonized with age- and growth-discriminatory bacteria. A randomized, double-blind controlled feeding study identified a lead MDCF that changes the abundances of targeted bacteria and increases plasma biomarkers and mediators of growth, bone formation, neurodevelopment, and immune function in children with MAM.</p>

                  <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
                  <p>There is a dimension to post-natal human development that involves assembly of microbial communities in different body habitats, including the gut. Children with acute malnutrition have impaired development of their gut microbiota, leaving them with communities that appear younger (more immature) than those of chronologically age-matched healthy individuals. Current therapeutic foods given to children with acute malnutrition have not been formulated based on knowledge of how they affect the developmental biology of the gut microbiota. Moreover, they are largely ineffective in ameliorating the long-term sequelae of malnutrition that include persistent stunting, neurodevelopmental abnormalities, and immune dysfunction.</p>

                  <title>RATIONALE</title>
                  <p>Repairing microbiota immaturity and determining the degree to which such repair restores healthy growth requires identification of microbial targets that are not only biomarkers of community assembly but also mediators of various aspects of growth. Identifying ingredients in complementary foods, consumed during the transition from exclusive milk feeding to a fully weaned state, that increase the representation and expressed beneficial functions of growth-promoting bacterial taxa in the developing microbiota could provide an effective, affordable, culturally acceptable, and sustainable approach to treatment.</p>

                  <title>RESULTS</title>
                  <p>Metabolomic and proteomic analyses of serially collected plasma samples were combined with metagenomic analyses of serially collected fecal samples from Bangladeshi children with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) treated with standard therapy. The results provided a readout of their biological features as they transitioned from SAM to a state of persistent moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) with accompanying persistent microbiota immaturity. Significant correlations were identified between levels of plasma proteins, anthropometry, plasma metabolites, and the representation of bacteria in their microbiota. Gnotobiotic mice were subsequently colonized with a defined consortium of bacterial strains that represent various phases of microbiota development in healthy Bangladeshi children. Administration of different combinations of Bangladeshi complementary food ingredients to colonized mice and germ-free controls revealed diet-dependent increases in the abundance and changes in the metabolic activities of targeted weaning-phase strains as well as diet- and colonization-dependent augmentation of growth-promoting host signaling pathways. Host and microbial effects of microbiota-directed complementary food (MDCF) prototypes were subsequently examined in gnotobiotic mice colonized with immature microbiota from children with post-SAM MAM and in gnotobiotic piglets colonized with a defined consortium of targeted age- and growth-discriminatory taxa. A randomized, double-blind study of standard therapy versus various MDCF prototypes emerging from these preclinical models, conducted in Bangladeshi children with MAM, identified a lead MDCF that increased levels of biomarkers and mediators of growth, bone formation, neurodevelopment, and immune function toward a state resembling healthy children. Using an approach inspired by statistical methods applied to financial markets, we show in the accompanying paper by Raman <italic>et al</italic>. that this lead MDCF was most effective in repairing the microbiota.</p>

          <body>
            <p>Evidence is accumulating that disruption of “normal” gut community (microbiota) development may contribute to the pathogenesis of undernutrition. Using culture-independent surveys, bacterial membership has been defined in fecal samples collected monthly during the first 2 postnatal years from healthy members of a birth cohort living in an urban slum (Mirpur) in Dhaka, Bangladesh (<italic><xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></italic>, <italic><xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></italic>). Applying machine learning [Random Forests (RF)] to the resulting 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) data-set yielded a “sparse” model composed of the most age-discriminatory bacterial strains; changes in the relative abundances of these organisms described a program of normal microbiota development (<italic><xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></italic>). This RF-derived model was subsequently used to characterize fecal samples collected from Bangladeshi children with severe acute malnutrition [SAM; defined as a weight-for-height z-score (WHZ) &gt;3 standard deviations below the median for a World Health Organization (WHO) reference healthy growth cohort (<italic><xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></italic>)]. The results revealed gut communities that resembled those of healthy children who were chronologically younger. This microbiota “immaturity” was more pronounced in children with SAM as compared with those with moderate acute malnutrition (MAM; WHZ score between –2 and –3) and was not repaired in a clinical study that tested the effects of two therapeutic foods (<italic><xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></italic>).</p>
            <p>Impaired microbiota development has also been documented in undernourished Malawian children (<italic><xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></italic>). To examine the functional importance of this impairment, microbial communities from healthy and stunted or underweight 6- and 18-month-old Malawian children were transplanted into groups of recently weaned germ-free mice fed a diet representative of that consumed by the human donor population. The results disclosed that compared with mice colonized with normally maturing microbiota from the healthy donors, animals harboring immature microbiota exhibited reduced rates of lean body mass gain, alterations in bone growth, and metabolic abnormalities (<italic><xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></italic>). These studies provided preclinical evidence for a causal link between microbiota immaturity and undernutrition; they also revealed that a subset of the age-discriminatory strains is growth-discriminatory. Moreover, a cultured consortium of these age- and growth-discriminatory taxa ameliorated the impaired growth phenotype transmitted to recipient gnotobiotic mice by an immature microbiota (<italic><xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></italic>).</p>
            <p>One question arising from these observations is, how do we design optimal foods that steer a microbiota into an age-appropriate and healthy state? Breastfeeding plays a major role in reducing childhood malnutrition. As such, WHO and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) recommend exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of postnatal life and continued breast-feeding after the introduction of complementary foods up to 24 months of age (<italic><xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></italic>). Suboptimal complementary feeding practices are important contributors to malnutrition in children less than 2 years of age (<italic><xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></italic>). However, current complementary feeding recommendations are not based on knowledge of how foods affect the developmental biology of the gut microbiota during the weaning process. Together, these observations raise the question: Do certain complementary food ingredients or combinations of ingredients have the ability to selectively increase the representation and expressed beneficial functions of age- and growth-discriminatory strains deficient in SAM- or MAM-associated microbiota? If the answer is yes, then prescribed feeding of these ingredients could help “repair” or prevent development of microbiota immaturity in children, with potentially long-lived, health-promoting effects.</p>
            <p>Here, we describe a process for identifying microbiota-directed complementary foods (MDCFs) designed to treat children with acute malnutrition. We first characterized gut microbial community and host responses over the course of 12 months in Bangladeshi children who were treated for SAM with one of three conventional therapeutic foods. Measurement of the levels of 1305 human plasma proteins—including regulators and effectors of physiologic, metabolic, and immune functions—combined with mass spec-trometric profiling of plasma metabolites and culture-independent analyses of serially collected fecal samples provided a “readout” of the biological features of these children as they progressed from SAM to a state of incomplete recovery (post-SAM MAM) with persistent microbiota immaturity. This readout included correlations between plasma proteins, anthropometry, plasma metabolites, and the representation of age-discriminatory members of their microbiota. We then screened complementary foods in gnotobiotic mice colonized with a consortium of bacterial strains that had been cultured from children living in Mirpur to identify ingredients that promote the representation of constituent age-discriminatory strains that are underrepresented in the setting of acute malnutrition. Subsequently, a representative microbiota from a child with post-SAM MAM was transplanted into gnotobiotic mice. Recipient animals were fed a diet resembling that consumed by children in Mirpur but supplemented with ingredients identified in the screen, in order to establish whether one or more of these MDCF formulations could repair a microbiota from a subject who had already received conventional therapy. Lead formulations were subsequently tested in gnotobiotic piglets colonized with a defined consortium of age- and growth-discriminatory strains to test their biological effects in a host species that is physiologically and metabolically more similar to humans than mice. Last, three MDCF prototypes were administered to children with MAM, and their effects on the microbiota and host biological state were determined.</p>

              <title>Effects of conventional therapeutic foods on the biological state of children with SAM</title>
              <p>A total of 343 Bangladeshi children aged 6 to 36 months with SAM were enrolled in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind “noninferiority” study designed to compare two locally produced therapeutic foods (supplementary materials, materials and methods) with a commercially available, ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF) (<italic><xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></italic>)(study design is provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Fig. 1A</xref>, and the compositions of these therapeutic foods are available in table S1A). Children received standard management for SAM during the acute stabilization phase of in-hospital treatment, including a short course of antibiotics. Eligible children were then randomized to one of the three therapeutic food arms (~200 kcal/kg/day, mean duration 16.1 ± 10.3 days) (table S1B). Children were discharged after meeting criteria described in the supplementary materials, materials and methods. In a subset of 54 children, fecal samples were collected at enrollment [age 15.2 ± 5.1 months (mean ± SD)] before randomization, twice during treatment with a therapeutic food, and at regular intervals up to 12 months after discharge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Fig. 1A</xref>; clinical metadata is available in table S1B). Blood samples (plasma) were also obtained at enrollment, discharge, and 6 months after discharge for targeted mass spectrometry (MS)–based metabolic profiling; a sufficient quantity of blood was obtained from eight children at all three time points for aptamer-based proteomics analysis (<italic><xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></italic>–<italic><xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></italic>). Of these children, 44% had MAM at 12 months of followup. None of the therapeutic foods produced a significant effect on their severe stunting [height-for-age <italic>z</italic>-score (HAZ)] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Fig. 1B</xref> and table S1B).</p>

                <title>Metabolic phenotypes</title>
                <p>Targeted MS of plasma samples obtained at enrollment revealed high levels of ketones, nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA), and medium to long even-chain acylcarnitines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>, and table S2), which is consistent with the known acute malnutrition-induced lipolytic response that raises circulating fatty acids and activates fatty acid oxidation (<italic><xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></italic>). By discharge, this metabolic feature had normalized, whereas levels of a number of amino acids had increased significantly, including the gluconeogenic amino acid alanine; the branched-chain amino acids leucine, isoleucine, and valine; plus products of branched-chain amino acid metabolism [C3 (propionyl)-carnitine and their ketoacids] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Fig. 2, A to C</xref>). These findings suggest that the increased protein provided by the therapeutic foods prompted a switch from fatty acid to amino acid oxidation, leading to repletion of fat depots, increases in plasma leptin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Fig. 2A</xref>), and weight gain (table S1B). However, 6 months after treatment, multiple plasma amino acids and their metabolites had declined to levels comparable with those at admission, whereas fatty acids and fatty acid– derived metabolites remained at similar concentrations to those observed at discharge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Fig. 2, A to C</xref>). Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels did not change significantly during this period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Fig. 2A</xref>), potentially explaining the absence of a signature of pronounced lipolysis that had been observed at enrollment. Although the suppression of lipolysis at 6 months after discharge suggests a sustained effect of nutritional resuscitation, the fall in essential amino acids and the lower level of IGF-1 compared with that found in similarly aged healthy children from the same community (44.5 versus 69.4 ng/mL; <italic>P</italic> = 0.02, <italic>t</italic> test) may contribute to the observed failure to achieve catch-up growth.</p>

                <title>The gut microbiome</title>
                <p>A sparse RF-derived model of normal gut micro-biota development comprising 30 bacterial taxa [operational taxonomic units (OTUs)] and obtained from 25 healthy members of a birth cohort living in Mirpur (table S4, A to C) was applied to bacterial V4-16S rDNA datasets generated from fecal samples serially collected from the children in the SAM study (<italic>n</italic> = 539 samples). This model allowed us to define microbiota-for-age <italic>z</italic>-scores (MAZ) as a function of treatment arm and time [9.3 ± 3.7 samples/child (mean ± SD)]. The MAZ score measures the deviation in development of a child’s microbiota from that of chronologically age-matched reference healthy children on the basis of the representation of the ensemble of age-discriminatory strains contained in the RF-derived model (<italic><xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></italic>). Significant microbiota immaturity was apparent in the SAM and post-SAM MAM groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Fig. 1C</xref> and table S5A). Moreover, MAZ-scores in this SAM cohort were significantly correlated with WHZ, HAZ, and WAZ [Pearson correlation coefficient (<italic>r</italic>)= 0.16, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0004; <italic>r</italic> =0.13, <italic>P</italic> =0.003;and <italic>r</italic> =0.10, <italic>P</italic> = 0.02, respectively]. The MAZ score was not different at discharge but improved 1 month later (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0051 versus admission, Mann-Whitney test). This improvement could reflect increased dietary diversity, reduced antibiotic usage (table S1B), and/or other factors associated with returning to the home environment. MAZ-scores did not change significantly thereafter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p>
                <p>A number of the age-discriminatory strains were significantly correlated with anthropometric indices as well as with plasma proteins involved in biological processes that mediate growth. We also identified significant negative correlations between these taxa and mediators of systemic inflammation and anorexia/cachexia. <italic>Bifidobacterium longum</italic> (OTU 559527) had the greatest number of significant correlations (114) [table S3C; further discussion is available in supplementary text, results].</p>
                <p>The effects of the therapeutic food interventions on the representation of metabolic pathways in the gut microbiome were defined by shotgun sequencing of 331 fecal DNA samples obtained from 30 members of the Mirpur birth cohort with consistently healthy anthropometry and 15 of the 54 children enrolled in the SAM study (table S5B); these 15 children were selected according to their age (12 to 18 months) and that we had corresponding plasma metabolomic and proteomic datasets for at least two of the three time points sampled. The abundances of microbial genes that mapped to pathways in the microbial communities SEED (mcSEED) database (<italic><xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></italic>)—related to metabolism of amino acids, carbohydrates, fermentation products, and B vitamins and related cofactors—were first defined in healthy children sampled monthly from birth to 2 years of age. A set of age-discriminatory metabolic pathways (mcSEED “subsystems” or pathway modules) was identified. The resulting sparse RF-derived model (fig. S1, A and B, and materials and methods) allowed us to assign a state of development (functional age or “maturity”) to the fecal microbiomes of the 15 children treated for SAM. Relative functional maturity was significantly correlated with MAZ, WHZ, and WAZ scores during the course of the trial (Pearson <italic>r</italic> and <italic>P</italic> values are MAZ, <italic>r</italic> =0.55, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001; WHZ, <italic>r</italic> =0.30, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0011; WAZ, <italic>r</italic> = 0.23, <italic>P</italic> =0.013). At enrollment, and just before administration of therapeutic foods, children with SAM had more immature microbiomes [one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) <italic>P</italic> = 0.0002; Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test for healthy versus SAM adjusted <italic>P</italic> values at the two time points, 0.027 and 0.0001, respectively]. There was a statistically significant improvement in functional maturity from initiation of therapeutic food treatment to discharge, and at 1 and 6 months after discharge (Tukey’s multiple comparisons test; adjusted <italic>P</italic> values = 0.039, 0.0028, and 0.025, respectively). However, this improvement was not sustained at later time points (fig. S1D). Comparing the relative abundances of the 30 most age-discriminatory pathways at six time points revealed that the SAM microbiome had significantly reduced representation of (i) amino acid metabolic pathways, including those involved in isoleucine, leucine, valine biosynthesis, and uptake; (ii) several carbohydrate utilization pathways (arabinose and arabinosides, rhamnose and rhamnogalacturonan, and sialic acid); and (iii) multiple pathways involved in B-vitamin metabolism, including “niacin/NADP (nicotinamide adenine dinucleo-tide phosphate) biosynthesis” (fig. S1E and table S5C). The observed underrepresentation of age-discriminatory OTUs and metabolic pathways in the gut communities of children with post-SAM MAM provided the rationale for developing a pipeline to test complementary food ingredients for their ability to repair this immaturity.</p>

              <title>Screening complementary food ingredients</title>
              <p>Nine age-discriminatory bacterial strains were cultured from the fecal microbiota of three healthy children, aged 6 to 23 months, who lived in Mirpur, and genomes of these isolates were sequenced (table S6, A and C). Seven of the nine isolates had V4-16<italic>S</italic> rDNA sequences that corresponded to age-discriminatory OTUs whose representation is associated with the period of complementary food consumption (“weaning-phase” OTUs) (fig. S2A), whereas two, <italic>Bifidobacterium longum</italic> subsp. <italic>infantis</italic> and <italic>Bifidobacterium breve</italic>, are most prominent during the period of exclusive, predominant milk feeding (fig. S2A) (<italic><xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></italic>). OTUs representing seven of the nine cultured strains were significantly depleted in the fecal microbiota of Bangladeshi children with SAM before treatment (table S7 and fig. S3). Seven additional age-discriminatory strains were cultured from the immature fecal microbiota of a 24-month-old child with SAM enrolled in the same study as the subcohort shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Fig. 1</xref> (table S6, A and C). Together, the consortium of 16 strains represented OTUs that directly matched 65.6 ± 22.8% (mean ± SD) of V4-16S rDNA sequencing reads generated from 1039 fecal samples collected from 53 healthy members of the Mirpur birth cohort during their first 2 postnatal years, and74.2±25.2%ofthe reads produced from fecal samples obtained from 38 children with SAM (table S7).</p>
              <p>To identify complementary foods that selectively increase the representation of weaning-phase age-discriminatory strains deficient in immature SAM-associated microbiota, we colonized 5-week-old, germ-free C57Bl/6J mice with the consortium of cultured, sequenced bacterial strains. After colonization, an 8-week period of diet “oscillations” was initiated (fig. S2B). We incorporated 12 complementary food ingredients commonly consumed in Mirpur (<italic><xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></italic>) into 14 different diets using a random sampling strategy (table S8, A to E, and materials and methods). The composition of these complementary food combinations (CFCs) and their order of administration to mice were based on considerations described in the legend to fig. S2, B and C.</p>
              <p>Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients were calculated between the relative abundances of the 14 bacterial strains that colonized mice and levels of complementary food ingredients in the 14 CFCs tested (fig. S2D and table S9A). Chickpea and banana had strong positive correlations with the greatest number of strains representing weaning-phase age-discriminatory OTUs. Tilapia had a narrower range of significant positive effects (fig. S2D). Chickpea, banana, and tilapia also had significant negative correlations with levels of the preweaning, milk-adapted <italic>B. longum</italic> subsp. <italic>infantis</italic> isolate. A sobering observation was that a number of complementary food ingredients typically represented in diets consumed by 18-month-old children living in Mirpur had significant negative correlations with six of the weaning-phase age-discriminatory strains, including rice, milk powder, potato, spinach, and sweet pumpkin (fig. S2D). Rice gruel with milk is the most common first complementary food given to Bangladeshi children (<italic><xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></italic>). Moreover, egg, which is included in a number of regimens for nutritional rehabilitation of children with acute malnutrition (<italic><xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></italic>), was negatively correlated with the abundance of two weaning-phase strains, <italic>Dorea formicigenerans</italic> and <italic>Blautia luti.</italic></p>

                <p>Serum levels of IGF-1 were significantly higher in colonized mice that consumed the initial MDCF prototype compared with those that consumed MS/KH. This effect was diet- and colonization-dependent, with germ-free animals exhibiting significantly lower levels of IGF-1 in both diet contexts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Fig. 3D</xref>). Serum insulin levels were also higher in colonized animals that consumed MDCF compared with MS/KH [800.7 ± 302.9 ng/mL (mean ± SD) versus 518.7 ± 135.1 ng/mL, respectively; <italic>P</italic> =0.06;unpaired <italic>t</italic> test].</p>
                <p>IGF-1 binding to its receptor tyrosine kinase, IGF-1R, affects a variety of signal transduction pathways, including one involving the serine/threonine kinase Akt/PKB, phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K), and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Absorption of several amino acids from the gut—notably, branched-chain amino acids and tryptophan—leads to activation of mTOR (<italic><xref rid="cit0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></italic>). Colonized animals fed MDCF had significantly higher levels of hepatic phosphoSer473-Akt, which is consistent with activation of Akt by IGF-1 signaling through the PI-3K pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Fig. 3E</xref>). Levels of phospho–AMPK (5′ adeno-sine monophosphate-activated protein kinase) were not significantly affected by diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Fig. 3E</xref>), suggesting that Akt phosphorylation is not caused indirectly by altered hepatic energy status. Phosphorylation of hepatic Jak 2 (Tyr1007/1008) and mTOR (Ser2448), which are involved in IGF-1 production, was significantly increased in colonized mice consuming MDCF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Fig. 3E</xref>), whereas phosphorylation of STAT5, also implicated in IGF-1 production, was not significantly altered.</p>
                <p>Previous studies of adult germ-free mice reported increases in serum IGF-1 after their colonization with gut microbiota from conventionally raised mice; increased IGF-1 levels were also associated with increased bone formation (<italic><xref rid="cit0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></italic>, <italic>24</italic>). Micro-computed tomography (mCT) of mouse femurs revealed a significant increase in femoral cortical bone area in MDCF-fed animals; the effect was both diet- and microbiota-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Fig. 3F</xref>).</p>
                <p>We used targeted MS to quantify levels of amino acids, acyl–coenzyme As (acylCoAs), acylcarnitines, and organic acids in serum, liver, and gastrocnemius muscle (table S12). Products of nonoxidative metabolism of glucose and pyruvate (lactate from glycolysis and alanine from transamination of pyruvate, respectively) were significantly lower in mice fed MDCF compared with mice fed MS/KH; this was true for alanine in serum, skeletal muscle, and liver and for lactate in liver (table S12, A to C and H). Oxidative metabolism of glucose is associated with nutritionally replete, anabolic conditions. These findings are consistent with the observed elevations of the anabolic hormone IGF-1 in MDCF-fed compared with MS/KH–fed mice. MDCF-fed mice had significantly higher circulating levels of branched-chain amino acids than those of their MS/KH–fed counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Fig. 3G</xref> and table S12, A to C). Skeletal muscle C5 carnitine and the closely related metabolite C5-OH/C3 carnitine were significantly higher in animals consuming MDCF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Fig. 3G</xref> and table S12F). In liver, C3 and C5 acylcarnitines were significantly lower in MDCF-treated mice (Fig. 3G and table S12E), suggesting that the more nutritionally replete state associated with MDCF may act to limit branched-chain amino acid oxidation in this tissue.</p>

              <title>Testing additional MDCF prototypes in gnotobiotic mice</title>
              <p>Incorporating tilapia into MDCF prototypes poses several problems: Its organoleptic properties are not desirable, and its cost is higher than commonly consumed plant-based sources of protein. To identify alternatives to tilapia, we selected an additional 16 plant-derived complementary food ingredients with varied levels and quality of protein (<italic><xref rid="cit0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></italic>) that are culturally acceptable, affordable, and readily available in Bangladesh (fig. S4A and table S13, A and B). Their effects were tested in gnotobiotic mice colonized with a defined, expanded consortium of 18 age- and growth-discriminatory bacterial strains (table S6A). We generated 48 mouse diets by supplementing a prototypic base diet representative of that consumed by 18-month-old children living in Mirpur (Mirpur-18), with each of the individual ingredients incorporated at three different concentrations (fig. S4A and table S13A). The results revealed that in this defined community context, peanut flour had the greatest effect on the largest number of targeted weaning-phase age-discriminatory taxa, followed by chickpea flour (fig. S4B and table S13C). Soy flour, which promoted the representation of two of these taxa, had the second-highest percentage protein after peanut flour (fig. S4A), and its protein quality was among the highest of the ingredients tested (table S13B). On the basis of these observations, we chose soy and peanut flours as replacements for tilapia in subsequent MDCF formulations.</p>
              <p>We reasoned that by transplanting a representative immature intact microbiota into young, germ-free mice, we could investigate whether gut health (defined by relative abundances of community members, expression of microbial genes in mcSEED metabolic pathways, and biomarkers and mediators of gut barrier function) was improved by supplementing the Mirpur-18 diet with one or more complementary food ingredients that target weaning-phase age-discriminatory taxa. Fifteen fecal samples from 12 different children, obtained during or after treatment for SAM, were screened in gnotobiotic mice to identify samples containing the greatest number of transmissible weaning-phase age-discriminatory taxa and to assess their response to supplementation of Mirpur-18 (table S14A). We selected a sample obtained from a donor (PS.064) who had post-SAM MAM; in addition to the successful transmission of targeted taxa, 88.7 ± 1.3% (mean ± SD) of the recipient animals’ gut communities consisted of OTUs that were detected at &gt;0.1% relative abundance in the donor sample (table S14B). Three groups of mice were colonized with this microbiota and monotonously fed one of three diets: unsupplemented Mirpur-18, Mirpur-18 supplemented with peanut flour [Mirpur(P)], or Mirpur-18 supplemented with four of the lead ingredients [Mirpur(PCSB), with peanut flour, chickpea flour, soy flour, and banana] (<xref ref-type="aff" rid="aff0004">Fig. 4A</xref> and table S15A). Three control groups were maintained as germ-free; each group was fed one of the three diets.</p>

Significant differences in expression were categorized based on enriched Gene Ontology (GO) terms for “Molecular Function.” In colonized mice, Mirpur(P) and Mirpur(PCSB) significantly up-regulated genes assigned to “cadherin binding” (GO: 0045296) and “cell adhesion molecule binding” (GO: 0050839) compared with Mirpur-18 (table S17A). The diet effect was colonization-dependent; there were no significant differences in expression of these genes or these GO categories in germ-free mice consuming supplemented versus unsupplemented diets (table S17). (Further discussion is available in the supplementary text, results, and histochemical and immunohistochemical analyses of tissue sections prepared along the length of the small intestines of these mice are provided in fig.

              <p>We examined the effects of MDCF prototypes in a second host species whose physiology and metabolism are more similar to that of humans. Gnotobiotic piglets provide an attractive model for these purposes; piglets manifest rapid growth rates in the weeks after birth (<italic><xref rid="cit0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></italic>), and methods for conducting experiments with gnotobiotic piglets have been described (<italic><xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></italic>).</p>
              <p>On the basis of the results from the gnotobiotic mouse studies, we designed two MDCF prototypes. One prototype was formulated to be analogous to Mirpur-18, which contains milk powder; this prototype was supplemented with peanut flour, chickpea flour, soy flour, and banana [MDCF(PCSB)]. The other diet lacked milk powder and was supplemented with just chickpea flour and soy flour [MDCF(CS)]. The two MDCFs were isocaloric, matched in lipid levels and total protein content (with equivalent representation of amino acids), and also met current ready-to-use therapeutic food guidelines for children with respect to macro- and micronutrient content (table S18A) (28).</p>

              <p>To assess the degree to which results obtained from the gnotobiotic mouse and piglet models translate to humans, we performed a pilot randomized, double-blind controlled feeding study of the effects of three MDCF formulations. The formulations (MDCF-1, -2, and -3) were designed to be similar in protein energy ratio and fat energy ratio and provide 250 kcal/day (divided over two servings). MDCF-2 contained all four lead ingredients (chickpea flour, soy flour, peanut flour, and banana) at higher concentrations than in MDCF-1. MDCF-3 contained two lead ingredients (chickpea flour and soy flour). A rice- and lentil-based ready-to-use supplementary food (RUSF), included as a control arm, lacked all four ingredients but was otherwise similar in energy density, protein energy ratio, fat energy ratio, and macro- and micronutrient content to those of the MDCFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0006">Fig. 6A</xref>).

                <p>To contextualize the biological effects of the dietary interventions, we performed quantitative proteomics (SOMAscan) on plasma collected from 21 12- to 24-month-old Mirpur children with healthy growth phenotypes (mean age, 19.2 ± 5.1 months; WHZ, 0.08 ± 0.58; HAZ, –0.41 ± 0.56, WAZ, –0.12 ± 0.60) and 30 children with SAM before treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Fig. 1A</xref>, B1 sample; WHZ &lt; –3; mean age 15.2 ± 5.1 months) [metadata associated with the healthy, SAM, and MAM (MDCF trial) cohorts are provided in table S22]. We rank-ordered all detected proteins according to fold differences in their abundances in plasma collected from healthy children compared with children with untreated SAM. The top 50 most differentially abundant proteins (<italic>P</italic> &lt;10<sup>−</sup>7;Rpackage “limma”) that were significantly higher in healthy children were designated “healthy growth-discriminatory,” whereas the top 50 differentially abundant proteins that were significantly higher in children with SAM were designated “SAM-discriminatory” (table S23A). We next compared the mean difference for each protein in the pre- versus post-intervention plasma samples for all children in each MDCF/RUSF treatment group. Proteins were then ranked according to the fold differences of the pre- versus post-treatment levels in each of the four groups (table S23B), and these treatment effects were mapped onto the 50 most healthy growth-discriminatory and 50 most SAM-discriminatory proteins. Strikingly, MDCF-2 elicited a biological response characterized by a marked shift in the plasma proteome toward that of healthy children and away from that of children with SAM; MDCF-2 increased the abundance of proteins that are higher in plasma from healthy children and reduced the levels of proteins elevated in SAM plasma samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0006">Fig. 6B</xref>).</p>
                <p>Aggregating proteomic datasets from the combined cohort of 113 children with SAM, MAM, and healthy growth phenotypes for whom plasma samples were available, we identified a total of 27 plasma proteins that were significantly positively correlated with HAZ and 57 plasma proteins that were significantly negatively correlated with HAZ [absolute value of Pearson correlation &gt; 0.25, false discovery rate (FDR)– corrected <italic>P</italic> value &lt; 0.05]. Among the treatments, MDCF-2 was distinctive in its ability to increase the abundances of a broad range of proteins positively correlated with HAZ, including the major IGF-1 binding protein IGFBP-3, growth hormone receptor (GHR), and leptin (LEP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0006">Fig. 6C</xref>). Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) was reduced after 4 weeks of dietary supplementation with MDCF-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0006">Fig. 6C</xref>). This transforming growth factor–b superfamily member, which was negatively correlated with HAZ, has been implicated in the anorexia and muscle wasting associated with cancer and with chronic heart failure in children; it was elevated in children with SAM and positively correlated with their lipolytic biomarkers NEFA and ketones (supplementary text, results). Peptide YY, an enteroendocrine cell product elevated in SAM plasma that reduces appetite and negatively correlated with HAZ, was also decreased by MDCF-2.</p>

MDCF-2–induced changes in biological state were accompanied by increases in the relative abundances of several weaning-phase taxa, including OTUs assigned to <italic>F. prausnitzii</italic> (OTU 851865) and a <italic>Clostridiales</italic> sp. (OTU 338992) that are closely related to taxa ranked first and second in feature importance in the sparse Bangladeshi RF-derived model of gut microbiota maturation (fig. S7, B and C). MDCF-2 supplementation was associated with a significant decrease in <italic>B. longum</italic> (OTU 559527) (fig. S7B), which is ranked third in feature importance in the RF-derived model and discriminatory for a young, milk-oriented microbiota. None of the other members of the 30 OTU model showed significant changes. By contrast, MDCF-1 did not produce significant increases in any of the taxa in the model. The other two formulations were each associated with a significant change in just one member [an increase in the relative abundance of an early age-discriminatory OTU (<italic>Streptococcus</italic>;ranked30th)with MDCF-3 supplementation, and a decrease in another OTU (<italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic>; ranked 29th) with RUSF supplementation] (table S4B).</p>
                <p>MAZ scores were not significantly different between groups at enrollment, nor were they significantly improved by any of the formulations. Interpretation of this finding was confounded by unexpectedly high baseline microbiota maturity scores in this group of children with MAM [MAZ, –0.01 ± 1.12 (mean ± SD)] (table S22) compared with a small, previously characterized Mirpur cohort with untreated MAM (<italic><xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></italic>). Hence, we developed an additional measure of microbiota repair (<italic><xref rid="cit0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></italic>). This involved a statistical analysis of covariance among bacterial taxa in the fecal microbiota of anthropometrically healthy members of a Mirpur birth cohort who had been sampled monthly over a 5-year period. Using approaches developed in the fields of econophysics and protein evolution to characterize the underlying organization of interacting systems with seemingly intractable complexity, such as financial markets, we found that the gut community in healthy children could be decomposed into a sparse unit of 15 covarying bacterial taxa termed an “ecogroup” (<italic><xref rid="cit0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></italic>). These ecogroup taxa include a number of age-discriminatory strains in the Bangladeshi RF-derived model (such as <italic>B. longum</italic>, <italic>F. prausnitzii</italic>, and <italic>Prevotella copri</italic>). We used the ecogroup to show that in addition to its effects on host biological state, MDCF-2 was also the most effective of the four treatments in reconfiguring the gut bacterial community to a mature state similar to that characteristic of healthy Bangladeshi children.</p>

              <p>We have integrated preclinical gnotobiotic animal models with human studies to understand the contributions of perturbed gut microbiota development to childhood undernutrition and to identify new microbiota-directed therapeutic approaches. We identified a set of proteins that distinguish the plasma proteomes of healthy children from those with SAM. Using these data, we have developed a supplemental food prototype, MDCF-2, that shifted the plasma proteome of children with MAM toward that of healthy individuals, including proteins involved in linear growth, bone development, neurodevelopment, and immune function. MDCF-2 is a tool for investigating, in larger studies across different populations with varying degrees of undernutrition, how repair of gut microbiota immaturity affects various facets of child growth.</p>

The top 50 most differentially abundant proteins in healthy compared with SAM were designated as healthy growth-discriminatory proteins, and the top 50 most differentially abundant in SAM compared with healthy were designated as SAM-discriminatory proteins. The average fold-change for these healthy growth and SAM-discriminatory proteins was then calculated for each treatment arm in the MDCF trial (before versus after MDCF/RUSF treatment) and normalized to the mean fold-change across all four arms. Limma was used to calculate statistical significance. All 1305 proteins were mapped to all GO “Biological Processes” in the GO database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.geneontology.org">www.geneontology.org</ext-link>). SetRank, a gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) algorithm (<italic><xref rid="cit0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></italic>), was used to identify GO Biological Processes that were significantly enriched for proteins that exhibited changes in abundance from before to after treatment with MDCF/RUSF. Enrichment was calculated by using the setRank Analysis function in the SetRank R library (parameters were use.ranks = TRUE; setPCutoff = 0.01; and fdrCutoff = 0.05). The average fold-change for each protein in the statistically significant Biological Process category was calculated for each treatment arm and normalized to the mean fold-change across all four arms. We defined proteins within the GO Biological Process as “healthy growth-discriminatory” if they were at least 30% more abundant in healthy individuals compared with those with SAM and “SAM-discriminatory” if they were at least 30% more abundant in children with SAM compared with those who were classified as healthy.</p>

                  <p>All mouse experiments were performed by using protocols approved by the Washington University Animal Studies Committee. Mice were housed in plastic flexible film gnotobiotic isolators under a 12-hour light cycle. Male germ-free C57BL/6 mice were initially weaned onto an autoclaved, low-fat, high-plant polysaccharide chow that was administered ad libitum (diet 2018S, Envigo). Animals were maintained on this diet until 3 days before the beginning of experiments involving tests of the effects of complementary food ingredients. Defined consortia of sequenced bacterial strains cultured from Bangladeshi children, or intact uncultured microbiota from donors with post-SAM MAM, were introduced by means of gavage into recipient mice at 5 weeks of age. Methods for identifying and characterizing the effects MDCF prototypes—including (i) design and preparation of diets; (ii) culturing of age-discriminatory and SAM-associated bacterial strains; (iii) shotgun sequencing of DNA isolated from serially collected fecal samples; (iv) microbial RNA-seq of cecal contents; (v) targeted MS of cecal contents, liver, gastrocnemius muscle, and serum samples for measurement of amino acids, acylcarnitines, organic acids, and acylCoAs; (vi) Western blot analysis of IGF-1 pathway components in liver; (vii) mCT of bone; and (viii) characterizing the effects of a transplanted fecal microbiome from a donor with post-SAM MAM in recipient gnotobiotic mice as a function of diet treatment by histochemical and immunohisto-chemical analysis of their intestinal segments, LCM of their small intestinal epithelium, and RNA-seq analysis of gene expression in LCM mucosa—are all described in the supplementary materials.</p>
