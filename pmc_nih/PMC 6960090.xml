                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS IH) is a lysosomal storage disease treated with hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) because it stabilizes cognitive deterioration, but is insufficient to alleviate all somatic manifestations. Intravenous laronidase improves somatic burden in attenuated MPS I. It is unknown whether laronidase can improve somatic disease following HCT in MPS IH. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of laronidase on somatic outcomes of patients with MPS IH previously treated with HCT.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">This 2-year open-label pilot study of laronidase included ten patients (age 5–13 years) who were at least 2 years post-HCT and donor engrafted. Outcomes were assessed semi-annually and compared to historic controls.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">The two youngest participants had a statistically significant improvement in growth compared to controls. Development of persistent high-titer anti-drug antibodies (ADA) was associated with poorer 6-min walk test (6MWT) performance; when patients with high ADA titers were excluded, there was a significant improvement in the 6MWT in the remaining seven patients.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p id="Par4">Laronidase seemed to improve growth in participants &lt;8 years old, and 6MWT performance in participants without ADA. Given the small number of patients treated in this pilot study, additional study is needed before definitive conclusions can be made.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="Par5">The mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) are a group of diseases resulting from specific lysosomal enzyme deficiencies that result in accumulation of glycosaminoglycans. Debilitating disease-related pathology is a significant problem that persists even following standard treatment for Hurler syndrome, the severe form of mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS IH). Hurler syndrome is the most severe form of alpha-<sc>l</sc>-iduronidase (IDUA) deficiency and is characterized by progressive multisystem involvement including severe cognitive, cardiac, pulmonary, and orthopedic complications. Most untreated children with MPS IH die from cardiopulmonary disease by late childhood. The standard of care for MPS IH, hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), has been successful in decreasing mortality from cardiac, pulmonary disease, and preserving central nervous system (CNS) function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> Consequently, children with MPS IH treated with HCT are living into adulthood.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> HCT does not, however, adequately treat all disease manifestations in MPS IH. Even in the setting of complete hematopoietic engraftment from enzyme-normal donors, patients with MPS IH treated with HCT are continuing to develop severe orthopedic disease, which may include carpal tunnel syndrome, progressive kyphosis, scoliosis, hip dysplasia, genu valgum, cervical instability, and cord compression, along with cardiomyopathy and valve disease, corneal clouding, sleep disordered breathing, hearing loss, and endocrinological disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> Thus, there is an urgent need for augmentative treatments in patients with MPS IH, despite “successful” transplantation.</p>
              <p id="Par6">Engraftment of allogeneic hematopoietic cells provides a low level of continuous enzyme delivery within tissue and plasma compartments. In contrast, weekly IV laronidase, with a short half-life ranging from 1.5 to 3.6 h (Package Insert), provides intermittent supraphysiologic plasma levels of enzyme. Therefore, each treatment approach has different pharmacokinetics. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT; (laronidase)) is approved for patients with MPS I, as this therapy is effective in the treatment of most of the somatic manifestations of the disease; however, it does not treat the CNS pathology and is associated with poorer long-term survival for patients with Hurler syndrome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> ERT is routinely used in infants awaiting HCT in order to improve clinical status prior to HCT and prevent pulmonary complications during HCT,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> but HCT remains the standard treatment for MPS IH because it can stabilize cognition and prevent progressive, unrecoverable developmental deterioration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> Administration of laronidase for 8–14 weeks before and shortly following HCT appears to improve IQ, along with nonverbal problem solving and processing at 2 years post-HCT.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> In addition, a retrospective, multicenter, long-term follow-up study of 217 patients with MPS IH after treatment with HCT found that a below normal post-HCT IDUA leukocyte enzyme level is associated with increased morbidity, including more progression of cord compression, cervical instability, hip dysplasia, carpal tunnel, overnight hypoxia, and corneal clouding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> Finally, in a murine model of MPS IH, the delivery of supraphysiologic IDUA following transplantation with lentiviral-mediated genetically corrected hematopoietic stem cells resulted in improved appearance of the bone and epiphysis, suggesting a dose effect of enzyme in modifying orthopedic-related outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> Therefore, we hypothesized that the addition of intermittent supraphysiologic dosing of laronidase may benefit patients with MPS IH after HCT. If laronidase, continued after HCT, prevented complications of this disease, this has the potential to significantly improve the lives of affected patients and their families, and may decrease the risk of medical and surgical interventions required to manage disease-related complications. The primary objective of this pilot study was to evaluate safety and tolerability of weekly IV laronidase in patients with MPS IH treated with HCT at least 2 years prior. Secondary objectives evaluated the effect of weekly IV laronidase on joint range-of-motion (ROM), muscle strength, fitness, cardiac findings, and physical activity level.</p>

                <p id="Par7">Inclusion criteria included patients diagnosed with MPS IH that were &lt;14 years old at study enrollment. Eligible patients must have been treated with HCT &gt; 2 years prior to study enrollment and had &gt;10% donor engraftment. Exclusion criteria included previous administration of laronidase within 2 years, anticipated survival less than 2 years, or history of cardiac or pulmonary insufficiency defined by an ejection fraction &lt;40% or requiring continuous supplemental oxygen, respectively. Subjects were enrolled between June 2012 and February 2014 at the University of Minnesota.</p>
                <p id="Par8">For height and ROM outcomes, the study cohort was compared against historic MPS IH control data from a 9-year longitudinal observational study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> Inclusion criteria for the longitudinal study were biochemical and/or genetic diagnosis of MPS IH, age ≥5 years old and &lt;18 years old. Exclusion criteria included concurrent enrollment in a therapeutic drug trial. All of the patients from this control cohort had previously undergone HCT. The historical controls were selected by having MPS IH, history of HCT, and with comparable age at entry into the study.</p>

                <p id="Par10">This was an open-label, single arm, 2-year, pilot study of weekly laronidase in subjects with MPS IH who were treated with HCT &gt; 2 years prior to study enrollment. Subjects received weekly laronidase (0.58 mg/kg i.v.) and were monitored for infusion-related toxicities by their local treating physician. The local physicians completed a laronidase administration report form at the time of each infusion and returned the logs to the study coordinators at least every 3 months. Donor hematopoietic chimerism was measured at baseline and every 6 months for the duration of the 2-year study. Antidrug antibodies (ADA) were measured by two methods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>; inhibitory capacity was measured at ADA titer peak and end-of-study as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> Subjects were labeled ADA+ if their maximum titer was ≥4000 (using either method) and the mean inhibition (averaged between the inhibition at the ADA titer peak and the end of the study) was ≥30% as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> Measurements of ROM, muscle strength, fitness, physical activity, and growth were also conducted at baseline and every 6 months. In addition, annualized growth velocity at baseline was calculated using the most recent height measurement obtained in clinical practice, but at least 6 months prior to the baseline visit, in seven of ten participants (data unavailable in three participants).</p>

                <p id="Par11">The primary outcome measure was safety and tolerability. Secondary outcome measures included changes from baseline in several key domains. Bilateral shoulder flexion, elbow extension, and hip extension were measured using goniometry and the sites were chosen based on common areas of MPS-related disease. Muscle strength was measured by a Biodex System 3 dynamometer (Biodex medical Systems, Inc., Shirley, NY). The angular velocities of 90 and 120 degrees/second (d/s) were chosen based on previously reported deficits in these strength measures in MPS IH.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> Handgrip strength was measured three times in both hands with a mechanical hand-held dynamometer with the subject in a seated position at each visit; the average for each hand is presented. Fitness was measured by peak oxygen uptake (VO<sub>2</sub> peak), peak heart rate (HR), and time to fatigue during a modified Balke Treadmill Test.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> This test is recommended for unfit and/or chronically ill children or adolescents. Briefly, patients began walking at 2.0 mph with a 2% increase in grade every 2 min. A 12-lead electrocardiogram was monitored continuously throughout the test for the determination of heart rate and dysrhythmias or ischemic changes. Heart rate was measured at the end of each stage (i.e. every 2 min) and time to fatigue (i.e. patient request to stop despite encouragement to continue) was recorded. VO<sub>2</sub> peak was measured by collection and analysis of expired air by a MedGraphics CPX/D Metabolic System. The 6MWT was conducted as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> In brief, a 30 m hospital corridor marked by colored tape at each end was used. Subjects were instructed to walk from end to end at their self-selected pace, while attempting to cover as much distance as possible in the 6 min. The patients were instructed to walk around the mark as they changed direction. The time and distance covered was recorded, as was the heart rate prior to and immediately after completion of the walk test. The 6MWT has previously been used in assessments of laronidase and other ERT interventions in patients with lysosomal storage diseases as a measure of overall physical function and health status.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> The 6MWT is a measure of overall physical function and health status because performance of this test incorporates multiple body systems. The ability to understand and follow the instructions for the test requires a degree of cognitive ability. The physical performance of the test is a measure of mobility and coordination as well as cardiorespiratory status. As such, this test assesses many functions required to perform typical activities of daily living. Anthropometric measurements (standing height, sitting height, and arm span) were performed in triplicate and the average taken at the baseline and month 24 visits. Height standard deviation scores (SDS) were calculated based on CDC growth charts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> Cardiac ultrasounds were obtained at baseline and month 24. Two-dimensional imaging was obtained for determination of anatomy. Left ventricular chamber dimensions and wall thicknesses were measured by M-mode and shortening fraction (SF [normal &gt; 27%]) was calculated by standard methodology.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> Pulse-wave and color Doppler interrogation of cardiac valves was performed for determination of valve regurgitation or stenosis. To compare chamber dimensions and wall thicknesses sequentially in a single subject or between subjects of different sizes, <italic>Z</italic>-scores based upon body surface area were calculated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> A <italic>Z</italic>-score of 0 represents the normal, or average, value at a given body surface area and <italic>Z</italic>-scores between −2 and +2 are values within 2 standard deviations (SD) of normal (parameterz.com).</p>

An additional identical analysis was performed restricted to treated and control participants under 8 years of age.

In our study the range of change in shoulder flexion was −44° to +72° over 2 years. This is likely related to the high degree of variability in the severity of joint disease in patients with MPS IH after HCT, and was similar in regards to our observances in elbow extension.</p>
              <p id="Par26">We obtained two measures of fitness during our study: the modified Balke treadmill test and the 6MWT. The measurement of peak oxygen uptake during treadmill testing is considered the best single physiologic indicator of an individual’s cardiopulmonary fitness and can also be used to monitor changes in cardiopulmonary fitness over time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup> Unfortunately, our participants were rarely able to tolerate the mask necessary for this measurement during the treadmill test, and so this outcome proved not feasible. They were, however, able to perform the 6MWT, on which MPS IA participants have previously shown improvements of 19.7 ± 68.6 m over 26 weeks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> and 31.7 ± 10.2 m over 2 years of laronidase ERT.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> We found a mean increase on the 6MWT that was 2.5 and 1.6 times these prior studies, but also had greater variability: 50 ± 92 m. The variability in response to therapy is likely due to a broad spectrum of physical impairment in MPS IH patients after HCT, other interventions such as surgical procedures, and variation in motivation.</p>
              <p id="Par27">Prior reports of ADA following IV laronidase found a high incidence of the development of ADA that appear to have a negative impact of biochemical measures of disease activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup> For example, in one study of MPS IH patients treated before and during HCT, 50% of patients developed ADA with both catalytic enzyme inhibition and uptake inhibition of catalytically active enzyme, but became immune tolerant 26–137 days after HCT.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup> However, there was a negative impact of ADA on the ratio of dermatan sulfate to chondroitin sulfate in the six patients studied.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup> Others have found that laronidase ADA correlate with worse sleep disordered breathing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> In our study, patients who did not develop high ADA had a significant improvement in their 6MWT over the course of the study; however, patients with ADA did not improve on their 6MWT. This clinical outcome data seems to support previously published data on the negative impact of ADA on biochemical outcomes. However, the question remains as to whether patients with MPS IH treated with ERT after HCT will become immune tolerant over time, as has been reported,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup> or whether ADA persist and negate the positive impact of enzyme secreted by donor cells.</p>
              <p id="Par28">Progressively worsening short stature has been reported by us and others in patients with MPS IH after HCT.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> On average, after HCT patients with MPS IH lose approximately 0.5 height SDS every 2 years; however, this varies slightly with age and post-HCT leukocyte IDUA levels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> Five of our participants had a change in height SDS of better than the expected loss of 0.5 SDS every 2 years, and three of our study patients had a positive increase in height SDS of 0.1, 0.4, and 0.7. The improvement in annualized growth velocity in our treated group versus historic controls was 0.9 cm/yr (95% CI: −0.4 to 2.2 cm/yr; <italic>p</italic> = 0.16), with the greatest increase in comparative growth velocity in the youngest two participants (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The clinical significance of these improvements is unclear based on the limited sample size, but suggests that additional study would be useful to determine if this finding is observed in a larger group of younger patients.</p>
              <p id="Par29">Cardiac echo structural and functional parameters were within normal limits in all subjects and cardiac valve regurgitation was absent or trivial in most subjects at the initiation of ERT. The structural and functional parameters remained normal after 24 months of ERT in all except one subject who began the study with moderate mitral regurgitation. Progression of aortic valve regurgitation has previously been reported as a long-term finding in MPS I patients after both HCT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup> and enzyme replacement therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup></p>
              <p id="Par30">Although this study was primarily designed to understand safety and tolerability, the small sample size, which is an inherent limitation in rare disease research, restricts the number of factors that can be controlled when modeling outcomes, therefore requiring a conservative approach in drawing definitive conclusions. It is also possible that, given the small sample size, a longer study is needed to see statistically significant, and clinically meaningful, improvements in outcomes in this small group. Our study highlights the challenges in measuring the impact of disease burden in this pediatric population due to a variety of reasons, such as an inability to understand test directions, maintenance of motivation, and other factors such as disease and/or surgeries. For instance, we determined that assessment of cardiopulmonary fitness (VO<sub>2</sub> peak from the Modified Balke Treadmill test) was not feasible in our cohort due to an inability to wear the required mask while walking on the treadmill. Despite these limitations, this study provides (1) valuable insight into how a future study should be designed, considering the physical and cognitive limitations of the population, and (2) pilot data to adequately power a future study in order to draw definitive conclusions about the effects of laronidase in patients with MPS IH after HCT.</p>
              <p id="Par31">In conclusion, enzyme augmentation with laronidase 0.58 mg i.v. weekly is well tolerated in posttransplantation MPS IH patients. However, we cannot make conclusions on the usefulness of ERT in patients with MPS IH after HCT at this time due to the limitations described above. Additional testing is needed. One concerning finding however, is that we observed the development of antidrug antibodies in several patients, which was not anticipated, as the hematopoietic cells of these patients are endogenously producing enzyme. In addition, there is a suggestion that antibody generation may be clinically important, as an improvement was noted in the 6MWT in the individuals who did not develop high ADA levels. An improvement in growth rates were also seen, but only for the younger participants. If enzyme is used after transplantation, monitoring patients for the development of antibody would be important, as at least in the case of the 6MWT, it may be clinically relevant.</p>
