                <p id="Par1">Much of the mechanistic research on anxiety focuses on subcortical structures such as the amygdala; however, less is known about the distributed cortical circuit that also contributes to anxiety expression. One way to learn about this circuit is to probe candidate regions using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). In this study, we tested the involvement of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), in anxiety expression using 10 Hz repetitive TMS (rTMS). In a within-subject, crossover experiment, the study measured anxiety in healthy subjects before and after a session of 10 Hz rTMS to the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). It used threat of predictable and unpredictable shock to induce anxiety and anxiety potentiated startle to assess anxiety. Counter to our hypotheses, results showed an increase in anxiety-potentiated startle following active but not sham rTMS. These results suggest a mechanistic link between right dlPFC activity and physiological anxiety expression. This result supports current models of prefrontal asymmetry in affect, and lays the groundwork for further exploration into the cortical mechanisms mediating anxiety, which may lead to novel anxiety treatments.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="Par2">The bulk of the mechanistic research into anxiety expression implicates sub-cortical structures such as the amygdala and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] however, there exists a large body of literature implicating large-scale brain networks in anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In addition, individuals with anxiety disorders exhibit wide-ranging symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] that likely involve distributed neural circuits with multiple regions contributing to expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. By broadening our understanding of the mechanisms mediating anxiety expression, it may be possible to develop new treatments for anxiety disorders. One potential approach toward this goal is to use transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), which can directly activate cortical neurons via ultra-brief local magnetic field changes, to probe candidate regions in the networks thought to be important for anxiety. The general purpose of this study is to use rTMS to probe one specific candidate region, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), and determine the role of this region in anxiety expression.</p>
              <p id="Par3">We chose the dlPFC because previous studies indicate that this region may be important for top-down regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], which may be important for anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. For instance, BOLD responses in the dlPFC during threat are negatively correlated with subjective anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], tasks that activate the dlPFC reduce anxiety potentiated startle (APS), and dlPFC activity during threat positively correlates with performance when task demands are high [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Together these results suggest that facilitating dlPFC activity should reduce anxiety; however, this is not reflected in the current therapeutic application of rTMS to treat anxiety symptoms in depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Rather than facilitating dlPFC activity, these clinical rTMS protocols are designed to reduce dlPFC excitability in the right hemisphere. This type of application is consistent with the interpretation that the right dlPFC is important for anxiety expression rather than regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], but inconsistent with our previous results.</p>
              <p id="Par4">Accordingly, to distinguish between these two possibilities, we targeted this region with 10 Hz rTMS, based on previous results showing excitatory effects with high-frequency (&gt;5 Hz) stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Because brain state at the time of stimulation influences response to the stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], we delivered the stimulation during the maintenance interval of the Sternberg working memory paradigm, a task known to activate the dlPFC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], to facilitate the effectiveness of this stimulation. We also used this task to identify individualized functional TMS targets, representing the peak BOLD activity during the maintenance interval in the dlPFC for each subject, and used iterative electric-field modeling to optimize the coil position [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par5">To induce aversive states in our subjects, we used the NPU (Neutral, Predictable, and Unpredictable) threat task, a well-validated and robust way to evoke acute fear and sustained anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The NPU threat task uses both predictable and unpredictable threats of shock to probe acute fear and sustained anxiety responses within subject, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Fear and anxiety were measured using fear- and anxiety-potentiated startle (FPS, and APS, respectively), the change in the magnitude of the startle reflex during predictable and unpredictable threat periods compared to safe periods. Potentiated startle has been extensively researched [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], and shown to be reliable across sessions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par6">The specific objective of the study then, was to examine the effect of high-frequency rTMS to the dlPFC on sustained anxiety (See Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). We chose the right dlPFC based on previous data from our lab indicating a potential link between this region and anxiety regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. We administered active or sham 10 Hz rTMS to the right dlPFC on separate days, and measured the effect of this rTMS on fear and anxiety using the NPU task. Given the role of the dlPFC in anxiety regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], we specifically focused on sustained anxiety during the unpredictable periods. We chose this pre-post design to minimize the off-target effects of aversive sensation of the prefrontal rTMS delivery.

During the MRI visit, Subjects were consented and screened for MRI/TMS contraindications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. They then completed a T1, T2, a diffusion-weighted EPI scan, and a 10-m resting state scan, followed by two ~8 m EPI scans during which they performed the Sternberg WM task. Scanning took place in a Siemens 3T Skyra MRI scanner with a 32-channel head coil, with a coil mounted mirror system for visual stimulus delivery. The data from the MRI visit were used to localize the optimal stimulation site and calculate the e-field models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Testing took place during the TMS visits where subjects’ anxiety was assessed using the NPU threat task before and after 10 Hz stimulation to the right dlPFC. Subjects completed the following procedures: electrode setup, startle habituation, shock workup, pre-stimulation NPU, motor thresholding, TMS administration during the Sternberg WM task, and post-stimulation NPU. Active and sham stimulation were delivered on separate days, and the order was counterbalanced across subjects according to a random number sequence generated by the research assistants.</p>

                <p id="Par35">To quantify APS and FPS, we created the following difference scores (APS = U ITI – N ITI; FPS = P Cue – P ITI; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] T-scores and raw startle magnitudes for all conditions are plotted in Supplementary Figs. <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">3</xref>, respectively), clipping outliers to within 2SD of the mean, according to previously published standards [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. We conducted 2 (Stimulation: Active vs. Sham) by 2 (Timing: Pre vs. Post) repeated measures ANCOVAs on APS and FPS, covarying out ratings of the TMS sensation to account for placebo effects apparent in the NPU rating data.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par38">This study investigated the effect of 10 Hz stimulation to the dlPFC on anxiety induced by threat of shock with APS as the primary outcome measure. We hypothesized that APS would be reduced immediately after active rTMS compared to sham. However, contrary to this hypothesis, active rTMS to the dlPFC increased APS. Although additional research is needed to characterize this effect, our results suggest a link between dlPFC and the physiological expression of anxiety. Importantly, the increase in APS is unlikely due to expectancy effects because individuals’ anxiety ratings were reduced after both active and sham stimulation. This novel mechanistic link between the dlPFC and anxious arousal may prove to be an important clinical target for future anxiety treatments.</p>
              <p id="Par39">Given that the findings were counter to our hypothesis, it is important to consider them in light of the other findings in the study. There were two main findings that could be considered contrary to the APS findings. First, although we observed a significant Stimulation by Timing interaction with FPS, unlike APS the follow-up <italic>t</italic>-tests were not significant. These results suggest that the effect of active stimulation on APS may be stronger than the effect of active stimulation on FPS. One possibility for this difference is that the increase in arousal captured by the FPS measure is driven by an acute fear, rather than a sustained anxiety response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], and, as we have shown previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] the former is less susceptible to various types of experimental manipulation than the former. However, the most likely explanation for these results is that subjects expected the TMS to reduce their anxiety, and so they reported less anxiety. This dissociation between implicit (APS) and explicit (ratings) arousal is well documented in the emotional learning field (e.g. LeDoux et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]).</p>
              <p id="Par40">Our hypothesis for decreased APS with 10 Hz TMS to the dlPFC was based on the assumptions that (1) the dlPFC is involved in anxiety down-regulation, and (2) 10 Hz rTMS would facilitate this down-regulation. In the next sections, we will discuss the evidence for and against these assumptions. In the Future Directions section, we will discuss the follow-up work needed to further test these assumptions.</p>

                <title>Top-down regulation</title>
                <p id="Par41">Although the finding of increased APS following active 10 but not sham Hz rTMS to the right dlPFC was counter to our hypothesis, it is consistent with the frontal asymmetry hypothesis relating to negative affect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. According to this hypothesis, right prefrontal excitability (i.e. decreases in right prefrontal alpha) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], may be associated with negative affect and high arousal, while left prefrontal excitability may be associated with positive affect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. This hypothesis, form the basis for left dlPFC-focused TMS treatments for depression that have been largely successful [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. For instance, inhibitory continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) to the right dlPFC leads to accelerated habituation of the overall startle response during affective picture viewing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], and cTBS to the left dlPFC attenuates positive affective startle modulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Similarly, high-frequency rTMS to the right dlPFC increases threat-related attentional capture in those with high trait anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. In line with this thinking, there have been efforts to extend this model to treat anxiety by reducing right dlPFC activity with low-frequency stimulation, which has led to some success [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. One possible explanation for this concerns the distinction between anxiety expression and anxiety regulation.</p>
                <p id="Par42">The above asymmetry model is based on the observation of elevated right dlPFC activity accompanies high anxiety, and assumes that this activity mediates anxiety expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. However, it is also possible that this right dlPFC activity is more involved in top-down regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], which was the basis for the current study. Indeed, there is some evidence from neuromodulatory studies suggesting that exciting the right dlPFC produces anxiolytic effects, while inhibiting the right dlPFC produces the opposite effect. For instance, low-frequency rTMS to the right dlPFC increases heart rate during an affective picture viewing task [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Similarly, high-frequency stimulation to the right dlPFC reduces amygdala responses to negative faces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], and single pulses to the right dlPFC reduce amygdala activity during simultaneous TMS/fMRI and PTSD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par43">Indeed, both the expression and regulation hypotheses are consistent with our previous data showing a positive relationship between right dlPFC activity and anxiety. According to the expression hypothesis, right dlPFC activity increases may be related to increases in anxiety symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. In contrast, according to the regulation hypothesis, anxiety increases drive activity in expression-related regions (e.g. the amygdala, BNST, etc.) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], which engage down-regulation processes that drive activity in the right dlPFC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. This is consistent with the broader role of the dlPFC in emotion regulation and distractor suppression in general. Our current results are consistent with the expression hypothesis and by extension the frontal asymmetry hypothesis; however, it should also be mentioned that we did not directly test the effects of left vs. right dlPFC stimulation, so future work is needed to test the laterality of this effect. In contrast, assuming excitatory effects from the 10 Hz stimulation protocol, our results are not consistent with the regulation hypothesis.</p>

                <title>Frequency-specific effects of rTMS</title>
                <p id="Par44">Although the goal of this study was to experimentally test this top-down inhibition hypothesis by experimentally increasing dlPFC excitability and measuring the effect on anxious arousal, our hypothesis depended on the assumption that 10 Hz rTMS would increase right dlPFC activity post stimulation, with few off-target effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Indeed, there is evidence that high-frequency stimulation increases cortical excitability both within-session [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], and acutely after the stimulation session [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. High-frequency stimulation has also been shown to be effective at treating depression when delivered to the left dlPFC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], whereas anxiolytic effects have been reported with 1 Hz to the right dlPFC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, it should be noted that the after-effects of high-frequency rTMS are thought to be highly parameter dependent, varying also as a function of duration and intensity, with lower intensities often leading to decreases in excitability post stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. One possible explanation for our increase in APS following active stimulation may be our decision to decrease the stimulation intensity when requested by the subjects. Indeed, we do observe a moderate, albeit non-significant, negative correlation between stimulation intensity (as a percentage of motor threshold) and the pre-post change in APS (<italic>r</italic> = −0.27). We understand that this intensity adjustment is not common practice; however, our shock threat manipulation may have sensitized our subjects to pain. In addition, given the nature of our study, anxiety manipulation through threat of an unpleasant shock, it was important that the rTMS not be perceived as more unpleasant than the shock itself, which is indeed the case (Unpleasantness Ratings: shock = 8.84; active rTMS = 6.26). It is also important to note that the rTMS was done offline, so that anticipation of the rTMS did not contaminate the measures collected during the NPU task.</p>

                <title>Sternberg performance</title>
                <p id="Par45">The current study included the Sternberg WM task, which was used both as a functional localizer as well as a method to control the subjective state of the subject during the stimulation sessions. Although this study was not designed to directly test the effects of rTMS to the right dlPFC on Sternberg performance, we did observe two potential differences as a function of stimulation type. First, people tended to be marginally slower during active compared to sham. Second, practice effects for accuracy (i.e. changes from pre-stimulation baseline) tended to differ as a function of working memory load, with practice effects being marginally larger for sham compared to active for low and sort, while practice effects being marginally larger for active compared to sham for high. These results are consistent with previous work showing that targeting WM circuits can lead to load-related effects on WM performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. However, these results should be considered with caution for two reasons. First, the Sternberg WM task was included in the study design to facilitate the effects of TMS on anxiety, and so it was not optimally designed to measure the effect of TMS on WM performance. Second, the effects observed were marginal, and only included to show the degree to which the rTMS targeted WM-related circuitry.</p>

                <title>Future directions</title>
                <p id="Par46">The broader goals of this line of research are to identify mechanisms underlying the expression and regulation of anxiety, and to develop potential new treatments. By uncovering a link between right dlPFC activity and APS modulation, the current work represents a first step in this process. Again, it is important to note that additional work targeting both the left and the right dlPFC is needed to confirm the laterality of these findings. Given the existing work using low-frequency rTMS to treat anxiety symptoms in depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], it is tempting to conclude that this link primarily reflects a role for the right dlPFC in anxiety expression. However, given the large TMS parameter space [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>], and parameter-dependent nature of rTMS after-effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>], this conclusion may be premature. Future work should focus on characterizing the nature of this link in terms of expression-related vs. regulation-related processing. One key component to this work will be to systematically explore the relationship between stimulation frequency and intensity on anxiety expression within-session. Another key component will be to explore plasticity-related after-effects of rTMS on anxiety by extending the interval between the rTMS session and the test session. Because potential future treatment effects will need to be long-lasting, this latter component will also be an important step in developing robust treatment options.</p>

                <title>Strengths and limitations</title>
                <p id="Par47">There were several strengths to this study. The primary strength being the novel use of APS as an outcome measure to assess the effect of rTMS. Importantly, this physiological measure allowed us to measure the objective effect of the active stimulation protocol on anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>], independent of the subjective placebo effects induced by both the active and sham stimulation. This is an important step because anxiety is highly dimensional, so this healthy volunteer approach employing APS could be used from proof-of-concept in the development of novel rTMS treatment strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Although it is out of the scope of the current work to directly test the predictive validity of APS as predictive of clinical outcomes, there is ample evidence to suggest that APS is influenced by many of the same therapeutic interventions as clinical anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>], and is elevated in women, who are known to suffer from anxiety disorders at higher rates than men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Both the operator and the subject were blinded to the TMS condition, and the subjects were given a realistic electric stimulation sham to prevent unblinding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Another strength is that we used objective methods to obtain a priori criteria to determine the site (fMRI-based localization), orientation (E-field modeling; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]), and subjective state of the subject during stimulation (Sternberg WM maintenance; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]), thereby reducing the experimenter degrees of freedom inherent in the high dimensionality parameter space of rTMS.</p>
                <p id="Par48">The primary limitation of the current work is that we measured anxiety immediately post active or sham rTMS, making it difficult to assess how changes in right dlPFC plasticity affected anxiety independent of the acute effects of the rTMS on right dlPFC excitability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Another limitation is that although the operator was blinded to the rTMS condition, the research assistant had to remain unblinded, in order to set the coil (active vs. sham) and e-stim intensity. However, it should be noted that the research assistant had minimal patient contact during the visit. Another limitation is that we did not formally record participant guesses for the sham/real condition. However, these limitations are not likely sufficient to explain the increase in APS following active stimulation, because both our initial hypotheses (i.e. experimenter bias) and the subjective anxiety ratings (i.e. participant’s expectations) run counter to the APS finding. One final limitation of the current study is the relatively small N of the current work. Our initial power analysis suggested that we would need 26 subjects; however, due to time and resource constraints we were only able to collect 24 (19 included in the final analysis). Future studies should be conducted with larger sample sizes to replicate these findings.</p>
