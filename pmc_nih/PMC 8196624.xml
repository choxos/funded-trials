                <p id="P3">Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is a common complication of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). In this trial, we randomized adult CMV-seropositive HCT recipients without CMV viremia at screening 2:1 to receive brincidofovir or placebo until week 14 post-HCT. Randomization was stratified by center and risk of CMV infection. Patients were assessed weekly through week 15 and every third week thereafter through week 24 post-HCT. Patients who developed clinically significant CMV infection (CS-CMVi; CMV viremia requiring preemptive therapy or CMV disease) discontinued the study drug and began anti-CMV treatment. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with CS-CMVi through week 24 post-HCT; patients who discontinued the trial or with missing data were imputed as primary endpoint events. Between August 2013 and June 2015, 452 patients were randomized at a median of 15 days after HCT and received study drug. The proportion of patients who developed CS-CMVi or were imputed as having a primary endpoint event through week 24 was similar between brincidofovir-treated patients and placebo recipients (155 of 303 [51.2%] versus 78 of 149 [52.3%]; odds ratio, .95 [95% confidence interval, .64 to 1.41]; <italic>P</italic> = .805); fewer brincidofovir recipients developed CMV viremia through week 14 compared with placebo recipients (41.6%; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). Serious adverse events were more frequent among brincidofovir recipients (57.1% versus 37.6%), driven by acute graft-versus-host disease (32.3% versus 6.0%) and diarrhea (6.9% versus 2.7%). Week 24 all-cause mortality was 15.5% among brincidofovir recipients and 10.1% among placebo recipients. Brincidofovir did not reduce CS-CMVi by week 24 post-HCT and was associated with gastrointestinal toxicity.</p>

              <p id="P4">Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Advances in molecular detection for CMV reactivation and preemptive antiviral therapy have reduced CMV disease [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], yet CMV seropositivity [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>–<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and early CMV reactivation remain associated with increased all-cause mortality after allogeneic HCT [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p>
              <p id="P5">Ganciclovir and its orally bioavailable prodrug valganciclovir remain the most commonly used drugs for preemptive therapy [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]; however, ganciclovir use in CMV prophylaxis in HCT recipients has demonstrated no overall benefit over placebo due to myelosuppression and associated bacterial and fungal infections [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Therefore, prophylaxis with novel antiviral agents with acceptable safety profiles that could be started early after HCT may improve CMV-related outcomes [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p>
              <p id="P6">Brincidofovir (CMX001) is an orally bioavailable lipid conjugate of cidofovir with demonstrated antiviral activity <italic>in vitro</italic> and in animal models against CMV [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>–<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and other double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) viruses, including adenoviruses [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], herpesviruses [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], orthopoxviruses [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>–<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], and polyomaviruses [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>–<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Brincidofovir has a long half-life [<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and, unlike cidofovir, is not nephrotoxic because it is neither a substrate of organic ion transporter 1 nor concentrated in the renal proximal tubules [<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>–<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. These characteristics make brincidofovir an attractive candidate for antiviral prophylaxis for allogeneic HCT recipients, who are frequently affected by multiple viral infections [<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p>
              <p id="P7">In a phase 2 dose-ranging trial for CMV prevention in allogeneic HCT recipients, brincidofovir 100 mg twice weekly (BIW) significantly reduced CMV events when started after engraftment through week 13 post-HCT compared with placebo [<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Dose-limiting toxicity occurred in the brincidofovir 200 mg BIW dose cohort. This cohort experienced severe diarrhea and other gastrointestinal adverse events (AEs), including gastrointestinal acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). These findings prompted the implementation of a safety monitoring and management plan (SMMP) for the brincidofovir 100 mg BIW cohort [<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].

Of these, 110 patients were excluded, primarily due to detectable CMV DNA during screening (79 patients [71.8%]). Among the 458 randomized patients, 6 patients (4 in the brincidofovir arm and 2 in the placebo arm) were never dosed, and 5 discontinued trial participation. Death (61 patients [13.5%]) and withdrawal of consent (34 patients [7.5%]) were the most common reasons for discontinuing study participation through week 24. Deviations from eligibility criteria were documented in 17 treated patients (3.8%); 4 patients had detectable CMV DNA before randomization, 3 patients began the study drug at &gt;28 days post-transplantation, 3 patients enrolled based on local laboratory results, 2 patients received anti-CMV medications post-HCT, 2 patients underwent CMV screening &gt;5 days before randomization, 2 patients weighed &gt;120 kg, and 1 patient was not screened for hepatitis C; these patients continued remained in the trial. CMV risk stratification was misclassified at randomization in 14 patients (3.1%); data from these patients were analyzed according to their verified CMV risk.</p>

There was no appreciable relationship between brincidofovir exposure and grade ≥2 alanine aminotransferase elevations.</p>
                <p id="P34">We explored the impact of following the SMMP on 258 brincidofovir-treated patients who experienced any diarrhea (grade ≥1) or gastrointestinal GVHD (stage ≥1) through week 8 post-transplantation on outcomes. A total of 151 patients (58.5%) were managed according to the SMMP, 14 (5.4%) were managed more conservatively than prescribed in the SMMP, and in 93 patients (36.0%), brincidofovir was not interrupted or discontinued per the SMMP, and the patients were treated for GVHD. Both primary endpoint events and all-cause mortality were lower when patients were managed according to the SMMP or more conservatively (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). There were no appreciable differences in brincidofovir AUC<sub>ss</sub> according to SMMP management (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S8</xref>). Results were similar when diarrhea grade 1 was not considered an event.</p>

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p id="P36">In this phase 3 trial, oral brincidofovir dosed at 100 mg BIW through week 14 post-transplantation was not superior to placebo for the prevention of clinically significant CMV infection through week 24 post-HCT. Although antiviral activity against CMV was demonstrated with fewer events of quantifiable CMV viremia and a decreased need for preemptive therapy, brincidofovir treatment led to increased gastrointestinal toxicity, including excess diagnoses and treatment of acute gastrointestinal GVHD. As a result, brincidofovir use was not associated with improved survival or overall fewer clinical diseases caused by other dsDNA viruses.</p>
              <p id="P37">Some differences in design between the SUPPRESS phase 3 and the phase 2 trial (CMX001-201) [<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] may explain the differences in efficacy and safety seen between the 2 studies. First, SUPPRESS allowed preengraftment enrollment, given the absence of dose-dependent brincidofovir myelotoxicity [<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]; the median time to the first dose of study drug was 15 days, compared with 24 days in CMX001-201. The objective was to prevent earlier CMV and other dsDNA virus events, but this resulted in frequent initiation of brincidofovir while patients were still experiencing conditioning regimen-associated mucositis. This likely contributed to synergistic enterotoxicity [<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], especially in patients who underwent myeloablative HCT, and accounts in part for the different outcomes seen according to conditioning regimen (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). Second, the primary endpoint for SUPPRESS was set at week 24 [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and not at the end of treatment (week 14) [<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] to assess for postprophylaxis CMV events [<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. This was important in determining not only postprophylaxis antiviral efficacy and potential issues of antiviral resistance, but also the longer-term consequences of the gastrointestinal toxicity observed. Third, the CMX001-201 endpoint was virologic and not linked to the initiation of preemptive therapy, such that patients who received preemptive therapy but did not have confirmed CMV viremia or disease were not considered to have met the study endpoint in CMX001-201 [<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p>
              <p id="P38">The potential for brincidofovir-associated diarrhea was expected. Diarrhea was a manageable event in the CMX001-201 brincidofovir 100 mg BIW cohort following the SMMP guidance. In that trial, 60% of patients completed brincidofovir treatment at this dose, compared with 54% of patients who received placebo [<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], but completion rates were lower in the present study (38% brincidofovir, 46% placebo). Gastrointestinal events remained the main toxicity for brincidofovir and led to increased diagnosis and treatment of gastrointestinal GVHD. In turn, the more frequent immunosuppressive treatment for presumed grade III acute GVHD with gastrointestinal involvement likely contributed to the trends toward higher all-cause and nonrelapse mortality observed.</p>
              <p id="P39">The use of an independent GAC was planned to address the issue of empirical treatment for gastrointestinal GVHD in patients presenting with diarrhea, but the blinded adjudication of likely or presumptive acute GVHD events was unable to distinguish patients who received brincidofovir from those who received placebo [<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Furthermore, a blinded review of all gastrointestinal biopsy specimens was also unable to distinguish histopathological features between brincidofovir-treated and placebo-treated patients [<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. These observations suggest either that brincidofovir can induce acute GVHD events due to enteral injury or that brincidofovir enterotoxicity can cause histopathological changes that cannot be differentiated from those seen in acute GVHD, analogous to what has been described for mycophenolate-associated gastrointestinal toxicity [<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. A majority of the excess acute GVHD events reported in brincidofovir-treated patients were limited to the gastrointestinal tract, with otherwise a very similar incidence of reported skin GVHD, which suggests that a mechanism of enteric injury followed by an alloreactive effect could be less likely. Histopathological findings suggestive of acute GVHD have been recently reported in an autologous HCT recipient who received brincidofovir for treatment of adenovirus disease [<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. In addition, histopathological changes were attributed to mycophenolate-induced enterotoxicity in a patient who was receiving brincidofovir after kidney transplantation as part of a phase 3 prophylaxis trial [<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] who experienced significant diarrhea that led to endoscopy, but was not receiving mycophenolate treatment (Chimerix, data on file).</p>
              <p id="P40">A slight increase in adjudicated acute GVHD with liver involvement in brincidofovir-treated patients deserves mention. These events were due predominantly to an excessive number of presumptive liver stage 1 and 2 cases, based on elevated serum bilirubin concentration, in a background of diarrhea without biopsy confirmation (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S10</xref>). These cases may represent hyperbilirubinemia caused by brincidofovir rather than acute GVHD. The mechanisms behind these events in the present study are likely multifactorial, but an increased frequency of hyperbilirubinemia events in patients receiving concurrent brincidofovir and cyclosporine suggests a competitive interaction between brincidofovir and bilirubin for liver transport [<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] mediated through OATP1B1/3 [<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], because both brincidofovir and bilirubin are substrates of OATP1B1/3, and cyclosporine is a known inhibitor of both OATPs [<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]</p>
              <p id="P41">We found no evidence of an increased risk of nephrotoxicity or myelotoxicity in the brincidofovir-treated patients compared with placebo patients, confirming findings from earlier studies [<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p>
              <p id="P42">Differences in adherence to the SMMP’s recommended treatment interruptions also influenced outcomes. Treatment of brincidofovir-related diarrhea with systemic glucocorticoids in the setting of a presumptive diagnosis of acute gastrointestinal GVHD while maintaining the study drug resulted in continued or worsening diarrhea. In several instances, this was interpreted as refractory GVHD, with subsequent increases in immunosuppression with the addition of second- and third-line therapies. The blinded study, considered necessary even in diseases with objective outcome measures, including CMV viremia, certainly contributed to an increased rate of clinical diagnoses of gastrointestinal GVHD in this complex patient population. This experience also emphasizes the need to carefully evaluate HCT recipients for the etiology of AEs before increasing the doses of immunosuppressive therapy.</p>
              <p id="P43">Although the efficacy of oral brincidofovir prophylaxis for 10 to 14 weeks in adults early after allogeneic HCT was compromised by gastrointestinal toxicity in this trial, the experience in the treatment of adenovirus disease, especially in children, has been promising [<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>–<xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. This may be due to various factors, including starting brincidofovir treatment later post-HCT, after acute conditioning-related gastrointestinal toxicities have resolved, or possibly age-related differences in the gastrointestinal tracts of adults and children [<xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. In any case, the development of an i.v. formulation of brincidofovir [<xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] that does not result in gastrointestinal accumulation [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] but retains the drug’s spectrum, antiviral activity, and lack of nephrotoxicity or myelotoxicity could provide a more effective and safer prevention and treatment of CMV and the multiple dsDNA viruses that frequently affect allogeneic HCT recipients.</p>
