                <p id="Par1">The potential synergistic effects of combining cannabinoids and opioids for analgesia has received considerable attention. No studies to date have evaluated this combination in patients with chronic pain. The present study aimed to evaluate the combined analgesic and drug effects of oral opioid (hydromorphone) and delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (dronabinol), as well as their effects on physical and cognitive functioning, and human abuse potential (HAP) outcomes among individuals with knee osteoarthritis (KOA). This was a within-subject, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study. Participants (<italic>N</italic> = 37; 65% women; mean age = 62) diagnosed with knee osteoarthritis of ≥3/10 average pain intensity were included. Participants received (1) placebo-placebo, (2) hydromorphone (4 mg)-placebo; (3) dronabinol (10 mg)-placebo, and (4) hydromorphone (4 mg)-dronabinol (10 mg). Clinical and experimentally-induced pain, physical and cognitive function, subjective drug effects, HAP, adverse events, and pharmacokinetics were evaluated. No significant analgesic effects were observed for clinical pain severity or physical functioning across all drug conditions. Little enhancement of hydromorphone analgesia by dronabinol was observed on evoked pain indices. While subjective drug effects and some HAP ratings were increased in the combined drug condition, these were not significantly increased over the dronabinol alone condition. No serious adverse events were reported; hydromorphone produced more mild adverse events than placebo, but hydromorphone + dronabinol produced more moderate adverse events than both placebo and hydromorphone alone. Only hydromorphone impaired cognitive performance. Consistent with laboratory studies on healthy adults, the present study shows minimal benefit of combining dronabinol (10 mg) and hydromorphone (4 mg) for analgesia and improving physical functioning in adults with KOA.</p>

              <p id="Par3">Evidence for the cannabinoid-opioid synergistic effects in human laboratory studies remains tenuous, however [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Most human laboratory studies have enrolled healthy adults and found limited opioid analgesic effects and/or no significant enhancement of analgesia following THC/opioid co-administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Although some studies, including our previous Phase II clinical trial with healthy adults, have reported limited THC enhancement of opioid effects, enhancement was only observed in low THC dose conditions (e.g., dronabinol 2.5 mg), and the cannabinoid-opioid combinations also increased human abuse potential (HAP) ratings, dysphoric effects, and adverse events, suggesting limited clinical utility for analgesia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. A limitation of existing studies is their focus on healthy adults rather than persons with chronic pain, thus limiting our nascent understanding of the potential benefits of cannabinoid-opioid combinations in clinical populations. Moreover, a recent meta-analysis revealed significant variability in analgesic efficacy of cannabinoids in laboratory with healthy adults vs. observational studies with adults with chronic pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Finally, despite accumulating evidence that sex can moderate the efficacy of cannabinoid-based analgesia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], prior studies did not examine potential sex (assigned at birth) differences.</p>
              <p id="Par4">The present study rigorously evaluated the combined effects of <italic>dronabinol</italic> (oral synthetic THC suspended in sesame oil), a partial agonist at the cannabinoid 1 and 2 receptors, and <italic>hydromorphone</italic>, a prototypic opioid agonist at the mu-opioid receptor, among individuals with knee osteoarthritis (KOA). KOA is an ideal chronic pain condition in which to examine the combined effects of cannabinoid and opioid in a laboratory study for a number of reasons. KOA is a leading cause of chronic pain and disability worldwide, and prevalence is expected to sharply rise due to the increasing population age and rate of obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Patients with KOA have substantial clinical pain and poor physical functioning, and commonly used treatments (e.g., non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, opioids) have limited benefits and long-term risks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par5">Using a within-subject, double-blinded, randomized, and placebo-controlled design, the present study examined the independent and combined effects of dronabinol and hydromorphone on experimentally-induced acute and chronic pain models, clinical pain, physical and cognitive functioning, HAP ratings, and adverse events. A subset of participants provided blood samples that were analyzed for pharmacokinetic profiles, and the potential moderating effects of sex across outcomes were explored. To our knowledge, this is the first behavioral pharmacology study to examine the drug effect profile and analgesic response, as well as physical and cognitive functioning following co-administration of oral THC with an opioid in a clinical chronic pain sample.</p>

Potential participants completed a phone and in-person screening, during which they provided a urine sample that was tested for recent drug exposure and pregnancy (for premenopausal females) and were excluded if they reported past month opioid exposure. Eligibility was determined based on medical history and physical including ECG, hepatic, hematologic, and chemistry functioning (see Online Supplement Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). A knee x-ray was conducted to determine Kellgren–Lawrence score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] which is a five-point ordinal scale (from none [0] to severe [4]) grading schema for classifying the severity of KOA. Participants also completed self-report measures and were introduced to quantitative sensory testing (QST) during screening.

                  <p id="Par10">All thermal and pressure pain testing was conducted over two trials to obtain consistent readings; trial results were averaged for each measure. <bold>Thermal pain</bold>: To assess thermal threshold and tolerance, thermal stimulation via thermode (Medoc TSA II, Israel) was applied gradually from a pre-set baseline (31 °C) at a rate of. 5 °C/s (i.e., ascending method of limits paradigm). To identify thermal threshold, participants were asked to indicate when the task “first feels painful” and press a button to terminate the task. Thermal tolerance was assessed over two identical trials where the participant indicated that the perceived pain was intolerable. <bold>Pressure pain</bold>: A pressure algometer (Somedic; Sweden) delivered steady, constant pressure to the upper trapezius muscle until the maximum limit of 1200 kPa was reached or the participant indicated pain. <bold>Temporal summation</bold>: Repetitive thermal and punctuate stimuli were delivered to assess temporal summation. To assess thermal temporal summation, the thermode delivered 10 heat pulses (0.5-s each) at 49 °C and 51 °C at inter-pulse intervals of 2.5 s. After each pulse, participants rated the sensation on a 0–100 (‘no sensation’ to ‘intolerable pain’) scale. Thermal temporal summation is reported as the average of the initial pain rating minus the maximum pain rating for each temperature. Mechanical temporal summation was determined by applying weighted pinprick stimulators with fixed stimulus intensities to a flat contact area of 0.2 mm diameter on the ventral forearm. Participants verbally indicated their pain (0–100) following a single stimulus with a force of 256 mN or 512 mN. Thereafter, participants indicated their peak pain over a 10-stimulus train that lasted 10-s. Mechanical temporal summation scores were calculated by taking the average of two wind-up ratios that were determined by adding 1 (to avoid dividing by 0) to each rating for both probe weights and dividing the peak pain reported following the train of ten stimuli by the initial rating from a single stimulus. <bold>Cold pressor tasks</bold>: Participants were asked to rate their pain every 30-s while their hand was submerged in a circulating cold-water bath (5 °C). Both cold pain threshold (time to first pain) and tolerance (time to hand withdrawal) were also assessed. The cold pressor was then repeated for 20 s followed by concurrent randomly ordered pressure pain or mechanical temporal summation tasks in order to assess conditioned pain modulation. According to task, initial pressure pain threshold/peak mechanical temporal summation pain were subtracted from those values obtained during the combined cold pressor task. <bold>After sensation</bold>: Lingering pain 15-s following thermal and mechanical temporal summation and cold pressor was assessed.</p>

Once the capsaicin cream was removed, 45 °C thermal stimulation was applied to the affected site for 5 min coupled with pain ratings (0–100) every minute. Then, the affected area was assessed for flare, secondary hyperalgesia, and mechanical temporal summation. <bold>Rekindling</bold>: At each QST assessment, the thermode at 45 °C heated the treatment site for 5 min, thereafter, flare, secondary hyperalgesia, thermal threshold and mechanical temporal summation were reassessed.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par34">The present study rigorously and comprehensively evaluated the effects of co-administering dronabinol (10 mg) and hydromorphone (4 mg) on evoked and clinical pain, self-reported drug effects, HAP metrics, physical and cognitive functioning, and AEs in patients with chronic pain. Overall, our findings reveal limited clinical benefits, and suggest that co-administering dronabinol (10 mg) with hydromorphone (4 mg) to this clinical population demonstrated a slightly enhanced risk for use along with elevated risk for AEs in the combined condition. These findings were consistent across sexes (see online supplement Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5</xref> for each outcome’s peak mean and standard deviation separated by sex).</p>
              <p id="Par35">We found that although hydromorphone + dronabinol was associated with significant analgesia on several QST outcomes, it was not different than hydromorphone by itself, indicating no added benefit of the combination at the doses tested. We also found that none of the drug conditions significantly changed ratings of clinical pain severity. Overall, these findings are consistent with previous laboratory studies with healthy adults demonstrating limited additive benefit of combined cannabinoids and opioids on analgesia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, there remain significant differences in findings observed in human vs. preclinical/animal models. Findings from preclinical models show overall robust enhancements of opioids effects by a wide-range of cannabinoids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The reason for these discrepancies is vastly unknown, but may be attributable to differences in the cannabinoids being administered in preclinical versus human studies. For instance, none of the human studies employed weight-based cannabinoid dosing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In addition, as noted in our recent systematic review on analgesic effects of cannabis/cannabinoids, some additional factors such as, different cannabinoid compounds, routes of administration, chronicity of dosing, and cannabis use history may contribute to the variability in cannabinoids’ analgesic effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par36">To our knowledge, the present study is the first to evaluate the individual and combined effects of dronabinol and hydromorphone on clinically-relevant standardized physical testing measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. None of the drug conditions improved or diminished these outcomes. This finding may be related to the null effects observed for clinical pain severity, as knee pain can directly impact performance on these physical functioning tests [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Nevertheless, these data undermine support for using dronabinol and/or hydromorphone for improving physical functioning in patients with KOA at the tested doses. However, it is uncertain whether these null results can be generalized to other chronic pain conditions, or to persons for whom these drugs do reduce clinical pain severity.</p>
              <p id="Par37">Relative to hydromorphone, dronabinol significantly increased the percent of participants who rated feeling High ≥ 60, a cutoff discussed by HAP experts as a metric of future risk. This value is higher than what was observed in prior studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and provides initial evidence that this dose could engender use in the tested population. However, this concern is tempered by the lack of effect on other HAP ratings, including interest in taking medications again, assigned dollar value, or ratings of “Like the Way I Feel”, combined with elevated Bad Effects and Nausea ratings. The negative ratings produced by these medications are also reflected in the AE trends, wherein hydromorphone + dronabinol produced the highest rate of moderate AEs. Interestingly, only the hydromorphone condition decremented cognitive performance, and these results replicate our prior findings with healthy adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Ultimately, these data mirror prior studies that found no overarching benefit, and slightly enhanced risk of side effects or future use when dronabinol was combined with hydromorphone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Longer-term follow-up with those who co-use these drugs may shed further light on understanding their relative HAP and side effects of co-use.</p>
              <p id="Par38">Despite several strengths, the present study had a number of limitations. First, only a single dose of hydromorphone and dronabinol was used, precluding dose-dependent examinations. A more parametric, dose-dependent design was considered but rejected due to concerns about feasibility of completing numerous sessions given that participants were older adults with chronic pain. In lieu of that design, the study assessed the highest cannabinoid dose tested by our prior research to provide maximal opportunity to detect the presence of any effect (whereas it would be more challenging to infer whether lack of effect smaller doses represented true lack of effect or a dose-related issue). The more definitive test for this line of research would be a full dose-dependent evaluation. In addition, the average participant age was &gt;60 years old, which has been associated with changes in drug metabolism that may have impacted results. Third, use of an oral synthetic THC formulation may limit the data generalizability. Many advocates for the synergistic properties of cannabis prefer different routes of administration (e.g., inhalation) arguing that the whole, natural cannabis flower produces different effects than THC alone and could interact with opioids or produce analgesia in ways we do not yet fully understand. Fourth, although necessary for safety purposes, the hydromorphone condition was unrandomized which may have introduced order effects. Fifth, a longer walking test (6-min vs. 2-min) may have increased clinical pain levels and revealed more nuances in physical performance, but was shortened due to participant burden. Lastly, we focused on the acute effects of dronabinol and hydromorphone co-administration, and thus we cannot inform the long-term use of these two drugs on clinical outcomes, side effects, and HAP.</p>

              <p id="Par39">To our knowledge, this is the only laboratory study to examine the independent and combined effects of doses of dronabinol (10 mg) and hydromorphone (4 mg) that are within the range that can be prescribed therapeutically on a comprehensive array of clinically-relevant outcomes in individuals with chronic pain. These data extend our prior research with healthy adults by providing further evidence that combining dronabinol with hydromorphone for analgesia and physical function yields little benefit in a clinical cohort. The doses tested for dronabinol did not improve hydromorphone’s analgesic profile but did increase ratings of High, as well as negative side effects, and AEs. Finally, any significant analgesic effect observed following dronabinol + hydromorphone appeared to be driven by the hydromorphone, negating dronabinol enhancement of analgesia at the dose tested.</p>
