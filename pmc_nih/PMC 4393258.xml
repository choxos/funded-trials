              <abstract>
                <p>Bone metastasis occurs for men with advanced prostate cancer which promotes osseous growth and destruction driven by alterations in osteoblast and osteoclast homeostasis. Patients can experience pain, spontaneous fractures and morbidity eroding overall quality of life. The complex and dynamic cellular interactions within the bone microenvironment limit current treatment options thus prostate to bone metastases remains incurable. This study uses voxel-based analysis of diffusion-weighted MRI and CT scans to simultaneously evaluate temporal changes in normal bone homeostasis along with prostate bone metatastsis to deliver an improved understanding of the spatiotemporal local microenvironment. Dynamic tumor-stromal interactions were assessed during treatment in mouse models along with a pilot prospective clinical trial with metastatic hormone sensitive and castration resistant prostate cancer patients with bone metastases. Longitudinal changes in tumor and bone imaging metrics during delivery of therapy were quantified. Studies revealed that voxel-based parametric response maps (PRM) of DW-MRI and CT scans could be used to quantify and spatially visualize dynamic changes during prostate tumor growth and in response to treatment thereby distinguishing patients with stable disease from those with progressive disease (p&lt;0.05). These studies suggest that PRM imaging biomarkers are useful for detection of the impact of prostate tumor-stromal responses to therapies thus demonstrating the potential of multi-modal PRM image-based biomarkers as a novel means for assessing dynamic alterations associated with metastatic prostate cancer. These results establish an integrated and clinically translatable approach which can be readily implemented for improving the clinical management of patients with metastatic bone disease.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Bone metastasis is the hallmark of prostate cancer and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality [<xref rid="pone.0123877.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0123877.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. It is found in over 90% of men with castration-resistant disease [<xref rid="pone.0123877.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0123877.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and in most patients postmortem [<xref rid="pone.0123877.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0123877.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Clinical response criteria used for assessment of treatment efficacy are based upon changes in the anatomical size of the tumor. Recent changes in these criteria have been detailed as part of the updated Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) which consider lytic or mixed lytic-blastic bone metastases with soft tissue masses greater than 1 cm to be measurable disease, but blastic bone lesions are still considered non-measurable [<xref rid="pone.0123877.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The use of imaging in the clinical management of bone metastasis has traditionally relied predominantely on bone scintigraphy using <sup>99m</sup>Tc-methyl diphosphonate [<xref rid="pone.0123877.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0123877.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Plain film radiographs, MRI and more recently PET [<xref rid="pone.0123877.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0123877.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] have been used adjunctly. While assessment in the response of primary or metastatic cancers within the skeletal system has been a longstanding problem, alternative strategies including functional and molecular imaging approaches are being pursued [<xref rid="pone.0123877.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0123877.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, traditional imaging relies upon either visual intrepretation of acquired scans by a musculoskeletal radiologist or by whole volume quantification of mean values of voxels contained within a region of interest (i.e. a tumor). Furthermore, integration of the information available from multimodal images on a voxel-by-voxel basis to assess the spatiotemporal effects of tumor growth and response to therapy has not been attempted to date.</p>
              <p>Diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) has been reported as a tool for assessing cancer response to therapy as it is able to quantify the random (i.e., Brownian) motion of water molecules within tissue [<xref rid="pone.0123877.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0123877.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Water diffusion values are reduced in the presence of cellular membranes which impede the motion of water molecules. Effective treatments result in a loss in the number of tumor cells thus reducing restrictive barriers and allowing for more rapid water mobility (i.e., diffusion). DW-MRI is able to capture these subtle changes by quantifying water mobility as the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in tumors. The application of DW-MRI for tumor treatment response assessment was initially described using a 9L glioma model [<xref rid="pone.0123877.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and was successfully extended in preclinical studies evaluating the response to a variety of anticancer interventions [<xref rid="pone.0123877.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0123877.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Further evolution in image post-processing of tumor ADC values was undertaken for assessing treatment response through the development of a voxel-by-voxel algorithm to account for intratumor heterogeneity, an approach termed the functional diffusion map (fDM) [<xref rid="pone.0123877.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0123877.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The fDM approach tracked changes in the ADC values of individual tumor voxels over time in patients with primary malignant brain tumors as well as a brain tumor model where the amount of fDM-detected change in diffusion values was shown to correlate with overall survival [<xref rid="pone.0123877.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0123877.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p>
              <p>More recently, successful use of DW-MRI and the fDM metric for providing early indication of treatment response in preclinical models as well as patients diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer to the bone have been reported [<xref rid="pone.0123877.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0123877.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0123877.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Furthermore, extension of the voxel-based image analysis approach was significantly advanced by showing that it could be generally applied to a variety of imaging modalities including perfusion MR, PET and CT and was re-termed the parametric response map (PRM) [<xref rid="pone.0123877.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0123877.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In particular, application of PRM analysis to CT images obtained from a rat model of osteoporosis revealed that this approach could provide the ability to spatially track and quantify changes in bone mineral density over time [<xref rid="pone.0123877.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p>
              <p>In this present study we investigated the use of multimodal PRM imaging biomarkers for their ability to quantify dynamically changing tumor-host interactions by monitoring tumor treatment response (PRM<sub>ADC</sub>) along with changes in bone density (PRM<sub>CT</sub>) using <italic>in vivo</italic> mouse models and a pilot clinical trial involving patients with prostate cancer and bone metastasis. The mouse studies provided an opportunity to evaluate the impact of osteolytic and osteoblastic tumor models on the imaging metrics along with the effect of therapeutic intervention and results revealed that the multimodal approach could detect spatiotemporal tumor and bone alterations. Furthermore, results from the clinical study provide initial results showing that this approach can be successfully translated into the clinical setting allowing for multimodal disease monitoring of dynamic bone microenvironmental alterations associated with metastatic prostate cancer to the bone. Integration of the PRM imaging results into future clinical workflow will impact our ability to assess putative therapies in clinical trials as well as in routine patient management.</p>

                <p>The therapeutic effects of docetaxel and ionizing radiation (IR) were evaluated in an intra-tibial model of prostate cancer metastasis to the bone using DW-MRI. Androgen independent human prostate cancer [<xref rid="pone.0123877.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection and grown in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum.</p>
                <p>All studies involving the use of mouse protocols were approved by The University of Michigan Committee on Use and Care of Animals. Male severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice were included in the study at 4–6 weeks of age. Mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg). A Hamilton syringe with a 28-gauge needle was inserted in the middle of the patella ligament through the tibial crest epiphysis and growth plate. To prevent pain, Carprofen (5mg/kg) was injected subcutaneously. PC3 cells (5x10<sup>5</sup>) suspended in 10µl of media were injected into the trabecular bone of the tibial metaphysis. Sham surgeries were performed on the left leg using an identical procedure by injecting media only.</p>
                <p>When tumor volumes reached 7 to 15 mm<sup>3</sup>, as determined by MRI, animals were entered into one of four treatment groups: docetaxel (n = 6), IR (n = 6), docetaxel + IR (n = 6), or vehicle control (n = 8). Docetaxel treatment at a dose of 20 mg/kg in 10% DMSO was administered weekly via intraperitoneal injection for three weeks. The effect of IR on PC3 tumors was evaluated alone and in combination with docetaxel at a dose of 2 Gy/day 5 times per week for two weeks using an IC-320 Specimen Irradiation System. For combination therapy, animals were first treated with docetaxel followed by IR 4 hours later.</p>
                <p>MRI scans were acquired on days 0, 1, 4, 7, 11, 14, and then weekly until tumors surpassed a pre-defined terminal volume increase of 400% from initial volume. Imaging was performed using a 9.4T Agilent system. DW-MR was accomplished using a spin-echo sequence, with a navigator echo and gradient waveforms sensitive to isotropic diffusion [<xref rid="pone.0123877.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] as previously described.</p>

Cells were maintained by propagation as subcutaneous xenografts in SCID mice until needed for implantation [<xref rid="pone.0123877.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Immediately prior to cell implantation, LAPC-9 tissue was harvested and treated with collagenase to facilitate cell implantation into male SCID mice.

                <p>DW-MR scans were acquired weekly until the end of the study as described in Study 1. Changes in tumor volume and ADC were monitored to evaluate tumor treatment response. Bone response was evaluated using weekly µCT imaging to detect changes in mineral density in the vicinity of the tumor.</p>

                <p>Trabecular bone tumors underwent treatment initiation within 4 weeks post-cell implantation. Tumor volumes of control animals showed continual growth throughout the study until an endpoint of +400% (i.e., 5 times the initial volume) was reached (<xref rid="pone.0123877.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). Animals treated with IR and docetaxel exhibited significant growth delays of about 30 and 40 days, respectively. Further enhancement of treatment efficacy was found in the combination therapy group with an extended growth delay of 60 days (<xref rid="pone.0123877.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>).</p>

                <p>DW-MRI was also evaluated for its ability to detect early response by evaluating the changes in tumor water diffusion values during the first week of therapy. As shown in Fig <xref rid="pone.0123877.g002" ref-type="fig">2B</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0123877.g002" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>, tumors were analyzed using both mean tumor ADC as well as the PRM voxel-based approach. Analysis of tumor ADC changes using PRM revealed a significant shift in the distribution of tumor voxels to higher ADC values (red voxels) moving above the 95% cutoff threshold which served as the biomarker metric of response. The PRM color overlay revealed heterogeneous changes in ADC values at 7 days post-treatment initiation within an individual tumor. PRM scatter plots (2C) were generated by plotting ADC values from each voxel on day 7 (y-axis) against day 0. The red line represents equality between measurements whereas the black lines represent the 95% confidence interval cutoff which was determined to be ±0.32x10<sup>-3</sup> mm<sup>2</sup>/s. Control tumors exhibited little change in ADC over the first 7-day period post-treatment, as evidenced in the representative overlay (<xref rid="pone.0123877.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>) by majority of green voxels. Conversely, representative overlays showing docetaxel and IR-treated animals demonstrate the substantial fraction of voxels that shifted to higher values at day 7 due to an increase in tumor ADC values. Animals treated with a combination of docetaxel and IR presented an even greater change in ADC than either treatment alone.</p>
                <p>Changes in mean tumor ADC for each group showed similar magnitudes of response compared to PRM<sub>ADC</sub> (Fig <xref rid="pone.0123877.g002" ref-type="fig">2B</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0123877.g002" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>). The mono-therapy groups were both found to have an approximate 10–12% increase in mean tumor ADC values at 7 days post-treatment initiation whereas the combined treatment group exhibited a 25% increase. The percent change in mean ADC as well as the PRM<sub>ADC+</sub> values of the docetaxel, IR and combined treatment groups were all statistically different from the control group at day 7 (p&lt;0.01).</p>

                <title>PRM<sub>CT</sub> Assessment of Protective Bone Treatment from Metastatic Prostate Cancer</title>
                <p>PRM was applied to CT images to monitor bone tissue density changes during early protective treatment of PC3 tumors with ZA and compared to untreated animals soon after implantation of tumor cells. ZA was used as a treatment to evaluate the ability of PRM<sub>CT</sub> to detect the effects of a bisphosphonate drug on slowing down bone resorption which should allow for bone-forming cells the time needed to rebuild normal bone through bone remodeling. As shown in <xref rid="pone.0123877.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>, PC3 implantations treated with ZA revealed a bone-protective effect, with expedited healing of the surgical bone wound and progressive increases in overall bone density. MRI tumor volumes along with ADC values were quantified at day 21 post-treatment-initiation which revealed retardation of tumor growth in ZA-treated animals as compared to control animals (<xref rid="pone.0123877.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>). Longitudinal CT scans on control and ZA-treated animals allowed for voxel-based PRM analysis to be accomplished for assessment of bone mineral changes due to the osteolytic processes associated with a growing PC3 tumor along with bone changes due to ZA intervention. Shown in <xref rid="pone.0123877.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref> are representative images for a control (top panels) and ZA-treated (bottom panels) mouse showing (from top to bottom) an isosurface, CT slice, PRM overlay, and PRM scatterplots from pre-treatment to 21 days post-treatment. The red regions represent voxels of increased bone mineral density versus loss of bone density depicted by blue voxels.

The PRM<sub>HU-</sub> bar plot (<xref rid="pone.0123877.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>) showed minimal loss of bone occurred over time in the ZA-treated group as compared to progressively increasing bone loss in control PC3 implanted animals.</p>

                <p>Docetaxel-treated LAPC-9 tumors were also evaluated against controls using PRM. The LAPC-9 tumor has been shown to have a significant osteoblastic effect when implanted in mice and PRM analysis revealed that there was in fact a slower and mixed PRM<sub>HU</sub> response as compared to PC3 with docetaxel treatment. As shown in <xref rid="pone.0123877.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>, plots of changes in tumor volume (solid line) and ADC (dashed line) revealed the effects of docetaxel-treatment on LAPC-9 as a decrease in tumor volume was associated with an early and increasing change in tumor ADC values.

PRM<sub>HU</sub> analysis for this comparison was performed using a µCT image acquired the day of implantation as the baseline, compared to the previous studies which used the day that treatments were initiated (pre-treatment) as baseline. In <xref rid="pone.0123877.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>, PRM<sub>HU+</sub> (gain of bone density) over time appeared to be greater in animals with PC3 tumors as compared to animals with LAPC-9 tumors.

In contrast, clear differences in the effects of the two tumor lines on bone density loss is shown in <xref rid="pone.0123877.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref> wherein PRM<sub>HU-</sub> values which reflect bone loss was significantly larger for untreated PC3 tumors versus animals with LAPC-9 tumors.</p>

                <title>Clinical PRM<sub>ADC/HU</sub> Assessment of Metastatic Prostate Cancer Treatment Response</title>
                <p>In the pilot clinical trial, patients with CRPC underwent both DW-MRI and CT scanning protocols. Of the 12 patients 8 were clinically determined to have stable disease (SD) and 4 to have disease progression (PD) by standard criteria at first disease assessment. DW-MRI PRM<sub>ADC</sub> measurements were monitored per individual lesion on all 12 patients, resulting in 18 lesions for the SD group and 7 for the PD group. For CT-based PRM<sub>HU</sub> measurements, 5 patients analyzed were SD (12 lesions) and 4 patients were PD (7 lesions). Representative PRM color overlays are presented in <xref rid="pone.0123877.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref> showing results for a SD patient (top) versus a PD patient (bottom) for PRM<sub>HU</sub> (left) and PRM<sub>ADC</sub> (right). In these panels, blue represents regions of decreased value, red increased value, and green statistically unchanged value. Shown in <xref rid="pone.0123877.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref> is a bar plot summarizing the imaging findings for patients with prostate cancer to the bone post-therapy. Follow-up DW-MR scans were obtained on average at 2.2±0.1 and 2.1±0.1 weeks’ post-therapy initiation for patients with stable disease (SD) and progressive disease (PD), respectively, and CT scans were obtained on average at 9.6±1.1 and 14.5±2.1 weeks post-therapy initiation for the SD and PD patient groups, respectively. Significant differences between SD and PD groups were found in both PRM<sub>HU-</sub> and PRM<sub>ADC+</sub>. Early increases in tumor ADC quantified by PRM<sub>ADC</sub> at 2 weeks post-treatment were positively correlated to treatment response based upon changes in PSA levels. Patients with clinically determined stable disease generally had a significantly greater volume fraction of their tumor with increased ADC values (17.2±3.9%) versus patients which were subsequently determined to have progressive disease (7.1±1.4%). Tumor-regional PRM<sub>HU-</sub> volumes quantified by PRM<sub>CT</sub> at approximately 9–12 weeks post-treatment were positively correlated to treatment response based upon changes in PSA levels. Patients with stable disease also generally had a significantly greater volume fraction of their tumor-regional VOI with reduced attenuation (13.2±4.2%) versus patients with progressive disease (2.5±0.6%).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Skeletal involvement remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with prostate cancer. Bone scintigraphy with <sup>99m</sup>Tc-labelled bisphosphonates is widely used to stage patients with bone metastasis [<xref rid="pone.0123877.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The ability to optimize patient management in this population has been limited by difficulties in assessing response in bone metastasis based on bone scan imaging [<xref rid="pone.0123877.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Quantification of treatment response of osseous lesions can be complicated by an inability to delineate accurate tumor dimensions due to a dynamic remodeling process occurring between osteoclasts and osteoblasts in an attempt to maintain bone homeostasis. Moreover, an increase in <sup>99m</sup>Tc-labelled bisphosphonates by metastatic lesions may occur after initiation of systemic hormone or chemotherapy and is refered to as the flare phenomenon [<xref rid="pone.0123877.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. This phenomenon occurs due to bone remodeling in a skeletal metastasis as disregulation of processes involved with homeostasis can occur due to the presence of osteolytic, osteoblastic or mixed lesions contributing to an increased difficulty of image intrepretation.</p>
              <p>The overall goal of this research study was to evaluate the voxel-based PRM biomarker for quantification of multi-modal images to assess the pathology and treatment effects of multiple tissues including tumor and stroma in the context of metastatic prostate cancer to the bone. Pathological correlation of loss of tumor cell density with increasing ADC values by DW-MR as well as loss of bone mineral density with decreasing in HU values in CT scans have been previously reported by our group [<xref rid="pone.0123877.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0123877.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Complex interactions between prostate cancer tumor cells and the host microenvironment and therapies targeting osseous metastases are dynamically maintained through a series of signaling pathways. The skeleton is remodeled continually through simultaneous resorption and formation of new bone. Significant effects on bone metabolism can be induced due to delivery of cancer treatments even in the local absence of a bone lesion known as cancer treatment-induced bone loss [<xref rid="pone.0123877.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. As the skeleton is the most common organ affected by metastatic cancer along with the site that produces the greatest patient morbidity, development of improved multi-modal imaging approaches which can provide for assessment of both the tumor and bone integrity may provide for new advances in the management of this patient population.</p>
              <p>The objective of this study was to evaluate DW-MRI and CT as imaging biomarkers for quantification of growth progression and treatment response associated with changes in tumor cellularity (DW-MRI) and bone density (CT), respectively in metastatic cancer to the bone. We explored the capabilities of PRM voxel-based analysis of MRI and CT images to quantify and display changes in both tumor tissue and the bone stromal compartment in response to metastasis and treatment intervention. The hypothesis was that PRM may be useful for analyzing DW-MRI scans to provide for an early response biomarker and similiarly that PRM analysis of CT scans would provide insights on the impact of the tumor involvement and treatment on the stromal compartment.</p>
              <p>Docetaxel plus prednisone is the standard first-line chemotherapy for patients with CRPC at time of study conduct. The study also allowed non-standard systemic therapy that has had reported efficacy in this disease setting. In previous work by our group [<xref rid="pone.0123877.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], docetaxel therapy alone was shown to elicit a significant increase in ADC values for PC3 tumors. In this present study, MRI-determined PC3 tumor volumes showed that treatment with IR or docetaxel alone were both very effective in producing an overall growth delay but that the combination of the two interventions was much more effective than single agent therapies (<xref rid="pone.0123877.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). The PRM<sub>ADC</sub> biomarker revealed that at day 7 post-treatment, a significant increase in tumor ADC values had occurred in the single therapy groups which were also found to be even higher in the combination treatment group (<xref rid="pone.0123877.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>). Moreover, the data presented herein reveals that DW-MRI is capable of detecting early loss in tumor cellular density due to IR, docetaxel and radiochemotherapy in this bone metastasis model and that PRM analysis appeared to provide additional sensitivity for the combination therapy group over a simple histogram analysis (<xref rid="pone.0123877.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>). The observed correlation of the magnitude of PRM<sub>ADC</sub> changes as a quantitative imaging biomarker with outcome/tumor response in the setting of assessing therapeutic combinations may provide for improved screening opportunities in pre-clinical testing.</p>
              <p>In this study, we also evaluated the ability to use PRM analysis of longitudinal CT scans to assess tumor-stromal interactions in bone metastasis models. Net loss of bone density was readily observed which increased over time in untreated PC3 animals. PC3 cells were used as they are known to generate an androgen independent osteolytic response [<xref rid="pone.0123877.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0123877.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. PRM<sub>HU</sub> analysis revealed that this approach could readily detect spatially and time-dependent loss of bone mineral density in this model (<xref rid="pone.0123877.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>) which was inhibited using anti-resorptive therapy (zoledronic acid). While the use of bisphosphonate treatment is considered standard of care for patient with metastic bone involvement, the mechanisms are not fully understood and the development of the PRM biomarkers allowing for simultaneous interrogation of the impact of these treatments on the tumor and stroma open up potentially new approches for obtaining information to further our understanding of the underlying dynamic changes which occur during therapy.</p>
              <p>In an additional study, we used the LAPC-9 tumor line as it has been shown to have significant osteoblastic activity (<xref rid="pone.0123877.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>). This secondary tumor model was used to further evaluate the overall sensitivity of PRM analysis which revealed a slower and mixed PRM<sub>HU</sub> progression in mice with LAPC-9 tumors as compared to PC3 mice (<xref rid="pone.0123877.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>). Where PC3 tumors resulted in a steady loss of bone seen as increasing PRM<sub>HU-</sub>, LAPC-9 tumors resulted in progressive increases in both PRM<sub>HU+</sub> and PRM<sub>HU-</sub>. In fact, bone loss was found to be significantly higher in untreated PC3 tumors versus animals with LAPC-9 tumors. Significantly higher PRM<sub>HU+</sub> seen in the PC3 tumors was attributed to the need for the remaining healthy bone to compensate for the loss of bone structure near the tumor. The PRM analysis was able to detect and quantify osteolytic versus osteoblastic lesions.</p>
              <p>In the pilot clinical trial, we used both DW-MRI and CT scanning protocols to evaluate their ability to detect changes in patients with CRPC. While patient numbers were relatively small, the volume fraction of the tissue that had a significant decrease in HU value (PRM<sub>HU-</sub>) was found to be greater in the SD group versus the PD patient group. This may indicate bone re-normalization in patients who responded to therapy. Although lesion phenotyping was not performed in this study, regions of the metastases generally seemed to appear sclerotic on CT images, which agree with the hypothesis that a decrease in attenuation in these regions may indicate progress toward a normal state and positive treatment outcome. The use of PRM<sub>HU</sub> in the context of monitoring changes due to bone metastases and treatment intervention appears promising and further studies based upon these novel findings are warranted. Moreover, DW-MRI scans (PRM<sub>ADC</sub>) at 2 weeks post-treatment revealed that early increases in tumor ADC values could be detected which were positively correlated to a subsequent positive clinical response. The fact that patients with SD were shown to have a significantly greater volume fraction of their tumors with increased ADC values versus PD patients also reveals the potential for using PRM<sub>ADC</sub> as an imaging biomarker for early treatment stratification of patients with metastatic prostate cancer to the bone. These results support earlier findings in hormone naïve patients which showed similar increased PRM<sub>ADC</sub> values in therapeutically responsive patients [<xref rid="pone.0123877.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0123877.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Moreover, methodologies for assessment of response in disseminated skeletal metastases using whole body DW-MR have also recently emerged [<xref rid="pone.0123877.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0123877.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>].</p>
              <p>Overall, this study revealed that the PRM imaging biomarker as applied to DW-MRI and CT scans was able to provide for quantitative assessment of tumor-stroma (bone) interactions which were specific to overall treatment outcome with similar findings in both the mouse and human studies. Further development and evaluation of DW-MRI and methods for quantification and visualization of response such as PRM as a noninvasive quantitative imaging biomarker are warranted to more fully explore the clinical impact of this approach.</p>
