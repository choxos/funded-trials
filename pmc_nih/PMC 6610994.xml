                  <p id="Par1">Responsive parenting interventions that shape parenting behaviors in the areas of sleep and soothing, appropriate and responsive feeding, and routines represent a promising approach to early obesity prevention and have demonstrated effectiveness in our previous trials. However, this approach has yet to be applied to the populations most at-risk for the development of early obesity, including African Americans. The Sleep SAAF (Strong African American Families) study is a two-arm randomized controlled clinical trial evaluating whether a responsive parenting intervention focused on promoting infant sleeping and self-soothing can prevent rapid weight gain during the first 16 weeks postpartum among first-born African American infants. The responsive parenting intervention is compared to a child safety control intervention.</p>

                  <p id="Par2">Three hundred first-time African American mothers and their full-term infants will be enrolled from one mother/baby nursery. Following initial screening and consent in the hospital, mothers and infants are visited at home by Community Research Associates for data collection visits at 1 week, 8 weeks, and 16 weeks postpartum and for intervention visits at 3 weeks and 8 weeks postpartum. The primary study outcome is a between-group comparison of infant conditional weight gain (CWG) scores from 3 weeks to 16 weeks; additional weight-related outcomes include differences in change in infants’ weight for age over time and differences in infants’ weight outcomes at age 16 weeks. Several other outcomes reflecting infant and maternal responses to intervention (e.g., sleeping, soothing, feeding, maternal self-efficacy, maternal depressive symptoms) are also assessed.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par13">Racial disparities in obesity begin early in development and continue throughout the lifespan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. From birth to 2, the prevalence of high weight for length (above the 95th percentile) is 25% higher among African American children compared to White children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. From age 2–19, the rate of obesity is more than 50% higher among African American children compared to White children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Similar disparities persist into adulthood: rates of obesity are approximately 25% higher among African American adults compared to White adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Differences in early rapid weight gain during infancy (RWG) may be a key driver of these disparities: RWG is one of the most consistent factors associated with later overweight and obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], is more common among African American infants than among White infants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], and accounts for more than 70% of the difference between White and Black children’s BMI z scores during early childhood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par14">The higher prevalence of RWG and actual childhood obesity rates among African Americans suggest that intervening early in development has great potential to significantly reduce risk of later childhood and adult obesity among this population. Interventions that shape parenting behaviors in the areas of sleep and soothing, appropriate and responsive feeding, and routines have been cited as being of particular promise in early obesity prevention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and have demonstrated effectiveness in our previous trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. However, these interventions have yet to be tested among African American mothers and their infants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par15">Sleep SAAF is a prospective, two-arm, randomized controlled clinical trial evaluating whether a responsive parenting intervention focused on promoting infant sleeping and self-soothing can prevent rapid weight gain during the first 16 weeks postpartum among first-born African American infants. The responsive parenting intervention is being compared to a child safety control intervention. The responsive parenting intervention addresses infant sleep, soothing/crying, and feeding during the first months of life. The safety intervention addresses safe sleep practices as well as other aspects of newborn safety (e.g., food safety, preventing falls, poison prevention, preventing burns, car seat safety). The interventions are delivered at participants’ homes by Community Research Associates (CRAs), who are African American community members from communities similar to the ones in which we are implementing the intervention.</p>
              <sec id="Sec2">
                <title>Conceptual framework</title>
                <p id="Par16">Sleep SAAF’s responsive parenting intervention is grounded in the developmental literature on parenting sensitivities, arguing that parenting that is developmentally appropriate, prompt, and contingent on the infant’s needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] can increase infant sleep and self-regulation, and reduce rapid infant weight gain. The intervention is focused on a critical developmental period when plasticity is high. How parents put their infant to bed (e.g., bedtime routines, falling asleep independently) and respond to nighttime awakenings represent important sources of variability in infants’ developing sleep patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Because infant sleep bouts are interrupted by waking to be fed, the routines parents establish around sleep can also affect feeding frequency and energy intake, with important consequences for infant weight gain. Similarly, how parents respond to infant crying represents an important source of variability in infants’ developing regulation skills; avoiding the use of feeding as the first response to infant distress by using alternative soothing strategies can increase parental responsiveness to infants’ needs and promote infants’ self-regulation.</p>
                <p id="Par17">Individual and contextual stressors are common among African American mothers and have the potential to affect intervention effectiveness. For example, depressive symptoms are prevalent among African American mothers of infants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and are likely to interfere with maternal responsiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The broader social context is also likely to pose challenges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The families participating in Sleep SAAF live in communities in Georgia where poverty rates are high and unemployment rates are above the national average [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Under conditions of economic distress, parents are vulnerable to anger, low frustration tolerance, and depressive symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], all of which may be consequential for responsive parenting. African American families living in the South must also contend with race-based stressors such as racial discrimination, with negative consequences for depressive symptoms, health, and responsive parenting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Lastly, many African American mothers do not have a steady romantic partner at the time of their infant’s birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], potentially limiting available social support and increasing parenting stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. We examine each of these stressors as moderators of program effectiveness. Our conceptual framework is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Early factors affecting rapid weight gain among African American infants</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12887_2019_1583_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>

                <title>Evidence from previous trials</title>
                <p id="Par18">Sleep SAAF builds on our two previous RCTs providing evidence for the efficacy of a responsive parenting program. In a pilot study, Birch and colleagues developed and evaluated the SLIMTIME intervention for primiparous mothers who intended to breastfeed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Participants were predominantly middle income and White. The first component of SLIMTIME, “Soothe/Sleep,” began when infants were 2–3 weeks old and focused on promoting aspects of responsive parenting to promote the development of infant self-soothing and longer sleep duration and to reduce feeding frequency. As predicted, there was evidence of changes in sleeping, feeding, and soothing as a result of the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Infants whose mothers participated in the Soothe/Sleep intervention slept longer at night, had fewer total daily feeds, and had fewer nocturnal feeds from age 3 to 16 weeks compared to control group infants. Infants who received the intervention also gained weight more slowly over the first year, indicating that intervening on sleep and soothing behaviors can reduce the rate of weight gain during infancy.</p>
                <p id="Par19">In a subsequent larger scale randomized controlled trial (INSIGHT), the sample included primiparous mothers intending to formula feed as well as those intending to breastfeed and was predominantly middle income and White [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. This comprehensive responsive parenting program addressed infant feeding, sleeping and soothing, active social play, emotion regulation, and growth record education, and was taught to mothers at four home visits at 2-, 16-, 28-, and 40 weeks. During the first 16 weeks, program content focused on soothing, sleeping, and breast or bottle feeding; after 16 weeks, the focus was expanded to include introducing solids, table foods, and active social play. Relative to a home safely control, infants in the responsive parenting condition gained weight more slowly than control group infants from birth to 6 months, had lower weight-for-length percentiles at 1 year, were less likely to be overweight at 1 year, and had lower BMI z-scores through age 3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. There were also positive sleep outcomes: infants in the responsive parenting condition had longer nighttime sleep duration, more consistent bedtime routines, and earlier bedtimes, and were more likely to self-soothe to sleep without being fed at 8-, 16- and 40 weeks of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p>

Focusing on the initial soothe/sleep component of SLIMTIME and INSIGHT, we test whether a responsive parenting program can promote infants’ sleep and self-soothing and reduce rapid weight gain during the first 16 weeks of life among African American infants born in the South. Our specific aims are:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par21">To assess the effects of responsive parenting, focused on infant sleep and soothing, on reducing RWG from 3 weeks to 16 weeks among African American infants. We hypothesized that infants in the responsive parenting condition relative to safety control would show less rapid growth from 3 weeks to 16 weeks.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par22">To assess effects of responsive parenting on parental and infant behaviors at age 8 weeks, and whether these mediate effects on infant growth from 3 to 16 weeks. We hypothesized that compared with control mothers, mothers in the responsive parenting condition would report higher levels of responsive parenting, parenting self-efficacy, and greater use of alternatives to feeding to soothe, and lower levels of feeding to soothe at 8 weeks postpartum; infants in the responsive parenting condition would have longer sleep bouts and fewer feedings at age 8 weeks. These outcomes would be linked to healthier patterns of weight gain from 3 weeks to age 16 weeks.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par23">To examine moderation of intervention effects by individual and contextual factors.

AUMC provides comprehensive medical care for the Augusta area and serves as a referral center for the state of Georgia and western South Carolina. All newborns delivered at AUMC were screened for participation. The project’s Recruitment Coordinator had access to electronic medical records systems in order to pre-screen mothers and infants based on the following criteria: (1) full-term infants (<underline>&gt;</underline> 37 0/7 weeks gestational age), (2) singleton infant; (3) infant &gt; 2500 g at birth; (4) primiparous mother <underline>&gt;</underline> 17 years of age, (5) mother self-identifying as African American; (6) residence <underline>&lt;</underline> 75 miles from Augusta; and (7) English speaking. In addition, mother-infant dyads were excluded if there was a congenital anomaly or neonatal physical or metabolic condition that would significantly affect the newborn’s feeding or growth (e.g. cleft palate, complex congenital heart disease); if there were major maternal morbidities or pre-existing conditions that would affect postpartum care or the mother’s ability to care for her newborn (e.g., narcotic drug use, uncontrolled depression causing social service contact); if there was a plan for the newborn to be adopted; or if the family planned to move from the area within four months of delivery.</p>

Specifically, mothers learned various reasons why babies cry (e.g., wet, cold, hot, tired, gassy, over-stimulated) and that these cries differ in systematic ways, and viewed video clips illustrating these differences. Mothers were also taught soothing strategies that they could use to soothe their crying baby, including Shushing, Swinging, Side/Stomach Position, Sucking, and Swaddling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. They also received swaddle blankets and instruction and practiced swaddling their baby.

Expectations for typical feeding frequency during the day and night for breastfed and formula fed infants were discussed. Mothers were given education on age-appropriate bottle sizes, milk/formula volumes, use of slow-flow bottle nipples for infants under 4 months to prevent overfeeding or choking, and how to use fullness cues, rather than the amount of milk in the bottle, to determine when to terminate a feeding. Mothers were also advised that breast milk or formula is best for infants of this age, to delay the introduction of solid foods and other beverages until age 6 months, and to avoid adding infant cereal to a bottle.</p>

We will calculate CWG scores following the method of Griffiths and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], as described in our recent work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Scores will be calculated as standardized residuals from the linear regression of weight for age at 16 weeks on weight for age at 3 weeks (the first intervention session), with length for age at birth and 16 weeks and infant age at the 16-week assessment entered as covariates. The CWG score represents the variation in child weight gain not explained by child age, initial length, or initial weight. A CWG score of zero represents the population mean [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Positive CWG scores (above the estimated regression) indicate more rapid or faster than average weight gain, while negative scores (below the estimated regression) indicate slower weight gain.

                  <p id="Par41">In addition to conditional weight gain scores, we will examine several other secondary weight outcomes. First, we will examine differences in change in infants’ weight for age over time using growth curve models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Specifically, we will conduct growth curve analyses using hierarchical linear modeling to test whether the responsive parenting and safety control groups differ in their rate of change in weight over time. The model will include intervention group, time of growth measure, and infant weight adjusted for gestational age. These analyses will evaluate whether the responsive parenting group shows less of an increase in weight over time compared to the safety control group. Second, we will examine differences between groups in infants’ weight outcomes at age 16 weeks, including weight-for-age z scores, weight-for-length z scores, and BMI z scores. We include multiple growth outcomes because there is not one universally accepted measure for children younger than age 2 years. To compare 16-week outcomes between the responsive parenting intervention group and the safety control group, we will use linear mixed-effects models that include intervention group and infant weight at age 1 week adjusted for gestational age.

These analyses will test whether the responsive parenting group and the safety control group differ in these behaviors post-intervention and will be used to identify variables for the formal tests of mediation. Second, we will examine whether parent and infant behaviors mediate infant weight outcomes. We will test these hypotheses using structural equation modeling. The first step in demonstrating mediation is to establish the effects on mediating and distal outcomes, as we described above. We will then specify mediators as indirect effects in a path model. Intervention condition will be dummy coded and specified as a predictor of infant and parental behaviors, which in turn predict infant weight gain and infant weight.
