                  <p id="P3">Although many smokers use electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) to
quit smoking, most continue to smoke while vaping. This dual use might delay
cessation and increase toxicant exposure. We aimed to test the efficacy of a
self-help intervention designed to help dual users to quit smoking.</p>

                  <p id="P4">In this three-arm randomised controlled trial we recruited
individuals in the USA using Facebook and multimedia advertisements.
Included participants were 18 years or older, smoked at least weekly in the
preceding year, and vaped at least weekly in the preceding month. We used
computer generated randomisation with balanced-permuted blocks (block size
10, with 2–4-4 ratio) to allocate participants to assessment only
(ASSESS group), generic smoking cessation self-help booklets (GENERIC
group), or booklets targeting dual users (eTARGET group). Individuals in the
generic or targeted intervention groups received monthly cessation materials
for 18 months, with assessments every 3 months for 24 months. The main
outcome was self-reported 7-day point-prevalence smoking abstinence at each
assessment point. All randomly allocated participants were included in
primary analyses using generalised estimating equations for each of 20
datasets created by multiple imputation. Analysis of the
χ<sup>2</sup>s produced an F test. The trial is registered with

                  <p id="P5">Between July 12, 2016, and June 30, 2017, we randomly assigned 2896
dual users (575 to assessment, 1154 to generic intervention, and 1167 to
targeted self-help). 7-day point-prevalence smoking abstinence increased
from 14% at 3 months to 42% at 24 months
(<italic toggle="yes">F</italic><sub>7,541·7</sub>=67·1,

in higher smoking abstinence than did assessment alone throughout the
treatment period (<italic toggle="yes">F</italic><sub>1,973·8</sub>=10·20,
p=0·0014 [α=0·017]). The generic intervention group had
abstinence rates between those of the assessment and targeted groups, but
did not significantly differ from either when adjusted for multiple
comparisons (GENERIC <italic toggle="yes">vs</italic> eTARGET

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="P7">Electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) use (also known as vaping) has increased
greatly over the past decade. In 2018, for example, 8 million adults in the USA
alone reported vaping,<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> primarily
for the purpose of quitting or reducing smoking.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> The few randomised smoking cessation trials of e-cigarettes
have indicated efficacy at least as high as nicotine replacement therapy
(NRT).<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> However, many
individuals continue to smoke while vaping, representing a type of dual use, which
refers to use of two nicotine or tobacco products concurrently. It is estimated that
40·8% of e-cigarette users are also cigarette smokers (ie, dual
users).<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Unlike exclusive
vaping, which can be viewed as a harm reduction strategy, dual use is associated
with a high exposure to toxicants at levels that can be similar or higher than that
of cigarette smoking alone.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Dual
use might also lead to greater nicotine dependence, prolonging smoking and impeding
cessation.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Almost half of dual users continue both
smoking and vaping when followed up for a year, and 44% return to exclusive
smoking.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Therefore, although dual users are interested
in quitting smoking and are more likely to make quit attempts than smokers who do
not vape,<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> they still have
difficulty achieving smoking abstinence. Many dual users report a reduction in
smoking after the onset of vaping; yet even low rates of smoking are associated with
poor health outcomes and increased mortality.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Additionally, smoking cessation interventions with better
established efficacy (eg, behavioural counselling and pharmacotherapies such as NRT)
are limited by poor population uptake.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Together, these findings suggest that an intervention to help
dual users to achieve and maintain smoking abstinence, particularly one that is
easily disseminated, could have high public health impact.</p>
              <p id="P8">In this three-arm randomised controlled trial, we tested the hypothesis that
a self-help intervention designed specifically for dual users would improve smoking
abstinence compared with a no-treatment control and an existing, efficacious, and
generic self-help smoking cessation intervention.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Secondary aims were to identify responsive
prespecified subgroups, assess changes in vaping and its covariation with smoking,
and compare the cost-effectiveness of interventions.</p>

                <title>Study design and participants</title>
                <p id="P9">This study was a randomised controlled trial done in the USA.
Participants were recruited throughout the USA through Facebook and multimedia
advertisements (newspapers, radio, TV, e-cigarette forums, and so on) for a
study measuring attitudes and behaviours regarding cigarettes and e-cigarettes.
Inclusion criteria comprised the following: age 18 years or older, smoked one or
more combustible cigarettes per week over the preceding year, used e-cigarettes
one or more times per week over the preceding month, not currently enrolled in a
face-to-face smoking cessation programme, and able to speak and read English.
The original inclusion criteria required daily smoking. However, early in the
trial, it became apparent that many dual users were skipping smoking on some
days. Therefore, to better reflect the dual-using population, we amended the use
frequency criteria to equate them for smoking and vaping at one or more uses per
week. The protocol was amended on Sept 25, 2016. We had recruited 652
participants up to that date. Participants were not necessarily seeking
treatment or motivated to quit smoking or vaping. Participation was limited to
one individual per street address. Participants gave oral informed consent. The
study was approved by the Advarra Institutional Review Board. The study protocol
is available upon request to the corresponding author.</p>

                <title>Randomisation</title>
                <p id="P10">We used a three-arm (1:2:2) design for this trial. Upon return of a
baseline questionnaire, participants were randomly assigned to assessment only
(ASSESS; the no-treatment control group), a generic self-help intervention
(GENERIC),<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> or a
self-help intervention targeted to dual users (eTARGET). Randomisation was done
with balanced-permuted block randomisation with a block size of 10
(2–4-4). Sequences were created a priori by the study statistician (SKS)
and applied by a workflow and database software system. Given that interventions
in this study were in the form of self-help booklets, research staff involved in
the trial were not masked to group assignment. Participants were told during
telephone screening that they might receive educational smoking-cessation
materials, but they did not receive explicit information regarding the existence
of study arms or group assignment.</p>

                <p id="P11">Individuals interested in the study could either call to inquire about
the study or submit a brief survey with their contact information. Research
staff explained the study over the telephone and screened those who expressed
interest in participating. Eligible, consenting individuals were sent a baseline
questionnaire (by postal mail or e-mail). When the baseline questionnaire was
returned, individuals who still met inclusion criteria were randomly assigned to
one of the three study groups. The ASSESS group controlled for the baseline and
follow-up assessments and allowed for estimation of smoking abstinence among
dual users in the absence of intervention. Participants assigned to the GENERIC
group received smoking cessation materials found to be efficacious in our
previous randomised controlled trial:<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> an introductory <italic toggle="yes">Stop Smoking for Good</italic>
brochure, ten <italic toggle="yes">Stop Smoking for Good</italic> didactic booklets, and nine
<italic toggle="yes">How I Quit Smoking</italic> pamphlets, delivered over the course of
18 months. The content of these materials was based on cognitive-behavioural
theory<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> and empirical evidence regarding the
nature of tobacco dependence, cessation, and relapse.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> These materials were originally designed
as a means of translating the cognitive-behavioural counselling that occurs in a
clinic into a written format that would be much more accessible to smokers.
Participants in the eTARGET group received a guide designed specifically for
dual users (<italic toggle="yes">If You Vape: a Guide to Quitting Smoking)</italic>, which
included an introductory <italic toggle="yes">If You Vape</italic> brochure, a series of ten
<italic toggle="yes">If You Vape: Guide to Quitting Smoking</italic> booklets, and nine
<italic toggle="yes">My Story</italic> pamphlets. We drew on materials from the GENERIC
intervention, qualitative research and literature on dual users attempting to
quit smoking, and existing empirical research and guidelines on the efficacious
use of NRT, to address the special needs, circumstances, and risk factors of
dual users.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> The materials in
the <italic toggle="yes">If You Vape: Guide to Quitting Smoking</italic> resource emphasised
the use of e-cigarettes for smoking cessation (eg, vaping when tempted to smoke,
keeping e-cigarettes handy, or trying different flavours or devices until
finding the most effective), encouraged users to taper and eventually terminate
e-cigarette use towards the end of the intervention, and incorporated language,
photographs, and graphics relevant and appealing for dual users. Links to all
intervention materials are available in the <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">appendix (p 3)</xref>.</p>
                <p id="P12">Participants assigned to the GENERIC or eTARGET groups were sent the
intervention materials by postal mail, with the option of also receiving them
electronically. In both groups, the initial brochure and the first booklet were
mailed upon receipt of the completed baseline assessment. The remaining booklets
were mailed 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 12, 15, and 18 months after the baseline
assessment. The pamphlets were mailed 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, and 17 months
after baseline assessment.</p>
                <p id="P13">The baseline questionnaire contained a demographic and tobacco history
assessment, including the Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence
(FTND)<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> for the
assessment of baseline cigarette dependence and the Heaviness of Smoking Index
(HSI) to assess cigarette dependence before vaping initiation. Three
motivation-related constructs were assessed: the Stages of Change
algorithm,<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> a
situation-specific abstinence self-efficacy scale (SSE),<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> and the Abstinence-Related Motivational
Engagement (ARME) scale.<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> The
item “I am committed to being smoke-free” (a general measure of
motivation to quit smoking, rated with a 5-point Likert scale) was also
included. A questionnaire assessing e-cigarette use was developed mirroring the
combustible cigarette scales and items. A full description of all study measures
is available elsewhere.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup></p>
                <p id="P14">Full follow-up assessments with similar measures to the baseline
questionnaire were done at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after enrolment. Abbreviated
assessments were administered at 3, 9, 15, and 21 months after baseline.
Participants reporting smoking abstinence at 12 or 24 months and living within

considering that the study population was not limited to treatment-seeking
smokers, we estimated abstinence rates increasing linearly from 0% at baseline
to 15% at 18 months and beyond in the ASSESS group, 20% in the GENERIC group,
and 25% in the eTARGET group. Sample size was estimated by use of GEESIZE
version 3.1,<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> with a
first-order autocorrelation working correlation structure and coefficient of
0·7, and adjusted α of 0·017 (ASSESS <italic toggle="yes">vs</italic>
eTARGET), 0·025 (ASSESS <italic toggle="yes">vs</italic> GENERIC), and 0·05
(GENERIC <italic toggle="yes">vs</italic> eTARGET) following Holm’s
procedure.<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> We
assumed that abstinence rates would increase from 6 to 18 months and stabilise
thereafter. To ensure 80% power or greater for all comparisons required the
random assignment of 2065 participants in a 1:2:2 ratio (413 to ASSESS, 826 to
GENERIC, and 826 to eTARGET). Assuming the 17% attrition we observed in our
previous study,<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> we initially
planned to recruit 2500 individuals. However, the attrition rate for the first
575 participants was higher than expected at 27·5%, so on Feb 27, 2017,
we amended the protocol to increase the target sample size to 2900 to account
for this change.</p>
                <p id="P18">We used SAS, version 9.4, for all analyses. Descriptive statistics were
computed for demographic, smoking-related, and vaping-related variables, as well
as bio-verification outcomes. Hypothesis testing variables were transformed as
needed. The following prospective moderators and multiple imputation model
variables were dichotomised before the analysis: married or living together,
education beyond high school, committed to being smoke free, and annual
household income ($20 000). An intention-to-treat approach was used for all
analyses, with multiple imputation using the multivariate normal approach
applied to manage missing data.<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup></p>
                <p id="P19">Preliminary univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses
identified auxiliary variables for the imputation model (ie, baseline measures
predicting smoking or unreturned surveys) to increase credibility of the
missing-at-random assumption. After the imputation modelling, a post-hoc
adjustment was applied to imputed smoking status values to reflect
missing-not-at-random effects (ie, that individuals with missing smoking status
data might be more likely to continue smoking than individuals who submit data)
with a small to medium effect size (ie, Cohen’s d=0·35).<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> The final smoking and vaping

                <p id="P20">Analyses of intervention-based differences in smoking and vaping
abstinence used generalised estimating equations (GEE), with each GEE targeting
a treatment group-paired comparison (eg, eTARGET <italic toggle="yes">vs</italic> ASSESS).
The covariates for the base model were treatment group, assessment (3–24
months), and their interaction. Within each of the 20 datasets,
χ<sup>2</sup> was the test statistic. Within each of the 20 datasets
created by multiple imputation, χ<sup>2</sup> was the test statistic for
each effect. These 20 χ<sup>2</sup> values were submitted to
Allison’s COMBCHI.SAS macro implementing the method presented in
Schafer<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> to generate
an <italic toggle="yes">F</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">DF,DDF</italic></sub> test of the effect that
adjusts for the variability of the χ<sup>2</sup> values across datasets.
DF is from the χ<sup>2</sup> and DDF is based on the original sample size
with downward adjustment for the variability of the χ<sup>2</sup> values
across the imputed datasets. Given apparent differences between treatment
(3–18 months) and post-treatment (21–24 months) smoking outcomes,
we did separate analyses for these periods. To analyse whether the targeted
intervention had a greater effect on a particular subgroup of dual users, seven
prespecified moderators (sex, age, education, income, FTND at baseline, HSI
pre-vaping, and planning to quit within 30 days) were evaluated by adding the
moderator and its interaction with treatment group to the base model for eTARGET
<italic toggle="yes">vs</italic> ASSESS. Significant interactions were explored through
analyses of intervention effects within subgroups. Although not prespecified,
three baseline e-cigarette variables were evaluated as moderators: e-cigarette
type (refillable <italic toggle="yes">vs</italic> all others), daily vaping frequency, and
whether vaping was used for quitting smoking. Finally, the association between
smoking and vaping status was evaluated with use of GEE in a model predicting
smoking status with treatment group (all three), assessment, time-varying vaping
status, and the interaction of group with vaping status (more details in the

(eg, personnel, printing, and postage) and assigned appropriate unit prices for
each resource type to do a deterministic cost-effectiveness calculation of cost

were excluded. Incremental cost-effective ratios of abstinence at 18 and 24
months were calculated for eTARGET and GENERIC interventions compared with the
ASSESS group. Additionally, we did sensitivity analyses to explore the effect of
varying intervention costs that might occur with different levels of automation

              <p id="P23">Between July 12, 2016, and June 30, 2017, 5827 individuals were recruited
and assessed for eligibility, with 3611 individuals initially qualifying for
inclusion. Of these, 3113 returned the baseline questionnaire. Subsequently, 2896
remained eligible and were enrolled, randomly assigned, and included in the analyses
(<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>). 575 participants were allocated
to the ASSESS group, 1154 to the GENERIC group, and 1167 to the eTARGET group. Of
the individuals enrolled, 2263 (78%) were recruited through Facebook and 401 (14%)
through online advertisements. Of enrolled participants, 503 (17%) did not return
any follow-up surveys, with percentages higher for eTARGET (odds ratio [OR]
1·63, 95% CI 1·21–2·18, p=0·0013) and GENERIC
(1·89, 1·41–2·53, p&lt;0·0001) than for
ASSESS. Preliminary analyses to identify variables for the multiple imputation model
found three additional predictors of not returning any follow-up surveys: being male
(OR 2·25, 95% CI 1·80–2·82; p&lt;0·0001),
younger (0·95, 0·94–0·97; p&lt;0·0001), and
requesting paper surveys (1·45, 1·12–1·87,
p=0·0047). The number of incomplete surveys increased from 814 (28%) at 3
months to 1531 (53%) at 21 months and decreased to 1274 (44%) at the final
assessment (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>).</p>
              <p id="P24">Most participants were non-Hispanic White, men, aged 18–31 years,
educated beyond high school, and had an annual household income lower than $30 000

one to ten cigarettes per day, had low to moderate cigarette dependence, and were
considering quitting smoking within 6 months but not within the following 30 days;
nearly half started vaping to quit smoking. Most participants had vaped for at least
1 year and reported 20 or more vaping episodes per day (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>). Participants were asked which type of
e-cigarettes they usually used. The most endorsed category was
“refillable” at 2140 (74%), with only 86 (3%) indicating
“cartridge” and 69 (2%) indicating “disposable”. The

representing the interaction of a moderator or auxiliary variable with condition.
Relative efficiency for tests of variable mean differing from 0 was greater than

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="P35">To our knowledge, the targeted intervention tested in this trial was the
first specifically designed for dual users of combustible cigarettes and
e-cigarettes. Our study is also one of the few trials that followed up vapers for
over 12 months. Although the intervention did not endorse the initiation of vaping,
it notably did not demonise or immediately discourage ongoing vaping. Instead, the
intervention instructed current dual users to use e-cigarettes in ways thought to
maximise their efficacy for smoking cessation, and later it also recommended
cessation of vaping.</p>
              <p id="P36">In the full study sample, the targeted intervention resulted in smoking
abstinence rates approximately 5–10 percentage points higher than that of the
assessment-only control over the 18 months of treatment. The generic intervention
resulted in abstinence rates between those of the targeted and control groups. The
level of baseline cigarette dependence was an important moderator. As would be
expected, smokers who reported little or no baseline cigarette dependence had the
greatest success in quitting smoking, upon which the intervention did not improve.
However, the targeted intervention was efficacious compared with a no-treatment
control among smokers with greater cigarette dependence (FTND ≥2),
representing over 75% of our sample. Smokers who have higher dependency appear to
have more difficulty in quitting smoking; thus the intervention might have been more
valuable to them.<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Therefore, our
intervention might help smokers who are more dependent make a complete switch to
e-cigarettes, thereby reducing the harm from smoking.</p>
              <p id="P37">Although the targeted intervention produced higher abstinence rates over the
18 months when the materials were distributed, differences declined after the
treatment period. It is possible that the intervention accelerated smoking cessation
that would have eventually occurred without treatment. Alternatively, the
intervention might have been ended prematurely, and extending it might maintain its
efficacy.</p>
              <p id="P38">With vaping risks believed to be substantially lower than those of
smoking,<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> vaping cessation
was not a primary target or outcome. However, the intervention communicated the
advantages of e-cigarette cessation regarding health benefits, cost savings, and
freedom from addiction. Although vaping decreased over time, no significant
differences were observed across groups. In general, vaping was associated with a
higher probability of smoking abstinence, as has been previously reported.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> A 2019 randomised controlled trial
showing the efficacy of e-cigarettes also found that most individuals continued
vaping after they quit smoking.<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>
Unlike pharmaceutical NRTs, e-cigarettes mimic the sensorimotor aspects of cigarette
smoking; can, under certain circumstances, approximate more closely the
pharmacokinetics of smoking;<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> and
are not accompanied by instructions on tapering off the product over time. Although
long-term vaping appears to involve exposure to fewer toxicants than smoking, it is
probably not benign. Interventions that facilitate vaping cessation without risking
smoking relapse are needed.</p>
              <p id="P39">Smoking abstinence rates across all three trial groups were higher than
expected and higher than those reported in longitudinal studies of dual users,
albeit with different inclusion and outcome criteria.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>
Therefore, our findings support evidence from randomised controlled trials that
e-cigarettes can be efficacious smoking cessation aids. We did not select for
individuals seeking to quit smoking (and only 26% were planning to do so within the
following 30 days), which might have suppressed intervention effects compared with
other clinical trials. Additionally, because the study recruited only dual users,
any individuals who had already switched completely from smoking to vaping were
excluded, which would have attenuated the observed smoking cessation rates. Indeed,
approximately 70% of our sample had been vaping for over 1 year without quitting
smoking. Therefore, the sample could be conceptualised as comprising the residual
subset of vapers who had so far been unsuccessful at quitting smoking. Conversely,
the study probably attracted individuals committed to vaping and motivated to
participate in research on the topic. These last characteristics might have
increased the overall smoking cessation rates while also suppressing vaping
cessation rates.</p>
              <p id="P40">Self-help interventions are efficacious for smoking cessation, with
potentially high reach at low cost.<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> The economy of the targeted intervention yielded a cost per
quitter lower than most smoking cessation interventions,<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> particularly when excluding smokers with low
dependence. Costs might be reduced substantially by using a mobile health format,
which would also enable more frequent contact over a longer duration of
treatment.</p>
              <p id="P41">Limitations include a study sample recruited largely through social media,
potentially limiting generalisability; low representation of racial and ethnic
minorities, although this might reflect the demographics of e-cigarette
use;<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> minimal biochemical
verification of smoking abstinence; and relatively high long-term attrition rates,
possibly reflecting the young age and mobility of this sample, the study not being
advertised as a cessation trial, and media reports regarding e-cigarette risks over
the course of the study. However, 83% of participants responded to one or more of
the follow-up assessments, which contributed to imputation of missing data.
Importantly, follow-up assessment rates for research should not necessarily predict
the acceptance or effect of the intervention when implemented in non-research
settings. Finally, the study might have not captured the effect of newer and better
performing devices, including pod systems that deliver protonated nicotine, which
became popular during the course of the study.</p>
              <p id="P42">In conclusion, our trial of an inexpensive self-help smoking cessation
intervention for dual users of combustible and e-cigarettes showed that it improves
smoking cessation, particularly during the 18-month intervention and among dual
users with higher cigarette dependence. A 2020 Cochrane review of e-cigarette
efficacy for smoking cessation calculated that e-cigarettes improve smoking
cessation outcomes by about 6 percentage points at 6 or more months compared with
smoking cessation without e-cigarettes.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Effect sizes achieved in our study were of a similar size as
those reported by Cochrane for nicotine e-cigarettes versus non-nicotine
e-cigarettes or versus behavioural support or no support. This suggests that an
additional effect of similar size could be achieved by adding self-help booklets.
Moreover, because dual use is prevalent and self-help can be easily disseminated,
when brought to scale, each percentage point can represent a substantial public
health impact. Additional pragmatic trials of similar interventions in different
populations and settings are needed to identify the most effective ways to support
dual users in completely switching from smoking to vaping on their journey towards
nicotine abstinence.</p>

                <title>Evidence before this study</title>
                <p id="P60">A Cochrane review published in 2020, reviewing research published up to
January, 2020, reported the potential of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes)
for smoking cessation. The review concluded, with moderate confidence, that
e-cigarettes containing nicotine resulted in higher smoking abstinence rates
compared with placebo e-cigarettes, and that e-cigarettes were more effective
than nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation. The review also
concluded, albeit with very low confidence on the basis of only four randomised
controlled trials, that nicotine e-cigarettes were more effective than
behavioural support alone or no support for smoking cessation. To extend these
findings, we searched Cochrane, Ovid MEDLINE, and Embase databases on Oct 30,
2020, with no language restrictions, to identify additional randomised trials
testing the efficacy of e-cigarettes for smoking cessation published since
January, 2020. In line with the Cochrane search strategy, we searched for trials
using the following terms: “e-cig$ OR electr$ cigar$ OR electronic
nicotine OR (vape or vaper or vapers or vaping)”. We identified 60
articles with only one relevant randomised controlled trial that had not been
included in the meta-analyses previously summarised. The study was done in the
USA and randomly allocated 264 smokers uninterested in quitting to one of four
conditions they were instructed to follow: use e-cigarettes ad libitum,
completely substitute combustible cigarettes with e-cigarettes, completely
substitute e-cigarettes with nicotine gum or lozenges, or continue smoking
combustible cigarettes. 8 weeks after baseline, 7-day point-prevalence
abstinence from smoking was significantly higher when instructing participants
to completely substitute combustible cigarettes with e-cigarettes (32·9%)
compared with instructions to substitute cigarettes with nicotine gum or
lozenges (17·1%; p=0·039). We found no trials that tested
interventions designed for smokers already using e-cigarettes (ie, dual
users).</p>

                <title>Added value of this study</title>
                <p id="P61">Despite the growing evidence that e-cigarettes might aid smoking
cessation, most smokers who initiate vaping continue to smoke, raising concern
that e-cigarettes might also maintain smoking among many individuals otherwise
motivated to quit. Such dual use maintains exposure to known smoking-related
toxicants and possible vaping-related toxicants. To our knowledge, this study is
the first to test an intervention specifically for dual users, with the goal of
transforming their e-cigarettes from products that might maintain smoking into
tools that could be used to promote smoking cessation. Our low-cost, easily
disseminated intervention resulted in modest increases in smoking abstinence
over 18 months, with stronger treatment effects predicted by higher baseline
levels of cigarette dependence. Importantly, our findings expand the target of
smoking cessation interventions involving e-cigarettes to encompass those who
have already initiated vaping, including individuals who might have settled into
a prolonged pattern of dual use.</p>

                <title>Implications of all the available evidence</title>
                <p id="P62">This study indicates that dual users could benefit from specific
interventions that capitalise on their ongoing e-cigarette use. Future pragmatic
research is needed to test alternative intervention methods, enhance long-term
efficacy, keep pace with evolving e-cigarette products, assist with eventual
e-cigarette cessation, and maximise implementation in clinical and other
settings.</p>
