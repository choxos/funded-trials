              <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
              <p id="P5">The composition of the vaginal microflora can significantly impact both reproductive and neonatal health. Vaginal lactobacilli, through the production of lactic acid, create a vaginal environment characterized by a low pH, and this, in combination with bacteriocins and possibly other components, inhibits the colonization and growth of potentially pathogenic microorganisms and reduces the phylogenetic diversity of the vaginal microbiome. In a state of dysbiosis termed bacterial vaginosis (BV), the lactobacilli are depleted and replaced with a polymicrobial, anaerobic microflora that includes <italic>Gardnerella vaginalis</italic>, <italic>Atopobium vaginae, Sneathia, Prevotella spp</italic>, <italic>Megasphaera</italic>, and others. Although BV is frequently asymptomatic, this dysbiotic state is significantly associated with other clinical complications including pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility, and spontaneous abortion. When BV occurs during pregnancy, it is associated with a more than 2-fold increased risk for preterm birth. This is important because preterm birth accounts for as much as 70% of neonatal mortality, 75% of neonatal morbidity, and nearly 50% of long-term neurologic sequelae. A significant portion of moderate and late preterm births and the majority of very preterm births (&lt;32 weeks) may be attributable to infection and subsequent inflammation and recent microbiome analyses reveal an association between term birth and abundance of healthy lactobacilli and an association between preterm birth and BV-associated bacterial taxa<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p>
              <p id="P6">Numerous studies support the important role for sufficient serum or plasma concentrations of 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25(OH)D) during pregnancy in preventing negative outcomes<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>–<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. Although some studies failed to detect an association, possibly because vitamin D deficiency is low among certain populations, many others and a recent meta-analysis, suggest that vitamin D deficiency increases the rate of preterm birth, particularly early preterm birth<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. It plays roles in maintenance of maternal and fetal calcium homeostasis, which is linked to skeletal integrity, in general fetal growth and development, and in the regulation of immune function<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. There also appears to be a relationship between vitamin D and BV status during pregnancy. Multiple reports describe higher rates of BV among women with insufficient 25(OH)D concentrations (often defined as &lt;20 nmol/L or &lt;30 nmol/L)<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>–<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. However, studies in non-pregnant women have yielded conflicting results. One randomized controlled trial that investigated the effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation in conjunction with metronidazole in eliminating BV in non-pregnant women did not detect a positive effect of vitamin D<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> while another study found that vitamin D supplementation was effective in eliminating BV<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="P7">Race/ethnicity has significant population-level impacts on vitamin D status, BV status, and pregnancy outcomes. Vitamin D deficiency is more prevalent among people with limited sun exposure and among people with dark skin. Children of African ancestry are more likely than those of European ancestry to experience hypocalcaemic seizures and to develop rickets<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. Women of African ancestry are also twice as likely to receive a clinical diagnosis of BV, and analyses of the vaginal microbiota reveal that they are more likely to be colonized by certain BV-associated bacteria<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. Furthermore, African American women (though not African-born women) are nearly twice as likely to give birth preterm (&lt;37 weeks gestation) and more than twice as likely to give birth early preterm (&lt;34 weeks)<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> and vitamin D deficiency has been linked to preterm birth and small-for-gestational-age infants born to women of African ancestry<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. There is an urgent need to understand and address these important health disparities and an important first step in understanding whether or not the three parameters, vitamin D status, vaginal microbiome, and preterm birth, are linked. As a component of a prospective vitamin D supplementation trial in pregnant women funded by the W. F. F. Kellogg Foundation, referred to as the Kellogg Study, we analyzed a cohort of 230 healthy women and investigated the relationship between plasma 25(OH)D concentrations, the vaginal microbiome, and preterm birth.</p>

All subjects gave written, informed consent. Women of diverse racial/ethnic backgrounds presenting to their obstetrician or midwife at the Medical University of SC (MUSC), Charleston, SC obstetrical facilities within the first 14 weeks after last menstrual period (LMP) with confirmation of a singleton pregnancy were eligible for enrollment in the Kellogg Study. Obstetrical dating was confirmed by early ultrasound by an MUSC obstetrician at the first prenatal visit. In those women with greater than a 2-week discrepancy between dating by LMP and ultrasound, the ultrasound dating was used. Mothers with pre-existing calcium, uncontrolled thyroid disease, parathyroid conditions, or who required chronic diuretic or cardiac medication therapy including calcium channel blockers were excluded. Mothers with pre-existing sickle cell disease (not trait only), sarcoidosis, Crohn’s disease, or ulcerative colitis were also ineligible to participate in the study. In addition, because of the potentially confounding effect of multiple fetuses, mothers with multiple gestations as determined by obstetrical ultrasound, were not eligible for participation in the study. Women who met the entry criteria were approached by the Kellogg Study team for enrollment in the study following their written, informed consent. A sub-group of approximately 100 subjects with known diabetes, hypertension, HIV, or morbid obesity (body mass index &gt; 49) did participate but were subsequently excluded from analysis in the present study as the present study’s focus was on healthy women at the start of pregnancy.</p>
                <p id="P9">The women were randomized into 1 of 2 groups: (1) Group A: 400 IU vitamin D<sub>3</sub>/day—Standard dose treatment of placebo (0 IU vitamin D<sub>3</sub> gummy) plus prenatal vitamin (400 IU/day); or (2) Group B: 4 400 IU/day (4 000 IU/2 gummies/day + 400 IU/day in prenatal). A sample size of 240 subjects, 120 in each arm, was calculated to be sufficient to detect a clinically important difference of 0.3 between groups in achieving a total circulating 25(OH)D concentration of at least 40 ng/mL assuming a standard deviation of 10 using a two-tailed t-test of difference between means with 80% power and a 5% level of significance. Considering a dropout rate of 10% the sample size required is 264 (132 per group). To attain equal group numbers and balanced numbers by racial/ethnic group (African-American, Caucasian and Hispanic, which represent the predominant groups delivering at MUSC), a stratified block randomization was used. Adherence to treatment was assessed by monthly pill count and women with an adherence rate of &lt;60% predicted pill intake for two consecutive months exited the study (n= 60: 7 white/Caucasian; 18 Hispanic; and 35 black/African American women). Because of the effect of adherence to treatment on vitamin D status<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>, the biomarker—25-hydroxy-vitamin D (25(OH)D was used as an additional measure of maternal vitamin D status.</p>

Of these, 387 were randomized and received supplement: 191 received 400 IU (control group), of whom, 142 were followed through to delivery; 196 received 4400 IU (treatment group), of whom, 155 were followed through to delivery. There were 19 miscarriages (10 in black/African American women and 9 in Hispanic women). The concentration of 25(OH)D was determined from blood samples collected monthly starting at 10-14 weeks of gestation through delivery. Women (n=108) exited the study due to loss of interest, moving away and nonadherence to protocol (n=60). Three women were enrolled in the study for 2 separate pregnancies; the results from the second pregnancy was not included in the analyses, but all three women delivered at term gestation. Women who exited the Kellogg Study were more likely to be black/African American (p&lt;0.0001), had less than college education (p=0.005), were less likely to be employed full-time (p=0.03); more likely to have Medicaid/self-pay insurance (p&lt;0.0001), higher gravidity (p=0.008) and parity (0.0015); and lower 25(OH)D concentration at baseline (p=0.0003), but did not differ by body mass index (BMI), season, dietary vitamin D intake, or serum calcium or phosphorus concentrations.</p>
                <p id="P21">While a circulating 25(OH)D concentration was obtained for each participant on a monthly basis, vaginal swab samples were obtained in women who chose to provide a sample, and in some cases, women were late to be seen for their appointments, and chose not to provide a vaginal swab.

For the purpose of this nested study, we analyzed circulating 25(OH)D concentrations and vaginal swab samples that were obtained at visit 1 (baseline; 7.6-15.1 weeks gestation; n=177), visit 4 (21.5-28.3 weeks gestation; n=220), and visit 7 (31.6-40.4 weeks gestation; n=200) from 112 women in the control group and 124 women in the treatment group.

                <p id="P23">DNA from vaginal swab samples was analyzed by 16S rRNA gene survey. 16S amplicon sequences were classified against a custom database of vaginally-relevant species, using STIRRUPS<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>, and relative abundance were computed as a percentage of reads classified. Taxonomic assignments below 0.01% relative abundance were removed and the proportions were re-normalized. Furthermore, bacterial species not present in at least 5% of samples were removed. This protects against features with small mean and trivially large coefficient of variance. Vaginal 16S rRNA gene profiles from all samples were grouped based on total circulating plasma 25(OH)D concentrations of either &lt; 30 ng/mL or &gt; 40 ng/mL. There was no significant association between 25(OH)D concentration and alpha diversity as measured by Shannon index or Inverse Simpson Index (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure S1a</xref>).

When the samples were grouped by dominant taxon, it was apparent, as expected, that women with vaginal microbiome dominated by lactobacilli had lower Nugent scores, overall (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). Furthermore, it appeared that women with &gt; 40 ng/mL 25(OH)D at the time of sampling had vaginal microbiomes with greater abundance of lactobacilli relative to women with &lt; 30 ng/mL 25(OH)D (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2a, 2b</xref>).

We also developed a model to incorporate the mixed effects of treatment group and gestational age, and we analyzed the different ethnic groups separately. Because education differed between the control and treatment groups, education was accounted for in the model. When treatment group and gestational age were fixed, both treatment and gestational age significantly correlated with 25(OH)D concentrations, but the associations between many of the taxa and 25(OH)D were no longer significant, suggesting that covariation of abundance levels with gestational age, treatment group, and/or ethnicity exerted an effect.

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p id="P27">The hypothesis driving this study was that vitamin D status is associated with the vaginal microbiome. Vitamin D could affect the vaginal microbiome through a number of mechanisms. First, it could promote the barrier integrity of the vaginal epithelium. Vitamin D was shown to upregulate genes encoding epithelial cell junction proteins and stimulated proliferation of the vaginal epithelium<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>. Furthermore, two studies found that postmenopausal women receiving vitamin D treatment had increased numbers of superficial vaginal epithelial cells compared to women not receiving treatment, and that this increase was accompanied by decreases in vaginal pH<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>. Together these studies suggest that vitamin D may promote vaginal epithelial cell growth, differentiation, and function, which may increase vaginal thickness to prevent atrophy and improve barrier function. Second, adequate vitamin D during pregnancy may impact the vaginal environment so that it is more supportive of beneficial flora. It is well established that insulin stimulates glycogen synthesis<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>, and more recently it has been proposed that vitamin D induces insulin synthesis<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>. Vitamin D was also shown to increase the phosphorylation and inactivation of glycogen synthase kinase, an inhibitor of glycogen synthesis, in adipose tissue<sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup>. Therefore there is also a possibility that vitamin D sufficiency alters glucose homeostasis in the vagina to promote increased glycogen deposition. Increased vaginal levels of free glycogen positively correlate with <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> relative abundance<sup><xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup>, and so if vitamin D is indeed promoting vaginal glycogen production, the accompanying increase in lactobacilli and decrease in pH may result in the decreased abundance of pathogenic and BV-associated organisms. A third possibility is that vitamin D influences abundance of BV-associated bacteria through its effects on immune function. Previous studies have shown that vitamin D treatment induces the expression of the LL-37 antimicrobial peptide in keratinocytes, neutrophils, monocytes, and bladder and gingival epithelial cells as well as β2 defensin in keratinocytes, neutrophils, and monocytes<sup><xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>–<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup>, as well as potentiates the secretion of IL-8 and CXCL10 from airway epithelial cells<sup><xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup>. These effects could promote leukocyte recruitment to the vaginal epithelium and modulate the antimicrobial response of leukocytes upon arrival to the tissue<sup><xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="P28">In this study, we analyzed a sub-cohort from a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of vitamin D supplementation of pregnant women who were enrolled during the first trimester of pregnancy and followed until delivery. We analyzed 16S rRNA gene survey data to determine whether plasma 25(OH)D concentrations were associated with the vaginal microbiome. Women in both the control (400 IU vitamin D daily) and treatment groups (4 400 IU vitamin D daily) displayed higher circulating 25(OH)D concentrations with increasing gestational age. While initial analyses suggested a substantive association between 25(OH)D and the vaginal microbiome, we found that gestational age was a strong covariate. While multiple studies have shown that the abundances of certain BV-associated bacterial taxa decrease during pregnancy<sup><xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup>, a correlation with gestational age has not been demonstrated and a report of a longitudinal study suggested that the vaginal microbiome is remarkably constant over the course of pregnancy<sup><xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup>. In our study, however, <italic>G. vaginalis</italic> decreased significantly in abundance between visit 1 (7.6-15.1 weeks), and visit 7 (31.6-40.4 weeks) (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>).</p>
              <p id="P29">A model that took into account the covariation between the vaginal microbiome and gestational age, found only three taxa that were associated with 25(OH)D concentrations, and these associations were dependent upon ethnicity. Specifically, among women of African ancestry, there was a negative correlation between 25(OH)D and abundance of <italic>Megasphaera spp.</italic>. The majority of reads that were categorized with the genus <italic>Megasphaera</italic> were <italic>Megasphaera</italic> Type 1, which we have found in another study (Glascock, Fettweis, manuscript in preparation), to be the most common vaginal type. Detection of <italic>Megasphaera</italic> by PCR has been shown to accurately predict of BV<sup><xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup> and <italic>Megasphaera</italic> is associated with bacteria vaginosis and spontaneous preterm delivery<sup><xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>–<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref></sup>. <italic>Megasphaera</italic> has also been linked to genital tract inflammation<sup><xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref></sup> and HIV acquisition among African women<sup><xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref></sup>. Among women of European ancestry in the control group, women with higher 25(OH)D concentrations were more likely to have higher abundance of <italic>L. crispatus</italic>. <italic>L. crispatus</italic> is a healthy H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-producing lactobacillus species that is associated with decreased risk for developing BV and decreased risk for HIV acquisition<sup><xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref></sup>. Thus, although only two taxa were significantly associated with 25(OH)D, these results suggest that vitamin D could have a positive impact on the vaginal microbiome.</p>
              <p id="P30">A limitation of this study is that the cohort contained few women who had profound vitamin D deficiency (defined as 25(OH)D &lt;2 ng/mL). In our prior NICHD vitamin D pregnancy study involving 350 women randomized to three treatment groups (400, 2000 and 4000 IU vitamin D<sub>3</sub>/day)<sup><xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref></sup>, even the control group showed an increase in 25(OH)D over the course of pregnancy, especially in white/Caucasian women. Most women are not taking a prenatal vitamin or a multivitamin at the start of pregnancy and since most women have limited sunlight exposure or use sunscreen limiting their endogenous synthesis of vitamin D, and because the average American woman is provided ~200 IU vitamin D/day from her diet<sup><xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref></sup>, the addition of 400 IU/day results in a slight but measurable increase in 25(OH)D over time.</p>
              <p id="P31">Another potential limitation of the study is the loss of subjects during the study period. There were 108 women who exited the study, 60 due to nonadherence to protocol. The women who exited the study tended to be of lower socioeconomic status, were black/African American, less educated, more likely to be of higher gravidity and parity, and with a lower baseline 25(OH)D concentration than those women who completed the study. The loss of these subjects in the study could have created potential bias in the results.</p>
              <p id="P32">It is possible that within the range of total circulating 25(OH)D concentration among women in the cohort, there is little impact on the vaginal microbiome, but that severe vitamin D deficiency has a greater effect. In this study, plasma 25(OH)D was the only marker of vitamin D status that was measured; however, maternal 1,25D and other vitamin D metabolites such as 24,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D and the 3-epi-25(OH)D could also be important factors. Because the subjects in this cohort were pregnant, plasma 1,25D concentration would be expected to be higher and could influence immune function and the vaginal microbiota. Another limitation was that the relatively small cohort size may not have provided the study with adequate power to detect significant associations between 25(OH)D concentrations and bacterial taxa, particularly in light of other covariates (gestational age, ethnicity, and random treatment group assignment). While all participants in the study provided a blood sample to measure total circulating 25(OH)D, only a subset of those women provided a vaginal sample at the 3 timepoints, which further decreased the sample size. The vaginal microbiome is a complex parameter and consequently, microbiome studies often require large cohorts to detect biologically relevant results. An additional potential confounder is that women who were diagnosed with BV by Nugent score were prescribed treatment, and while treatment occurred after vaginal swab samples were obtained, it could have influenced the composition of the microbiome at subsequent visits.</p>
