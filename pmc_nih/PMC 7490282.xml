                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>A randomized trial is being conducted comparing two methods of scaling-up the <italic>Sun Safe Workplaces</italic> (SSW) intervention. Departments of transportation (DOTs) from 21 U.S. states are participating and their 138 regional districts were randomized following baseline assessment. In districts assigned to the in-person method (<italic>n</italic> = 46), project staff meets personally with managers, conducts trainings for employees, and provides printed materials. In districts assigned to the digital method (<italic>n</italic> = 92), project staff conduct these same activities virtually, using conferencing technology, online training, and electronic materials. Delivery of SSW in both groups was tailored to managers' readiness to adopt occupational sun safety. Posttesting will assess manager's support for and use of SSW and employees' sun safety. An economic evaluation will explore whether the method that uses digital technology results in lower implementation of SSW but is more cost-effective relative to the in-person method.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>The state DOTs range in size from 997 to 18,415 employees. At baseline, 1113 managers (49.0%) completed the pretest (91.5% male, 91.1% white, 19.77 years on the job, 66.5% worked outdoors; and 24.4% had high-risk skin types). They were generally supportive of occupational sun safety. A minority reported that the employer had a written policy, half reported training, and two-thirds, messaging on sun protection.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="p0005">In the field of implementation science, scale-up is the effort to increase the impact of successful prevention interventions to benefit more people on a lasting basis [<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Scale-up methods must be lower cost and increase reach to provide greater access to benefits [<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>]. Going to scale with a research-tested intervention is more than replication in large populations. Options, knowledge processes, and technologies are expanded to build capacity and influence decision-makers [<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and understand implementation and cost of programs [<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Costs of national distribution can be daunting, so affordable scale-up methods are needed to maintain sufficient intervention effectiveness, as interventions' effectiveness often declines [<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] due to reduced dose and fidelity [<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and adaptions to fit contextual/budget parameters [<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Information on costs and intervention delivery resources are under-reported in dissemination and implementation [<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p>
              <p id="p0010">A randomized trial is being conducted to compare two methods of scaling up, nationwide, an effective occupational sun protection intervention, <italic>Sun Safe Workplaces</italic> (<italic>SSW</italic>), that promotes policy and education for outdoor workers [<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>]. Americans laboring outdoors are regularly exposed to high doses of solar ultraviolet radiation over many years [<xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] that elevate risk for skin cancer [<xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>], especially keratinocyte cancers [<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>] but also melanoma [<xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. A method utilizing digital technology to conduct virtual communication with workplace managers is being compared to the original intervention method that relied on in-person contacts. The intervention is being disseminated to state departments of transportation (DOTs), public employers with large numbers of employees who work outdoors. The evaluation will explore whether the scale-up method that uses digital technology produces a lower implementation rate than the original in-person method by testing the following hypothesis:</p>
              <p id="p0015">H: Compared to employers in the in-person scale-up method, fewer employers receiving the digital scale-up method will deliver education and implement other sun safety action for employees.</p>
              <p id="p0020">Analyses are also exploring whether <italic>SSW</italic> can be delivered cost-effectively to worksites using the digital scale-up method, which contains scale-up costs. “Cost-effective” in our case means that digital method should be chosen over in-person despite a lower worksite implementation rate if the cost savings from the digital method are at least as much as a decision-maker would accept in exchange for fewer implementing worksites.</p>
              <p id="p0025">Several frameworks have guided scale-up, such as collaborative models that stress planning, finances, and systems [<xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], interactive systems approaches [<xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], and process models such as EPIS (exploration, preparation, implementation, and sustainability) [<xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The present trial was based on the RE-AIM framework (<underline>R</underline>each, <underline>E</underline>ffectiveness, <underline>A</underline>doption, <underline>I</underline>mplementation, and <underline>M</underline>aintenance) [<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], a robust framework for program dissemination [<xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. RE-AIM can address costs and economic outcomes across general and multiple dimensions of the model [<xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] including at the organizational and individual levels [<xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. It applies to the health policy arena by estimating public health impact and integrating policies with health promotion strategies [<xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In RE-AIM, cost influences several aspects of dissemination (e.g., intervention intensity is positively related to effectiveness but negatively to implementation) [<xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The economic analysis will examine key resource elements that include distribution, effectiveness, and replication and implementation costs [<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The scale-up methods, randomized trial design, and results from the baseline survey of managers on occupational and personal sun protection are presented in this paper.</p>

                <p id="p0030">The randomized trial is underway and designed to compare the distribution of SSW using the original in-person method to a digital method for meetings and training. The protocol originally included 200 fire departments and state departments of transportation (DOTs) enrolled in two waves (to make it more feasible) into a randomized, pretest-posttest two-group experimental design. Employers were to be stratified by size (large v. small; median split on number of employees) and solar intensity (a proxy for climate and UV), which had been significant covariates in our past research [<xref rid="bb0180" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. After pretesting, regional districts in the DOTs were randomized to the in-person or digital scale-up method, originally in a planned 1:3 ratio. The intervention period lasts 20-months for each district, after which posttesting will be completed. All procedures were approved by the Western Institutional Review Board.</p>

                <p id="p0035">After the trial commenced, the sample size was reduced to 138 because of budget constraints created by a reduction in the budget from the awarding agency. Also, the sample was altered to include just state DOTs. This also occurred because of budget constraints when a) cost of identifying fire departments was higher than expected, b) the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officers (AASHTO) was able to attract a large number of state departments of transportation to enroll, and c) state DOTs had similar structures with managers and employees organized into multiple regional districts. Regional districts became the unit of randomization rather than individual departments. Another change was that the policy measure was changed from an outcome variable to a moderator variable, because in state DOTs, written policies on sun protection are set at the central state office, with employee education delivered at the regional district level. As all 50 state DOTs were invited to participate, stratification by size and solar intensity region was eliminated. Instead, randomization occurred within state and each state had regional districts assigned to in-person and digital scale-up strategies (except one state that had only a single participating district, which was assigned to in-person strategy). Combined across states, districts were assigned in a 1:2 ratio to in-person to digital strategies. Finally, plans to pretest employees were eliminated due to budget constraints and reluctance by state DOT managers to provide access to employees prior to participating in the study.</p>

                <p id="p0040">State DOTs in all 50 states were invited to participate in the trial by a letter sent to the state DOT directors from the AASHTO Chief Executive Officer along with a description of the study. Project investigators followed up by telephone and email to secure agreement to participate. A key contact at the state office provided information on the state DOT districts, including district locations and characteristics, and manager names to be sent the pretest. Eligibility criteria for DOT regional districts were a) being a regional district in a participating state DOT, b) located in the United States, c) having the state DOT provide written safety policies at pretest, and d) having at least 6 managers complete the pretest. Eligibility criteria for managers included a) being in a management or front-line supervisory position in a regional district; b) supervising outdoor workers; c) consenting to participate, and d) completing the pretest. The manager cohort included Safety Officers/Leads, Safety Coordinators, Maintenance Administrators/Supervisors, Resident/Construction Engineers, Maintenance/District Superintendents, Operations/Infrastructure Managers, and Project/Section Supervisors. Managers were sampled by position at pretest and persons holding those same positions will be posttested. Survey invitations were sent by email followed by weekly reminders for up to 5 weeks. After that, persistent non-responders received a printed survey by U.S. mail, with a return-addressed stamped envelope. If the position holder changes, we will attempt to posttest both the new and original position holders. At posttest, eligibility criteria for employees to be assessed are a) being employed part/full-time in a participating regional district, b) working at least part of daytime hours outdoors, and c) consenting to participate. Employees will be sampled at posttest from employee rolls. Districts were the unit of randomization within each state. After each state completed the pretest protocol, the project statistician randomized districts into scale-up strategy (in-person or digital).</p>

It promoted comprehensive occupational sun protection (i.e., adoption of sun safe policies and provision of sun safety education) to ensure employee sun safety was promoted and supported long term. The intervention was based on principles of Diffusion of Innovations Theory (DIT) and two theories of relationship development – social penetration theory [<xref rid="bb0185" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and stages of relational development [<xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>].

In meetings and follow-up communication with managers, program staff aimed to a) reduce managers' uncertainty [<xref rid="bb0245" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="bb0250" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] about sun safety; b) highlight advice from national health authorities to build credibility/trust [<xref rid="bb0255" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="bb0260" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]; and c) obtain commitment to adopt and implement the policies/education [<xref rid="bb0265" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0270" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0275" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>].</p>
                <p id="p0050">Operationally, <italic>SSW</italic> consisted of personal visits with managers and materials promoting sun protection policies and education [<xref rid="bb0280" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>].

The <italic>SSW</italic> website was provided to workplaces with promotional materials on: skin cancer and UV, risk factors, personal risk assessment, workplace prevention strategies (i.e., sunscreen, sunglasses, long-sleeved shirts, hats, shade, scheduling), prevention at home, and online workplace audit and policy writing tool. Program staff conducted in-person Sun Safety Training to staff during worksite visits that presented: 1) The U.S. Skin Cancer Problem; 2) The Sun, UV Rays and Skin Cancer; 3) Assessing Your Personal Risk; and 4) Practicing Sun Safety. A Sun Safety Tool Box provided support materials for policy and education (i.e., worksite audit and facts sheets on sun safety and barriers to policy implementation and theory-based printed posters, risk assessment brochures, and tip cards for employees). In monthly follow-up contacts, staff sustained the relationship with managers, supported their decisions on sun safety policies and education, and problem-solved barriers [<xref rid="bb0285" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="bb0290" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>].</p>

                <p id="p0055">The digital scale-up method for distributing <italic>SSW</italic> aims to virtualize the in-person contacts, trainings, and policy tools, using conferencing technology, an online training platform, and the <italic>SSW</italic> website to reduce cost and expand reach, deliver standardized, engaging content, provide flexibility to fit the worksite's schedules and environments, and increase portability [<xref rid="bb0295" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. The digital method has the same goals and schedule, and similar components, as the original <italic>SSW</italic> and advocates that employers adopt comprehensive sun safety policies and employee education. The virtual meetings and follow-up communication are being conducted by multi-model synchronous web-based video conferencing (i.e., Zoom) or telephone conference call technology. In most cases, a single key contact manager meets with program staff but where possible staff seeks to meet with additional managers to enhance knowledge sharing, idea generation, synergistic conversations, and collaborative learning [<xref rid="bb0300" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="bb0305" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. An online version of the Sun Safety Training was produced that could be used in groups or individually. The content was updated and expanded to address UV and skin cancer, personal skin cancer risk, sun protection practices on the job (e.g., UV Index, shade, protective clothing, hats, sunglasses and sunscreen), and skin self-examination. Finally, all printed materials, Sun Safety Tool Box, posters, risk assessment brochures, and tip cards were converted to a digital format and are available on the <italic>SSW</italic> website, where managers can download them for use with employees<italic>.</italic>

                <p id="p0065">To improve communication with managers in both scale-up methods, procedures were developed to tailor the communication with managers to their readiness to adopt occupational sun safety, based on DIT and a protocol developed in another project: Agenda Setting (i.e., need for sun safety), Matching (i.e., fit of sun safety with existing policy/procedures), Structuring (i.e., initial implementation of policies/actions), and Clarifying (i.e., communicating with employees, other managers, and clients to garner support and counter opposition). By tailoring on readiness, program staff connects with districts where they are in the innovation process so they provide the most relevant coaching and resources. A tailored report on the DOT's current support and actions for occupational sun safety is prepared for state-level key contacts based on the existing sun safety content in their written policies and managers' responses to a pretest survey and a checklist of workplace sun safety actions they complete during the first meeting. The report presents a plan for implementing sun safety for employees with resources matched to state contact's readiness.</p>

Composite scores will assess presence, strength, intent, and responsibility from a coding protocol developed previously [<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Specifically, it assesses 15 policy categories: engineering controls (physical environment of the workplace), administrative controls (workplace procedures), and employee education (workers' sun safety). Each category receives a point (0,1) for presence (total score = 15) and a 3-level strength score (−1 = not allowed, 0 = not mentioned, 1 = allow/ recommend, 2 = require; total score = 30). Policies on engineering controls (scheduling/shade) and sun safety practices (hats/protective clothing/protective eyewear) could exist for reasons other than sun safety (e.g., to prevent injury), so those categories receive a point (0,1) when sun protection is explicitly cited (total intent score = 5). A 3-level responsibility score is assigned, noting who provides protection equipment (0 = not specified, 1 = employee, 2 = employer, total score = 10). These ordinal composite scores are continuous and summed across categories. Training ensured inter-coder reliability exceeds 0.70. There is no basis for the minimum number of components that must be changed to improve workplace sun safety, so we will assess both presence and extent of change. The ordinal measures can detect expansion of existing policies. The proportion of employers who have any policy will be estimated. We will also assess extent (number of elements) and strength (−1 = not allow, 0 = not mentioned, 1 = allow/ recommend, 2 = require summed across policy components) of policy.</p>

Perceived susceptibility to skin cancer is assessed by two Likert-type items for self and employees within the organization (1 = strongly disagree; 5 = strongly agree). Support for occupational sun protection is measured by two Likert-type questions: I personally support adopting policies to protect employees from the sun at my organization and Employees should take action on their own to protect themselves from the sun while at work, without my organization telling them to do so (reverse coded). Managers rate occupational sun protection (i.e., changing formal written policies, procedures, and training in my organization to protect employees' skin and eyes from the sun) on six innovation characteristics suggested by DIT: [<xref rid="bb0210" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0215" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0220" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0225" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>] necessary, too expensive, compatible with work procedures, too complicated, acceptable to employees, and would improve organization's existing risk management or employee wellness programs (1 = strongly disagree; 5 = strongly agree). Managers and employees report if the organization has a formal written policy, administrative procedure, or training standard on sun protection of employees and unwritten informal standard operating procedures on sun safety (i.e., presence and content of procedures). Those aware of a policy also indicate degree of acceptance (How much do employees that report to you agree with the formal written policy; Do I agree with the formal written policy [1 = not at all; 3 = very much]) and compliance (How much are the employees that report to me following the policy; Do I follow the policy [1 = not at all; 5 = completely]) with the policy on sun protection.</p>

Managers report on the amount outdoor work: Whether they work mostly outdoor, mostly indoors, or outdoors and indoors equally; and number of hours spent working outdoors in a typical week in the summer (April to October) and winter (November to March). Their tanning desires are measured by an item asking if they thought they looked better with a tan (1 = strongly disagree; 5 = strongly agree [<xref rid="bb0390" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]).

                    <p id="p0175">The primary analysis will model the cost-effectiveness of digital relative to in-person scale-up strategy, based on the estimated rate of employers (i.e., regional districts) who implement policies and education and the cost of delivering each intervention. Secondary analyses will explore the representativeness of districts who implement the interventions. The proportion of regional districts adopting sun safety education in the trial establishing the effectiveness of <italic>SSW</italic> was used to estimate the sample size of districts. To be conservative, we expected implementation to be slightly lower in the in-person scale-up group than in the original trial and designed the sample size of the digital scale-up group to be larger, on the possibility it produces a lower implementation rate than in-person method. In the <italic>SSW</italic> trial, the proportion of districts implementing education was 0.80 (40 of 50), but we assumed that in-person scale-up method will have a lower rate of implementing education of 0.600. We further expected up to 10% of the organizations to be unavailable/refuse to provide follow-up data. A sample of 40 regional districts assigned to the in-person group, with 36 providing full data, allows for 95% confidence intervals (CI) for proportions of 0.424 to 0.759 when true proportion of districts providing education is 0.600. For the digital scale-up method, the sample was designed to have similar precision even if the proportion implementing education is one-tenth as large as the in-person group, i.e., 0.060 implementing education. A sample of 100 districts, with 90 providing full data, assigned to digital scale-up group allows for 95% CI for proportions of 0.021 to 0.131 when the true proportion providing education is 0.060 using exact clopper pearson calculations. Comparisons of education have &gt;80% power to test implementation rate differences between interventions. The smallest sample size would be 42 and 84 respectively, but 84 does not provide for an estimated nonzero lower limit of the 95% CI for implementation, a key figure for calculating cost-effectiveness. Thus, the sample size was increased to provide a nonzero lower limit of the 95% CI. We invited all eligible managers in the DOT regional districts, with the aim of pretesting 840 (6 per district) so we could reasonably expect to posttest 672 (5 per district; 80% follow-up).</p>

As noted, we assume the proportion of districts in the in-person scale-up group who implement education is 0.600. The rate may be lower in the digital scale-up group but by how much is unknown. Thus, based on the rate of 0.600 for districts in the in-person group, we estimated power for a range of proportions implementing policy in digital group for a low <italic>n</italic> = 36 for in-person and <italic>n</italic> = 90 for digital (expecting 90% with complete data in our original sample size calculations).

                    <title>Cost-effectiveness analysis</title>
                    <p id="p0190">The economic evaluation will explore whether <italic>SSW</italic> can be delivered cost-effectively by a digital scale-up method to worksites producing a lower implementation rate than by an in-person method but at substantially lower cost. To begin the cost analysis, we will estimate implementation of education in two ways, i.e., if at least 1 manager reports training for districts and the average number of managers who report it. We will create similar measures of implementation of other sun safety actions, including if at least 1 manager reports implementing the action and the average number of managers who report it. Implementation will be defined conservatively, i.e., district both delivers training and other sun safety actions, and liberally, i.e., either training or other sun safety actions. Next, we will use an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) to summarize the economic effects of the digital scale-up method (“intervention”) relative to the in-person scale-up method (“control”). The ICER is the incremental program cost (C) of digital method per incremental change in implementation rate (E [for effect]): <italic>ICER = (C</italic>
<sub><italic>digital</italic></sub>
<italic>– C</italic>
<sub><italic>in-person</italic></sub>
<italic>) / (E</italic>
<sub><italic>digital</italic></sub>
<italic>– E</italic>
<sub><italic>in-person</italic></sub>
<italic>).</italic> In <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>
, digital scale-up is cost-effective relative to in-person if the ICER is in the gray area to the right of the dashed line, which represents the dollar value of an additional unit of effect (i.e., either maximum willingness to pay (WTP) for an additional implementing worksite or minimum willingness to accept (WTA) cost savings in lieu of a worksite that does not implement). If the ICER is to the left of the dashed line, in-person scale-up is considered cost-effective relative to digital. If digital scale up were both less costly and more effective than in-person scale-up, a negative ICER would imply economic “dominance” of digital over in-person. Conversely, a positive ICER (e.g., both numerator and denominator negative) would indicate the average cost savings for a non-implementing worksite that would have implemented sun safety policy under in-person scale-up but not under digital scale-up. In this case, cost-effectiveness depends on one's willingness to accept a given level of digital scale-up cost savings from a worksite not implementing at or below its cost savings (see <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). We will not have access to WTP/WTA data from participating agencies or worksites, so we cannot state definitively that either digital or in-person scale-up methods will be cost-effective relative to the other. However, we will strive to validate our ICER results using external comparators (e.g., budgets for known implemented health-related policies and programs). Note that this is not an analysis of <italic>SSW</italic> simply delivered “as is” to more worksites. Content remains the same, but the delivery mechanism and associated resources differ between the two scale-up methods.<fig id="f0005"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Approach to Cost-effectiveness Analysis Comparing Digital to In-person Scale-up Strategy.</p></caption><alt-text id="al0005">Fig. 1</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr1_lrg"/></fig></p>
                    <p id="p0195">For policy purposes, development costs will be considered “sunk” and excluded, so the economic evaluation will be that of an existing program. However, to the extent possible, digital method development costs will be tracked and reported as appropriate. Research and evaluation costs will be removed. Univariate and multivariate sensitivity analyses will model representativeness. Regional district size will be examined to evaluate the digital scale-up method's ability to (cost-effectively) contact individual workers. It may be cost-effective but if mostly small districts implement, digital scale-up's representativeness (i.e., “reach”) is limited among individual workers. Further, we will calculate ICERs within each of the five U.S. Census regions, with similar ratios indicating representativeness across regions. Our cost analysis will not include or account for potential feedback effects, such as business interactions that expose other worksites to the digital method or long-term health outcomes, such as reduced skin cancer incidence.</p>
                    <p id="p0200">We will extend the economic analysis by recalculating ICERs based on number of employees that report pre-post improvement in sun protection (see below). This analysis will address effectiveness, i.e., program cost required to motivate positive behavior change by employees.</p>

                    <p id="p0205">Analyses will also test the hypothesis that the digital scale-up method would result in less implementation of training and other sun safety actions by the district than the in-person method. The unit of analysis will be the district, using logistic regression analyses and Poisson regression (or negative binomial regression, if the assumptions of the Poisson model is not fulfilled) (i.e., Proc MIXED, Proc GLIMMIX), adjusting for significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.10) covariates. Representativeness of implementation achieved by the digital method will be explored by adding to the regression models variables such as size and U.S. Census region and other moderators potentially affecting implementation. These variables will be added as fixed factors and their interactions with condition examined at <italic>p</italic> = 0.05 (2-tailed), unadjusted for multiple comparisons. Using the correlation structure from the primary outcome variables, we will assess order effects to determine which components may drive the implementation of policy and education.</p>
                    <p id="p0210">Districts' engagement with the two scale-up methods may differ and affect implementation rates achieved by them. We will explore mediation of education and other sun safety actions implementation rates by program exposure assessed by process measures as ancillary analyses, using mediational analyses from Judd and Kenny [<xref rid="bb0400" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>] and elaborated by MacKinnon [<xref rid="bb0405" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. To satisfy the conclusion of mediation, significance will be determined via interval estimation using a bootstrap estimate [<xref rid="bb0410" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. Ratio of indirect to total effect will estimate proportion of effect mediated by engagement.</p>

. As would be expected for senior staff, they are generally long-term employees (nearly 20 years on average), almost all make decisions about workplace safety and health policy, procedures, and training, and serve as opinion leaders on those topics. Many regularly read professional publications and attend conferences, which can expose them to innovative ideas such as occupational sun safety. Nearly all managers are male. Education is widely distributed, with one-fifth having a high school education, one-third some education beyond high school, and 43.4% a college degree. Many of these managers work outdoors at least part time on the job (66.5%). Nearly a quarter (24.4%) have skin types at high-risk for skin cancer and several have been diagnosed with skin cancer. This is not too surprising given that nearly all managers are white (&lt;9% another race and only 5.6% Hispanic).

Very few managers reported other occupational sun protection actions such as providing shade in the work environment, monitoring the UV Index and modifing work activities for UV levels, asking contractors/subcontractors to comply with sun safety policy in the organization's work environment, conducting risk assessments of sun exposure and sun protection, or encouraging employees to get regular skin checks with self- or clinical exams.

Few managers limited their time outdoors during midday (24.4% always or often), the daily period of highest UV.<table-wrap position="float" id="t0015"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Sun protection practices and sunburn prevalence reported by regional district managers at baseline.</p></caption><alt-text id="al0025">Table 3</alt-text><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Characteristic</th><th>Overall Sample</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>N</td><td>1113</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">Sun Protection Practices (mean, sd)<xref rid="tf0050" ref-type="table-fn">1</xref></td></tr><tr><td>Sunscreen with an SPF 15 or greater on my face through the use of aftershave, face lotion or make-up.</td><td>2.61 (1.33)</td></tr><tr><td>Sunscreen with an SPF 30 or greater on my exposed body parts (not including aftershave, face lotion or make-up).</td><td>2.98 (1.12)</td></tr><tr><td>Clothing specifically to protect my skin from the sun, such as long-sleeved shirts and pants.</td><td>3.06 (1.10)</td></tr><tr><td>Hat with a wide-brim all the way around (this includes a hat with a flap in the back that protects the ears and the neck).</td><td>2.48 (1.24)</td></tr><tr><td>Hat with any type of brim.</td><td>3.78 (1.08)</td></tr><tr><td>Sunglasses.</td><td>4.18 (1.02)</td></tr><tr><td>Limit my exposure to the sun during the mid-day hours.</td><td>2.84 (1.00)</td></tr><tr><td>Stay mostly in the shade when it's available.</td><td>3.29 (0.96)</td></tr><tr><td>Have sunscreen, a hat, and eye protection with me at work when I am outdoors.</td><td>3.79 (1.01)</td></tr><tr><td>Composite sun protection score<xref rid="tf0055" ref-type="table-fn">2</xref></td><td>3.16 (0.65)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">Sunburn</td></tr><tr><td>Number of sunburns in past year (mean, sd)</td><td>1.62 (2.99)</td></tr><tr><td>Number of sunburns in past year that occurred while working outdoors (mean, sd)</td><td><break/>1.10 (2.56)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tf0050"><label>1</label><p id="np0050">1 = never, 2 = rarely, 3 = sometimes, 4 = often, and 5 = always.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tf0055"><label>2</label><p id="np0055">Cronbach's alpha (standardized) = 0.73.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p>

              <p id="p0260">Our team has successfully recruited two-fifths of the state DOTs in the United States to participate in the randomized trial on the cost effectiveness of two scale-up methods. These departments employ over 100,000 workers, many of whom work outdoors. As the managers reported, employees work for many years at the state DOTs (managers average nearly 20 years) and spend substantial time outdoors both in the summer and winter, making them vulnerable to solar UV skin damage including skin cancer. The focus on a single industry provides some measure of control against confounding of organizational characteristics but the 21 states are diverse in terms of climate and ambient UV levels, and racial composition of the workforce, that alter their approach to on-the-job sun protection. The sample of managers in this trial is similar to the one we recruited from cities, counties, and special taxing districts in Colorado, with the exception that they were longer-term employees, more variable on education, and more predominately male.</p>
              <p id="p0265">A very pronounced knowledge-practice gap appears to exist in occupational sun safety in these organizations, according to reports from managers. Many of the managers recognized that they and their employees are at risk for skin cancer and are supportive of occupational sun safety, but only some managers said their organizations were taking steps to address it. Only half of managers said training was occurring, but two-thirds said the organization was communicating about sun safety with employees. Employees were more likely to receive training than managers. This may be an oversight given that managers are spending time outdoors on-the-job and training may motivate them to be opinion leaders for occupational sun safety. Two-thirds of managers said that organizations were providing personal protection resources, but most employees were not using them according to managers. Training and communication to employees may need to be expanded to get more use of personal protection. Further, the organizations were not taking advantage of the UV Index to alert employees or adjust work schedules for the risks posed by high UV, although we have found in the past that adjusting work schedules is one of the least likely actions by employers. In this case, concerns over safety of employees (i.e., motorist can see them better during daylight) may favor daytime work schedules. The organizations also are not providing shade, although this too may be challenging for employees who are traveling long distances to monitor and work on roadways. Still, shade canopies can be mounted on some equipment (e.g., tractors) and vehicles and other environmental objects such as trees, underpasses, and buildings cast shade and can be used during breaks to reduce UV exposure (although auto glass blocks UVB better than UVA).</p>
              <p id="p0270">Still, the initial support for occupational sun protection and the fact that state DOTs were taking some actions on sun safety bodes well for the successful scale-up and implementation of our evidence-based sun safety intervention. There does not appear to be strong resistance from the management of DOT regional districts to occupational sun safety. Rather, it may be that sun safety is a lower priority than other safety issues such as safe driving practices, fall prevention, hazardous materials, and construction site safety. Also, well-designed training and resources for sun safety at a reasonable cost may not be widely available to risk management and training staff.</p>
              <p id="p0275">Information on costs (and intervention delivery resources) is essential for moving research into practice [<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and under-reported in dissemination and implementation [<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Cost will undoubtedly be relevant when attempting to reach and serve these very large organizations in the trial that maintain transportation infrastructure of over 1.9 million square miles. The size of the regional districts makes them more manageable organizational units for testing the scale-up methods. However, the regional districts do pose many challenges to implementation of occupational sun safety, with most districts having employees based in multiple locations, from central offices and yards to remote maintenance facilities. Travel costs are substantial to reach employees with in-person training and work with local managers across locations within these districts to take other actions on sun safety. Digital communication can reach the outlying locations for far lower costs; however, digital communication may not be easy with some of these districts. Many locations of remote yards are small and in very rural areas, without a lot of technology resources. Many jobs require employees to travel to outlying locations and rely on using vehicles and heavy equipment, not work in offices and locations where computers are readily available. However, these circumstances are true for many outdoor jobs, increasing the potential generalizability of the study. Facilitating implementation is the presence of formal risk management and training personnel and procedures in all of the state DOTs, which was typically the initial point of contact for the study.</p>
              <p id="p0280">The trial design has a number of strengths and weaknesses. The participation of a large proportion of a major U.S. public sector industry adds to the realistic nature of the test and generalizability. The prospective, randomized trial design is rigorous and will control several confounders among the regional districts. The multiple levels of analysis, from policy coding to surveys of managers and employees will provide a more comprehensive assessment of the scale-up processes and impact. The scale-up methods are based on a theoretical framework used extensively in the implementation sciences and the assessment of cost, as well as impact on implementation activities and employee behavior, will provide key information for decision makers charged with distributing evidence-based programs and adopting them with at-risk groups.</p>
              <p id="p0285">However, the study is limited by a single industry, although it does have a variety of outdoor occupations, and the fact that it is a public rather than private employer. Public employers may have longer term employees, have less concerns over profits that limit resources for health programs, and provide other types of occupations. Public employers supported by taxes also can experience budget constraints. The implementation and some of the cost measures will be reported by managers, rather than obtained from observations, which are impractical in this geographically large study area but which are subject to social desirability biases, demand effects, and memory errors. We will conduct a small-scale validation study on these reports. State DOTs centralize some of the risk management functions, so the regional districts will vary in their abilities to make independent decisions on all sun safety actions.</p>
              <p id="p0290">This paper was written during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. While DOTs were classified as essential employers in all states, all DOTs suspended in-person training and out-of-town travel was inadvisable during stay-at-home orders in many states. Thus, the in-person scale up method has been suspended during the spring and summer 2020. The digital scale-up procedures have continued in a very limited number of districts where managers were still willing to engage with our intervention staff. As states transition to safer-at-home and other forms of opening, the scale-up methods will be re-started. We should be able to intervene and posttest in 10 states with little interruption to the study timeline but posttesting will be delayed in 11 states to provide sufficient time to implement scale up procedures through the spring and summer 2021. We will handle this deviation in intervention duration by including a covariate for the time between baseline and posttest period and use least squares means for the adjusted post analysis that accounts for possible attenuation of effects due to the longer interval of time.</p>
