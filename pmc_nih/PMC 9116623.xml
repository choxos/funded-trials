                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Pregnancy and motherhood increase the risk for long-term exposure to physical, psychological and sexual intimate partner violence (IPV; sexual or physical violence by current or former partners). Pregnant women and mothers with children under 5 who have experienced IPV exhibit poor physical and mental health and obstetric outcomes. Depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are the two most common mental health consequences of IPV. There is good evidence that women with good social support have better mental health and IPV outcomes.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>This study will develop MOthers’ AdvocateS In the Community (MOSAIC) Plus intervention for pregnant women and mothers with children under the age of 5. MOSAIC uses trained mentor mothers and has been found to reduce subsequent IPV. This study will blend the original MOSAIC intervention with principles of interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) to address symptoms of depression, PTSD, and prevent subsequent risk of IPV. We will conduct a pilot randomized trial of the MOSAIC Plus intervention compared to the traditional MOSAIC intervention to determine its feasibility and acceptability. Study samples include focus groups (n = 36), open trial (n = 15), and a randomized pilot trial including 40 pregnant women and mothers with children under 5 who report current/recent of IPV and elevated symptoms of maternal depression and/or PTSD. The study’s primary outcome will be changes in maternal depressive and PTSD symptoms. Secondary outcomes will include reduction in subsequent IPV, improvement in functioning, changes in social support and effectiveness in obtaining resources.</p>

              <title>1. Background</title>
              <p>Violence against women is a global human rights concern and a significant public health challenge; one in three women experience lifetime physical and/or sexual violence [<xref rid="pone.0267679.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. As many as 5.3 million U.S. women experience intimate partner violence (IPV; referring to sexual or physical violence by current or former partners) annually [<xref rid="pone.0267679.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are the two most common mental health consequences of IPV. In turn, developing depressive and PTSD symptoms after experiencing IPV increases future risk of IPV [<xref rid="pone.0267679.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. IPV is also associated with chronic physical health problems [<xref rid="pone.0267679.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0267679.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and self-harm [<xref rid="pone.0267679.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p>
              <p>Pregnancy and motherhood increase the risk for prolonged exposure to physical, psychological and sexual IPV [<xref rid="pone.0267679.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. IPV can start or worsen during the perinatal period. As many as 4% to 8% of women report IPV during pregnancy [<xref rid="pone.0267679.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Compared to those who do not experience IPV, mothers who experience IPV during pregnancy or in the year following childbirth are at elevated risk for experiencing physical injury, other medical challenges, homicide [<xref rid="pone.0267679.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and mental health problems including suicide [<xref rid="pone.0267679.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0267679.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Twenty percent of postpartum deaths are attributable to suicide [<xref rid="pone.0267679.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p>
              <p>Pregnant women and mothers who experience IPV may not seek care when they need it [<xref rid="pone.0267679.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. For example, perinatal women with experience of IPV may not initiate prenatal care until third trimester [<xref rid="pone.0267679.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. They are more likely than women without IPV to miss three or more prenatal visits [<xref rid="pone.0267679.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Perinatal women with experience of IPV are twice as likely to have babies with low birthweight [<xref rid="pone.0267679.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], higher rates of severe acute maternal morbidity [<xref rid="pone.0267679.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and have infants requiring intensive care [<xref rid="pone.0267679.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. IPV increases risk of depressive and PTSD symptoms, which in turn increases risk of subsequent IPV [<xref rid="pone.0267679.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0267679.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0267679.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p>
              <p>Interventions are needed that address both, especially for pregnant women and mothers of young children [<xref rid="pone.0267679.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0267679.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. There are very few interventions that effectively reduce IPV among pregnant women and mothers with children under 5 who report IPV [<xref rid="pone.0267679.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0267679.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. One of them, Mother AdvocateS In the Community (MOSAIC) forms the basis of this study [<xref rid="pone.0267679.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Very few existing interventions address maternal depressive and PTSD symptoms that often follow IPV [<xref rid="pone.0267679.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0267679.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0267679.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. An integrated intervention that addresses elevated symptoms of maternal depression and PTSD while reducing subsequent IPV is needed.</p>
              <p>Mother AdvocateS In the Community (MOSAIC) [<xref rid="pone.0267679.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] is a non-professional intervention delivered by mentor mothers from the community to reduce IPV in pregnant women and mothers with children under 5 [<xref rid="pone.0267679.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The intervention combines elements of mentoring and IPV-specific support provided by mentor mothers. MOSAIC was tested in a fully-powered RCT for pregnant women and mothers with children under 5 in Australia and was found to reduce subsequent IPV [<xref rid="pone.0267679.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, the effects of the intervention depression were not significant and PTSD symptoms were not evaluated. The proposed study will augment MOSAIC with principles of an evidence-based intervention to improve maternal mental health. Interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) is the front-line treatment for perinatal depression [<xref rid="pone.0267679.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and has been found to reduce PTSD symptoms in the perinatal period [<xref rid="pone.0267679.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. IPT addresses maternal mental health by helping women increase their general social support systems and build communication skills and confidence to access needed resources and help. IPT can be effectively delivered by lay providers [<xref rid="pone.0267679.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. IPT is theoretically consistent with the MOSAIC approach and addresses the consequences of IPV. IPT focuses on building or better utilizing one’s social support network within the context of a life stressor [<xref rid="pone.0267679.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0267679.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The proposed study aims to integrate IPT principles into MOSAIC to address both IPV and its mental health sequelae.</p>

                  <title>2.1.2. Manual development</title>
                  <p>The goal of the development phase will be to develop the MOSAIC Plus intervention manual. We will begin with the MOSAIC intervention manual which was developed to reduce subsequent IPV experiences in perinatal women and mothers with children under 5 [<xref rid="pone.0267679.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] but was not specifically designed to address concomitant mental health issues. The MOSAIC intervention uses non-professional befriending, domestic violence-specific advocacy and mentoring by mentor mothers from the community [<xref rid="pone.0267679.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The mentor mothers may or may not have lived-experience with IPV, maternal depression or PTSD. MOSAIC Plus will expand the social support offered by mentor mothers in MOSAIC with IPT approaches for broadening women’s social support network generally. In MOSAIC Plus, we will expand the existing MOSAIC manual by integrating IPT approaches to address depressive and PTSD symptoms among IPV-exposed mothers. IPT conceptualizes interpersonal functioning and disturbance in social support as intimately linked to psychological symptoms [<xref rid="pone.0267679.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. IPT identifies a difficult life event or current interpersonal problem and addresses it by helping the individual to build or better utilize the individual’s extended social support network with specific IPT strategies that include psychoeducation, communication skills practice, and exploration/encouragement.</p>

                  <title>2.1.3. Focus group discussions</title>
                  <p>We will conduct focus group discussions with potential study participants and potential mentor mothers to enhance and tailor the MOSAIC intervention to address mental health outcomes (reduction in depressive symptoms and PTSD symptoms). We will use information generated from focus group discussions to ensure that our manual expansion optimally addresses the needs of our target population, the mentor mothers, and the eventual implementing systems. We will conduct six focus group discussions of 6–8 members each (for 30–44 in total). Three groups with pregnant women and mothers of young children with current, recent or prior experience of IPV, 2 groups with potential mentor mothers, and one group with staff from community agencies (the settings where we would envision MOSAIC Plus being implemented if found promising). Focus group discussions will explore perspectives of potential clients and mentor mothers regarding the potential acceptability, benefits, and risks of the proposed MOSAIC Plus intervention and of the IPT components we plan to integrate. The goal of the 3 focus groups with pregnant women and mothers with children under 5 with IPV experiences will be to explore: (1) women’s perspectives on the greatest needs of IPV-exposed perinatal mothers; (2) what they would like most from mentor mothers to help with IPV, depression, and PTSD symptoms; and (3) feedback on the proposed MOSAIC Plus intervention and on the IPT-based components to be integrated. The goal of the two focus groups with nurse-family partnerships will be to explore ways to maximize acceptability of MOSAIC Plus, to integrate the intervention into their ongoing programs, and how to design the MOSAIC Plus program to maximize future implementability.</p>
                  <p>Participants for potential clients focus group discussions will be recruited from Hurley Medical Center’s perinatal clinic and YWCA using our standard study recruiting procedures and criteria. For the other two focus group discussions, we will recruit participants from local agencies serving mothers.</p>

                  <p>A moderator accompanied by a note taker will facilitate the focus group discussions, which will be recorded by using a digital audio recorder. The recordings will be transcribed verbatim by an experienced transcriber. We will use the framework approach by using a framework drawn from the data. We will modify our coding framework based on the newly emerging themes. For rigorous and high-quality data management, we will use NVivo qualitative analysis software, version 12 [<xref rid="pone.0267679.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. We will develop an outline of the MOSAIC Plus intervention manual based on the original MOSAIC intervention manual. We will embed contents relevant to reducing depressive and PTSD symptoms to the new manual based on results of the focus group discussions. We will enhance, refine and adapt the MOSAIC Plus intervention for the outcomes of interest based on the results of the focus group discussions. Dr. Hailemariam will conduct member checking with selected study participants to validate the fit, credibility and transferability of the results (i.e., main themes and translation of them into the manual itself) from the focus group discussions.</p>

                  <title>2.2.1. Sampling and recruitment</title>
                  <p>The randomized pilot study will involve 40 women who are 1) pregnant and/or are mothers of children under 5 and report IPV experiences in the past 6 months (as assessed by Composite Abuse Scale [<xref rid="pone.0267679.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]) 2) aged 18 or above, and 3) have elevated depressive and/or PTSD symptoms (including full disorder). This will be determined using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) with a cutoff point of ≥9 [<xref rid="pone.0267679.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], and the Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS) with a cut-off point of ≥40 [<xref rid="pone.0267679.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. We anticipate that the majority of study participants will have both elevated depressive and PTSD symptoms, given that 50% of individuals with PTSD also have comorbid major depressive disorders [<xref rid="pone.0267679.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0267679.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], especially among women with IPV [<xref rid="pone.0267679.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Participants will be excluded if they (1) cannot provide the name and contact information of at least two locator persons (~6%), and/or (2) do not have access to any telephone, (3) have a current serious mental illness requiring intensive care or (4) cannot understand English well enough to understand the consent form or assessment instruments when they are read aloud. Virtually all pregnant women and mothers of children under 5 accessing care in these settings speak English. An initial sample of 15 pregnant women and mothers with children under 5 will be recruited to participate in a nonrandomized open pilot trial and will receive the proposed MOSAIC Plus mentoring intervention. No woman will be excluded from recruitment on the basis of race, sexual orientation, gender identity? or disability status.</p>
                  <p>Participants will be recruited from two local agencies, the Hurley Medical Center OBGYN clinic and the YWCA-Flint. The YWCA offers domestic violence support, emergency shelter and long-term housing for persons with domestic violence exposure. For women identified as having a positive response to screening questions at those agencies, the provider in charge will ask “would you be interested in meeting with a person to hear about a voluntary project about peer support for pregnant women and mothers?”. The assessing provider will also explain that their decision whether to obtain additional information about the project has no potential impact on their access to other services at the agency. Women who are willing to meet with study staff will be given a referral slip by their providers which they will present to the study research assistant (RA). The study RA will meet potential participants in private locations at each agency. The RA will explain all aspects of the study, including confidentiality and its limits, and address questions. If the participant agrees, they will provide a written informed consent complete the baseline assessment. We will ask participants if they would like us to read consent forms aloud. The RA will emphasize that enrollment in the study is completely voluntary. Those who consent to participate will be provided with a copy of the informed consent document.</p>

                  <title>2.2.2. The MOSAIC Plus intervention</title>
                  <p>The MOSAIC Plus intervention will be delivered to those in the intervention arm as specified in the manual, for the duration of 9 months. After completing the screening interviews, the study research assistant will introduce consenting, eligible participants to a MOSAIC Plus trained mentor mother (See training procedures below). The mentor mothers will work as a mentors and advocates in the areas of IPV safety planning, building social support, managing depressive symptoms and enhancing effectiveness obtaining community resources. During the initial phase, mentor mothers will explain their roles as a MOSAIC Plus intervention provider and exchange contact information (i.e., the participant’s contact information and the mentor mother’s study cellphone number). In the following four weeks, the MOSAIC Plus mentors will meet their clients in a private, confidential location to assess if there is ongoing IPV, conduct safety planning, strength and needs assessment. They will collaboratively set a realistic treatment plan for the intervention period. MOSAIC Plus mentor mothers will maintain regular contact with their clients at least once a week (may be more as needed). Information obtained during initial assessment (safety, strengths, needs) will be used to plan the rest of the mentoring intervention in the subsequent months.</p>
                  <p>After the initial phase is complete, as in the original MOSAIC intervention, mentor mothers will continue meeting their clients (in person or by phone) for a session no less than 60 minutes. This level of contact is high but was feasible and acceptable in the original MOSAIC trial [<xref rid="pone.0267679.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In person meetings will take place in the community at convenient, private, and safe locations (libraries, treatment facilities, public buildings) as suggested by the clients. Telephone meetings will only be made from a study telephone line given to each mentor mother. The mentor mothers will review their clients’ activities since the initial planning meeting and problem-solve any challenges they may encounter. Mentor mothers also facilitate their clients’ access to other services by informing, educating and advocating for them when needed. Their services will involve 1) building social support networks by helping their clients solve any interpersonal difficulties they may have within their networks. Mentor mothers will also work with their clients by linking them with new social support groups and networks available in the community. They will focus on social support because strong social support protects against the negative effects of IPV on mental health [<xref rid="pone.0267679.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. 2) Mentor mothers will inform women about services and advocate for their access. Women with experience of IPV may have limited access to information, and hence poor access to services. Mentor mothers will help improve their access to services by actively identifying the needed services, creating proper linkage with providers and advocating for their access by addressing the barriers they may encounter. 3) Plan and monitor their safety by helping their clients create a personalized safety plan and monitor the potential of future violence and address any challenges they may have. Mentor mothers will employ the skills of active listening, reflecting and validating feelings, showing empathy, inspiring hope and facilitating a trusting relationship with other people in their personal networks or people who are service providers. The IPT component in this intervention includes the focus on addressing interpersonal conflict within the woman’s social network. MOSAIC Plus is consistent with the original intent of MOSAIC (support the mother directly), but utilizes a broader conceptualization (i.e., help the mother build her own social support network) and evidence-based IPT strategies for doing so.</p>

IPT’s focus on building social support is a good fit for mothers who have experienced IPV because social support is protective against the negative effects of partner violence [<xref rid="pone.0267679.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0267679.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]and can help reduce future IPV [<xref rid="pone.0267679.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0267679.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Perinatal women mothers with ongoing experience of IPV often struggle establishing social networks [<xref rid="pone.0267679.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] and therefore additional help developing social support is useful. Social support also helps with depressive and PTSD symptoms [<xref rid="pone.0267679.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Lack of social support is associated with antepartum depressive symptoms [<xref rid="pone.0267679.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Studies suggest that social support, received in the form of informational, instrumental and emotional support, reduces depressive and PTSD symptoms in women with IPV experience [<xref rid="pone.0267679.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0267679.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0267679.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Studies in population-based samples of women have found that women with experience of IPV with stronger social support are protected against the negative effects of IPV on mental health including depression and PTSD [<xref rid="pone.0267679.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0267679.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. In contrast, lack of perceived social support is a primary risk factor for developing PTSD following a traumatic experience [<xref rid="pone.0267679.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0267679.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>].

                  <p>We will recruit 8 mentor mothers and train them to deliver the MOSAIC and the MOSAIC Plus intervention with fidelity. Turnover in community interventionists can be high. Therefore, by training 8 mentor mothers, the study is likely to have at least 6 for the trial. If needed, additional mentor mothers can be recruited and trained. Mentor mothers will be selected with the help of our Community-Based Organization Partners (CBOP), our community partner for this study. With the support from CBOP and its network of partners, we will identify and interview women from Flint Genesee County. Mentor mothers will be: 1) 21 years of age and above, 2) have good listening skills and embody a non-judgmental attitude, 3) a permanent resident in Genesee County, 4) report that they are able to use a computer to upload intervention recordings and have access to a computer with internet, 5) are mothers, 6) have access to reliable transportation and 7) are available up to 2 hours per week by phone or in person. Mentor mothers will have weekly group supervision and case discussion with Dr. Hailemariam. Dr. Hailemariam will also listen to audio recordings of the mentor mother intervention sessions and will provide feedback. During weekly supervision or in the audio files, if a mentor appears to be triggered by a case discussion or talks about being overwhelmed in a group supervision meeting, Dr. Hailemariam will promptly schedule an individual meeting and debrief session with the mentor mother. Mentor mothers will be constantly reminded that if they are feeling overwhelmed by a case (eg., thinking about the case more than they want to, poor sleep, changes in appetite, dreaming about the case, feeling anxious) they will be encouraged to contact Dr. Hailemariam for a debrief and supportive supervision.</p>

Mentor mothers will be given a study cellphone to communicate with their clients. They will meet their clients in public places with private space such as health facilities, libraries and parks to reduce potential risk of victimization. To protect mentor mothers’ privacy, mentor mothers will not share their residence addresses and last names with their clients. We will train mentor mothers on how to respond to clients’ substance abuse. Moreover, safety plans will be adapted and tailored to each participating woman based on her needs. Mentor mothers will also be trained on burnout management, self-care and will be offered an opportunity to debrief with study investigators quarterly, and to call on an as needed basis.</p>

                  <p>As this is an intervention development study, our primary goal is assessment of feasibility and acceptability of the MOSAIC Plus intervention and research procedures. However, pilot data can be used to demonstrate whether the effects of treatment look promising across a set of outcome variables, to begin to examine distribution of outcome variables to inform future analytic strategies, and to suggest, in concert with results from larger scale clinical trials in related fields, the range of effect sizes that would be reasonable to expect in a future trial. We will obtain the between treatment condition effect size estimates (with 95% CI) at each assessment (e.g., Cohen’s d or h) and the correlation between the same dependent variable at adjacent assessments. We will have complete data on approximately 40 participants (the minimum expected after participant loss due to attrition). Sample size guidelines for treatment development from Rounsaville et al. [<xref rid="pone.0267679.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>] recommend 15 to 30 participants per cell. Given that group means begin to stabilize by around 15, we believe a sample of 20 in each condition should provide some information relevant to demonstrating potential promise for MOSAIC Plus.</p>

We will separately calculate the effect size and 95% CI for the effect of the intervention on proposed target mechanisms including improved social support (measured using MOS-SS) and effectiveness obtaining resources (measured using EOR scale). Separate exploratory tests for differences between conditions will use HLM, with baseline scores as covariates. We will then explore the association of each of these target mechanisms with changes in our primary outcome (reduction in depressive and PTSD symptoms) from baseline through 9 months. These exploratory analyses will inform full tests of mediation (i.e., tests of the hypothesis that the effects of MOSAIC Plus on reduced depressive symptoms is mediated through improvement in social support and effectiveness obtaining resources) in a subsequent fully powered trial. Although we expect the MOSAIC Plus intervention show evidence of preliminary effectiveness, should the intervention show no or limited evidence, exploratory tests of target mechanisms will also provide some initial information about whether MOSAIC Plus’ limited effectiveness was due to failure to engage target mechanisms or to the target mechanisms not being associated with the final outcome. Target mechanisms are presented in <xref rid="pone.0267679.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> below.</p>

              <title>3. Discussion</title>
              <p>The current study is designed to provide evidence for the feasibility and acceptability of a mentor mother-delivered intervention for IPV and depressive and/or PTSD symptoms among pregnant women and mothers with children under the age of 5. Moreover, the study also aims to pilot research procedures for a subsequent fully powered trial comparing MOSAIC Plus to the original MOSAIC.</p>
              <p>Addressing IPV and its associated mental health symptoms (i.e. depression and PTSD) is important because unaddressed mental health challenges and IPV increase the woman’s risk of mortality, morbidity, future child abuse, suicidal ideation, and femicide [<xref rid="pone.0267679.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. Women with elevated depressive and PTSD symptoms are at greater risk of experiencing future IPV [<xref rid="pone.0267679.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0267679.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. Moreover, the stigma of mental illness also reinforces abusers’ ability to manipulate, control and discredit survivors, and weaken vital social support [<xref rid="pone.0267679.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. Therefore, depressive and PTSD symptoms not only follow IPV and are associated with suffering and morbidity, they potentiate future IPV risk. This bidirectional relationship between depression/PTSD and IPV suggests that addressing these issues simultaneously may help end the vicious cycle of victimization and mental health vulnerability. Therefore, an integrated intervention for reducing subsequent IPV, elevated symptoms of maternal depression and PTSD in pregnant women and mothers with children under 5 is needed.</p>
              <p>Evidence exists that paraprofessionals can deliver mental health interventions for perinatal women with similar fidelity to mental health professionals [<xref rid="pone.0267679.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. Results from the original MOSAIC study also confirm that paraprofessional/mentor mother-delivered interventions reduce the risk of subsequent IPV among pregnant women and mothers with children under 5 [<xref rid="pone.0267679.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p>
              <p>IPT can be delivered by non-professional lay providers. Community-based, non-professional delivered, evidence-based mental health interventions can help reduce health disparities present in underserved groups [<xref rid="pone.0267679.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. For example, IPT has been found to be effective for treating major depressive disorder using providers with no particular educational background, who were native Ugandans treating individuals in rural villages [<xref rid="pone.0267679.ref088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. Several other studies have also shown that non-professional or paraprofessional workers with appropriate clinical supervision can effectively deliver IPT [<xref rid="pone.0267679.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0267679.ref089" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0267679.ref090" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>], including studies conducted by our team [<xref rid="pone.0267679.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0267679.ref089" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. Therefore, incorporating IPT principles into MOSAIC for use by the mentor mothers is feasible and appropriate.</p>
              <p>To date, no study has found that an IPV focused intervention for any group of women significantly reduced both future IPV risk and depressive and PTSD symptoms. Addressing depressive and PTSD symptoms while effectively reducing future risk of IPV in mothers who report IPV is crucial.</p>
              <p>This study expands the literature because it will develop and pilot-test a paraprofessional-delivered intervention to address symptoms of maternal depression and PTSD in a highly vulnerable sample; pregnant women and mothers with young children who report experience of IPV.</p>
