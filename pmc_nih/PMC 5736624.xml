                <p id="Par1">Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) is a myeloproliferative disorder of childhood caused by mutations in the Ras pathway. Outcomes in JMML vary markedly from spontaneous resolution to rapid relapse after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Here, we hypothesized that DNA methylation patterns would help predict disease outcome and therefore performed genome-wide DNA methylation profiling in a cohort of 39 patients. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering identifies three clusters of patients. Importantly, these clusters differ significantly in terms of 4-year event-free survival, with the lowest methylation cluster having the highest rates of survival. These findings were validated in an independent cohort of 40 patients. Notably, all but one of 14 patients experiencing spontaneous resolution cluster together and closer to 22 healthy controls than to other JMML cases. Thus, we show that DNA methylation patterns in JMML are predictive of outcome and can identify the patients most likely to experience spontaneous resolution.</p>

              <p id="Par3">Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) is a rare and aggressive myeloproliferative disease of childhood associated with heterogeneous outcomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. JMML is initiated by mutations in Ras pathway genes that lead to hyperactive Ras signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Several recent reports have identified secondary mutations in epigenetic-regulating genes, including members of the polycomb repressor complex 2 (PRC2), whose presence correlates with higher rates of relapse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. In addition, <italic>SETBP1</italic> is mutated in up to 30% of patients as a secondary event, and we previously showed that subclonal mutations in <italic>SETBP1</italic> at diagnosis are associated with poor outcome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par4">Spontaneous resolution of JMML with minimal to no traditional chemotherapy or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is rare but has been reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Although this phenomenon is more common in patients with germline syndromes such as Noonan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> and CBL syndrome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, it has also been seen in a handful of patients with somatic <italic>NRAS</italic> and <italic>KRAS</italic> mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> that are typically less than one year of age and have high platelet counts. Interestingly, spontaneous resolution does not commonly occur in patients with Neurofibromatosis type I, a common congenital condition with a high incidence of JMML. In general, robust biomarkers to predict spontaneous resolution are still lacking.</p>
              <p id="Par5">We know that patients with identical somatic Ras pathway mutations have divergent outcomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. We hypothesized that either the cell in which genetic mutations arise or potentially non-genetic changes such as DNA methylation could explain differences in outcome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Considering that DNA methylation has a critical role in the differentiation of normal fetal and adult hematopoietic stem cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, we suspected that leukemogenesis in JMML is in part determined by alterations in the JMML methylome, and that such differences may predict outcome. Importantly, prior reports investigating the role of DNA methylation in this leukemia were limited to a handful of candidate genes previously shown to be altered in other myeloid malignancies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. We therefore sought an unbiased, genome-wide approach to define the DNA methylome of newly diagnosed JMML patients and then evaluated whether a specific DNA methylation signature was capable of predicting outcome with a particular emphasis on identifying patients who experienced spontaneous resolution.</p>
              <p id="Par6">In this study, we generated genome-wide DNA methylation data in a discovery cohort of 39 patients with JMML and validated our findings in an independent cohort of 40 additional patients. We found that JMML patients cluster into three subgroups that were independently predictive of outcome based on their methylomes. The low methylation subgroup was associated with high rates of survival and spontaneous resolution, whereas the high methylation subgroup was associated with dismal survival. These data suggest that DNA methylation can be used to predict outcome in JMML.</p>

CD14<sup>+</sup> cells would be most likely to be enriched with a leukemic signature due to the monocytic nature of the disease. To determine the allelic fraction of somatic Ras pathway mutations in different cell lineages we performed deep sequencing of individual mutations in CD3<sup>+</sup>, CD14<sup>+</sup>, CD19<sup>+</sup>, and CD34<sup>+</sup> compartments and observed nearly identical allelic fractions in CD14<sup>+</sup> cells compared to unselected mononuclear cell DNA (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par20">JMML is an aggressive myeloproliferative disorder predominantly affecting infants and toddlers. It is considered one of the purest forms of a Ras-driven leukemia with ~95% of patients harboring at least one mutation in the Ras pathway. Several groups have now reported that secondary genetic mutations within and outside of the canonically defined Ras pathway are present in roughly a third of patients and that these mutations are associated with a worse prognosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Even with this knowledge, identifying patients in need of more intensive therapy at diagnosis is still a challenge for providers. Equally difficult is predicting the phenomenon of spontaneous resolution frequently experienced by patients with Noonan or CBL syndrome, and occasionally in young patients with somatic <italic>NRAS</italic> and <italic>KRAS</italic> mutations.</p>
              <p id="Par21">One proposed model for understanding the divergent outcomes in this disease centers around the putative initiating hematopoietic cell in which the causative Ras mutations first arise. We first hypothesized that patients who experience spontaneous resolution would have somatic mutations only in late, committed progenitors as opposed to patients with aggressive disease who possibly have mutations occurring in earlier stem cells. For example, we have previously demonstrated that <italic>SETBP1</italic> mutations occur in early progenitor cells including CD34<sup>+</sup>/CD45RA<sup>−</sup>/CD90<sup>+</sup> (putative HSCs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Here we show that patients who experienced spontaneous resolution also had somatic mutations in HSCs and thus the cell of origin in which genetic mutations arise are unlikely to explain differences in outcome. We therefore explored epigenetic changes, specifically DNA methylation, as a possible explanation for divergent outcomes.</p>
              <p id="Par22">Using our discovery cohort, we found that JMML patients suffering from aggressive disease have a distinctly hypermethylated DNA profile at the most variable CpG sites compared to healthy controls in the same age range. In contrast, nearly half of JMML patients clustered more closely with healthy controls who were of a similar age range than with other patients suffering from aggressive disease. All but one of these patients who experienced spontaneous resolution clustered with healthy controls and we thus propose that further developing this methylation signature into a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments/College of American Pathologist (CLIA/CAP) approved assay could lead to the first biomarker capable of predicting a milder disease course not requiring HSCT. In preparation for implementing a clinical assay, we have agreed to pool all publicly available DNA methylation data in this disease and develop a single sequencing-based assay across multiple continents. Of note, this pattern was consistent in bone marrow, peripheral blood, and spleen, suggesting that a fundamental mechanism underpins the DNA methylation signature in all of the infiltrating cells involved in this disease.</p>
              <p id="Par23">Pathway analysis confirmed that the most variably methylated CpG sites that were used in our supervised analysis were centered on genes involved in development and Ras/MAPK/PI3K/AKT signaling. However, after analyzing a small but representative subset of our JMML patients at the gene expression level, we believe that altered DNA methylation in JMML is functioning in a more complex manner than simply altering expression of associated genes. Recent work has demonstrated that patients with more than one mutation in the Ras pathway have inferior event-free survival compared to patients with only one Ras pathway mutation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Our analysis shows that patients with more than one mutation tend to display hypermethylated DNA; however, the relationship between the two is not yet clear. In several myeloid malignancies, alterations in DNA methylation are a result of genetic mutations in epigenetic-regulating genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Surprisingly, JMML patients with any secondary mutation inclusive of those affecting genes in the Ras pathway, transcription factors and the spliceosome machinery all have hypermethylated signatures, not just patients with secondary mutations in genes directly affecting DNA methylation. We therefore hypothesize that alterations in DNA methylation are an early event in JMML and are permissive for the acquisition of secondary mutations and not vice versa.</p>
              <p id="Par24">Several important questions remain, including what initially causes the hypermethylation seen in patients with JMML? Similarly, how does a hypermethylated signature contribute to the aggressive disease seen in these patients? In addition, what role if any will hypomethylating agents have in this disease, and are they capable of reversing the hypermethylated state observed at diagnosis?.</p>
              <p id="Par25">This study highlights the utility of DNA methylation as a potential biomarker that could be used in a combined risk stratification algorithm along with clinical characteristics including age, fetal hemoglobin, and number of somatic mutations at diagnosis in future clinical trials. For JMML patients that are classified into the lowest methylation group clinicians could now consider careful observation or treatment with low intensity regimens like azacytidine or 6-mercaptopurine. In contrast, patients with the highest levels of methylation have unacceptably poor outcomes even after HSCT, with 75% of these patients experiencing relapse of their disease post-transplant. These patients should receive novel treatments in the context of clinical trials even at initial diagnosis.</p>
              <p id="Par26">In summary, our results show the potential of DNA methylation as a biomarker that can both identify patients who are predicted to fail HSCT as well as those who are most likely to experience spontaneous resolution and could be observed to avoid the acute and late side effects of HSCT.</p>

Image capture, analysis and base calling was performed using Illumina’s CASAVA 1.7. eRRBS sequencing data was aligned to whole genome using the bismark alignment software<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> with a maximum of two mismatches in a directional manner and only uniquely aligning reads were retained. To call methylation score for a base position, we required that at least 10 reads cover the position with a phred base quality of at least 20. Only CpG dinucleotides that satisfy these coverage and quality criteria were retained for subsequent analysis. Percentage of bisulfite converted Cs (representing unmethylated Cs) and non-converted Cs (representing methylated Cs) were recorded for each C position in a CpG context. We retained methylation calls for all CpG sites with at least 10 reads of coverage in all datasets (790,359 CpG sites). We then calculated the difference at each CpG site between DNA from unselected and CD14<sup>+</sup> cells for each patient, as well as the concordance correlation coefficient between the two datasets. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering was performed using the most variable CpG sites (standard deviation &gt;30 = 3277 CpG sites) using Ward’s method. Implementation was through the hclust function in the stats R package.</p>

We ranked probes from most typical to least typical on the discovery cohort, where the determination of “typical” was based on the distance from the sample to the centroid of the corresponding cluster summed over all samples. We made calls on the validation cohort using 5 to 200 probes, adding the best probes 5 at a time, with distance to the discovery cohort centroid as the basis of the call. Disagreements of calls based only a subset of probes compared to all 1527 probes were considered errors.</p>
