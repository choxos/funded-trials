                <p>Socially warm experiences, when one feels connected to others, have been linked with physical warmth. Opioids, hypothesized to support social bonding with close others and, separately, physical warmth, may underlie both experiences. In order to test this hypothesis, 80 participants were randomly assigned to the opioid antagonist, naltrexone or placebo before neural and emotional responses to social and physical warmth were collected. Social and physical warmth led to similar increases in ventral striatum (VS) and middle-insula (MI) activity. Further, feelings of social connection were positively related to neural activity to social warmth. However, naltrexone (<italic>vs</italic> placebo) disrupted these effects by (i) reducing VS and MI activity to social and physical warmth, (ii) erasing the subjective experience–brain association to social warmth and (iii) disrupting the neural overlap between social and physical warmth. Results provide additional support for the theory that social and physical warmth share neurobiological, opioid receptor-dependent mechanisms and suggest multiple routes by which social connections may be maintained.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Close social connections and the feelings that come from being connected to other individuals are of utmost importance. Decades of research confirms that humans need close social connections to grow and thrive (<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">Bowlby, 1988</xref>; <xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">Leary and Baumeister, 1995</xref>; <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">Holt-Lunstad <italic>et al.,</italic> 2010</xref>). However, relative to its suggested importance, feelings of social connection with our closest loved ones and the neurochemical, neural and psychological mechanisms that support such feelings are poorly understood. Therefore, we examine in the current study the causal role of opioids in feelings of social connection, neural activity to an experience of social connection and the potential overlapping contribution of physical warmth to social connection.</p>

              <title>Opioids and social connection</title>
              <p>Due to the importance of social connection for well-being, basic homeostatic mechanisms that maintain individuals at an optimal level of functioning may be involved in the maintenance of social bonds (<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">Panksepp <italic>et al.,</italic> 1980a</xref>; <xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">Panksepp, 1998</xref>). One candidate system that has received increasing attention in recent years is the endogenous opioid system, best known for its role in pain relief and pleasure (<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">Leknes and Tracey, 2008</xref>). According to the brain opioid theory of social attachment, opioids contribute to emotional responding within close relationships and to the behavior or feelings that might promote further bonding (<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">Panksepp <italic>et al.,</italic> 1980a</xref>; <xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">Machin and Dunbar, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">Inagaki, 2018</xref>). Evidence for the theory comes primarily from animal research, which has shown that pharmacologic manipulations of the opioid system alter social-bonding behavior [reviewed in <xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">Machin and Dunbar (2011</xref>) and <xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">Loseth <italic>et al.</italic> (2014</xref>)]. For instance, blocking endogenous opioid activity (<italic>vs</italic> placebo; <xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">Panksepp <italic>et al.</italic>, 1980b</xref>; <xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">Shayit <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>) or using genetic knockout models (<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">Moles <italic>et al.,</italic> 2004</xref>) reduced social-bonding behavior. Conversely, naltrexone (<italic>vs</italic> placebo) has also been shown to increase social-bonding behavior (e.g. <xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">Martel <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>; <xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">Schino and Troisi, 1992</xref>). Thus, animal research shows that opioids affect social behavior, suggesting opioids may also have implications for the affective experience of social connection in humans.</p>
              <p>The relatively smaller human literature on opioids and social bonding also suggests opioids alter the affective experience related to social bonding (<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">Inagaki, 2018</xref>). Naltrexone (<italic>vs</italic> placebo) reduced affiliative feelings to lab tasks designed to promote feelings of social connection to close others (<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">Inagaki <italic>et al.,</italic> 2015</xref><italic>,</italic><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">2016a</xref>) and more general affiliative stimuli of strangers (<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">Depue and Morrone-Strupinsky, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">Schweiger <italic>et al.,</italic> 2013</xref>; <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">Chelnokova <italic>et al.,</italic> 2014</xref>). Outside of the lab, daily feelings of social connection are also reduced by naltrexone (<italic>vs</italic> placebo; <xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">Inagaki <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016a</xref>).</p>
              <p>Opioids are theorized to contribute to social bonding via the system’s actions on distinct brain regions. Indeed, the first indirect evidence for opioids and social bonding came from observations that the neural regions most densely concentrated in opioid receptors (<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">Cross <italic>et al.,</italic> 1987</xref>; <xref rid="ref51" ref-type="bibr">Zubieta <italic>et al.,</italic> 2001</xref>) are also the regions that contribute to social bonding. These regions include the ventral striatum (VS), middle insula (MI), ventral tegmental area (VTA), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC; <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">Bartels and Zeki, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">Aron <italic>et al.,</italic> 2005</xref>; <xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">Acevedo <italic>et al.,</italic> 2012</xref>; <xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">Inagaki and Eisenberger, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">Atzil <italic>et al.,</italic> 2017</xref>). Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, which examines opioid activity <italic>in vivo</italic>, confirmed initial observational evidence. Endogenous opioid release in males (i.e. decreased binding of the μ-opioid-specific ligand [<sup>11</sup>C]carfentanil) increased in the insula and cingulate cortices after a laughter manipulation with friends (<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">Manninen <italic>et al.,</italic> 2017</xref>). In addition, greater laughter between friends was associated with opioid-receptor binding in the VS, OFC, anterior and middle cingulate cortices at baseline. Similarly, increased desire for social interaction was associated with left VS binding to learning that one is liked by an opposite-sex stranger (<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">Hsu <italic>et al.,</italic> 2013</xref>). Collectively, results from animals and humans point to the opioid system as a promising contributor to social bonding.</p>

              <title>Social–physical warmth</title>
              <p>Connecting with others is often described as a heart-warming or warm experience. More than metaphor, physical warmth, and the thermoregulatory pathways that keep individuals at an optimally warm core body temperature, may also contribute to experiences of social warmth, the experience of feeling loved by, cared for and connected to other people (<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">Panksepp, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">Inagaki <italic>et al.,</italic> 2016b</xref>). In particular, we have proposed that humans have an innate system that both supports social warmth and concurrently maintains core temperature for survival purposes (<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">Inagaki <italic>et al.,</italic> 2016b</xref>). The association between social and physical warmth may have then been strengthened by our very first social encounter: that between infant and caregiver. Warmth may have simultaneously signaled the proximity of a caregiver (physical warmth) and of potential care or connection (social warmth) such that later in life there may be a bidirectional relationship where activating either physical or social warmth might similarly activate the other.</p>
              <p>In support of this hypothesis, cutaneous warmth has been shown to affect social warmth and the reverse (though results are not uniform; <xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">Lynott <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). For example, holding a warm object (<italic>vs</italic> room temperature object) led to increases in affiliative feelings (<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">IJzerman and Semin, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">Fay and Maner, 2012</xref>). In the other direction, experimentally increasing feelings of social connection led to increases in feelings of warmth (<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">Inagaki and Eisenberger, 2013</xref>), whereas experimentally decreasing feelings of social connection led to decreases in perceptions of warmth (<xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr">Zhong and Leonardelli, 2008</xref>).</p>
              <p>More direct evidence for shared mechanisms comes from neuroimaging work in humans. Neural activity to a socially warm experience shared overlapping neural activity with physical warmth but not another pleasant task (<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">Inagaki and Eisenberger, 2013</xref>). Specifically, activity in the VS and MI, regions known to activate to warm thermal stimuli (e.g. <xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">Rolls <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>) and, separately, to close social connections (<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">Bartels and Zeki, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">Aron <italic>et al.,</italic> 2005</xref>; <xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">Acevedo <italic>et al.,</italic> 2012</xref>; <xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">Inagaki and Eisenberger, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">Atzil <italic>et al.,</italic> 2017</xref>), showed similar responses to both kinds of experiences. Thus, it is possible that these regions contribute to the convergence of the subjective experiences of warmth and social connection.</p>
            </sec>
            <sec id="sec4">
              <title>Opioids and physical warmth</title>
              <p>Opioids may also contribute to physical warmth, although current literature to support this hypothesis is sparse. In animals, opioids mediate changes in core body temperature (<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">Clark, 1979</xref>; <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">Adler <italic>et al.,</italic> 1988</xref>) with opioid agonists injected into the lateral cerebral ventricle leading to an increase in core body temperature (<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">Clark <italic>et al.,</italic> 1983</xref>) and opioid antagonists decreasing body temperature (<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">Handler <italic>et al.,</italic> 1992</xref>). Similarly, in humans, exogenously administered opiates alter correlates of thermoregulatory function (<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">Martin <italic>et al.,</italic> 1973</xref>; <xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">Kurz <italic>et al.,</italic> 1995</xref>). As reviewed above, physically warm experiences led to increases in feelings of social connection. Therefore, we expect opioids to alter the effect of physical warmth on feelings of social connection. That is, opioids might further affect social connection by increasing felt social connection when experiencing physical warmth.</p>
              <p>In the only study to examine the contribution of opioids to physical-warmth-induced feelings of social connection, participants took naltrexone and placebo before evaluating warm and cool stimuli (<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">Inagaki <italic>et al.,</italic> 2015</xref>). As expected, holding a warm (<italic>vs</italic> cool) object increased feelings of social connection. Naltrexone, however, specifically reduced feelings of social connection to holding the warm but not the cool object. Thus, it is plausible that opioids similarly contribute to social and physical warmth. However, whether opioids affect neural activity to both social and physical warmth and the potential link between the two experiences is currently unknown.</p>

              <title>The current study</title>
              <p>One way to examine the causal contribution of opioids to social bonding is to pharmacologically manipulate opioids. Therefore, the current study used a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled design with the opioid antagonist, oral naltrexone, to test the following primary aims: (i) the effect of naltrexone on feelings of social connection and VS and MI activity to a socially warm experience; (ii) the effect of naltrexone on the same outcomes to a physically warm experience; and (iii) the effect of naltrexone on the neural overlap between social and physical warmth. Based on the existing animal and human research on the contribution of opioids to both experiences of social connection and physical warmth, naltrexone (<italic>vs</italic> placebo) was hypothesized to reduce feelings of social connection and VS and MI activity to social warmth and physical warmth. Further, naltrexone was hypothesized to disrupt the neural overlap between social and physical warmth.</p>
              <p>Inherent in the perspective outlined above is that opioids and physical warmth are particularly relevant for social bonding that occurs with close others. That is, opioids likely contribute to the experience of connecting with friends, family and other people one feels particularly close to. Similarly, warmth may signal the proximity of close others, such as a responsive caregiver or loved one, whereas cold may signal the absence of close others. Therefore, a final aim of the current study was to assess naltrexone’s effect on responses to both close others and strangers and, separately, warm and cool stimuli. Naltrexone was not expected to affect responses to strangers or cool stimuli.</p>

For pre-scan message collection procedures, see <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Materials</xref>. Participants were told that the experimenters had asked their friends and family members to provide 12 messages each and that they would be reading the messages in the scanner (close other condition). In addition, participants read randomly selected messages from a previous participant’s friends and family members (stranger condition). No specific instructions were given as to what to think about while reading. Blocks began with a 2-s cue explaining whom the messages were from [e.g. The following messages are from Ed (example close other cue); the following messages are from a previous participant (stranger cue)] followed by three messages, either from a single close other or a stranger, presented for 5 s each. Blocks were separated by 6 s of fixation crosshair, and close other and stranger blocks were randomized. Presented were 40 sets of messages (20 close other; 20 stranger) over 2 functional runs. Examples of messages from close others in the current study include the following: <italic>‘</italic>I really appreciate the way you love and support me; our connection is one of the most beautiful things in my life.<italic>’</italic>; <italic>‘</italic>You are endlessly funny and bring joy to everyone around you.’; <italic>‘</italic>I love that I can always call on you to experience new things with.<italic>’</italic>; <italic>‘</italic>You light up my entire world.<italic>’</italic></p>

After motion correction, images were realigned to the MPRAGE, warped into Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space and smoothed with a 5-mm Gaussian kernel full-width, half-maximum. Contrasts for the main comparisons of interest were computed (social warmth task: messages from close others &gt; strangers; physical warmth task: warm &gt; cool; warm &gt; neutral; cool &gt; neutral) at the first level and then brought to the group level of analysis.

                <p>Naltrexone (<italic>vs</italic> placebo) did not alter feelings of social connection to the cool object [<italic>M placebo</italic> = 0.117, s.d. = 0.932; <italic>M naltrexone</italic> = 0.154, s.d. = 1.037; <italic>t</italic>(77) = 0.168, <italic>P</italic> = 0.434].

                <p>The effects of naltrexone on ratings of thermal intensity were also evaluated.

However, in a replication of our previous findings (<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">Inagaki <italic>et al.,</italic> 2015</xref>), there was no effect of naltrexone on perceptions of thermal intensity for either the warm [<italic>t</italic>(77) = 1.030, <italic>P</italic> = 0.153] or cool objects [<italic>t</italic>(77) = 1.007, <italic>P</italic> = 0.159], suggesting naltrexone did not alter the more objective perceptions of warmth.</p>

              <p>How do we feel close and connected to our loved ones? The present study is the first to show that the opioid antagonist, naltrexone, reduces VS and MI activity to both social and physical warmth and erases the neural overlap between the two experiences.

                <title>Brain opioid theory of social attachment</title>
                <p>The brain opioid theory of social attachment suggests that blocking opioid activity would subsequently alter social connection (<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">Panksepp <italic>et al.,</italic> 1980a</xref>; <xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">Panksepp, 1998</xref>). Consistent with some research findings on social behavior in animals, blocking opioids (<italic>vs</italic> placebo) in the current study reduced activity in the VS and MI to messages from participants’ own close others. In addition, naltrexone erased the positive correlation between feelings of social connection toward messages from close others and neural activity that was present in the placebo group. These results are the first to show that naltrexone causes a disconnect between subjective feelings of social connection and neural activity to reading messages that affirm one is loved, cared for, known and appreciated by their own loved ones.</p>
                <p>Although the drug effect on self-reported feelings of social connection to the social warmth task was in the expected direction, results did not reach statistical significance. In everyday life, meaningful messages from close others, like the ones presented in the current study, are rare. Therefore, any feelings of social connection experienced after reading such messages may not be reduced (at a statistically significant level) by a single drug administration. Indeed, in our previous work with naltrexone and the same social warmth task, naltrexone did not have an effect on feelings of social connection during the first presentation of messages (<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">Inagaki <italic>et al.,</italic> 2016a</xref>). Instead, the current results suggest that opioids may have a more nuanced effect on social connection experiences by not only altering neural responding but also disrupting the link between self-reported subjective experience and neural activity. Future work may wish to examine additional neurochemical contributors to self-reported feelings of social connection [e.g. oxytocin (<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">Bartz, 2016</xref>), dopamine (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">Atzil <italic>et al.,</italic> 2017</xref>)] and their interactions with opioids as they contribute to subjective social experience. However, taken together, the results on the effects of naltrexone to the social warmth task add to a growing literature to suggest that the central actions of opioids alter experiences of social connection in humans (<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">Machin and Dunbar, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">Nummenmaa <italic>et al.,</italic> 2015</xref>; <xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">Inagaki, 2018</xref>).</p>

                <title>Social and physical warmth</title>
                <p>The present research contributes additional data in support of the notion that social warmth and the feelings of connection that can result from interacting with our closest others may act on the same pathways as physical warmth. An emerging literature shows that physical warmth can cause increases in feelings of social connection and that feelings of social connection can likewise increase feelings of warmth (e.g. <xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">Inagaki and Eisenberger, 2013</xref>). Responses to social and physical warmth in the current study further suggest a link in two ways. First, holding a warm (<italic>vs</italic> cool) object increased feelings of social connection and VS and MI activity. That is, simply holding a warm object was sufficient to temporarily increase feelings of social connection and VS and MI activity. Second, neural responding to social and physical warmth showed overlapping activity in the VS and MI, regions previously associated with close social bonds (<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">Bartels and Zeki, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">Aron <italic>et al.,</italic> 2005</xref>; <xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">Acevedo <italic>et al.,</italic> 2012</xref>; <xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">Inagaki and Eisenberger, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">Atzil <italic>et al.,</italic> 2017</xref>).</p>
                <p>Naltrexone, however, disrupted the neural patterns present in the placebo condition. First, naltrexone reduced VS and MI activity to physical warmth. Second, and perhaps more notable, naltrexone altered neural responding such that the overlap in responding to social and physical warmth that was present in the placebo group was eliminated. Together, these results suggest that another route by which opioids contribute to social bonding is via its effects on physical warmth.</p>

                <title>Implications for social bonding and relationship maintenance</title>
                <p>Close social relationships that one maintains over time are the most critical relationships to health and well-being (e.g. <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">Agerbo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). The current results have implications for understanding how opioids contribute to the maintenance of close social bonds. Specifically, results support the theory that opioids might affect thermoregulatory pathways [afferent central nervous system (CNS) pathways that bring the physiological condition of the body to the brain] and thus thermoregulation, the process by which the body maintains its temperature around a normotensive range, but not set point, or the level at which warm is considered warm (<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">Adler <italic>et al.,</italic> 1988</xref>; <xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">Panksepp, 1998</xref>). In the current study, the thermoregulatory pathways tested include the VS and MI and the action of naltrexone on these brain regions. It is important to highlight that additional research that directly measures thermoregulation and its correlates (e.g. core body temperature, fever and shivering) as they contribute to social connection is needed. However, consistent with our theoretical perspective, naltrexone left perceptions of how warm the stimuli were rated (i.e. thermal intensity) unaltered but instead affected the more subjective experience of warmth. A possibility that could be tested with additional research is that the subjective experience of social bonding (feelings of social connection) is maintained similarly to how the thermoregulatory system maintains core temperature around a set point. In other words, feelings of social connection may fluctuate around a normotensive range, with the endogenous opioid system assisting in this maintenance. There is at least one study suggestive of a relationship between thermoregulation and the maintenance of affective experience. A single dose of whole-body heating (<italic>vs</italic> sham procedure) in individuals suffering from depression produces improvements in depressive symptoms both 1 week and 6 weeks after treatment, suggesting a long-term effect (<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">Janssen <italic>et al.,</italic> 2016</xref>).</p>
                <p>Also consistent with the notion that opioids contribute to the maintenance of close social bonds, naltrexone affected neural responses to messages from some of our participants’ own close others (e.g. parents, friends, romantic partners). However, naltrexone did not alter similar neural responses to messages from strangers. In a similar vein, naltrexone altered neural responses to warm stimuli, which may signal the proximity of close others but not cool stimuli (for the ROI results only). We have previously shown that the effects of naltrexone can be separated from general pleasant responding to both social warmth (<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">Inagaki <italic>et al.,</italic> 2016a</xref>) and physical warmth (<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">Inagaki <italic>et al.,</italic> 2015</xref>). The current results further clarify the contribution of opioids to social connection to suggest that opioids alter neural activity toward close others and related stimuli that might signal the presence of close others but not toward those one is not close to. These results not only underscore the similarities between social and physical warmth but also highlight an unrecognized and understudied side effect of opioid antagonism, namely altered neural responses to one’s own close others. If opioids affect VS and MI activity to one’s own close others after a single experience with these individuals (i.e. the social warmth task in the current study), it is possible opioids affect experiences that underlie bonding over time. However, as noted above, additional research that examines the long-term effects of weeks or months of naltrexone treatment are needed to directly assess the effects of naltrexone on relationships with close others over time.</p>
                <p>Some limitations warrant discussion. The effect of naltrexone on self-reported feelings of social connection to social and physical warmth resulted in a pattern consistent with hypotheses but was not statistically significant. Indeed, the effect of naltrexone on feelings of social connection shows mixed results with some studies showing a statistically significant reduction (<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">Inagaki <italic>et al.,</italic> 2015</xref>; <xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">Inagaki <italic>et al.,</italic> 2016a</xref>), some showing no effect (<xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">Tarr <italic>et al.,</italic> 2017</xref>) and some showing an effect only after considering moderators (<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">Depue and Morrone-Strupinsky, 2005</xref>). Similarly, holding a warm <italic>vs</italic> a cool object did not increase VS and MI activity corrected at the whole brain in the placebo group. However, holding a warm object compared to a neutral, room temperature object increased VS and MI activity, in line with primary hypotheses and in a replication of our previous findings (<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">Inagaki and Eisenberger, 2013</xref>). Additional research with larger samples and tighter control over the thermal stimulation may be needed to understand the effect of naltrexone on subjective social feelings toward close others and tease apart the brain’s response to warmer <italic>vs</italic> cooler temperatures.</p>
                <p>In conclusion, this is the first study to show that naltrexone, an opioid antagonist, disrupts experiences of social connection by reducing VS and MI activity to social and physical warmth. Further, the effect of naltrexone was specific to close others and warmth, as naltrexone did not alter neural responses to strangers or cool stimuli. Within its limitations, the results contribute to an understanding of opioids and social bonding via two converging theories: the brain opioid theory of social attachment and a social-physical warmth overlap.</p>
