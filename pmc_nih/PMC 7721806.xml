                <p id="Par1">Combining PD-L1 blockade with inhibition of oncogenic mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling may result in long-lasting responses in patients with advanced melanoma. This phase 1, open-label, dose-escalation and -expansion study (NCT02027961) investigated safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of durvalumab (anti–PD-L1) combined with dabrafenib (BRAF inhibitor) and trametinib (MEK inhibitor) for patients with BRAF-mutated melanoma (cohort A, n = 26), or durvalumab and trametinib given concomitantly (cohort B, <italic>n</italic> = 20) or sequentially (cohort C, n = 22) for patients with <italic>BRAF</italic>-wild type melanoma. Adverse events and treatment discontinuation rates were more common than previously reported for these agents given as monotherapy. Objective responses were observed in 69.2% (cohort A), 20.0% (cohort B) and 31.8% (cohort C) of patients, with evidence of improved tumor immune infiltration and durable responses in a subset of patients with available biopsy samples. In conclusion, combined MAPK inhibition and anti–PD-L1 therapy may provide treatment options for patients with advanced melanoma.</p>

However, as a significant proportion of patients do not respond or progress after initial therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, further treatment options are needed for patients with advanced melanoma. Of particular scientific and clinical interest has been combining both modes of therapy, MAPK pathway inhibitors with cancer immunotherapies. This is supported by the knowledge that blocking oncogenic <italic>BRAF</italic><sup>V600</sup> signaling results in increased sensitivity of melanoma cells to immunotherapy and increasing antitumor activity in combination with immunotherapy in mouse models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, while in patients it makes melanoma metastases permissive to immune cell infiltration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par4">To maximize the clinical benefits of these distinct classes of therapeutics, several studies have explored concurrent and sequential combinations of MAPK inhibitors and immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with advanced melanoma; many have examined combinations of BRAF and MEK inhibitors with anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 antibodies in patients with <italic>BRAF</italic><sup><italic>V600</italic></sup> mutant melanoma. A single-arm phase 1b study of the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib, the MEK inhibitor cobimetinib, and the PD-L1 antibody atezolizumab showed an objective response rate of 71.8% and a median response duration of 17.4 months<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Furthermore, a phase 1 trial followed by a randomized phase 2 trial of the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib and the MEK inhibitor trametinib with or without pembrolizumab demonstrated significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) with triple therapy despite an 8.4% lower response rate, and at the expense of increased toxicity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Recently, results from the primary analysis of the first randomized phase 3 clinical trial comparing the triple combination of atezolizumab with vemurafenib and cobimetinib, compared to placebo-controlled vemurafenib and cobimetinib, demonstrated a significant improvement in PFS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Patients in the control arm with vemurafenib and cobimetinib double targeted therapy had a median PFS of 10.6 months, which was improved to 15.1 months with the addition of atezolizumab (hazard ratio 0.78)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. There was an increase in some toxicities with the triple therapy, in particular, increased creatinine phosphokinase, transaminases, and lipase, as well as an increase in arthralgia and pyrexia, but no change in the rate of discontinuation of study drugs due to toxicities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par5">Here we report the phase 1 clinical trial testing triple therapy with dabrafenib, trametinib, and the anti-PD-L1 antibody durvalumab in patients with <italic>BRAF</italic><sup><italic>V600</italic></sup>-mutant melanoma with a long-term follow-up (at least 3 years in all patients) to analyze the effect of these therapies on patients. The study includes immune monitoring to explore potential combinatorial effects as well as interference between these therapeutic modalities. In addition, we examine clinical and immunologic effects of concurrent and sequential dosing of trametinib and durvalumab in patients with <italic>BRAF</italic>-wild type melanoma, including those with prior progression on anti-PD-1 antibodies, to explore the potential interactions between these agents in patients in whom immunologic antitumor effects are expected to predominate.</p>

                <title>Patient characteristics</title>
                <p id="Par6">Between December 2013 and April 2015, 99 patients were screened. Sixty-eight patients were enrolled from 11 study centers (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>, Supplementary Data 1), with 31 patients subsequently excluded due to screening failures. Data cutoff for this analysis was May 30, 2018, when there were at least 3 years of follow-up in all study subjects.</p>
                <p id="Par7">Cohort A initially included six patients who received durvalumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks (Q2W) plus standard doses of dabrafenib plus trametinib. Once the safety of this dose was assessed, an additional 20 patients received durvalumab at 10 mg/kg Q2W, of which 7 were enrolled and treated in the second dose-escalation phase and 13 were enrolled and treated as part of the dose-expansion phase. Twenty patients were enrolled in cohort B and received durvalumab 10 mg/kg Q2W concomitantly with trametinib 2 mg every day (QD); 6 patients were enrolled and treated in the dose-escalation phase and 14 patients were enrolled and treated in the dose-expansion phase. In cohort C, 22 patients received the same combination but sequentially (trametinib: days 1–42; durvalumab: from day 29); 7 patients were enrolled and treated in the dose-escalation phase and 15 patients were enrolled and treated in the dose-expansion phase (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). The median age in cohort A was 49.0 years (range: 23–71) (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), which is consistent with younger age observed in patients with <italic>BRAF</italic><sup><italic>V600</italic></sup><italic>-</italic>mutant melanoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Cohorts B and C had a median age of 68.0 years (range: 31–85) and 63.0 years (34–84), respectively (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The majority of patients—21 (80.8%), 18 (90.0%), and 18 (81.8%) for cohorts A, B, and C, respectively—had stage IV metastatic melanoma. Median lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels at baseline for cohorts A, B, and C were 206.5 units per liter (U/L), 215.0 U/L, and 225.0 U/L, respectively; levels were elevated in approximately one-third of patients per cohort (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). In cohort A, 10 (38.5%) patients had received prior systemic therapies, which was a lower proportion than those seen in cohort B (13 [65.0%]) and cohort C (15 [68.2%]).

                <p id="Par8">The median treatment duration was 10.4 months in cohort A, 6.3 months in cohort B, and 5.9 months in cohort C. Eleven (42.3%), 6 (30.0%), and 5 (22.7%) patients, respectively, completed the intended 12 months of durvalumab treatment, and were eligible to continue with the targeted therapy beyond that time. For those who did not complete durvalumab treatment, the most common reasons for treatment discontinuation were disease progression, occurring in 8 (30.8%), 9 (45.0%), and 11 (50.0%) patients in cohorts A, B, and C, respectively, with adverse events (AEs), occurring in 5 (19.2%), 4 (20.0%), and 3 (13.6%) patients, respectively.

                <p id="Par19">Biopsies for analysis of changes in CD8+ T-cell infiltration by immunohistochemistry were available from 13 patients in cohort A, 12 in cohort B, and 5 in cohort C (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Baseline CD8+ cell infiltration was higher in cohort A (median density 432.0 cells/mm<sup>2</sup>) than in cohort C (388.2 cells/mm<sup>2</sup>), and highest in cohort B (median 835.5 cells/mm<sup>2</sup>); the difference may have been influenced by patients in cohort A being less likely to be pretreated for metastatic melanoma. Changes in immune infiltration were common in cohort A: CD8+ cell density increased in 9 of 13 biopsies at day 15. Changes in CD8+ cell density were not as consistent in biopsies of patients from cohorts B and C. Because patients in cohort C received sequential therapy with trametinib and durvalumab, with a partial overlap over 2 weeks, we analyzed CD8+ cell infiltration on day 15 when they were on trametinib alone and on day 43 when they were receiving the combination. However, there was no evidence of change in CD8+ cell density in the 3 patients that had sequential biopsies for analyses at all 3 time points (baseline, day 15, and day 43). Although the study was not powered to make a direct comparison, these data may suggest a more frequent increase in CD8+ cell infiltration in patients with <italic>BRAF</italic>-mutated melanoma receiving BRAF plus MEK inhibitors with anti-PD-L1 therapy than in patients with <italic>BRAF</italic>-wild type melanoma receiving the MEK inhibitor with anti-PD-L1 therapy.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><title>RNA-sequenced gene expression profiling, CD8+ T-cell infiltration by IHC, and IFNγ levels in circulating blood.</title><p>Cohort A, <italic>n</italic> = 13; Cohort B, <italic>n</italic> = 12; Cohort C, <italic>n</italic> = 5.

                <p id="Par20">RNA-sequenced gene expression profiling was performed on 95 biopsies from 65 patients; of these, 84 samples had adequate quality for analysis (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>, Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). The analyzed biopsies were from 20 patients in cohort A (including 13 with CRs or PRs, 6 with stable disease [SD], and 1 not evaluated), 16 patients in cohort B (including 3 with PRs, 11 with SD, and 2 with disease progression), and 14 patients in cohort C (including 4 with PRs, 4 with SD, 3 with disease progression, and 3 not evaluated) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>).</p>
                <p id="Par21">In cohort A, objective responses were observed regardless of baseline immune gene expression, suggesting that response to this triple therapy combination is not limited to patients with a pre-existing immune infiltrate, as is the case with single-agent PD-1/L1 blockade therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Biopsies on day 15 from patients in cohort A who had a response to therapy had higher levels of immune gene expression than those from patients with SD, but there was wide variability among the biopsies. Similar variability in immune gene expression was noted in biopsies from cohorts B and C, with an evident decrease from baseline in expression in the on-therapy biopsies of cohort C, which were taken at the time that patients received trametinib alone and were the only group of on-therapy biopsies while patients were not receiving durvalumab. These data suggest that single-agent therapy with trametinib in cohort C resulted in an apparent decrease in immune gene expression in biopsies compared with combination therapy including durvalumab in the two other cohorts.</p>
                <p id="Par22">We also analyzed interferon-gamma (IFNγ) levels in circulating blood from patients in all 3 cohorts (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The triple therapy used in cohort A resulted in a rapid increase that peaked on day 15 and remained high in subsequent blood samples up to day 57. In contrast, cohorts B and C had slower increases in circulating blood IFNγ levels, which also peaked at day 15 but were lower in subsequent blood samples. These data suggest that systemic immune activation occurred in all cohorts, but was more pronounced in cohort A.</p>

              <p id="Par23">This multicohort phase 1 clinical trial provides confirmation of the combinatorial effects between BRAF plus MEK inhibitor therapy and anti-PD-L1 blockade in BRAF-mutated melanoma, including patients who had previously progressed on anti-CTLA-4 therapy, with supporting data on the immune-stimulatory effects of the triple therapy combination provided by RNA sequencing. We also tested the combination of a MEK inhibitor with anti-PD-L1 antibody therapy, both concomitant and sequentially.</p>
              <p id="Par24">The immune monitoring data for the triplet combination of dabrafenib, trametinib, and durvalumab provide continued support for the concept of a favorable immunologic interaction between MAPK inhibitors and anti-PD-1 antibodies. As reported in previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, the triplet combination was associated with increases in CD8+ T-cell density, which is associated with productive antitumor immune responses. Furthermore, objective responses were seen even in patients without substantial baseline CD8+ T-cell infiltrate, a population that might be unresponsive to anti-PD-1 antibody monotherapy; increased circulating IFNγ levels were observed in cohort A overall. Previous work supports an independent role of BRAF and MEK inhibitor combination therapy in increasing tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte populations and inflammatory cytokine levels, suggesting that this effect cannot be attributed solely to exposure to the anti-PD-L1 antibody, durvalumab<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Although our sample size was small, half of the patients receiving triplet therapy remained in remission at a median follow-up of 20.8 months, which compares favorably to historical controls for combined BRAF plus MEK inhibitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. However, in the absence of a durvalumab monotherapy lead-in and paired biopsies, the immunologic contribution of the PD-L1 inhibitor to long-term patient benefits could not be isolated.</p>
              <p id="Par25">In cohort C of the current study, in which trametinib was initially given alone, there was no increase in tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells in three patients with available paired tumor biopsies. In addition, inflammatory gene expression actually decreased in patients treated with trametinib alone, while this effect was not seen in patients treated with concurrent trametinib and durvalumab. Although these data are preliminary given the small sample size, they suggest that trametinib could have an immune inhibitory effect that is offset by the addition of durvalumab. In addition, circulating IFNγ levels appeared to increase more gradually and in a less sustained manner in patients in cohorts B and C, compared with patients in cohort A with increased MAPK inhibitor-sensitive <italic>BRAF</italic>-mutant melanoma, even though the BRAF plus MEK inhibitor combination is expected to have less impact on wild type cells than the MEK inhibitor alone; a recognized paradoxical effect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par26">Overall, the clinical response data for the trametinib plus durvalumab combination arms in <italic>BRAF</italic>-wild type melanoma could not clearly demonstrate whether doublet therapy improved the response rate in comparison with historical controls. In cohort B, in which trametinib and durvalumab were administered concurrently from the outset, the ORR was 20.0%, and in cohort C, in which the agents were initiated sequentially, the ORR was 31.8%. These estimates in relatively small patient samples are similar to, if not slightly lower, than those observed in patients treated with anti-PD-1 antibody monotherapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, which may reflect that this study allowed inclusion of patients who had prior progression to PD-1 blockade therapy. Of the patients in cohorts B and C, 30% were previously treated and progressed on anti-PD-1 antibodies. One of these 11 patients responded to combination therapy and 9 patients had SD; it remains unclear whether the addition of MEK inhibition could promote antitumor immunity and response to anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies in a selected subset of patients.</p>
              <p id="Par27">In summary, the triplet combination of dabrafenib, trametinib, and durvalumab is feasible in patients with <italic>BRAF</italic>-mutant advanced melanoma and induces robust and sustained immune modulation. The increase in toxicities observed with the combination of the three therapies needs to be evaluated within the context of the limited benefits observed when targeted therapies or immunotherapy treatments are given separately in those patients with the most aggressive disease at diagnosis. Additional studies are required to define the role of combined MAPK inhibition and immune checkpoint blockade in patients with advanced melanoma.</p>

                <p id="Par28">This was an open-label, dose-escalation, and -expansion study in patients with <italic>BRAF</italic><sup><italic>V600</italic></sup><italic>-</italic>mutant or <italic>BRAF</italic>-wild type metastatic or unresectable melanoma (NCT02027961). Patients were randomized to receive either durvalumab in combination with dabrafenib and trametinib or with trametinib alone. The study protocol can be found in the <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">Supplementary Notes</xref>; Section 4.5 of the study protocol detailing the formulation of durvalumab has been redacted due to legal/intellectual property requirements set by the manufacturer.</p>
                <p id="Par29">Following a 28-day screening phase, patients were enrolled in one of three study cohorts (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>). Cohort A included patients with <italic>BRAF</italic><sup><italic>V600E</italic></sup>- or <italic>BRAF</italic><sup><italic>V600K</italic></sup>-mutant disease who received dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily, trametinib 2 mg once daily, and durvalumab 3 mg/kg (first dose-escalation cohort) or 10 mg/kg administered intravenously Q2W (dose-expansion phase). Dabrafenib and trametinib were administered until confirmed progressive disease or intolerable toxicity, and durvalumab was administered for up to 12 months. Cohort B included patients with <italic>BRAF</italic>-wild type melanoma who received concurrent trametinib 2 mg once daily and durvalumab 10 mg/kg intravenously Q2W for up to 12 months until confirmed disease progression or intolerable toxicity. Cohort C included patients with <italic>BRAF</italic>-wild type melanoma who received sequential doses of trametinib 2 mg once daily for 42 days and durvalumab 10 mg/kg Q2W starting on day 29 for up to 12 months. In all 3 treatment cohorts, durvalumab would be stopped at 12 months in the absence of confirmed progression, initiation of alternative cancer therapy, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or other reason to discontinue treatment.</p>
                <p id="Par30">The study protocol allowed to continue patients on therapy beyond initial progression. In Cohorts A and B, if there was evidence of progression during the post-durvalumab treatment period, durvalumab may be re-administered as an IV infusion Q2W for up to an additional 12 months while continuing dabrafenib and trametinib (Cohort A) or trametinib alone (Cohort B) provided the subject meets the criteria for re-administration in the setting of PD. In Cohort C, durvalumab may be re-administered as an IV infusion Q2W for up to an additional 12 months without concurrent trametinib provided the subject meets the criteria for re-administration in the setting of progressive disease. All subjects will be followed indefinitely for survival, until the sponsor closes the study, or for the maximum duration per institutional standards.</p>

The PK-evaluable population consisted of all subjects who received at least 1 dose of investigational product and at least 1 post-dose evaluable PK result. Immunogenicity data were analyzed in all patients who had a non-missing baseline ADA result and at least one non-missing post-baseline ADA result.</p>
                <p id="Par36">AEs were graded per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03 and were assessed throughout the study and for 90 days after the end of treatment. Tumor assessments for the secondary (RECIST v1.1) or exploratory (irRECIST) endpoints were conducted during screening, and throughout the study period until disease progression, death, or withdrawal from the study. In addition to tumor assessments during screening, and throughout the study period, assessment for patients discontinuing all study products due to confirmed disease progression, disease evaluation was performed at the end-of-treatment visit and 30 days thereafter. For patients entering follow-up after discontinuation of all study products due to toxicity, disease evaluation was performed at the end of treatment, every 2 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months thereafter until confirmed disease progression or the end of the study. The response rate was defined as the percentage of patients with a confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) per RECIST v1.1, as assessed by the site investigators. The best percentage change from baseline in tumor diameter was defined as the maximum reduction from baseline or the minimum increase from baseline in the absence of a reduction. Measurement of durvalumab concentrations in serum and of dabrafenib, dabrafenib metabolites (hydroxy- and desmethyl-dabrafenib), and trametinib concentrations in plasma were performed using a validated immunoassay. Blood samples were collected on day 1, day 8, day 15, and day 29 (±1 day). Presence of ADA will be assessed in samples taken on day 1 and day 29 (±1 day). Samples will be measured for the presence of ADA by the sponsor using a validated bridging immunoassay. For the translational analyses, tumor biopsies were collected at baseline, and then on day 15 (±3 days) and day 43 (±3 days) of the treatment period. For the RNA sequencing (RNAseq), total RNA from each sample was prepared for sequencing using the Takara Bio SMART-Seq: SMART-Seq<sup>®</sup> v4 Ultra<sup>®</sup> Low Input RNA Kit. Between 0.8 and 1.3 ng of RNA was used to prepare the RNA libraries. Eleven cycles of PCR were performed during cDNA amplification. Samples were then processed with the Nextera XT DNA sample preparation kits for Illumina. The cDNA was normalized to the modified recommended input amount of 100–150 pg and ten cycles during Nextera library prep. The purified amplified libraries were then validated by Agilent High Sensitivity DNA chip on Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer and quantitated via qPCR using KAPA Library Quantification Kit (KAPA Biosystems) according to manufacturer’s instructions. The libraries were sequenced on Illumina HiSeq 2500 with the following run parameters: Paired-End/Dual-Indexed 2 × 75 bp reads.

                <p id="Par37">The dose-escalation phase followed a standard 3 + 3 design. Where ≤2 DLTs were observed in the dose-escalation phase for each cohort, the dose for durvalumab could be increased to 10 mg/kg (MTD) as part of the dose-expansion phase. The dose levels for the dose escalation of durvalumab in combination with dabrafenib and trametinib in cohort A was based on the dose-escalation safety and pharmacokinetic information using single-agent durvalumab. Based on the prior experience, durvalumab was started at 3 mg/kg Q2W, one dose level below the recommended phase 2 dosing of durvalumab alone, with the next cohort using the full dose of durvalumab at 10 mg/kg Q2W followed by a dose-expansion cohort. The 10 mg/kg is the FDA-approved dose for durvalumab. The primary justification of the schedule for cohort C was the anticipated increase in toxicities with the combination of a MEK inhibitor with an anti-PD-L1 therapy. At the time of starting this study, it was already clear that the combination of a BRAF and MEK inhibitor was less toxic than using either agent alone, given that both drugs offset the toxicities of each other through the phenomenon of paradoxical MAPK activation with a BRAF inhibitor. In particular, MEK inhibitors given as single agent had near-universal acneiform skin rash that limited continuous therapy administration, which was felt could be worsened with the addition of anti-PD-L1.</p>
                <p id="Par38">Approximately 69 patients were required to be enrolled for both the dose-escalation phase and the dose-expansion phase of the study. For the dose-escalation phase, up to 24 evaluable patients were required, with 2 dose levels in cohort A and 1 dose level each in cohorts B and C. For the dose-expansion phase, a minimum of 42 patients were required in the 3 cohorts (~14 patients in each of Cohorts A, B, and C) to ensure ~20 patients were treated at the MTD or 10 mg/kg dose level selected for each cohort. The sample size was mainly chosen to obtain preliminary assessment of antitumor activity (ORR) for the <italic>BRAF</italic>-wild type and <italic>BRAF</italic> mutation-positive cohorts.</p>
                <p id="Par39">Unless otherwise stated, patient dispositions, baseline characteristics, and safety and efficacy analyses were based on the as-treated population, which included all subjects who received any investigational product.

Continuous variables were summarized by descriptive statistics, including N values, means, standard deviations, medians, and ranges. Confidence intervals, whenever specified, were two-sided and produced at 95%. The Kaplan–Meier method was used to estimate PFS and OS, where PFS was defined as the time from the start of treatment with a study product to the first documentation of disease progression or death, whichever came first, and OS was measured from the start of treatment until death. Individual durvalumab, dabrafenib, dabrafenib metabolites, and trametinib concentrations were tabulated by dose cohort, visit, and time points, along with descriptive statistics. For durvalumab, PK parameters were estimated using a non-compartmental PK analysis approach for each dose cohort. Immunogenicity was assessed by summarizing the number and percentage of subjects who develop detectable ADAs.</p>
