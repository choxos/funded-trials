                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>The large number of key populations in China who would benefit from HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in the context of limited health system capacity and public awareness will pose challenges for timely PrEP scale-up, suggesting an urgent need for innovative and accessible interventions. This study aims to develop and pilot test a theory-informed, tailored mobile phone intervention that was codeveloped by young gay men, HIV clinicians and public health researchers to increase engagement in PrEP education and initiation among Chinese gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM), who bear a disproportionate burden of HIV infections and remain underserved in the healthcare system.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>This two-phase study includes a formative assessment using in-depth interviews (N=30) and a 12-week experimental pilot study using a two-arm randomised controlled trial design (N=70). The primary intervention is delivered through a WeChat-based mini-app (a program built into a Chinese multipurpose social media application) developed by young GBMSM from a 2019 crowdsourcing hackathon. Using mixed methods, we will further investigate the specific needs and concerns among GBMSM in terms of using PrEP as an HIV prevention strategy, how their concerns and PrEP use behaviours may change with exposure to the mini-app intervention during the study period and how we can further refine this intervention tool to better meet GBMSMâ€™s needs for broader implementation.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>HIV prevalence among gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM) in China has steadily increased over the past 5â€‰years.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1â€“3</xref> In Guangzhou, a major economic centre in southern China, the HIV prevalence among sexually active GBMSM increased from 3.9% in 2009<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> to 11% in 2017.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Individual and contextual risk factors associated with HIV acquisition among Chinese GBMSM include condomless sex, high rates of ulcerative sexually transmitted infections (eg, syphilis), use of recreational drugs during sex, gay entertainment venues (eg, public bathhouse) and social and sexual networking mobile phone applications.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 6â€“11</xref> Taken together, these risk factors suggest that Chinese GBMSM could benefit from additional HIV prevention strategies such as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP).</p>
              <p>However, the overall awareness of PrEP among Chinese GBMSM remains relatively low and varies across samples. Generally 20%â€“75% of GBMSM respondents reported having heard of PrEP in China-based studies.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12â€“14</xref> By July 2021, there was an estimated number of 6000â€“6500 PrEP users reported from official demonstration projects in this country.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Cross-sectional surveys<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12 16â€“24</xref> and PrEP clinical trials<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25â€“27</xref> and in-depth interviews with HIV-negative GBMSM<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26 28</xref> have reported perceived barriers to PrEP uptake among Chinese GBMSM including concerns about side effects, financial cost and low HIV risk perception. Yet, little is known about multilevel barriers to PrEP uptake and maintenance in China, especially from those with PrEP using experience. Further, there is widespread HIV-related and gay-related stigma and discrimination in clinical settings<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29â€“31</xref> that may inhibit the effective delivery of PrEP drugs and related services for GBMSM.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></p>
              <p>The China National Medical Products Administration approved tenofovirâ€“emtricitabine (TDFâ€“FTC) as HIV PrEP in China on 11 August 2020. However, the aforementioned gaps highlight the need for innovative, culturally appropriate and GBMSM-friendly tools that prepare GBMSM for PrEP uptake, to pave the way for a rapid scale-up. Facing the broad spread of HIV-related and gay-related stigma in Chinese society, mobile health (mHealth) interventions for HIV prevention and sexual health promotion are feasible and highly acceptable among Chinese GBMSM due to their privacy, portability and convenience.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33â€“35</xref> Health hackathons as a crowdsourcing approach are an effective and convenient way to mobilise GBMSM communities in generating innovative mHealth solutions to meet their own health needs,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> which could further potentially contribute to reductions in internalised stigma and an increase in community resilience among sexual minority populations.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37 38</xref></p>
              <p>Globally, limited data exist on the efficacy of app-based interventions aimed to increase PrEP uptake among GBMSM. Among the few published mHealth PrEP intervention efficacy studies, text messaging has been effective in improving PrEP adherence in GBMSM via reducing missed doses.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39 40</xref> More mHealth PrEP uptake intervention studies are underway, however, all are in high-income countries.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41â€“44</xref> To date, little is known about the optimal design and efficacy of using mHealth-enabled interventions for PrEP promotion in Chinese populations, especially among GBMSM.</p>

                <title>Aims and objectives</title>
                <p>This study focuses on developing and testing a tailored mobile app-based intervention built on our previous work from a gay-friendly doctor finder hackathon in China,<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> aiming to increase engagement in PrEP education and initiation and generate hypotheses that explain potential behavioural pathways to PrEP uptake among Chinese GBMSM. The study site is Guangzhou, a major economic centre of southern China. To this end, the study has two phases: Phase I collects formative data using in-depth interviews to assess unmet needs in HIV prevention (PrEP in particular) and sexual health among HIV-negative GBMSM and test and refine the usability of the mini-app. Phase II will implement a two-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) to assess the feasibility and preliminary evidence of the efficacy of the refined mini-app in increasing intention to use PrEP and PrEP initiation among HIV-negative GBMSM. Specific aims include:</p>

                <p><xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> presents the studyâ€™s conceptual model. The intervention content development is informed by the Information, Motivation and Behavioral Skills Model (the IMB model). The IMB model proposes a mediational framework that hypothesises that the performance of many health-related behaviours is determined by three core constructs: information, motivation and behavioural skills.<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> With years of application in HIV research, the IMB model has been widely applied in intervention studies and adapted to promote specific HIV-related behaviours, including PrEP care-related behaviours.<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47â€“49</xref> Among Chinese GBMSM, the IMB model was also found useful in explaining HIV preventive behaviour such as condom use.<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> We also use the Motivational PrEP Cascade (MPC),<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> originally proposed by Parsons <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic> who combined the concept of PrEP care cascade<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> and the transtheoretical model of behavioral change, to inform the measurement of the several stages of behavioural change culminating in PrEP initiation. The MPC outlines stages of readiness to make a behavioural change, including precontemplation, contemplation, preparation, action and maintenance of the change.<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref> A 2018 survey study based on the MPC among a sample of 708 HIV-negative GBMSM from multiple major cities in China showed that 53% of the respondents who were PrEP eligible were in the precontemplation stage, 36% were in contemplation stage, 9% were in preparation stage, 2% were in PrEP action and initiation stage and none were in adherence and maintenance stage.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Given variable awareness about PrEP and the wide range of age of the target population, measuring the stages of change toward PrEP initiation will help us better tailor and refine the intervention.</p>

                <p>The intervention is delivered via a WeChat-based mini-app (a program built within an existing commercial application) that was developed by a team of young GBMSM from a GBMSM-friendly doctor finder hackathon contest.<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> This hackathon contest was part of a series of crowdsourcing events that aimed to engage the GBMSM community in generating public health innovations in HIV and sexual health promotion in China. From February 2018 to March 2018, the Shenzhen University College of Mass Communication, the non-profit organisation Social Entrepreneurship to Spur Health (SESH) and Blued (the largest gay social networking app in China) held a crowdsourcing contest for designing concepts of a mobile phone-based, GBMSM-friendly doctor mobile app. In July 2018, four focus group discussions with 38 GBMSM in Guangzhou and Shenzhen were subsequently conducted to solicit participantsâ€™ feedback on refining the app design.<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref></p>
                <p>From December 2018 to April 2019, UNC Project China with support from SESH and Blued hosted a GBMSM-friendly doctor finder hackathon in Guangzhou, during which the participants were asked to develop a mobile phone-based doctor finder prototype based on the work from previous events. A total of 38 participants grouped into eight teams attended the final hackathon contest and developed eight prototypes after a 72-hour hacking. Four prototypes adopted the mode of a mini-app embedded within WeChat, and three prototypes were designed as stand-alone apps and one was designed as a tool that can be adjusted to multiple platforms. One of the WeChat mini-app prototypes was adapted for use in the current study. WeChat (Android and iOS) is a social platform in China with over one billion active users<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref> that has been widely used for public health education by Chinese health administrations and private organisations.<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref> The WeChat app allows developers to build new app programs (ie, the mini-app) within the platform that are accessible without additional download or installation.</p>
                <p>Before testing and evaluating the mini-app in the current study, we invited a group of key community stakeholders including gay men, sex educators and local HIV-related community-based organisation (CBO) workers to test the mini-app prototype and provide valuable feedback in user-interface design and choice of educational materials. The main features of the version of the interventional mini-app for the current study include: (1) the mini-classroom; educational materials which cover topics of HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STI), PrEP and postexposure prophylaxis and mental health, aiming to change participantâ€™s information, motivation and behavioural skills to initiate PrEP; (2) an at-home HIV/syphilis dual testing kit ordering system; (3) chat-based online counselling; (4) and a user profile centre (their account in the mini-app is automatically linked to their WeChat account with the userâ€™s permission). The overall structure of the mini-app is illustrated in <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">figure 2</xref> and a detailed description of the main features is presented in <xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental table 1</xref>.</p>

                  <p>In phase I, we conduct in-depth interviews among Chinese GBMSM to understand the key barriers and facilitators of using PrEP. We also assess participantsâ€™ perceived usability of the intervention mini-app during the interview. All one-on-one interviews are conducted by the principal investigator via videoconference (audio-recorded with participantsâ€™ permission) and last 60â€“90â€‰min. The principal investigator (CL) is a PhD candidate in health behavior with over 10 years training in public health and 5 years research experience in HIV prevention and LGBTQ health among Chinese populations in particular. We use a semistructured interview guide (<xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental table 2</xref>) with tailored questions for participants with and without PrEP experience. Interview topics cover knowledge, attitudes and willingness to use PrEP and/or PrEP use history, preference over PrEP regimens (daily vs event-driven dosing, oral vs long-term active injectable PrEP) and delivery modes and past pathways, barriers and facilitators to HIV testing and PrEP services. During the interview, participants are introduced to the mini-app design and features, use the mini-app for 5â€“10â€‰min, complete a 10-item app usability scale (System Usability Scale<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57 58</xref>) and discuss the appâ€™s design, contents and ease of use. Following the interview, each participant completes a brief demographic survey via Wenjuanxing, an online survey tool in China. All interviews will be transcribed in Chinese and analysed using the qualitative analysis platform, Dedoose.<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref> The qualitative analysis will be conducted in Chinese with the translation of exemplary content for English-language publications. The principal investigator (CL) will take the lead role in applying a thematic analysis-based approach<xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref> for identifying, analysing and reporting patterns within the data. The other research team members will be actively engaged in the monitoring of data collection process and proving continuous feedback on data analysis and interpretation via regular meetings with CL.</p>

                  <p>To represent the variety of experience GBMSM has had with PrEP, we will conduct in-depth interviews with 30 Chinese GBMSM at different stages of the PrEP care continuum, including approximately 20 PrEP naive individuals, 5 prior PrEP users who are not currently on PrEP and 5 current PrEP users. This sample size is generally considered sufficient for thematic analysis to reach information saturation among a relatively homogenous group.<xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref> While the mini-app is primarily designed for PrEP-naive GBMSM, including the perspectives of past and current PrEP users is intended to gain feedback on the intervention design and content based on experiences across the stages of change in PrEP adoption. Participants will be recruited through research advertising on Chinese social media and referral by local GBMSM-related organisations.</p>
                  <p>Eligibility criteria for phase I are: Chinese citizen and current resident, assigned male sex at birth, age 18 years and above, any lifetime anal sex with another man and willingness to sign (or e-sign) informed consent. Exclusion criteria include: self-reported HIV-positive status or reporting or demonstrating mental health issues which may compromise participant safety, including memory loss, cognitive impairment, intellectual disability or communication disorders.</p>

                  <p>Participants in both arms can choose to initiate PrEP through the research study at any time point from enrolment through the end of week 8. Participants who decide to start PrEP after week 8 will still be able to receive standard PrEP care at the study clinic, but they will not be eligible to receive complimentary physical examinations that are covered by this research project (please see details in Incentives section). Participants can contact the study team via phone call, text messages or the chat function in the mini-app (intervention arm only) to communicate their interest in PrEP initiation. Interested participants will be referred to the department of infectious diseases at the study hospital to consult a clinician regarding HIV risks and PrEP eligibility. As per protocols in the study hospital, participants starting PrEP will undergo standard of care comprehensive physical examinations including routine blood and urine examinations, hepatic and renal function tests and HIV/syphilis/HBV (hepatitis B virus)/HCV (hepatitis C virus) tests.</p>
                  <p>During this clinical encounter, participants who are confirmed to be HIV negative and without any relative contraindications for PrEP initiation will be prescribed a 30-day supply of TDFâ€“FTC. Participants can choose from two PrEP medicines that is available for prescription at the study clinic during the study period: Truvada (before reimbursement: 1980 CNY/ 30 pills) or the generic Keaike (1180 CNY/ 30 pills). Once starting PrEP, participants will be required to complete twoâ€‰monthly clinic visits during their first 2â€‰months of PrEP use to monitor their medication adherence, HIV/STI tests and overall physical health status and receive another 30-day supply of TDFâ€“FTC. Participants may follow the daily oral regimen or event-driven regimen based on their discretion and they will be given education on the two PrEP regimens during their initial PrEP counselling and through the mini-classroom in the mini-app. PrEP prescriptions may be filled at the study clinicâ€™s pharmacy or a private pharmacy.</p>

                <p>HIV remains a stigmatised disease in many places in the world, including China. Same-sex sexual behaviours can also be associated with stigma and lack of social acceptance. The potential social harm that may cause to the participants by participation in our study may include emotional distress, embarrassment and breach of confidentiality. During the study implementation, every effort will be made to ensure that study participants are protected from these risks and to maintain confidentiality and discretion throughout all research procedures and data management and analysis. If at any time during the study a participant divulges that he is at risk for harm, measures will be taken to ensure their safety. Reporting will be done as appropriate to the situation and the legal statutes, and referrals will be provided to appropriate support, counselling or treatment resources.</p>

Participants testing positive will be referred to the study hospitalâ€”the Guangzhou Eighth Peopleâ€™s Hospital for confirmation tests or other testing places if needed. The Guangzhou Center for Diseases Prevention and Control will be notified of confirmed positive results following Chinaâ€™s public health reporting laws, a procedure that will be explained to participants at consent. For positive syphilis testing results, participants will be referred to as STI treatment at the Guangzhou Eighth Peopleâ€™s Hospital. The study team will follow-up with participants testing positive for HIV or STI to encourage participants to seek appropriate care.

              <p>Despite the high prevalence of HIV infection and risk factors among Chinese GBMSM, PrEP use is quite limited.<xref rid="R67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref> A theory-informed, GBMSM-friendly and innovative behavioural intervention to facilitate PrEP uptake among Chinese GBMSM may help to increase the awareness of PrEP among this population through timely information and strengthened motivation and skills. It may also help to link individuals to providers and clinics where they can receive PrEP. While PrEP campaigns in China have to date failed to engage relevant communities,<xref rid="R68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref> initiatives in other settings have successfully used GBMSM-tailored approaches to promote PrEP,<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41â€“44</xref> including using mHealth technologies to approach GBMSM â€˜where they areâ€™. In an online survey of 1035 Chinese GBMSM in 2017, about 75% of the participants mainly met their sex partners online<xref rid="R69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref> and Chinese GBMSM have been using the internet frequently to search for HIV-related information, counselling or testing services.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></p>
              <p>A large body of evidence has suggested that HIV-related and sexual health interventions delivered through internet-enabled platforms are feasible and acceptable in Chinese settings,<xref rid="R70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref> including interventions through websites, text message and mobile apps that have shown effectiveness in reducing HIV-related risk behaviours, increasing linkage to care and improving medication adherence.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 71 72</xref> Thus, an mHealth-enabled intervention, like this PrEP education mini-app, which leverages the platform of a popular Chinese social media app, could facilitate the rapid scale-up of PrEP use in China. In contrast to the traditionally top-down health mandates or researcher-led intervention projects, the PrEP mini-app tested in our study was cocreated by a team of young gay men, HIV clinicians and public health researchers through a crowdsourcing hackathon. This not only helps to generate innovative approaches to address their own social and health needs but also increases the acceptability and potential impact of the intervention in target populations.</p>
              <p>Developing and testing theory-driven interventions around HIV prevention and care is challenged by rapid developments in the field, which can influence the pertinence or timeliness of interventionsâ€”a case in point concerns PrEP in China. The Chinese government has taken several crucial steps in introducing PrEP to China, including launching large-scale PrEP studies in multiple provinces and cities in 2018, developing implementation guidelines for PrEP in China<xref rid="R68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref> and officially approving TDFâ€“FTC for HIV PrEP in August 2020.<xref rid="R73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref> Nevertheless, the large population of GBMSM who would benefit from PrEP will encounter significant challenges for timely scale-up. The PrEP education mini-app developed by this study aims to meet the pressing need for innovative, easily accessible and broadly acceptable modes of promoting and supporting PrEP among Chinese populations.<xref rid="R74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref></p>
              <p>We also expect some challenges in the study implementation given the rapidly evolving conditions of the global COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on human activities and interpersonal interactions. The fieldwork is expected to take place between summer 2020 and summer 2021, while international travel of our research team members will be significantly delayed or restricted because of the global mitigation strategies to control COVID-19. In order not to bring significant delay to the study progression as well as encourage participantsâ€™ engagement, our research team has been working remotely with local collaborators regarding GBMSM recruitment and enrolment. All data collection activities including in-depth interviews and surveys will be conducted electronically via videoconferencing systems or web-based survey tools, to ensure participantsâ€™ and the research teamâ€™s safety. The mHealth-based feature of the proposed intervention does not require in-person interaction between the participants and the research team, though study enrolment currently includes clinic-based lab tests and follow-up visits among PrEP users.</p>
              <p>Whether globally or in China, limited data exist on the efficacy of app-based interventions aimed to increase PrEP uptake and adherence among GBMSM. If successful, this research study may help inform the implementation design of a rapid PrEP roll-out in China by examining whether an mHealth intervention can promote PrEP uptake and other HIV prevention services. Promoting such services among GBMSM is of great importance as this population bears a disproportionate burden of Chinaâ€™s HIV infections and remains underserved in the healthcare system.</p>
