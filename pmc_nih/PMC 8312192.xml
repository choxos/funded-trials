                  <title>Purpose:</title>
                  <p>Prostate cancer survivors (PCS) receive androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) as treatment for recurrent cancer, yet ADT is associated with loss of skeletal muscle and physical function. Resistance training can counter both muscle and physical function loss; however, an understanding of the molecular responses of skeletal muscle to resistance training during ADT is still undefined. This sub-analysis of the original randomized, controlled pilot trial investigated effects of 12 weeks of periodized resistance training on mRNA expression of the anabolic genes IGF-1, myogenin, PGC-1α4 and the catabolic genes myostatin and MuRF-1 in skeletal muscle of PCS on ADT. Secondary aims investigated if changes in lean mass and physical function correlated with changes in mRNA expression.</p>

                  <title>Methods:</title>
                  <p>PCS on ADT (n = 17) were randomized to 12 weeks of supervised resistance training (EXE, n = 9) or home-based stretching (STRETCH, n = 8) 3 days per week. Outcomes were assessed at baseline and post-intervention. Muscle biopsies were analyzed by RT-PCR for mRNA expression. Body composition was assessed through dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and physical function through muscular strength, timed up and go, stair climb, and 400 m walk.</p>

                  <title>Results:</title>
                  <p>MuRF-1 mRNA expression was significantly greater in EXE compared to STRETCH post-intervention (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = .005). Change in MuRF-1 mRNA expression significantly correlated with improvements in strength and physical function (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; .05), while change in IGF-1 expression correlated with change in lean mass (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = .015).</p>

                  <title>Conclusion:</title>
                  <p>Twelve weeks of resistance training increased mRNA expression of MuRF-1 in skeletal muscle of PCS on ADT. Elevations in resting mRNA expression of IGF-1, myogenin and PGC-1α4, and reduction in mRNA expression of myostatin that are typically expected following resistance training were not observed.</p>

              <p>In men with locally advanced or metastatic prostate cancer, treatment with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) confers substantial benefit by deferring symptom progression and increasing survival, especially when combined with radiation therapy.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-15347354211035442" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> However, ADT is associated with a loss of skeletal muscle that can impact physical well-being and increase risk of metabolic disease.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-15347354211035442" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Resistance training is an established countermeasure to ADT-related reductions in skeletal muscle and physical function,<sup><xref rid="bibr3-15347354211035442" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> but only a few investigations have examined the effect of exercise on cellular responses underpinning skeletal muscle changes in prostate cancer survivors (PCS) on ADT.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-15347354211035442" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="bibr5-15347354211035442" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr6-15347354211035442" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr7-15347354211035442" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup></p>
              <p>In investigating the iatrogenic effects of ADT on skeletal muscle quality, Lamboley et al<sup><xref rid="bibr5-15347354211035442" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> found reduced contractile performance of skeletal muscle fibers in PCS on ADT compared to age-matched controls. Hanson et al<sup><xref rid="bibr4-15347354211035442" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> observed blunted muscle protein synthesis after protein ingestion in PCS on ADT compared to age-matched control subjects, which was rescued when protein ingestion was combined with resistance exercise. Nilsen et al<sup><xref rid="bibr6-15347354211035442" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bibr7-15347354211035442" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> investigated skeletal muscle cellular outcomes after 16 weeks of resistance training in PCS on ADT, but only observed significant changes muscle cross sectional area and strength. Collectively, these studies support a role of resistance exercise in stimulating muscle protein synthesis and improving muscle quality during ADT, but an understanding of the molecular targets involved in skeletal muscle remodeling due to training in PCS is still limited.</p>
              <p>The molecular pathways mediating the pro-atrophy skeletal muscle remodeling during ADT has been previously summarized.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-15347354211035442" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Activation of genes that regulate proteolytic pathways, such as myostatin and the muscle-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase muscle ring finger 1 (MuRF-1), result in protein degradation,<sup><xref rid="bibr8-15347354211035442" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> yet are decreased following acute and chronic resistance exercise in healthy adults.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-15347354211035442" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="bibr10-15347354211035442" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr11-15347354211035442" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Also responsive to exercise are the myogenic factor myogenin and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), the Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, where elevations in mRNA expression have been observed in healthy adults after acute and chronic resistance exercise.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-15347354211035442" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="bibr13-15347354211035442" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr14-15347354211035442" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> In addition, a splice variant of the transcriptional coactivator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) known as PGC-1α4, has been shown to affect both catabolic and anabolic pathways.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-15347354211035442" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Preferentially induced during resistance exercise, PGC-1α4 inhibited transcriptional activity of the ubiquitin-proteasome system and promoted muscle hypertrophy.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-15347354211035442" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup></p>
              <p>As mRNA expression of these molecular markers has not yet been assessed in PCS on ADT, an understanding of the molecular targets involved in skeletal muscle protein synthesis and breakdown may contribute to strategies mitigating the adverse effects of ADT. Therefore, the primary aim of this study was to investigate the effect of 12 weeks of resistance training on mRNA expression of anabolic regulators of skeletal muscle, including IGF-1, myogenin and PGC-1α4, and catabolic regulators of skeletal muscle, including myostatin and MuRF-1, in PCS on ADT. Secondary aims investigated correlations between changes in mRNA expression and changes in skeletal muscle mass and physical function. This exploratory study was conducted as part of a larger pilot trial, in which 12 weeks of resistance training was found to significantly increase muscle mass, strength and quality of life in PCS on ADT.<sup><xref rid="bibr16-15347354211035442" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> We hypothesized that 12 weeks of resistance training would elevate anabolic mRNA expression and reduce catabolic mRNA expression in PCS on ADT.</p>

                <title>Recruitment and Randomization</title>
                <p>Participants were recruited from hospitals in the Los Angeles area between May 2014 and March 2017 by physicians, nurses and physical therapists, and through newspaper advertisements. Eligible participants were diagnosed with prostate cancer, aged 50 or older, free of contraindications to exercise and currently treated with gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist/antagonist with or without anti-androgen for at least 12 weeks. Exclusion criteria included chemotherapy or radiation therapy within 4 weeks of enrollment, major surgery within the previous 6 months, acute coronary or vascular event in the last year, or current participation in a structured exercise program. Metastatic patients were not excluded. The randomization list was prepared in advance by the biostatistician and provided to the Clinical Investigation Support Office (CISO) at the USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center. To prevent potential bias, study personnel did not have access to the randomization list. Trial participants and investigators were not blinded to the group assignment. In the parent study, patients were randomly allocated (1:1:1:1) by CISO to 12 weeks of (1) resistance training + protein supplementation, (2) resistance training, (3) protein supplementation, or (4) control stretching. As small effect sizes were found between the 4 groups for all endpoints, the 4-arm design was collapsed into 2 groups of either EXE (received resistance training) or STRETCH (no resistance training). In the present study, EXE consisted of 4 participants who received resistance training + protein supplementation and 4 participants who received resistance training only, while STRETCH consisted of 4 participants who received protein supplementation and 3 participants who received control stretching. The study was approved by the University of Southern California (USC) Institutional Review Board (HS-13-00315) and all participants provided written informed consent.</p>

                  <title>Resistance training program (EXE)</title>
                  <p>EXE performed one-on-one resistance training 3 days per week for 12 weeks with a certified exercise trainer at the USC Clinical Exercise Research Center. The resistance training program met the American College of Sports Medicine/American Cancer Society’s recommendation for strength training<sup><xref rid="bibr18-15347354211035442" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> and has been previously described in detail.<sup><xref rid="bibr17-15347354211035442" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Briefly, each ~50 minutes session began with a 5 minutes dynamic warmup. The training routine included 7 upper and lower extremity machine-based exercises and 3 trunk exercises. Weekly training volume was divided such that lower extremities/trunk musculature were trained on Day 1, lower and upper extremities trained on Day 2, and upper extremities/trunk musculature trained on Day 3. Every session concluded with 5 minutes of static stretching targeting the muscle groups used in the routine. The resistance training program was progressed over the course of the intervention using a periodization model consistent with a hypertrophy training goal for the majority of the program. Load assignments were calculated from estimated 1 repetition maximum (RM) values, which were determined from 10RM tests at baseline and at the end of week 6. The progression cycle was as follows: Weeks 1 to 2: 60% 1RM, 15 repetitions; Weeks 3 to 4: 65% to 67% 1RM, 15 to 12 repetitions; Weeks 5 to 6: 70% 1RM, 12 to 10 repetitions; Weeks 7 to 8: 75% 1RM, 10 to 8 repetitions; Weeks 9 to 10: 80% 1RM, 10 to 8 repetitions; Weeks 11 to 12: 83% 1RM, 8 repetitions. Rest periods were timed at exactly 1 minute between sets, and 3 sets of each exercise were performed. Participants were trained to fatigue, where light spotting and encouragement were provided for the last few reps of the third set when necessary.</p>

                  <title>Home-based stretching program (STRETCH)</title>
                  <p>STRETCH performed a home-based flexibility program 3 times per week for 12 weeks, with each session lasting ~5 minutes. The stretching exercises in the home-based program matched those performed by EXE at the end of each training session. To increase compliance, STRETCH participants were given a stretching band and a booklet detailing the exercises. Participants completed weekly records of flexibility and self-directed exercises and were given a monetary compensation for the completed records. All STRETCH participants were offered the resistance training program after the post-intervention assessments.</p>

For the 400 m walk, Timed Up and Go and stair climb, time was recorded to the nearest 0.1 second using a stopwatch. The Timed Up and Go and stair climb were performed in triplicate, and average score was reported. Maximal voluntary strength was assessed through 10RM tests at baseline, intervention midpoint (6 weeks) and post-intervention. Due to fragility concerns in individuals with bone metastatic disease, multiple-repetition testing was selected to minimize orthopedic issues that could arise from high force single repetition maximum testing.<sup><xref rid="bibr19-15347354211035442" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> In the parent trial, both upper and lower extremity exercises were tested, but this report focuses on the lower extremity exercises of leg press, leg curl, and leg extension.

During the testing session, participants completed a warm-up at a load of ~20RM, which was estimated based on investigator experience and verbal questions pertaining to training history. Three attempts were given to reach the final 10RM load with a 2 minutes rest period between attempts. Feedback on range of motion and verbal encouragement were given by the investigator after each repetition.

                <p>The safety of the resistance training program was assessed at every exercise session and testing time point through the identification and grading of adverse events using the common terminology criteria for adverse events (CTCAE v4.3). Muscle biopsy tolerability was assessed at a follow-up visit 48 to 96 hours post-biopsy and graded using CTCAE (v4.3). In addition, testosterone and prostate-specific antigen, assessed at baseline, intervention midpoint and post-intervention, were used as circulating safety measures of disease activity.</p>
                <p>Resistance training attendance was calculated as the number of sessions completed compared to the total number of sessions. Resistance training adherence was calculated as the percentage of exercises performed at the prescribed modality, intensity, and volume as specified in the periodization model compared to the total number of exercises.

Because data for most variables were not normally distributed, outcomes are presented as Median (IQR) and nonparametric analyses were performed. Comparisons of baseline characteristics and pre-to-post changes between groups were made using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests for continuous outcomes and Fisher’s exact test for categorical outcomes. For within-group baseline to post-intervention comparisons, the difference (post-pre) was computed on individual scores with Wilcoxon signed-rank tests used to assess significance. Changes in mRNA expression were correlated with changes in lean mass and strength outcomes in the EXE group using Spearman correlation, <italic toggle="yes">R<sub>s</sub></italic>.

              <p>Twenty-three of the 37 participants enrolled in the study consented to the optional muscle biopsy (<xref rid="fig1-15347354211035442" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). No significant differences in baseline characteristics were observed between participants in the parent study and participants who volunteered for the muscle biopsy. In total, post-intervention muscle samples were not obtained from 3 EXE participants because of intervention discontinuation (n = 2) or disease progression (n = 1), and 2 STRETCH participants who declined to undergo the second biopsy. In addition, 1 EXE sample was excluded from the final analysis because of insufficient tissue quantity. No adverse events were reported due to the biopsy procedure.</p>

              <p>To our knowledge, this is the first randomized controlled pilot study investigating the effects of a 12-week periodized resistance training program on mRNA expression of anabolic and catabolic regulators of skeletal muscle mass in PCS on ADT. Contrary to our hypothesis, resistance training was found to increase resting mRNA expression of the catabolic gene, MuRF-1, while no increases in resting levels of the anabolic genes IGF-1, myogenin and PGC-1α4 or decreases in the catabolic gene myostatin were observed. The change in MuRF-1 mRNA expression was correlated with changes in lower extremity muscular strength and physical function, while change in IGF-1 mRNA expression was correlated with change in lean mass.</p>
              <p>Examination of skeletal muscle mRNA expression in PCS is limited, and we are not aware of other data investigating resting MuRF-1 mRNA expression following resistance training in PCS during ADT. Therefore, based on previous resistance exercise studies in healthy young males, we expected reductions in MuRF-1 mRNA expression post-training.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-15347354211035442" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Contrary to our hypothesis, resting levels of MuRF-1 increased following 12 weeks of periodized hypertrophy resistance exercise. Though our findings diverge from studies employing traditional resistance exercise protocols with long rest periods (&gt;2 minutes) between sets where resting levels of MuRF-1 mRNA expression were unchanged,<sup><xref rid="bibr11-15347354211035442" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="bibr32-15347354211035442" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="bibr33-15347354211035442" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> our results are similar to those using high-intensity protocols with limited rest periods (≤1 minute).<sup><xref rid="bibr32-15347354211035442" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><xref rid="bibr33-15347354211035442" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr34-15347354211035442" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> In healthy young males, increases in resting MuRF-1 mRNA expression have been reported following 8 weeks of resistance training with minimal rest periods (&lt;1 minute),<sup><xref rid="bibr34-15347354211035442" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> 7 weeks of multimodal resistance and aerobic exercise,<sup><xref rid="bibr32-15347354211035442" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> and 10 weeks of high-intensity interval cycle training.<sup><xref rid="bibr33-15347354211035442" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> These similar patterns of MuRF-1 mRNA expression suggest the role of metabolic stress in modulating molecular responses. Exercise entailing high metabolic stress, such as limited rest, high-intensity, or multimodal protocols, may act as a driver of similar intracellular signaling and gene targets.<sup><xref rid="bibr33-15347354211035442" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> In the present study, multi-joint exercises were performed with a moderate number of maximal repetitions (6-12) for multiple sets and limited rest periods consistent with a hypertrophy training protocol.<sup><xref rid="bibr35-15347354211035442" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> As hypertrophy training regimens are purported to produce significant metabolic stress,<sup><xref rid="bibr35-15347354211035442" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> the elevated resting levels of MuRF-1 observed post-training in the present study may be due to the limited rest periods and time under tension consistent with a hypertrophy-oriented program.</p>
              <p>We found that lower extremity strength was greatly enhanced by 12 weeks of resistance training, and observed a small, but significant difference in appendicular skeletal mass between groups post-intervention. Increases in strength directly correlated with increases in MuRF-1 mRNA expression, but no relationship was found between appendicular skeletal mass and MuRF-1 mRNA expression. One explanation for these findings may be that we missed the window of anabolic gene expression and only captured the elevation in MuRF-1 expression. While elevations in proteolytic signaling such as that of ubiquitin proteasome pathway ligases like MuRF-1 are considered to be part of normal skeletal muscle remodeling during chronic exercise,<sup><xref rid="bibr33-15347354211035442" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="bibr34-15347354211035442" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="bibr36-15347354211035442" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> this degradation is countered by elevated rates of muscle protein synthesis, which, in long-term resistance training, is purported to lead to muscle protein accretion.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-15347354211035442" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Activation of the anabolic remodeling process could have been occurring in parallel with the increases in strength due to neural adaptations, and if we had measured protein content, we might have observed this anabolic program. However, because only mRNA expression was measured, we captured changes in MuRF-1 levels, although strength improvements would not be attributable to elevations in MuRF-1 mRNA expression.</p>
              <p>Missing the window of mRNA expression might explain why we did not observe the increases in resting levels of IGF-1 and myogenin or decreases in myostatin typically demonstrated in healthy older men or testosterone-suppressed younger men after a resistance training program.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-15347354211035442" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="bibr10-15347354211035442" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="bibr14-15347354211035442" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="bibr37-15347354211035442" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> Yet, other factors, such as timing of biopsies or testosterone status, might have played a role as well. In a previous investigation in young males on ADT, resting mRNA expression of IGF-1 and myogenin were found to increase and myostatin was found to decrease following 8 weeks of resistance training.<sup><xref rid="bibr37-15347354211035442" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> Biopsies were taken 24 hours after the last training session, which is contrast to the present study, where biopsies were performed 72 to 96 hours after the last training session. In the present study, this was done to avoid residual effects of training, as myogenin mRNA expression has been shown to be acutely elevated after a resistance exercise bout for up to 24 hours.<sup><xref rid="bibr13-15347354211035442" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Testosterone status might also have been a factor in the divergent results. Resting mRNA expression of myogenin was increased in eugonadal older males after 21 weeks of resistance training.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-15347354211035442" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> However, eugonadal older men exhibit mean total testosterone levels of ~16 nmol L<sup>−1,<xref rid="bibr38-15347354211035442" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> which is an order of magnitude greater than the PCS (~1 nmol L<sup>−1</sup>) in the present study. As testosterone administration has been shown to increase IGF-1 mRNA expression in rat muscle,<sup><xref rid="bibr39-15347354211035442" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="bibr40-15347354211035442" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> it is possible that eugonadal testosterone levels potentiate the response of skeletal muscle IGF-1 mRNA expression to the anabolic stimulus of resistance exercise.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-15347354211035442" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup></p>
              <p>The lack of change that we observed in PGC-1α4 mRNA expression parallels findings by Lundberg et al in eugonadal young men (~25 years) who performed 5 weeks of resistance training or combined resistance and aerobic training.<sup><xref rid="bibr41-15347354211035442" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> The unaltered resting levels despite increases in muscle cross-sectional area led the authors to conclude that resting PGC-1α4 expression was unlikely to contribute to hypertrophy. These findings are in contrast to Ruas et al, who noted elevated resting expression of PGC-1α4 following 8 weeks of resistance training in human samples collected 72 to 96 hours after the last training session. Marked increases in muscle mass and resistance to the muscle-wasting effects of cancer cachexia were also observed in transgenic PGC-1α4 mice, suggesting a role of PGC-1α4 in mediating an anabolic program of hypertrophy.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-15347354211035442" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Although we did not observe significant increases in resting PGC-1α4 mRNA expression in PCS on ADT, without protein analysis we cannot exclude the involvement of PGC-1α4 in hypertrophic mechanisms.</p>
              <p>We also observed no significant difference in myostatin mRNA expression between exercise and non-exercise groups post-intervention, which agrees with findings from Nilsen et al,<sup><xref rid="bibr7-15347354211035442" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> the only other study to quantify myostatin response to resistance training in PCS on ADT. Myostatin is a key modulator of both protein synthesis and degradation pathways, with inhibition of myogenin and activation of MuRF-1 among its diverse activities.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-15347354211035442" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Despite observing increases in muscle cross-sectional area and strength, Nilsen et al<sup><xref rid="bibr7-15347354211035442" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> found no changes in resting myostatin protein content after 16 weeks of resistance training. These findings differ from previous reports in eugonadal young and older men,<sup><xref rid="bibr9-15347354211035442" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="bibr10-15347354211035442" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> where resting myostatin mRNA expression was reduced following 12 to 21 weeks of resistance training. Our results are similar to the unchanged resting myostatin mRNA expression observed in young men on ADT following 8 weeks of resistance training,<sup><xref rid="bibr37-15347354211035442" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> suggesting a role of androgen suppression in limiting the response of myostatin to exercise.</p>
              <p>This study has several limitations. Importantly, this study was a pre-specified exploratory analysis of the clinical trial and was therefore underpowered to determine between-group differences in mRNA expression. Also, alterations in the mRNA expression of anabolic and catabolic regulators of muscle mass may depend on many variables, including physical activity levels, nutritional status, and age.<sup><xref rid="bibr24-15347354211035442" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="bibr42-15347354211035442" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> While we attempted to control for differences between groups through the reporting and statistical analyses of these variables, it is possible that alternative intervening factors may exist that were not accounted for. We were only able to obtain small samples (~23 mg) from the vastus lateralis muscle, which prevented us from conducting other analyses such as protein content, fiber typing, and histochemical staining. The lack of protein expression data, in particular, limits our ability to draw conclusions about the contribution of anabolic genes during the muscle remodeling process that might not have been detected from mRNA analyses. In addition, other hypertrophic and proteolytic signaling genes besides those measured in the present study may contribute to the changes observed in strength and lean mass, although IGF-1 and myostatin were the genes primarily expected to regulate muscle mass. Other limitations of this study include a non-sedentary control group that might have blunted the effects of the intervention and biopsy time points that limit the generalization of these results to studies with similar collection times. In addition, heterogeneities in exercise program design among the studies discussed may explain the differences in findings. Hence, to unequivocally compare mRNA expression across studies, exercise protocols should be reproduced in the same patient population.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, 12 weeks of resistance training increased resting MuRF-1 mRNA expression in <italic toggle="yes">vastus lateralis</italic> samples from prostate cancer survivors on ADT, but did not influence resting mRNA expression of myogenin, IGF-1, PGC-1α4, or myostatin. This randomized pilot trial was the first to investigate signaling through the IGF-1/Akt/mTORC1 and ubiquitin-proteasome pathways in the skeletal muscle of men with prostate cancer on ADT. Future studies can improve on this investigation by characterizing protein content as well as mRNA expression of anabolic, myogenic, and proteolytic genes in skeletal muscle of patients with prostate cancer on ADT and comparing these results to age-matched eugonadal men. Such investigations may aid in a greater mechanistic understanding of skeletal muscle regulation in the absence of androgens and the effects of resistance exercise and skeletal muscle mass on cancer-related outcomes.</p>
