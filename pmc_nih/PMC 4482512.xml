                  <title>Objective</title>
                  <p>In ovarian cancer, two of the most important prognostic factors for survival are completeness of staging and completeness of cytoreductive surgery. Therefore, intra-operative visualization of tumor lesions is of great importance. Preclinical data already demonstrated tumor visualization in a mouse-model using near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging and indocyanine green (ICG) as a result of enhanced permeability and retention (EPR). The aim of this study was to determine feasibility of intraoperative ovarian cancer metastases imaging using NIR fluorescence imaging and ICG in a clinical setting.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Ten patients suspected of ovarian cancer scheduled for staging or cytoreductive surgery were included. Patients received 20 mg ICG intravenously after opening the abdominal cavity. The mini-FLARE NIR fluorescence imaging system was used to detect NIR fluorescent lesions.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>6 out of 10 patients had malignant disease of the ovary or fallopian tube, of which 2 had metastatic disease outside the pelvis. Eight metastatic lesions were detected in these 2 patients, which were all NIR fluorescent. However, 13 non-malignant lesions were also NIR fluorescent, resulting in a false-positive rate of 62%. There was no significant difference in tumor-to-background ratio between malignant and benign lesions (2.0 vs 2.0; P=0.99).</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>This is the first clinical trial demonstrating intraoperative detection of ovarian cancer metastases using NIR fluorescence imaging and ICG. Despite detection of all malignant lesions, a high false-positive rate was observed. Therefore, NIR fluorescence imaging using ICG based on the EPR effect is not satisfactory for the detection of ovarian cancer metastases. The need for tumor-specific intraoperative agents remains.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Ovarian cancer has a worldwide incidence of 225,500 making it the 6th most common cancer in women. With 140,200 deaths worldwide per year, it has the highest mortality rates amongst all gynaecological cancers [<xref rid="pone.0129766.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0129766.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In general, ovarian cancer can be classified as early stage (FIGO I to IIa) or advanced stage (FIGO IIb to IV). Prognosis and treatment are mainly dependent on this classification.</p>
              <p>Early stage ovarian cancer has a 5 year survival of 75–100%, with the most important factors influencing survival being differentiation grade of the tumor and the completeness of staging [<xref rid="pone.0129766.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. During surgical staging, blind biopsy samples of predefined areas and biopsy samples of suspected lesions are obtained. The primary aim of the staging procedure is to determine whether there is occult metastatic disease not primarily visible by the naked eye. When no metastases are present, resection of the primary tumor is the treatment of choice and chemotherapy can be avoided [<xref rid="pone.0129766.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. When metastases are present, surgical resection is supplemented with chemotherapy. Optimal staging has been shown to improve survival in low stage ovarian cancer because it discriminates true early stage ovarian cancer from occult tumor spread, which results in more advanced disease [<xref rid="pone.0129766.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p>
              <p>However, most patients (around 75%) present with advanced disease [<xref rid="pone.0129766.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The most important prognostic factor for overall survival in advanced stage disease is the amount of residual tumor after cytoreductive surgery [<xref rid="pone.0129766.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0129766.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Therefore complete cytoreduction, defined as no visible residual tumor left after surgery, or optimal cytoreduction, not consistently defined as a maximal diameter of residual tumor of 0–2 cm [<xref rid="pone.0129766.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129766.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0129766.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], is the goal for advanced stage ovarian cancer surgery.</p>
              <p>In order to achieve either optimal staging or complete or optimal cytoreduction, visualization of tumor lesions is of great importance. With imaging modalities such as CT and MRI, pre-operative identification and localization of tumor lesions is reasonably achievable, however intraoperative visualization of tumor tissue can be challenging.</p>
              <p>Near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging is a promising technique to assist in the real time intraoperative identification of malignant lesions [<xref rid="pone.0129766.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This technique makes use of NIR fluorescent light (700–900 nm) emitted by contrast agents after excitation by an imaging system able to detect this NIR fluorescent signal. NIR fluorescence is relatively easy and provides sufficient contrast due to high tissue penetration and low auto-fluorescence [<xref rid="pone.0129766.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p>
              <p>For tumor identification, it is essential that contrast agents accumulate in tumor tissue either actively or passively. Active accumulation can be achieved by targeting ligands that are over-expressed on tumor tissue. Van Dam et al. were the first to show tumor identification using a folate receptor alpha (FR-a) targeting agent [<xref rid="pone.0129766.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In their series they were able to identify tumor tissue in 3 patients with FR-a positive ovarian cancer intraoperatively. However, these results have not yet been reproduced in other studies using a FR-a or different targeting agents. A possible cause for this may be the expensive and time-consuming nature of the development of these tumor-specific agents. Therefore, it is of great importance to exploit clinically available contrast agents, such as indocyanine green (ICG) [<xref rid="pone.0129766.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p>
              <p>In vivo ICG binds to serum proteins and therefore behaves as a macromolecule in the circulation. It is known that macromolecules accumulate in tumor tissue due to increased vascular permeability and reduced drainage. This phenomenon is called the "enhanced permeability and retention" (EPR) effect and has been observed in most solid tumors [<xref rid="pone.0129766.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129766.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p>
              <p>Clinical feasibility trials using this effect with ICG in breast cancer patients in a pre-operative diagnostic setting and in gastric cancer patients during endoscopic surgery showed that it was possible to distinguish tumor from surrounding tissue [<xref rid="pone.0129766.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0129766.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In addition, Kosaka et al.[<xref rid="pone.0129766.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] detected small ovarian (1–2 mm in size) cancer implants using NIR fluorescent imaging after intravenous (IV) administration of ICG in a mouse model. Pathophysiological heterogeneity of solid tumors, for examples in size, presence of necrosis, or presence of vascular mediators may influence accumulation of macromolecules in tumor tissue [<xref rid="pone.0129766.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129766.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. It is therefore not clear if all preclinical results can be translated to the clinic.</p>
              <p>The primairy aim of the current study was to determine the feasibility of ovarian cancer metastases detection using ICG and NIR fluorescence imaging in a clinical setting. Secondary aim was to assess concordance between fluorescence signal and tumor status on histopathology. In addition, we sought to determine if a sufficient tumor-to-background ratio (TBR), based on the EPR effect, could be obtained to discriminate between malignant and non-malignant tissue.</p>

                <p>The study protocol (<xref rid="pone.0129766.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0129766.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref> Protocols) was approved by the Local Medical Ethics Committee of the Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC) on 27-06-2012 and was performed in accordance with the ethical standards of the Helsinki Declaration of 1975. Due to administrational error, trail registration was performed after the start of the study (date trial registration 11-09-2014; ISRCTN16945066). This non-randomised study adheres to the Transparent Reporting of Evaluations with Non-Randomised designs (TREND) guidelines (<xref rid="pone.0129766.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 TREND Checklist</xref>). The authors confirm that all ongoing and related trials for this intervention are registered. Because this study was set up as feasibility study, no formal sample size could be calculated. Determination of feasibility was expected after inclusion of 15 patients. In case apparent non-feasibility was observed, earlier termination of the study could be performed.</p>
                <p>Eventually, ten patients presenting at the department of Gynaecological Oncology of LUMC between 14 October 2012 and 11 December 2013 suspected of either early stage ovarian cancer scheduled to undergo staging surgery or of advanced ovarian cancer scheduled to undergo cytoreductive surgery, were included. All surgical procedures were performed by laparotomy through a midline abdominal incision. All patients gave written informed consent. Exclusion criteria were pregnancy, severe renal insufficiency (GFR &lt; 55 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>), or an allergy to iodine or ICG.</p>
                <p>In the operating theatre, after opening of the abdominal cavity, 20 mg of ICG was administered intravenously as single bolus by the anaesthesiologist. The average time between administration of ICG and imaging of the first lesion was 37 minutes. The last lesion was imaged on average 141 minutes post-administration of ICG. First the surgical field was searched for metastases visible by the naked eye. After resection of the primary tumor, uterus and ovaries, the Mini-FLARE was used to identify NIR fluorescent signals. When a fluorescent signal was observed, the operating surgeon performed a biopsy or resection of the fluorescent tissue, unless this would jeopardize patient health or success of surgery. In case of non-fluorescence, only macroscopically suspected lesions were resected. Resected specimens were marked as fluorescent or non-fluorescent and were routinely examined by a pathologist for the presence of malignant cells.</p>

                <p>Intraoperative imaging procedures were performed using the Mini-Fluorescence-Assisted Resection and Exploration (Mini-FLARE) image-guided surgery system, as described earlier [<xref rid="pone.0129766.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Briefly, the system consists of 2 wavelength isolated light sources: a “white” light source, generating 26,600 lx of 400 to 650 nm light, and a “near-infrared” light source, generating 1.08 mW/came of ≈ 760 nm light. Color video and NIR fluorescence images are simultaneously acquired and displayed in real time using custom optics and software that separate the color video and NIR fluorescence images. A pseudo-colored (lime green) merged image of the color video and NIR fluorescence images is also displayed. The imaging head is attached to a flexible gooseneck arm, which permits positioning of the imaging head at extreme angles virtually anywhere over the surgical field. For intraoperative use, the imaging head and imaging system pole stand are wrapped in a sterile shield and drape (Medical Technique Inc., Tucson, AZ).</p>

                <p>For statistical analysis, SPSS statistical software package (Version 20.0, Chicago, IL) was used. TBRs were calculated by dividing the fluorescent signal of the tumor by fluorescent signal of surrounding tissue. Patient age was reported in median, standard deviation (SD), and range, and TBR was reported in mean, SD, and range. To compare patient characteristics, independent samples t-test and chi-square tests were used. To compare TBR and background signal between malignant and benign lesions, independent samples t-test was used. P &lt; 0.05 was considered significant.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>In this feasibility study we investigated the use of NIR fluorescence imaging with the clinically available, non-targeted fluorescent tracer ICG in ovarian cancer patients who underwent a surgical staging procedure or cytoreductive surgery. Malignant metastatic lesions were present in 2 out of 10 patients only, but we found that 100% of these histologically proven malignant lesions were fluorescent using this technique. However, there was also a high false-positive rate of 62%.</p>
              <p>In cytoreductive surgery, the goal is to remove as much tumor as possible, aiming for complete (no tumor visible after surgery) or leastwise optimal cytoreduction (residual tumor maximized to 10 mm), because the amount of residual tumor is one of the most important prognostic factors for survival in advanced stage patients. Van Dam et al.[<xref rid="pone.0129766.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] already showed that with the use of fluorescence imaging using a folate receptor alpha targeting probe (that is over-expressed in 90–95% of ovarian cancer patients), it was possible to identify more tumor deposits than by the naked eye. In our study we could not demonstrate such an added value of NIR fluorescence using the non-specific agent ICG, because all of the fluorescent, histologically malignant lesions were identified with the naked eye.</p>
              <p>Treatment decisions in early stage ovarian cancer patients, for instance regarding adjuvant chemotherapy, are based on the presence of occult metastases and the extent of disease found during surgical staging procedures. If staging is not done properly, this could lead to under treatment of the patient. It has been shown that completeness of surgical staging is an independent prognostic factor for overall survival in early stage patients [<xref rid="pone.0129766.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. If the use of NIR fluorescence imaging leads to more accurate detection of (occult) ovarian cancer metastases, more patients could be optimally staged, possibly leading to better treatment decision making and overall survival. In none of the 3 patients with early stage ovarian or fallopian tube cancer who underwent a staging procedure in this study, metastatic disease was found. Therefore, no added value of NIR fluorescence imaging could be demonstrated in this study using ICG. A total of 13 fluorescent lesions were observed in the 7 patients undergoing surgical staging. On pathologic testing, all 13 lesions were benign and thus false-positive. To conclude, NIR fluorescence imaging could not demonstrate added value in staging procedures because no otherwise undetected metastatic disease could be found, but did result in the resection of non-malignant lesions.</p>
              <p>The intended effect of NIR fluorescence imaging with ICG was based on the EPR effect. Due to tumor-induced angiogenesis, solid tumors exhibit leaky and immature vessels. Because of this macromolecules are able to permeate through the vessels and into tumor tissue where they are retained due to impaired lymph drainage [<xref rid="pone.0129766.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. ICG is not a macromolecule, but behaves like one after binding to serum proteins. This, combined with the rapid clearance from the circulation, makes ICG a potentially good probe for NIR fluorescence imaging of solid tumors. This theory has proven to be true for gastric and breast cancer [<xref rid="pone.0129766.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0129766.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. But it should be noted that all the trials in breast cancer patients were conducted in a pre-operative diagnostic setting and results may differ from intraoperative usage of ICG.</p>
              <p>The large number of false-positives found in this study may be due to the lack of specificity of the EPR effect. It is known that the EPR effect is influenced by multiple factors, such as size, presence of necrosis, tumor type, presence of vascular mediators such as bradykinin or prostaglandins, and location (including primary tumor vs metastatic lesion) of the lesion. Moreover, reactive processes and cancer have parallels in pathophysiological pathways and in vascular mediators. It has been shown that the EPR effect also occurs in inflammatory lesions [<xref rid="pone.0129766.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129766.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129766.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. This is in agreement with part of the false-positive lesions identified in the current study. Especially since the EPR effect in reactive tissue is more prominently present hours after injection (coinciding with our imaging window) versus days to weeks after injection in tumor tissue [<xref rid="pone.0129766.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p>
              <p>Several studies describe the intraoperative identification of solid tumors using clinically available, non-targeted fluorescent probes as ICG and methylene blue (MB). These studies report higher TBRs than found in the current study. For example, imaging of colorectal liver metastases using ICG (TBR 7.0) [<xref rid="pone.0129766.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], parathyroid adenomas using MB (6.1) [<xref rid="pone.0129766.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and breast cancer using MB (2.4) [<xref rid="pone.0129766.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] all showed higher TBRs than the observed 2.0. A possible explanation for this is that in these studies other mechanisms causing accumulation of the fluorescent probe in or around tumor tissue played a role in addition to the possible EPR effect. The EPR effect on its own may not be sufficient in providing high enough TBRs for tumor imaging. Finally, the average TBR of false-positive, benign lesions was just as high as the average TBR of true positive malignant lesions, while the average TBR of reactive benign lesions was even higher than that of malignant lesions. This lack of discriminative power makes NIR fluorescence imaging based on the EPR effect unsuitable for further clinical implementation in ovarian cancer.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>This is the first clinical trial demonstrating the feasibility of intraoperative detection of ovarian cancer metastases using NIR fluorescence imaging and ICG. However, a high number of false-positive lesions that could be explained by the lack of specificity of the EPR effect was found. Moreover, no distinction between malignant, reactive, or benign tissue based on TBR of the different lesions could be made. Therefore, the use of ICG, even when optimized, is not satisfactory for intraoperative NIR fluorescence imaging of ovarian cancer metastases and the need for more tumor-specific targeting agents remains. These results should be confirmed in other solid tumors where intraoperative NIR fluorescence imaging based on the EPR effect is being contemplated.</p>
