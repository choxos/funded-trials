                <p>In malaria-naïve individuals, <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> infection results in high levels of parasite-infected red blood cells (iRBCs) that trigger systemic inflammation and fever. Conversely, individuals in endemic areas who are repeatedly infected are often asymptomatic and have low levels of iRBCs, even young children. We hypothesized that febrile malaria alters the immune system such that <italic>P. falciparum</italic> re-exposure results in reduced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines and enhanced anti-parasite effector responses compared to responses induced before malaria. To test this hypothesis we used a systems biology approach to analyze PBMCs sampled from healthy children before the six-month malaria season and the same children seven days after treatment of their first febrile malaria episode of the ensuing season. PBMCs were stimulated with iRBC <italic>in vitro</italic> and various immune parameters were measured. Before the malaria season, children's immune cells responded to iRBCs by producing pro-inflammatory mediators such as IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-8. Following malaria there was a marked shift in the response to iRBCs with the same children's immune cells producing lower levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and higher levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10, TGF-β). In addition, molecules involved in phagocytosis and activation of adaptive immunity were upregulated after malaria as compared to before. This shift was accompanied by an increase in <italic>P. falciparum-</italic>specific CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>−</sup> T cells that co-produce IL-10, IFN-γ and TNF; however, after the subsequent six-month dry season, a period of markedly reduced malaria transmission, <italic>P. falciparum</italic>–inducible IL-10 production remained partially upregulated only in children with persistent asymptomatic infections. These findings suggest that in the face of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> re-exposure, children acquire exposure-dependent <italic>P. falciparum</italic>–specific immunoregulatory responses that dampen pathogenic inflammation while enhancing anti-parasite effector mechanisms. These data provide mechanistic insight into the observation that <italic>P. falciparum</italic>–infected children in endemic areas are often afebrile and tend to control parasite replication.</p>

                <p>Malaria remains a major cause of disease and death worldwide. When mosquitoes infect people with malaria parasites for the first time, the parasite rapidly multiplies in the blood and the body responds by producing molecules that cause inflammation and fever, and sometimes the infection progresses to life-threatening disease. However, in regions where people are repeatedly infected with malaria parasites, most infections do not cause fever and parasites often do not multiply uncontrollably. For example, in Mali where this study was conducted, children are infected with malaria parasites ≥100 times/year but only get malaria fever ∼2 times/year and often manage to control parasite numbers in the blood. To understand these observations we collected immune cells from the blood of healthy children before the malaria season and 7 days after malaria fever. We simulated malaria infection at these time points by exposing the immune cells to malaria parasites in a test-tube. We found that re-exposing immune cells to parasites after malaria fever results in reduced expression of molecules that cause fever and enhanced expression of molecules involved in parasite killing. These findings help explain how the immune system prevents fever and controls malaria parasite growth in children who are repeatedly infected with malaria parasites.</p>

              <p>In previously unexposed individuals, blood-stage <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> parasites rapidly replicate and almost invariably induce fever and other symptoms of malaria <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Collins1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> through the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Day1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1004079-Walther1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Although the initial systemic inflammatory response is crucial for setting in motion the innate and adaptive immune effector mechanisms that control blood-stage parasites <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Urban1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Langhorne1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, dysregulated inflammation has been linked to severe malaria <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Kwiatkowski1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Grau1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> which only occurs in a minority of individuals with infrequent or no prior malaria exposure <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Molineaux1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Conversely, in malaria endemic areas where individuals are repeatedly exposed, <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infections more commonly cause a mild febrile illness or no symptoms at all, and parasite numbers in the blood are generally kept in check, even in young children <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Baliraine1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1004079-McGregor1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> who have yet to acquire a fully protective antibody repertoire <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Portugal1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. The nature of the immune response that enables most children to restrain <italic>P. falciparum</italic>-induced inflammation while maintaining control of parasite replication remains elusive <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Langhorne1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Riley1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p>
              <p>The notion of malaria ‘tolerance’ has long been invoked to explain the common finding of low-level, asymptomatic blood-stage infection in endemic areas <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Sinton1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, particularly among children, as antibodies that reliably protect against febrile malaria are only acquired after many years of exposure to genetically diverse and clonally variant <italic>P. falciparum</italic> antigens <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Portugal1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain malaria tolerance or ‘anti-disease’ immunity <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Riley1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Boutlis1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> including antibody-mediated neutralization of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) molecules such as GPI anchors <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Riley1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Schofield1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Boutlis2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>; desensitization of pattern-recognition receptor (PRR)-mediated signaling as a result of repeated stimulation <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Boutlis1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>; and the production of anti-inflammatory mediators such as IL-10 <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Day1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1004079-Dodoo1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> and TGF-β <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Dodoo1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1004079-Walther2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> that suppress inflammation-driven anti-parasite effector mechanisms once parasite replication has been controlled <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Riley1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p>
              <p>Interestingly, it has long been speculated that parallels exist between malarial tolerance and bacterial endotoxin tolerance (reviewed in <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Boutlis1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>). This speculation is based in part on early studies in humans that showed that malaria induces cross-tolerance to the febrile response normally induced by bacterial endotoxin <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Heyman1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Rubenstein1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. The traditional view of endotoxin tolerance holds that immune cells that are exposed to endotoxin have an altered response when re-challenged with endotoxin, such that the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines is attenuated relative to the response induced at homeostasis <xref rid="ppat.1004079-West1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Whether <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infection in humans ‘tolerizes’ immune cells in an analogous manner is unknown. More specifically, there is no direct evidence that febrile malaria in humans induces regulatory responses that limit the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines upon re-exposure to <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasites relative to responses induced at homeostasis before malaria in the same individual. Also, it is unclear how current views of malaria-induced tolerance/regulatory responses account for the observation that most children in endemic areas are able to restrain <italic>P. falciparum</italic>-induced inflammation <italic>and</italic> simultaneously control parasite replication, since generalized suppression of <italic>P. falciparum</italic>-triggered immune responses predicts that parasite replication would proceed unhindered and cause severe disease.</p>
              <p>A potential solution to this problem is that febrile malaria temporarily alters immune cells such that the host responds to <italic>P. falciparum</italic> re-exposure by downregulating the production of acute phase pro-inflammatory mediators that contribute to fever and other malaria symptoms while enhancing anti-parasite effector mechanisms that control parasite replication, such as phagocytosis-mediated clearance of blood-stage parasites. This hypothesis is supported by a recent study by Foster et al. who used an <italic>in vitro</italic> model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) tolerance in murine macrophages to show that the regulation of LPS-triggered inflammation is component-specific, such that pro-inflammatory mediators are transiently silenced or ‘tolerized’ while antimicrobial effectors are primed or enhanced upon re-challenge with LPS <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Foster1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. A similar phenotype was observed in a human model of LPS tolerance <xref rid="ppat.1004079-delFresno1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, but whether these observations reflect events induced by natural infections in humans is unknown.</p>
              <p>Here we tested the hypothesis that febrile malaria alters children's immune cells such that pro-inflammatory mediators are downregulated and anti-parasite effector responses are upregulated upon re-exposure to <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasites compared to that induced at homeostasis before malaria in the same children. In addition, given the pivotal role of IL-10 in regulating <italic>Plasmodium</italic>-induced inflammation in murine models <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Spence1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, we sought to elucidate the identity, function and kinetics of <italic>P. falciparum</italic>-specific IL-10-producing cells. We further asked if <italic>P. falciparum</italic>-inducible regulatory responses that limit inflammation are maintained in untreated children who harbor chronic asymptomatic infections, and whether these responses can be recalled in children who have not been exposed to <italic>P. falciparum</italic> for extended periods of time. To address these questions we applied a systems biology approach <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Tran1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> to a longitudinal analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) sampled from Malian children over a 12-month period—starting at their healthy baseline before the six-month malaria season; seven days after treatment of their first febrile malaria episode of the ensuing malaria season (when malaria symptoms had resolved); and after the subsequent six-month dry season, a period of little to no <italic>P. falciparum</italic> transmission.</p>
              <p>We found that febrile malaria induces a marked shift in the response to <italic>P. falciparum</italic> re-exposure with cells producing lower levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and higher levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines compared to responses induced at homeostasis before malaria. Re-exposure was also associated with enhanced expression of pathways involved in phagocytosis and activation of adaptive immunity. This shift was accompanied by a marked increase in <italic>P. falciparum-</italic>specific CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>−</sup> T cells that co-produce IL-10, IFN-γ and TNF. IL-10 remained partially inducible in untreated children with chronic asymptomatic infections whereas IL-10 was no longer inducible in children whose infections had been cleared by treatment.</p>

                <title><italic>P. falciparum</italic>-inducible inflammation is downregulated and anti-parasitic effectors are upregulated after febrile malaria relative to responses induced at the healthy baseline</title>
                <p>To obtain a global view of transcriptional changes that persist in children's PBMCs after the clinical resolution of febrile malaria, compared to each child's own healthy baseline, we profiled RNA expression of PBMCs collected from 34 healthy Malian children before the six-month malaria season, when blood smears were negative for <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasites, and 7 days after treatment of their first febrile malaria episode of the ensuing malaria season, when malaria symptoms had resolved. The average age of these children was 8.5 years and 32% were female. At their first febrile malaria episode of the season, children had an axillary temperature of &gt;37.5°C (or their parents reported fever within 24 hours), were infected with <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (geometric mean density 17,817 asexual parasites/µl of blood) and had no other cause of fever discernible on physical examination. The average incidence of febrile malaria during the six-month malaria season was similar for the 34 children in this study compared to children in this age group in the larger cohort (1.6 and 1.5 episodes, respectively) <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Crompton1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. By definition, these malaria-susceptible children had yet to acquire <italic>P. falciparum</italic>-specific antibodies that reliably protect from febrile malaria. Individual demographic and clinical data are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004079.s003">Table S1</xref>. Malaria was effectively treated in all subjects with a standard 3-day course of artemether/lumefantrine.</p>
                <p>PBMCs were first analyzed directly ex vivo (not re-stimulated). Principal components analysis of the microarray data showed segregation of transcription profiles based on time-point (healthy baseline vs. day 7 after malaria), but not age, gender or batch effects (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004079.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). Within-subject gene-expression changes were computed and resulted in 1497 differentially expressed genes (DEGs)—1,351 increased and 146 decreased after the resolution of febrile malaria relative to baseline (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004079.s004">Table S2</xref>). Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) identified “Infectious Disease”, “Immunological Disease” and “Inflammatory Disease” among the top five functional categories enriched with DEGs. Notably, all differentially expressed genes encoding cytokines and chemokines that have been associated with <italic>P. falciparum</italic>-induced fever and inflammation <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Day1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1004079-Walther1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Ochiel1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, including the canonical pyrogenic cytokines <italic>IL1B</italic> and <italic>TNF</italic> as well as the pro-inflammatory chemokines <italic>IL8</italic>, <italic>CCL3</italic> (<italic>MIP-1α</italic>) and <italic>CXCL2</italic> (<italic>MIP-2α</italic>), were suppressed after the resolution of malaria to lower levels than observed at baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004079-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Conversely, genes expressing molecules directly involved in microbial killing and activation of adaptive immunity were significantly upregulated after the resolution of febrile malaria relative to the healthy baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004079-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Specifically, IPA identified the following canonical pathways as significantly upregulated: “Toll-like receptor signaling” (<italic>P</italic> = 2.15e-6), “Fcγ receptor-mediated phagocytosis in macrophages and monocytes” (<italic>P</italic> = 1.8e-4), “Production of nitric oxide and reactive species in macrophages” (<italic>P</italic> = 1.09e-7), “Antigen presentation pathway” (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0463), “T cell receptor signaling” (<italic>P</italic> = 1.19e-5) and “Interferon signaling” (<italic>P</italic> = 5.08e-6) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004079.s001">Figure S1B</xref>). The expression of several PRRs including Toll-like receptor (<italic>TLR</italic>)<italic>2</italic> and <italic>TLR4</italic> was increased after malaria relative to baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004079-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), consistent with recent <italic>in vivo</italic> exposure to <italic>P. falciparum</italic> PAMPs such as GPI anchors <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Krishnegowda1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, hemozoin <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Shio1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, CpG-containing DNA motifs bound to hemozoin <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Parroche1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> and AT-rich DNA motifs <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Sharma1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, but of note, <italic>NLRP3</italic>, a putative receptor for <italic>P. falciparum</italic> hemozoin-induced IL-1β production <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Griffith1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, was the only PRR to be downregulated after malaria relative to homeostasis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004079-g001">Figure 1A</xref>).</p>

                <p>Because changes in mRNA levels in PBMCs can reflect an altered cell composition of the PBMC compartment or changes in gene expression in discrete cell populations, we analyzed the PBMCs used for gene-expression profiling by FACS and found no significant differences in the percentage of CD4<sup>+</sup> or CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, B cells or monocytes after the resolution of febrile malaria relative to the healthy baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004079-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Moreover, at the individual subject level we found that genes encoding myeloid-expressed pro-inflammatory mediators were downregulated after resolution of malaria relative to baseline irrespective of changes in the percentage of monocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004079-g001">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004079.s001">Figure S1C</xref>), and even as mRNA levels of other genes identified as myeloid-specific <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Chaussabel1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> were unchanged or increased after malaria relative to baseline (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004079.s001">Figure S1D</xref>). Taken together, these data indicate that the changes in mRNA levels that persist after the resolution of febrile malaria relative to the healthy baseline reflect differential regulation of gene expression rather than gross alterations in the composition of the PBMC compartment.</p>
                <p>These data indicate that febrile malaria induces transcriptional changes in PBMCs that persist after the resolution of febrile malaria; namely, we observed that the expression of genes encoding pro-inflammatory mediators is suppressed while the expression of molecules involved in microbial killing and activation of adaptive immunity is enhanced after malaria relative to baseline. On the basis of these findings we hypothesized that re-exposure to <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasites soon after the resolution of febrile malaria would induce a qualitatively different immune response relative to that induced at the healthy baseline. To test this hypothesis and to investigate the molecular and cellular basis of regulatory responses induced upon <italic>P. falciparum</italic> re-exposure, we analyzed the same PBMCs from the same 34 children (collected at the healthy baseline before the malaria season and seven days after treatment of the first febrile malaria episode) following <italic>in vitro</italic> stimulation with <italic>P. falciparum</italic>-infected red-blood cell (iRBC) lysate. iRBC-inducible gene expression as well as secreted and intracellular cytokine production were examined with each child serving as his or her own healthy baseline control.</p>
                <p>Within-subject gene expression changes induced by iRBC stimulation at both time points were computed and resulted in 456 DEGs—148 decreased and 308 increased after the resolution of febrile malaria relative to that induced at the healthy baseline (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004079.s005">Table S3</xref>). IPA identified “Inflammatory Response” as the functional category with the highest enrichment score (<italic>P</italic> = 3.36e-34).

In line with this result, IPA identified the following canonical pathways as significantly downregulated: “Acute phase response signaling” (P = 5.94e-4), “Role of hypercytokinemia/hyperchemokinemia in pathogenesis of Influenza (P = 1.19e-3), “IL-6 signaling” (P = 1.18e-3), “Agranulocyte adhesion and diapedesis” (P = 8.82e-6), “Granulocyte adhesion and diapedesis” (P = 6.55e-9) and “Role of cytokines in mediating communication between immune cells” (P = 0.017) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004079.s001">Figure S1E</xref>).

                <p>In contrast to the downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine responses, genes encoding molecules involved in microbial killing and activation of adaptive immunity were upregulated by iRBC stimulation after malaria relative to responses induced by iRBC stimulation at baseline. These included molecules involved in opsonic and non-opsonic phagocytosis, phagolysosome maturation, antigen presentation and co-stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004079-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). IPA identified the following canonical pathways as significantly upregulated: “iNOS signaling” (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0012), “Antigen presentation pathway” (P = 6.87e-5), “T helper cell differentiation” (P = 1.88e-3) and “T cell receptor signaling” (<italic>P</italic> = 0.035) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004079.s001">Figure S1E</xref>). Together these data suggest that re-exposure to <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasites after a recent episode of febrile malaria induces the differential expression of functionally distinct components of the immune response, whereby acute phase pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines that drive the initial systemic inflammatory response are restrained, while pathways involved in microbial killing and activation of adaptive immunity are upregulated.</p>
                <p>To validate the expression of selected immune-related genes, we used quantitative real time (qRT)-PCR to analyze PBMCs from the 17 children who had microarray data from the <italic>ex vivo</italic> and iRBC-stimulated experiments at both time points (before and after malaria). We found a positive correlation (<italic>r</italic> = 0.8653; <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001) for gene expression as detected by microarray and qRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004079-g001">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004079.s006">Table S4</xref>).

                <p>In an independent experiment, we sought to determine if the upregulation of <italic>P. falciparum</italic>-inducible IL-10 production after malaria influences the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. We observed that blocking IL-10 activity with antibodies specific for IL-10 and the IL-10 receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004079-g002">Figure 2C</xref>) enhanced iRBC-inducible TNF and IL-6 production in some but not all children after the resolution of febrile malaria compared to baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004079-g002">Figures 2D and E</xref>).</p>
                <p>We next asked if <italic>P. falciparum</italic>-inducible IL-10 responses could be recalled in children who had not been exposed to <italic>P. falciparum</italic> transmission for an extended period of time.

              <p>In our previous investigations at this study site we observed that the risk of febrile malaria slowly decreases over years as individuals are exposed to intense seasonal <italic>P. falciparum</italic> transmission such that adults rarely experience febrile malaria when infected with blood-stage parasites <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Weiss1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. The gradual acquisition of blood-stage immunity that reliably protects from the onset of febrile malaria likely reflects the need for repeated infections over years to achieve levels of broadly reactive antibodies that exceed a protective threshold <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Portugal1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Crompton2" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. However, even malaria-susceptible children at this study site (who by definition have yet to acquire reliably protective antibodies) experience only 1 to 2 febrile malaria episodes per six-month malaria season despite ≥100 infective mosquito bites per person each season, and generally these children manage to keep parasite numbers in the blood in check <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Weiss1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. These observations prompted us to investigate immune mechanisms beyond antibody responses that might contribute to protection from febrile malaria and parasite replication in children who are exposed to repeated <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infections, and also to investigate how children become susceptible again to febrile malaria after a period of decreased <italic>P. falciparum</italic> exposure.</p>
              <p>We found that acute febrile malaria alters children's PBMCs such that <italic>P. falciparum</italic> re-exposure results in downregulation of acute phase pro-inflammatory cytokines that drive fever and systemic inflammation (e.g. IL-1β and IL-6 from monocytes/macrophages), and upregulation of immune mechanisms involved in control of inflammation (e.g. IL-10-producing CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells) and parasite clearance (e.g. IFN-γ-producing CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, phagocytosis and phagolysosome maturation) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004079-g004">Figure 4</xref>). The maintenance of this regulatory state appears to depend on recent or ongoing <italic>P. falciparum</italic> exposure as children revert to a homeostatic baseline in the absence of ongoing <italic>P. falciparum</italic> exposure during the six-month dry season. The short-lived, exposure-dependent nature of this response mirrors the kinetics of <italic>P. falciparum</italic>-specific antibody responses in children <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Weiss1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Crompton2" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, suggesting that these responses work in concert to protect children as long as <italic>P. falciparum</italic> exposure is ongoing. These data offer mechanistic insights into how children who are repeatedly infected with <italic>P. falciparum</italic> commonly manage to remain afebrile and control parasite replication, and how they become susceptible again to febrile malaria after a period of reduced <italic>P. falciparum</italic> exposure. The possibility that treatment with artemether/lumefantrine contributed to these findings cannot be excluded.</p>

                  <p>In children without prior or recent malaria exposure, <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infection induces a robust pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine response (e.g. IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8) whereas effector mechanisms that mediate parasite clearance (phagocytosis, phagolysosome activation, antigen presentation, T cell co-stimulation and IFN-<bold>γ</bold> production by CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells) are not readily inducible, leaving children susceptible to fever and other systemic symptoms of malaria as well as poorly controlled parasite replication. In contrast, febrile malaria induces an exposure-dependent regulatory state (shown here) whereby re-exposure to <italic>P. falciparum</italic> results in reduced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and enhanced expression of regulatory cytokines (e.g. IL-10 production by CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells) and pathways involved in phagocytosis-mediated clearance of infected red blood cells and activation of adaptive immunity, thus enabling children to remain asymptomatic and control parasite replication in the face of ongoing <italic>P. falciparum</italic> exposure. In addition, <italic>P. falciparum</italic>-specific IgG levels are low in children who have not been recently exposed to malaria, but transiently increase in response to <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infection <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Weiss1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Crompton2" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, further enhancing exposure-dependent parasite clearance through opsonization and phagocytosis of infected erythrocytes. Arrows indicate the direction of expression observed in this study of molecules at the mRNA and/or protein levels induced by <italic>P. falciparum</italic> re-exposure after febrile malaria relative to responses induced by <italic>P. falciparum</italic> exposure at the healthy baseline.

              <p>These data shed light on the long-standing and enigmatic clinical notion of ‘premunition’—a partially effective, exposure-dependent immune response that protects against illness and high numbers of parasites in the blood without completely eliminating the infection <xref rid="ppat.1004079-McGregor1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Smith1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Hansen1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. Although premunition is often viewed as a state of immune dysregulation or suppression <xref rid="ppat.1004079-McGregor1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Smith1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Hansen1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, we speculate that it evolved as an appropriate immune response in the face of unrelenting exposure to genetically and antigenically diverse parasites such that young children are at least partially protected from potentially life-threatening inflammation and unchecked parasite replication before they acquire durable, broadly reactive antibodies that reliably protect against the onset of malaria symptoms. Although we did not study severe malaria per se—an overlapping set of syndromes <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Marsh1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref> which have been linked to excessive inflammation <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Schofield2" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>—it is conceivable that the ability to rapidly downregulate <italic>P. falciparum</italic>-inducible inflammation in early life contributes to the rapid acquisition of strain-transcendent immunity to severe malaria which may occur after only one or two symptomatic infections <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Gupta1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, and conversely, that the small percentage of children who develop severe malaria are those whose genetic background, environment (e.g. co-infection history, microbiota, nutritional status) or specific interaction with parasite virulence factors <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Avril1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1004079-Turner1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref> tips them toward dysregulated pathologic inflammatory responses.</p>
              <p>The prospective design of this study, in which each subject served as their own healthy control, provides a rare view of the regulation and functional plasticity of innate and adaptive immune cells in response to a natural infection in humans. In general, innate immune cells such as monocytes/macrophages first detect pathogens through PRRs such as TLRs and NOD-like receptors (NLRs) which recognize highly conserved PAMPs <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Takeuchi1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. Through these initial host-pathogen interactions, innate immune cells provide the first line of defense against pathogen invasion and also direct the quality of antigen-specific B and T cell responses. To date, only a handful of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> PAMPs and their respective PRRs have been identified. These include GPI anchors (TLR2&gt;TLR4) <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Krishnegowda1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, hemozoin (NLRP3) <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Shio1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, CpG-containing DNA motifs bound to hemozoin (TLR9) <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Parroche1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> and AT-rich DNA motifs (unknown cytosolic receptor) <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Sharma1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Studies <italic>in vitro</italic> and in animal models show that these PAMPs drive monocytes/macrophages to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Krishnegowda1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1004079-Parroche1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. These observations are consistent with studies in humans that show these cytokines and chemokines rise and fall in the serum of individuals treated for febrile malaria <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Day1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1004079-Walther1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. However, prior to this study, the nature of the inflammatory response induced by <italic>P. falciparum</italic> re-exposure relative to that induced at the healthy baseline of the same individuals was unknown. Here we show that the capacity of monocytes/macrophages to produce the canonical pyrogenic cytokines IL-1β and IL-6 is reduced upon re-exposure to <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasites relative to that induced at the healthy baseline of the same individuals—a finding we observed at the mRNA level by microarray and qRT-PCR in PBMCs, and at the protein level in isolated monocytes/macrophages.</p>
              <p>Although the precise molecular mechanisms that regulate <italic>P. falciparum</italic>-inducible inflammation remain to be fully elucidated, this study offers insight into the multiple levels at which this regulation might occur. For example, we observed that <italic>NFKB1</italic> expression was downregulated after malaria relative to baseline. <italic>NFKB1</italic> encodes the p50 component of the canonical p65/p50 NF-κB heterodimeric transcription factor that stimulates the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-6 <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Hayden1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. We also observed decreased expression of <italic>NLRP3</italic> after malaria relative to baseline. <italic>NLRP3</italic> encodes a component of the NALP3 inflammasome which is expressed in myeloid cells and activates caspase-1, thereby promoting the maturation and secretion of IL-1β <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Davis1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>. Other differentially expressed PRRs such as <italic>TLR2</italic> and <italic>TRL4</italic> were upregulated after malaria relative to baseline, suggesting that the regulation of <italic>P. falciparum</italic>-inducible inflammation does not occur at the level of TLR expression. Interestingly, TLR expression is also upregulated in the context of tolerance induced by gram positive bacteria <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Buckley1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>, whereas tolerance induced by gram negative bacteria is associated with reduced expression of TLR2 and TLR4 <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Zhong1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>, underscoring the microbe-specific nature of immune-regulation.</p>
              <p>After the resolution of febrile malaria we also observed increased expression of genes encoding proteins that limit the inflammatory response including <italic>IL18BP</italic>, <italic>IL1R2</italic>, <italic>CTLA4</italic>, <italic>BTLA</italic>, <italic>SAMHD1 and TNFSF10</italic>, as well as decreased expression of genes encoding proteins that promote inflammation including <italic>PTGS2</italic> and <italic>TREM1</italic>. Further studies are needed to more clearly elucidate the signaling networks involved in regulating the immune response to <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infection and to fully understand the relationships between perturbations to these networks and the variability in malaria clinical outcomes.</p>
              <p>The gene expression microarray data also shed light on the regulation of chemotactic responses <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Mantovani1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref> in malaria. Relative to the response induced at the healthy baseline, re-exposure to <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasites was associated with downregulated expression of chemokines that recruit macrophages (<italic>CCL3</italic>, <italic>CCL3L1</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004079-g001">Figures 1A, 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004079-g004">4</xref>) and neutrophils (<italic>CXCL1</italic>, <italic>CXCL2</italic>, <italic>CXCL3</italic>, <italic>CXCL6</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004079-g001">Figures 1A, 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004079-g004">4</xref>), but upregulated expression of monocyte/macrophage-specific chemokine receptors (<italic>CCR1</italic>, <italic>CCR5</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004079-g004">Figure 4</xref>). We postulate that this pattern reflects the fine-tuning of chemotactic responses in the face of ongoing or repeated <italic>P. falciparum</italic> exposure, whereby systemic chemokine release is restrained to decrease the potential for tissue damage caused by aberrant trafficking and accumulation of effector cells such as neutrophils, whereas the reciprocal regulation of monocyte/macrophage-specific chemokines (repressed) and chemokine receptors (increased) enhances the sensitivity of monocyte/macrophages to detect decreased concentrations of chemokines.</p>
              <p>Murine models clearly demonstrate that IL-10 and TGF-β play critical roles in regulating <italic>Plasmodium</italic>-induced inflammation <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Omer1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. In humans, IL-10 and TGF-β levels increase in serum during acute febrile malaria and then fall after treatment <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Day1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Wenisch1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, consistent with a role for these cytokines in restraining and resolving <italic>P. falciparum</italic>-induced inflammation during a single malaria episode. However, whether febrile malaria conditions the immune system to modify the production of IL-10 and TGF-β upon subsequent exposure to <italic>P. falciparum</italic> within the same individual remained an open question. Here we show that <italic>P. falciparum</italic>-inducible IL-10 and TGF-β production/expression is upregulated after the resolution of febrile malaria relative to that which is inducible at the healthy baseline of the same individuals. In addition, we observed that IL-10 blockade <italic>in vitro</italic> enhanced IL-6 and TNF production in some but not all children, consistent with a role for IL-10 in controlling inflammation in the setting of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> re-exposure, but also highlighting the complexity of regulatory responses that restrain <italic>P. falciparum</italic>-induced inflammation.</p>
              <p>Given the role of IL-10 in regulating <italic>Plasmodium-</italic>induced inflammation, we sought to illuminate the identity, function and kinetics of <italic>P. falciparum</italic>-specific IL-10-producing cells. Previous studies in humans have shown that total FOXP3<sup>+</sup> T regulatory cells (Tregs) increase in response to experimental <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Walther2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> and natural <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Finney2" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>
<italic>P. falciparum</italic> infection (reviewed in <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Finney1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>), which suggested that Treg-generated anti-inflammatory cytokines play an important role in controlling <italic>P. falciparum</italic>-inducible inflammation. However, subsequent cross-sectional studies failed to conclusively show significant differences in Treg responses between individuals with mild and severe malaria <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Walther3" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Minigo1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>. Here we show that CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>−</sup> T cells are the predominant source of <italic>P. falciparum</italic>-inducible IL-10, whereas Tregs contributed minimally to the overall IL-10 response. We demonstrate that IL-10 producing CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>−</sup> T cells are <italic>P. falciparum</italic>-specific, in that they require APCs and T cell receptor engagement to produce IL-10. We also found that <italic>P. falciparum</italic>-inducible IL-10 production by CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells isolated after malaria did not change significantly when these cells were co-cultured with homologous APCs collected before malaria, although there was a trend toward enhanced IL-10 production by these CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells when cultured with APCs collected after malaria.</p>
              <p>Interestingly, we observed that a significant proportion of <italic>P. falciparum</italic>-specific IL-10 producing CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>−</sup> T cells co-produced the Th1 cytokines IFN-γ and/or TNF. Similar ‘self-regulating’ Th1 cells that co-produce IL-10 and IFN-γ were first identified in the lungs of patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Gerosa1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref> and have since been observed in mice infected with <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>
<xref rid="ppat.1004079-Jankovic1" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref> and <italic>Leishmania major</italic>
<xref rid="ppat.1004079-Anderson1" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref> as well as in humans with visceral leishmaniasis <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Nylen1" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref>. Intriguingly, we observed that <italic>P. falciparum</italic>-specific IL-10 was only inducible in activated Th1 cells after recent febrile malaria, and that after the dry season IL-10 and IFN-γ were no longer inducible through <italic>P. falciparum</italic> stimulation. This is consistent with a recent study of Ugandan children by Jagannathan et al. in which the frequencies of <italic>P. falciparum</italic>-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells co-producing IFN-γ and IL-10 were inversely associated with days since last malaria episode <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Jagannathan1" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>. Together these data support the hypothesis that IL-10 production by antigen-specific Th1 cells represents a normal phase of their differentiation program which is reached after full activation in order to restrain the inflammatory response while still allowing an efficacious immune response <xref rid="ppat.1004079-OGarra1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Jankovic1" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>, namely, IFN-γ production that promotes phagocytosis-mediated clearance of blood-stage parasites.</p>
              <p>Importantly, we show that <italic>P. falciparum</italic>-specific IL-10 production remains inducible in some but not all untreated children whose low-level asymptomatic <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infections persisted through the six-month dry season, suggesting that the production of IL-10 and IFN-γ is finely tuned such that parasitemia is controlled without inducing clinically overt inflammation—potentially explaining the long-standing clinical observation that most individuals, if left untreated after their initial bout of febrile malaria, become afebrile and maintain control of parasitemia for months before the infection is finally cleared. The exposure-dependent inducibility of IL-10 production by Th1 cells may also explain our previous observation at the same study site that children with asymptomatic <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infection at the end of the dry season are at lower risk of febrile malaria during the ensuing malaria season <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Crompton1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, whereas uninfected children at the end of the dry season are at increased risk—corresponding temporally with their return to a homeostatic baseline in which <italic>P. falciparum</italic> exposure induces a pro-inflammatory phenotype. The exposure-dependent inducibility of IL-10 is also consistent with anecdotal reports of rapidly waning clinical immunity to febrile malaria in those who emigrate from malaria endemic areas <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Marsh2" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref>. Taken together these data point toward a protective effect of <italic>P. falciparum</italic>-specific IL-10 producing Th1 cells in malaria, a hypothesis supported by a cross-sectional study in The Gambia which showed a higher frequency of total IL-10 producing Th1 cells in children with mild versus severe malaria <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Walther3" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>. In contrast, a study in Uganda recently reported that frequencies of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells co-producing IFN-γ and IL-10 were not associated with protection from future malaria, although imprecise measures of malaria exposure may have led to spurious associations with protection <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Jagannathan1" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>. More studies are needed to define the potential role of these cells in protection from malaria and to elucidate the molecular basis of their remarkable functional plasticity <xref rid="ppat.1004079-OShea1" ref-type="bibr">[70]</xref>—information that could define ways in which these cells could be safely induced and maintained through vaccination. Further studies are also needed to disentangle the relative contributions of IL-10 upregulation and antibodies to protection from malaria.</p>
              <p>Malaria-induced regulatory responses that control inflammation are often viewed as globally immunosuppressive, which predicts that parasites would grow unimpeded in individuals residing in areas of ongoing <italic>P. falciparum</italic> transmission. However, this model is at odds with the common finding of low-level, asymptomatic infection among children in endemic areas. Therefore a key finding of this study is that despite the downregulation of <italic>P. falciparum</italic>-inducible inflammation after the resolution of malaria, pathways involved in clearance of blood-stage parasites and activation of adaptive immunity were upregulated. Specifically, we observed <italic>P. falciparum</italic>-inducible upregulation of genes encoding proteins that mediate opsonic (e.g. <italic>FCGR1</italic>) and non-opsonic (e.g. <italic>CR1</italic>, <italic>CD36</italic>) phagocytosis, phagolysosome maturation, antigen processing and presentation, and T cell co-stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004079-g004">Figure 4</xref>). The limited blood volume available from children enrolled in this study precluded concomitant functional confirmation of these observations; however, the observed gene expression pattern of enhanced anti-microbial activity after the resolution of febrile malaria is consistent with the results of a study in which malaria-naïve adults, who were experimentally infected with <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, showed enhanced macrophage phagocytic activity after treatment relative to baseline <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Leitner1" ref-type="bibr">[71]</xref>. Non-opsonic phagocytosis of iRBCs is considered to be an important first line of defense in non-immune or partially immune hosts who have yet to acquire <italic>P. falciparum</italic>-specific opsonizing antibodies <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Urban2" ref-type="bibr">[72]</xref>. Indeed, others have shown that the scavenger receptor CD36 mediates phagocytosis of non-opsonized iRBCs <xref rid="ppat.1004079-McGilvray1" ref-type="bibr">[73]</xref>, and interestingly, does so without inducing pro-inflammatory cytokines <xref rid="ppat.1004079-McGilvray1" ref-type="bibr">[73]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Serghides1" ref-type="bibr">[74]</xref>.</p>
              <p>This study reveals several intriguing parallels between the regulation of <italic>P. falciparum</italic>-triggered inflammation and endotoxin tolerance <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Biswas1" ref-type="bibr">[75]</xref>, a link that is particularly germane in light of earlier studies in humans that showed that malaria induces cross-tolerance to the febrile response normally induced by bacterial endotoxin <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Heyman1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Rubenstein1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, suggesting at least partial overlap of regulatory pathways induced by <italic>Plasmodium</italic> and gram negative bacteria. Indeed, similar to what has been described in an <italic>in vitro</italic> model of LPS tolerance in murine macrophages <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Foster1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, we observed that the regulation of <italic>P. falciparum</italic>-triggered responses is component-specific, such that acute phase pro-inflammatory mediators such as IL-1β and IL-6 are transiently downregulated or ‘tolerized’, while anti-parasitic effector pathways are primed or enhanced upon re-challenge with <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasites. Further reductionist studies are needed to define the molecular mechanisms by which this regulation occurs including the potential role of chromatin modification <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Foster2" ref-type="bibr">[76]</xref> and microRNAs <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Quinn1" ref-type="bibr">[77]</xref>. It will be of interest to understand how malaria-induced epigenetic reprogramming of innate immune cells—or “trained immunity”—differs from that induced by other pathogens <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Kleinnijenhuis1" ref-type="bibr">[78]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Quintin1" ref-type="bibr">[79]</xref>.</p>
              <p>To our knowledge, no human study has evaluated the genome-wide transcriptional response to a natural infection in which each subject serves as his or her own healthy control. Nearly all individuals at the study site become infected with <italic>P. falciparum</italic> within a predictable window of time each year <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Tran2" ref-type="bibr">[80]</xref>, which enabled us to compare intra-individual changes in PBMC gene expression at the healthy baseline before the malaria season and after the resolution of febrile malaria—both directly <italic>ex vivo</italic> and after re-exposing PBMCs to <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasites <italic>in vitro</italic>. An important limitation of blood transcriptome analysis is that changes in mRNA levels can be driven by <italic>de novo</italic> transcriptional regulation or changes in the composition of PBMCs in peripheral blood <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Chaussabel2" ref-type="bibr">[81]</xref>. Three lines of evidence indicate that the observed changes in mRNA levels in this study are driven by <italic>de novo</italic> transcriptional regulation. First, by flow cytometry we did not observe gross changes in the composition of the study subjects' PBMCs from before to after malaria. This is consistent with the observation that immune cells traffic out of the peripheral circulation during acute malaria but then return to the peripheral circulation after the infection has resolved <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Hviid1" ref-type="bibr">[82]</xref>. Second, at the individual subject level we found that genes encoding myeloid-expressed pro-inflammatory mediators were downregulated after malaria relative to baseline, irrespective of changes in the percentage of monocytes, even as mRNA levels of other genes identified as myeloid-specific <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Chaussabel1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> were unchanged or increased relative to baseline. And finally, we observed that <italic>in vitro</italic> stimulation of fixed populations of cells (PBMCs and isolated monocytes/macrophages) induces <italic>de novo</italic> expression of immune-related genes.</p>
              <p>In summary, this longitudinal study of Malian children shows that febrile malaria induces exposure-dependent <italic>P. falciparum</italic>-specific regulatory responses that limit pathogenic inflammation and enhance anti-parasite effector responses upon <italic>P. falciparum</italic> re-exposure. These findings offer mechanistic insights into several long-standing clinical observations in malaria including the high incidence of asymptomatic <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infection in endemic areas <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Marsh2" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref>, reduced fever with repeated experimental <italic>Plasmodium</italic> infections in humans <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Collins2" ref-type="bibr">[83]</xref>, the rapid acquisition of immunity to severe malaria <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Gupta1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, the rapid loss of clinical immunity to febrile malaria in the absence of ongoing <italic>P. falciparum</italic> exposure <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Langhorne1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> and <italic>Plasmodium</italic>-induced hetero-tolerance to endotoxin challenge <xref rid="ppat.1004079-Rubenstein1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Longitudinal studies of symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals who are repeatedly exposed to <italic>P. falciparum</italic> will refine our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the regulation and dysregulation of <italic>Plasmodium</italic>-induced inflammation and may help define the potential for interventions that safely prevent or mitigate <italic>Plasmodium</italic>-induced immunopathology without compromising control of parasite replication.</p>

                <p>Blood samples (8 ml) were drawn by venipuncture into sodium citrate-containing cell preparation tubes (BD, Vacutainer CPT Tubes) and transported 20 km to the laboratory where PBMCs were isolated and frozen within three hours according to the manufacturer's instructions. PBMCs were frozen in fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco, Grand Island, NY) containing 7.5% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), kept at −80°C for 24 hours, and then stored at −196°C in liquid nitrogen. For each individual, PBMCs from all time points were thawed and assayed at the same time. The trypan blue dye exclusion assay consistently demonstrated &gt;80% viability of PBMCs after thawing.</p>

Hybridization, fluidics and scanning were performed according to standard Affymetrix protocols. GeneChip Operating Software GCOS v1.4 was used to convert the image files to cell intensity data (cel files). All cel files, representing individual samples were normalized using the Robust Multiarray Average (RMA) method from the <italic>affy</italic> package library in the R project for Statistical Computing (R Core Team 2013). Nine outlier chips were identified among the unstimulated samples using quality control plots from Partek Genomics Suite software (Partek, inc. St. Louis, Mo., v6.5 6.11.310) and principal components analyses (PCA) computed using R. An empirical Bayes moderated paired T-test was computed using the <italic>limma</italic> package library in R to obtain false discovery rate (FDR) adjusted p-values and fold changes. Probes were considered statistically significant if their FDR-adjusted P values were &lt;0.05 and their absolute fold change was &gt;1.25. Heatmaps were generated with the <italic>gplots</italic> package library in R. Log fold change ratios, p-values and false discovery rates from the empirical Bayes T-tests were imported into Ingenuity Pathways Analysis to examine enrichment of pathways and functional groups.</p>
