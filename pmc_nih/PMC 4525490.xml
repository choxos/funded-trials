              <abstract>
                <p>The human circulatory system consists of arterial blood that delivers nutrients to tissues, and venous blood that removes the metabolic by-products. Although it is well established that arterial blood generally has higher concentrations of glucose and oxygen relative to venous blood, a comprehensive biochemical characterization of arteriovenous differences has not yet been reported. Here we apply cutting-edge, mass spectrometry-based metabolomic technologies to provide a global characterization of metabolites that vary in concentration between the arterial and venous blood of human patients. Global profiling of paired arterial and venous plasma from 20 healthy individuals, followed up by targeted analysis made it possible to measure subtle (&lt;2 fold), yet highly statistically significant and physiologically important differences in water soluble human plasma metabolome. While we detected changes in lactic acid, alanine, glutamine, and glutamate as expected from skeletal muscle activity, a number of unanticipated metabolites were also determined to be significantly altered including Krebs cycle intermediates, amino acids that have not been previously implicated in transport, and a few oxidized fatty acids. This study provides the most comprehensive assessment of metabolic changes in the blood during circulation to date and suggests that such profiling approach may offer new insights into organ homeostasis and organ specific pathology.</p>

            <p>Arterial and venous blood circulation represents the principle integrating system of the human anatomy, serving to maintain homeostasis in all tissue interstitial fluids. The preservation of homeostasis depends primarily upon the biochemical correspondence between the cells and arterial and venous blood, where the essential vectors and mediators are metabolites. This “metabostasis” is crucial for optimal cell function and intercellular communication and cooperation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Blood is a primary carrier of metabolites including a variety of nutrients (carbohydrates, lipids and amino acids), hormones, electrolytes, metabolic by-products and organic wastes. The acknowledged concept of arterial blood supplying the tissues with nutrients (and oxygen) and venous blood carrying the metabolic by-products (and carbon dioxide) from tissues and organs is one of the best examples of metabolite transport <italic>in vivo</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. The uptake of nutrients by metabolizing tissues and release of by-products is clearly reflected in oxygen consumption as basal arteriovenous difference for oxygen content (~40 mL/L). Beyond measurements of oxygen consumption coupled to the measurement of glucose uptake and early amino acid balance studies across major organs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>, surprisingly little research has been performed on metabolic blood homeostasis at different levels of the circulatory system. Since these early, fundamental metabolism studies, performed between 1930’s and 1970’s, when the available analytical methods allowed for the analysis of only a limited number of metabolites, the arterio-venous approach of simultaneous sampling of arterial and venous blood has been markedly discontinued. Few follow up studies in the 1990’s required several different analytical techniques, including spectrophotometry, spectrofluorimetry, ion-exchange chromatography and enzymatic assays to target the metabolites of interest<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Technology, specifically mass spectrometry, has since improved by orders of magnitude in terms of sensitivity, accuracy, dynamic range and ability to observe intact biomolecules, thereby offering many new insights into metabolic processes and organismal biology<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>.</p>
            <p>Technology-driven metabolomic research in clinical diagnostics is evolving rapidly and blood is one of the most widely used biofluids for metabolic phenotyping<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. Targeted mass spectrometry blood assays are already applied in clinical research diagnostics, in screening for congenital, inborn errors of metabolism or acquired metabolic disorders<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. While targeted metabolomics is a hypothesis driven approach that screens for a defined set of known, potential biomarkers of disease, untargeted metabolomics is a discovery-oriented approach, designed to comprehensively measure metabolite pools within an organism and generate hypothesis about unanticipated changes in metabolism<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. The majority of untargeted, blood metabolomic studies today focuses on disease biomarker discovery by profiling exclusively venous blood<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Due to high inter-individual variability of human metabolic profiles (which fluctuate markedly depending on age, gender, diet, drug therapy and other aspects of lifestyle) it is difficult to determine whether the subtle variations in concentrations of metabolites, measured only in venous blood, are related to a specific disease and/or side effects from a particular drug. While more easily accessible, venous blood reflects the metabolism of the particular organ drained<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>, and can thus yield a biased profile of the body’s metabolic status. In contrast, arterial blood represents the fluid prior to being processed by any particular organ, reflecting better the average metabolic state of the body<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>.</p>
            <p>To extend the value of blood metabolite profiling beyond biomarker discovery, we performed global profiling of paired arterial <italic>vs.</italic> venous human blood at the skeletal muscle level of a circulatory system to asses metabolic changes in the blood during circulation in a more comprehensive manner. A recently developed, hydrophilic interaction chromatography-mass spectrometry (HILIC/MS) based untargeted metabolomic approach<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref> has enabled us to screen several thousand metabolite features present in the plasma metabolome. The metabolite levels that were initially revealed as changing in arterial <italic>vs.</italic> venous plasma were further measured, together with their counterparts from related biochemical pathways, using a targeted approach. The respective, subtle, yet highly significant changes in specific metabolite levels in arterial <italic>vs.</italic> venous plasma are discussed in the light of the biochemical nutrient cycling and energy gradients. We introduce the concept of global arteriovenous metabostasis analysis to study intra-tissue metabolic activity and gain insights into normal organ homeostasis and potentially organ specific pathology, by simultaneously assaying the broad range of chemically diverse metabolites.</p>

                <title>Global Metabolite Profiling Reveals Changes in Arterial <italic>vs.</italic> Venous Human Blood during Circulation</title>
                <p>Untargeted metabolite profiling was performed initially to examine the differences between arterial and venous plasma across human forearm tissue, collected from healthy adult individuals (female:male 1:1) at rest, after an overnight fast. The population cohort description, including the gender, age, height, weight and body mass index, is given in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Table S2</xref>. The approach using hydrophilic interaction chromatography coupled with negative ionization mode mass spectrometry based on 80% methanol extraction was applied to maximize the coverage of central carbon metabolites in human plasma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). The analytical strategy using HILIC in negative ionization mode enabled the detection of 8811 metabolite features in the water soluble and lipid plasma metabolome. Overall, untargeted profiling of arterial and venous plasma revealed high inter-individual variability with specific metabolic phenotypes characterizing each individual. These personalized metabotypes may interfere with profile alignment and comparisons, therefore paired analysis of the arterial and venous blood were essential when conducting global (untargeted) profiling of human blood. Many nutrients and metabolic by-products transported in plasma were analyzed across all subjects, including amino and non-amino organic acids, purines and pyrimidines, endogenous sugars, fatty acids, and dietary metabolites and their breakdown products (e.g. tagatose, paraxanthine). The global profiling followed by comparison of paired metabolite levels (measured simultaneously in the same individual) highlighted the significant changes (p &lt; 0.01) in venous <italic>vs.</italic> arterial plasma during circulation across the human peripheral tissue, precisely the skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>). Characteristic metabolites with significantly different levels in venous <italic>vs.</italic> arterial plasma were filtered out using the interactive XCMS Online platform and identified using MS/MS pattern matching against METLIN - the largest standard metabolite database (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. Among significantly changing metabolites, several metabolites involved in gluconeogenesis body cycle displayed highly consistent ratios between arterial and venous levels. Glutamate showed a significant decrease in venous <italic>vs.</italic> arterial plasma (p = 3.8E-06, median fold change = 2.9, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>) across all 20 subjects.

Targeted analyses were multiple-pathway focused in order to measure many additional intermediates, associated with the metabolites highlighted by untargeted analysis. Numerous amino acids (21) and other non-amino organic acids, playing an important role in carbon and nitrogen shuttle through glycolysis and gluconeogenesis were targeted together with glutamate and lactate. To interrogate differences highlighted by untargeted analysis further, targeted quantification was also expanded to include tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates, the intermediates of purine and of phenylalanine metabolism.</p>

                <title>Multiple Pathway Targeted Analysis to Elucidate the Metabolite Transport at the Skeletal Muscle Level of the Circulatory System</title>
                <p>Changes in arterial <italic>vs.</italic> venous levels were determined for 36 endogenous metabolites using targeted multiple reaction monitoring. The summary of quantified metabolites with the associated arteriovenous fold changes (arterial/venous (A/V) or venous/arterial (V/A) ratios) and levels of significance is given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>. Direction of the fold change implies either the positive arteriovenous balance reflecting the metabolite uptake by the organ or the negative arteriovenous balance reflecting the metabolite release by the organ. Metabolite levels (i.e. dynamic range) in both, arterial and venous plasma, varied significantly from one individual to another, up to 10 times, depending on the metabolite of interest. Lactate, was measured together with glucose, as the most abundant among the quantified metabolites (1453 ± 109.4 μM in arterial and 1728 ± 180.1 μM in venous plasma, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S2</xref>), followed by amino acids (glutamine, glutamate) also detected in high concentrations (≥100 μM) in arterial and venous plasma (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S2</xref>). Levels of ten different amino and non-amino organic acids were observed to change significantly between arterial and venous plasma, following the passage through the human peripheral tissue (skeletal muscle). Although subtle, the arteriovenous fold changes (from V/A = 1.09 fold for sialic acid to A/V = 3.02 fold for glutamate, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S1</xref>) were consistent across the majority of analyzed subjects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>). Glutamate showed the highest uptake pattern (or the highest positive arteriovenous balance (3.02 ± 0.32 fold lower in venous plasma, p &lt; 0.0001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figs 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">4</xref>) while lactate (1.31 ± 0.06 fold higher in venous plasma, p &lt; 0.0001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figs 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">4</xref>) and succinate (1.56 ± 0.09 fold higher in venous plasma, p &lt; 0.0001, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S1</xref>) displayed the most significant release pattern across human forearm tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>).

              <p>This study was designed to gain a comprehensive and quantitative overview of metabolite transport, reflected in nutrient uptake from arterial blood and metabolic product release into venous blood<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>, at the specific level of the circulatory system. In contrast to traditional venous plasma screening, metabolite profiling in paired arterial and venous plasma of the same individual was essential to cope with high variability of human biofluid profiles. Moreover, the paired arteriovenous profiling provided an insight into the metabolic activity of a particular tissue. Here we profiled arterial and venous plasma across human forearm tissue where skeletal muscle appears the predominant contributor to the observed metabolic balance or metabostasis. The untargeted metabolomic approach, using hydrophilic chromatography in negative ionization mode allowed for detection of broad set of central carbon and lipid metabolites in human plasma. The results implied the dominant role of central carbon metabolites in the metabolite transport across human skeletal muscle and highlighted the importance of profiling highly polar metabolites, which cannot be retained by reversed phase analyses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. Overall, the metabolites that varied between arterial and venous blood showed highly significant differences (p ≤ 0.01) yet subtle fold changes (A/V or V/A) ranging from 1.1 to 3. These observations are in accordance with the results from early amino acid metabolism studies that revealed small, although physiologically important arteriovenous differences at different points in the body<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. It is important to note that while the untargeted metabolite profiling pointed out the arteriovenous differences and related biochemical pathways, the follow up (“<italic>post-hoc</italic>”) targeted analyses were essential to validate the observed changes and quantify the additional intermediates. Targeted metabolite profiling eliminated the bias due to complex matrix effects (e.g. ion suppression) present in untargeted analysis, effectively eliminating false positives<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>.</p>
              <p>The differences in arterial <italic>vs.</italic> venous plasma, primarily observed in amino acid and other organic acid levels, appear to mainly reflect the metabolic requirements of muscle tissue in a postabsorptive state, the period following an overnight fast when the blood is usually sampled in the process of clinical examination. The postabsorptive metabolic state in muscle is primarily associated with an increase in glycolysis, resulting in an excess of pyruvate<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. Our observations indicate that the excess of pyruvate independently governs the production of lactate, and the production of alanine <italic>via</italic> transamination of glutamate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>). The significantly higher lactate level in venous plasma (referred to as negative arteriovenous balance) is likely associated with its release to venous plasma as the end-product of pyruvate conversion. This observation is congruent with earlier findings on peripheral lactate levels<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref> and is representative of incomplete glycolysis even at rest, in aerobic conditions at early fasting metabolic state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>). It also demonstrates the role of lactate as a mobile nutrient (gluconeogenic metabolite) that is further taken up by the liver to regenerate glucose and complete the Cori cycle<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. The observations of a significantly lower levels of glutamate (positive AV balance), and increased levels of alanine (negative AV balance) and glutamine (negative AV balance) in venous plasma imply the uptake of glutamate (by muscle) and the production and release of alanine and glutamine by transamination. While early metabolic studies demonstrated the synthesis of glutamine and alanine, as two main gluconeogenic amino acids formed by transamination of α-ketoacids (pyruvate and oxaloacetate, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>) in muscle<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>, the uptake pattern of glutamate by human muscle has been reported only by Marliss <italic>et al.</italic> using enzymatic assays<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. Our results reflect a significant uptake pattern of glutamate suggesting that glutamate is the major amino acid precursor, primarily as a nitrogen donor, in the synthesis of alanine and glutamine. Furthermore, a significant positive arteriovenous difference was observed for aspartate, suggesting that aspartate could play an important role in glutamate supply in the muscle cells. The uptake of aspartate by muscle is a new finding that is likely coupled to excess of α-ketoglutarate, produced by transamination of glutamate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>). The excess of α-ketoglutarate could lead the amino transfer from aspartate to glutamate and concurrently replenish the TCA-cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>). Early tracing experiments using rat muscle <italic>in vitro</italic> indicate that glutamate, aspartate and specific branched amino acids (isoleucine and valine) should enter the TCA cycle and serve as carbon skeleton and nitrogen supply for glutamine synthesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>, however only the uptake pattern of glutamate has been previously reported<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>, The uptake pattern of serine, reflected as lower concentration in venous blood, is a new finding as well, which may imply its usage for pyruvate anaplerosis, as a non-carbohydrate precursor, by serine dehydratase mediated direct conversion to pyruvate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>). This finding supports the original formulation of the glucose-alanine cycle after which pyruvate is derived from glucose as well as other metabolized amino acids<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. Tracer experiments in humans <italic>in vivo</italic> have implied that the carbon atoms of alanine are mostly derived from plasma glucose and muscle glycogen<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref> and that glutamine should be a major gluconeogenic precursor for a positive transfer of new carbon to the glucose pool<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>, originating primarily from protein-derived amino acids. Therefore, the hypothesis of serine deamination for pyruvate anaplerosis needs to be further investigated.</p>
              <p>Although substantial release of free amino acids from muscle tissue (reflecting the muscle protein undergoing degradation) after an overnight fast has been reported in early studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>, and we did observe the negative arteriovenous differences for most of the quantified amino acids, only the release of alanine, glutamine and phenylalanine were observed at statistically significant levels. This implies that specific biochemical pathways that support primarily gluconeogenic metabolite synthesis (lactate, alanine, glutamine and phenylalanine) are dominant in human postabsorptive metabolic state. Overall, our results suggest that glutamate and aspartate are metabolized by muscle as primary nitrogen and/or carbon donors in the synthesis of other gluconeogenic metabolites, as demonstrated by their highly significant positive arteriovenous balance. The increased levels of TCA-cycle intermediates (e.g. succinate, malate, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figs 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">5</xref>) in venous plasma suggest that the metabolized amino acids are converted into TCA cycle intermediates that can be released to venous blood and/or used as carbon source mainly for the synthesis of glutamine<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Alanine seems to be directly produced by transamination of pyruvate, using the “uptaken” glutamate as nitrogen donor<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. These observations affirm that muscle is a key gluconeogenic site in the body and provide some new, potentially physiologically important insights into its metabolic activity regarding the unanticipated role of aspartate and serine, related to the inter-organ carbon and nitrogen transfer <italic>via</italic> the Cori and analogous Glucose-Alanine cycle, to meet the energy needs of different cell types.</p>
              <p>Beyond the above mentioned arteriovenous differences related to muscle metabolism, distinct metabolites, including oxidized fatty acids (HPODE family) and sialic acid may reflect the oxidation state difference between the arterial and venous plasma<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. Surprisingly, HPODEs level in venous plasma was significantly higher compared to arterial plasma. It is noteworthy that HPODEs, the products of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated peroxidation of linoleates and the primary products of the autoxidation process, are considered as potential biomarkers for oxidative stress status <italic>in vivo</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. Our results may imply that the venous system is under an increased oxidative stress state when compared to the arterial system. The observed difference may also be the reflection of the peroxided lipid production in the muscle or capillary system. Lipid peroxidation is implicated in the pathogenesis of several diseases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>, however its relation to venous disease has not yet been demonstrated. The arteriovenous oxidation state, with the focus on venous system, is a separate subject that demands further investigation.</p>
              <p>The value of untargeted, paired arterial and venous plasma profiling is in the ability to examine very subtle changes related to tissue specific metabolism. As demonstrated here on human peripheral tissue, the finely tuned arteriovenous metabolite changes provided information on the active metabolic pathways in muscle, associated with an overnight fast. This information, which reflects the metabolic activity of an organ related to characteristic physiological state, would not be possible to obtain from the analysis of venous plasma alone. The observed differences highlight the roles of glutamate, lactate, glutamine and alanine, and the unanticipated roles of aspartate, serine and succinate as carbon and nitrogen shuttles in the body mainly <italic>via</italic> Cori and Glucose-Alanine cycle. Therefore, arteriovenous plasma profiling can elucidate new, functionally related metabolites based on patterns of metabolite transport at a specific level of circulatory system. The metabolite transport analysis further provide relevant information regarding the effects of various factors that influence nutrient uptake and/or assimilation and thus aid in defining normal organ homeostasis <italic>vs.</italic> specific organ pathology. The arteriovenous blood metabolite levels were also examined in relation to the clinical characteristics of the patients (e.g. gender, age, body mass index, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Table S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S3</xref>). However, to draw a meaningful conclusion related to the impact of specific clinical factors on a human blood profile the population cohort size should be larger.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, the application of this approach would be especially useful when attempting to examine a cohort of individuals for changes in blood metabolite levels in relation to an organ specific disease (such as liver cirrhosis, or heart disease). Human populations have inherent inter-individual variation, and most studies require numbers in the hundreds if not thousands to identify a statistically significant disease biomarker in venous blood. Removing this variation through calculation of the paired arterial to venous blood ratios can reveal subtle biochemical changes impossible to pick up through large-scale screening of venous blood samples. We have already shown in the relatively small sample set here that these metabolite A/V ratios are stable between individuals; any large deviations from these ratios can thus alert us to possible metabolic pathway disruption. Therefore we propose that this approach will provide a new metabolic profiling model for blood analysis.</p>

                <p>The observed significant arteriovenous metabolite changes that fit into the context are pointed out in red (glucose, glutamate, aspartate, serine) and blue (lactate, alanine, glutamine and succinate). The uptake pattern of glucose, glutamate, aspartate and serine (in addition to being formed by breakdown of muscle proteins) demonstrates their use by muscle cells as supply for TCA cycle as well as nitrogen and/or carbon donors in the synthesis of alanine, glutamine and other amino acids. Lactate, alanine, glutamine and succinate produced by muscle cells are released into the venous blood. α-KG—α-ketoglutarate, OAA—oxaloacetate, αAA—α-aminoacids, αKA—α-ketoacids.
