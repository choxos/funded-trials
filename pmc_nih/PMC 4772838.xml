                <p>Women receiving efavirenz-based antiretroviral therapy plus a contraceptive implant had significantly lower levonorgestrel pharmacokinetics than women not receiving antiretroviral therapy. An unexpected high pregnancy rate (3/20, 15%) occurred in the efavirenz group, highlighting the clinical significance of this interaction.</p>
              </abstract>
              <abstract>
                <p><bold><italic>Background.</italic></bold> Levonorgestrel subdermal implants are preferred contraceptives with an expected failure rate of &lt;1% over 5 years. We assessed the effect of efavirenz- or nevirapine-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) coadministration on levonorgestrel pharmacokinetics.</p>
                <p><bold><italic>Methods.</italic></bold> This nonrandomized, parallel group, pharmacokinetic evaluation was conducted in three groups of human immunodeficiency virus–infected Ugandan women: ART-naive (n = 17), efavirenz-based ART (n = 20), and nevirapine-based ART (n = 20). Levonorgestrel implants were inserted at baseline in all women. Blood was collected at 1, 4, 12, 24, 36, and 48 weeks. The primary endpoint was week 24 levonorgestrel concentrations, compared between the ART-naive group and each ART group by geometric mean ratio (GMR) with 90% confidence interval (CI). Secondary endpoints included week 48 levonorgestrel concentrations and unintended pregnancies.</p>
                <p><bold><italic>Results.</italic></bold> Week 24 geometric mean levonorgestrel concentrations were 528, 280, and 710 pg/mL in the ART-naive, efavirenz, and nevirapine groups, respectively (efavirenz: ART-naive GMR, 0.53; 90% CI, .50, .55 and nevirapine: ART-naive GMR, 1.35; 90% CI, 1.29, 1.43). Week 48 levonorgestrel concentrations were 580, 247, and 664 pg/mL in the ART-naive, efavirenz, and nevirapine groups, respectively (efavirenz: ART-naive GMR, 0.43; 90% CI, .42, .44 and nevirapine: ART-naive GMR, 1.14; 90% CI, 1.14, 1.16). Three pregnancies (3/20, 15%) occurred in the efavirenz group between weeks 36 and 48. No pregnancies occurred in the ART-naive or nevirapine groups.</p>
                <p><bold><italic>Conclusions.</italic></bold> Within 1 year of combined use, levonorgestrel exposure was markedly reduced in participants who received efavirenz-based ART, accompanied by contraceptive failures. In contrast, nevirapine-based ART did not adversely affect levonorgestrel exposure or efficacy.</p>

          <body>
            <p>The integration of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) care and family planning services is critical for more than 17.4 million HIV-infected women, of whom nearly 95% live in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) [<xref rid="CIV1001C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="CIV1001C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. These women face an increased risk for complications following an unplanned pregnancy, including the risk of vertical transmission of HIV [<xref rid="CIV1001C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="CIV1001C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Accordingly, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the use of long-acting, reversible contraceptive methods for family planning, including progestin-releasing subdermal implants [<xref rid="CIV1001C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], and the use of efavirenz-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) as preferred first-line treatment for HIV-1 [<xref rid="CIV1001C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="CIV1001C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Nevirapine-based ART remains an alternative; however, its use is declining due to inferior virologic efficacy and a higher rate of toxicity compared with efavirenz [<xref rid="CIV1001C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="CIV1001C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Despite the benefits of both implantable contraceptives and ART, drug–drug interactions between these recommended therapies represent a critical barrier to effective family planning methods for HIV-infected women.</p>
            <p>The levonorgestrel-releasing subdermal implant is widely used in sub-Saharan Africa [<xref rid="CIV1001C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. After insertion, the implant may remain in place for up to 5 years, with a low failure rate of 0.1 pregnancy per 100 woman-years during the first year [<xref rid="CIV1001C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Levonorgestrel is released from the implant initially at 100 μg/day, decreasing to 40 μg/day within 1 year and to 30 μg/day within 3 years, providing stable daily drug concentrations [<xref rid="CIV1001C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Levonorgestrel is metabolized via hepatic enzymes, and coadministration of medications that induce or inhibit the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system influences levonorgestrel exposure [<xref rid="CIV1001C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The risk for drug–drug interaction compromising contraception efficacy is greatest with antiretrovirals that induce CYP3A4, including efavirenz and nevirapine. Few data characterize the impact of the drug–drug interaction between ART and levonorgestrel. However, when oral levonorgestrel for emergency contraception was combined with efavirenz, levonorgestrel exposure decreased 56%, as measured by the area under the concentration time curve (AUC) in 12 healthy volunteers [<xref rid="CIV1001C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In contrast, 3 HIV-infected women who received nevirapine-based ART and oral contraceptive pills had higher levonorgestrel exposure compared with 3 HIV-infected participants who did not receive ART (AUC<sub>0–24 hours</sub> 147 vs 114 ng h/mL) [<xref rid="CIV1001C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Further, a retrospective analysis among 570 HIV-infected women who used the levonorgestrel-releasing implant identified concomitant use of efavirenz as the only factor correlated with unintended pregnancy (15 of 16 observed pregnancies occurred in women receiving efavirenz; 12.4% pregnancy rate); no pregnancies occurred among 208 women who received nevirapine [<xref rid="CIV1001C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. There is no known interaction between nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and levonorgestrel [<xref rid="CIV1001C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. No evidence exists regarding the pharmacokinetic effect of ART on levonorgestrel-releasing implants.</p>
            <p>Noting the absence of high-quality studies, recent WHO guidance states that women on efavirenz- or nevirapine-based ART can “generally use” subdermal implants, because the benefits of contraception generally outweigh the risks [<xref rid="CIV1001C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="CIV1001C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Our primary objective in this study was to assess the effect of efavirenz- or nevirapine-based ART on the pharmacokinetic exposure of levonorgestrel released from a subdermal implant in HIV-infected women over 24 weeks. We hypothesized that levonorgestrel concentrations would be reduced but would remain effective. Secondary objectives were to assess levonorgestrel, efavirenz, and nevirapine concentrations; HIV-related outcomes; pregnancies; and levonorgestrel-related adverse events, each over 48 weeks.</p>

              <p>This was a nonrandomized, open-label, parallel group, pharmacokinetic study among HIV-infected Ugandan women. All study-related procedures occurred at the Infectious Diseases Institute (IDI), Makerere University College of Health Sciences, Uganda.

                <title>Participants</title>
                <p>All HIV-infected women who sought family planning services at the IDI received information about available family planning methods, including oral contraceptive pills, depo-medroxyprogesterone, intrauterine devices, condoms, and progestin-containing implants. Women aged &gt;18 years who planned to receive the levonorgestrel implant and were judged medically eligible for the implant [<xref rid="CIV1001C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] were screened for study participation following informed consent. Women were included if they were receiving efavirenz-based ART (efavirenz 600 mg daily plus 2 NRTIs; efavirenz group), nevirapine-based ART (nevirapine 200 mg twice daily plus 2 NRTIs; nevirapine group), or were not receiving ART (ART-naive group). The ART-naive group included women with a CD4+ cell count &gt;500 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> at screening who were not eligible for ART per Ugandan HIV guidelines at the time of enrollment [<xref rid="CIV1001C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Women in the efavirenz or nevirapine groups received efavirenz- or nevirapine-based ART for &gt;30 days and had an HIV-RNA &lt;400 copies/mL at screening. Participants were excluded if they were pregnant, were &lt;30 days post-partum, or had abnormal laboratory parameters. Herbal products and medications expected to have significant interactions with study drugs were prohibited 30 days prior to entry and throughout the study [<xref rid="CIV1001C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="CIV1001C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].

                <p>Participants who met enrollment criteria returned for an entry visit (day 0) within 30 days of screening. Participants self-reported parity and marital status. Blood was collected for measurement of plasma levonorgestrel concentrations prior to implant placement. After a negative urine pregnancy test and other entry procedures were complete, a standard-dose levonorgestrel implant system (2-rod, levonorgestrel 75 mg/rod; Jadelle, Bayer, New Zealand) was placed subdermally on the interior of the upper arm by a trained study team member [<xref rid="CIV1001C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p>
                <p>Additional study visits occurred 1, 4, 12, 24, 36, and 48 weeks after implant placement. Blood was collected for measurement of plasma levonorgestrel, efavirenz, and nevirapine concentrations at each visit. Timing of the blood sampling for the ART groups was based on time since last ART dose: mid-efavirenz dosing interval (12–14 hours post-dose) or end of the nevirapine dosing interval (11–13 hours post-dose). If the participant missed an ART dose within the 3 prior days, the visit was rescheduled. A physical exam, documentation of new or changed medications, and a urine pregnancy test were performed at each visit. A questionnaire to detect adverse events was administered, and all adverse events were categorized by severity [<xref rid="CIV1001C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. CD4+ cell counts were abstracted from the medical record for all participants. HIV-RNA was repeated at week 48 for participants in the ART arms. Family planning counseling was provided at each visit, emphasizing the uncertainty of implant contraceptive effectiveness in combination with ART and the provision of condoms.</p>

Each participant's concentration–time curve was analyzed using noncompartmental methods (Phoenix WinNonlin, Certara). The levonorgestrel AUC from weeks 0–24 (AUC<sub>0–24 weeks</sub>) was determined using the trapezoidal rule. All safety and adverse event data were descriptively summarized.

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>We determined that women who use a levonorgestrel-releasing contraceptive implant in combination with efavirenz-based ART had 47% lower levonorgestrel concentrations after 24 weeks, decreasing to 57% at week 48, compared with ART-naive women. Critically, these pharmacokinetic changes were associated with 3 unintended pregnancies in the efavirenz group (15% pregnancy rate) during the 48-week study, which is in contrast to the implant's expected &lt;1% failure rate over 5 years of use [<xref rid="CIV1001C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. These results provide pharmacokinetic evidence and further support for the high unintended pregnancy rate (12.4%) that was observed retrospectively among 121 women in Swaziland who received efavirenz-based ART with a levonorgestrel-releasing implant [<xref rid="CIV1001C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In addition, our data are consistent with a pharmacokinetic study of ART with the only other progestin-releasing subdermal implant, etonogestrel, in that etonogestrel plasma concentrations were 63% lower among HIV-infected women who received efavirenz-based ART [<xref rid="CIV1001C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In a recent retrospective cohort from Kenya, a 3-fold higher pregnancy risk was observed in implant users (either levonorgestrel- or etonogestrel-containing) who received efavirenz-based ART compared with nevirapine-based ART (adjusted rate ratio, 3.0 [1.3–4.6]) [<xref rid="CIV1001C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Notably, the pregnancy rate in patients who received implants plus efavirenz-based ART in the Kenya cohort (unadjusted pregnancies, 3.3 per 100 person-years) was lower compared with both our results and those reported from Swaziland [<xref rid="CIV1001C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="CIV1001C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Similarly, 6 published case reports describe etonogestrel implant failures in women who received efavirenz-based ART [<xref rid="CIV1001C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>–<xref rid="CIV1001C27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p>
              <p>In contrast, women in our nevirapine group had 35% higher levonorgestrel concentrations after 24 weeks, and 14% higher after 48 weeks, compared with the ART-naive group. We observed no pregnancy or excess adverse events, supporting the effectiveness of levonorgestrel implants in combination with nevirapine-based ART. Although both are CYP3A enzyme inducers, differences in the drug–drug interaction potential of efavirenz and nevirapine have been observed [<xref rid="CIV1001C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="CIV1001C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. One possible explanation of higher levonorgestrel concentrations may be the study participants' body weight. Prior studies demonstrate an inverse association between levonorgestrel concentrations and body weight; women weighing &lt;50 kg maintained levonorgestrel concentrations 43%–50% higher than women weighing &gt;70 kg [<xref rid="CIV1001C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="CIV1001C28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="CIV1001C29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Although the difference in body weight between the nevirapine and ART-naive groups was not statistically different, the nevirapine group had more women with lower body weights (see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="CIV1001TB1">1</xref>).</p>
              <p>We are the first to describe progestin concentrations prior to conception among women who became pregnant while using an implant due to a drug–drug interaction. One other study characterized levonorgestrel concentrations prior to pregnancy during an extended-use study of the implant over 7 years, 2 years beyond its intended duration of use [<xref rid="CIV1001C29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Sivin and colleagues determined that no pregnancies occurred when levonorgestrel concentrations were maintained above 180 pg/mL [<xref rid="CIV1001C29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In contrast, 2 pregnancies occurred in our participants at concentrations above this previously observed efficacy threshold, that is, 303 and 299 pg/mL, measured approximately 2 and 10 weeks prior to conception (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/cid/civ1001/-/DC1">Supplementary Table 1</ext-link>). The reason for this difference is unclear, but a potential explanation is differences in laboratory methods for quantitation of levonorgestrel: HPLC-MS vs radioimmunoassay [<xref rid="CIV1001C29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p>
              <p>Integrated guidelines for family planning and HIV suggest that contraceptive implants can be used for HIV-infected women receiving efavirenz-based ART [<xref rid="CIV1001C30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. However, our data suggest that efavirenz-based ART reduces the contraceptive efficacy of the levonorgestrel implant. Although both levonorgestrel implants and efavirenz have been available in LMICs over the past decade, the impact of this detrimental drug–drug interaction may not have been identified because, until recently, efavirenz was not widely prescribed among women of childbearing potential due to concerns for teratogenicity. Furthermore, because many HIV treatment centers do not have integrated family planning services, women may obtain levonorgestrel implants from other providers, and an unintended pregnancy could go unrecognized by HIV caregivers. This highlights the importance of integrated, comprehensive care of HIV-infected persons, as well as multidisciplinary collaboration to disseminate findings [<xref rid="CIV1001C31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p>
              <p>Our study has limitations related to its design. It was an open label, nonrandomized, clinical pharmacokinetic investigation of women already planning to receive the levonorgestrel implant. Therefore, baseline differences exist between study groups. We did not assess participants’ sexual activity, and the study was not designed to evaluate the contraceptive effectiveness of the levonorgestrel implant in combination with ART. Therefore, measures of contraceptive effectiveness such as detection of ovulation or changes in the cervical–vaginal lining were not included. Despite this, our results support an exposure–response relationship, and pharmacokinetic data are an FDA-accepted method to establish the impact of a drug–drug interaction [<xref rid="CIV1001C32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Finally, we cannot compare our results with the contraception failure rate of other methods in combination with ART.</p>
              <p>We describe suboptimal pharmacokinetic exposure when the levonorgestrel implant is combined with efavirenz-based ART, but not with nevirapine-based ART. The increased risk of unintended pregnancy in women who received the levonorgestrel implant and efavirenz-based ART is of critical public health importance, given the ongoing scale-up of both contraceptive implants [<xref rid="CIV1001C33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and efavirenz-based ART throughout LMICs and the resultant decreased use of nevirapine-based ART in many countries [<xref rid="CIV1001C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="CIV1001C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Policymakers will need to assess the risk–benefit of the levonorgestrel implant combined with efavirenz-based ART in the context of alternative contraceptive failure rates and available ART options in LMICs. Given the increased risk of unintended pregnancy among HIV-infected women using the levonorgestrel implant with efavirenz-based ART, alternative strategies for long-acting contraceptive agents are urgently needed.</p>
