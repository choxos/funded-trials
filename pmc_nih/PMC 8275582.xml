                <p id="Par1">Aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) deficiency is a rare genetic disorder characterized by deficient synthesis of dopamine and serotonin. It presents in early infancy, and causes severe developmental disability and lifelong motor, behavioral, and autonomic symptoms including oculogyric crises (OGC), sleep disorder, and mood disturbance. We investigated the safety and efficacy of delivery of a viral vector expressing AADC (AAV2-hAADC) to the midbrain in children with AADC deficiency (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT02852213). Seven (7) children, aged 4–9 years underwent convection-enhanced delivery (CED) of AAV2-hAADC to the bilateral substantia nigra (SN) and ventral tegmental area (VTA) (total infusion volume: 80 µL per hemisphere) in 2 dose cohorts: 1.3 × 10<sup>11</sup> vg (n = 3), and 4.2 × 10<sup>11</sup> vg (n = 4). Primary aims were to demonstrate the safety of the procedure and document biomarker evidence of restoration of brain AADC activity. Secondary aims were to assess clinical improvement in symptoms and motor function. Direct bilateral infusion of AAV2-hAADC was safe, well-tolerated and achieved target coverage of 98% and 70% of the SN and VTA, respectively. Dopamine metabolism was increased in all subjects and FDOPA uptake was enhanced within the midbrain and the striatum. OGC resolved completely in 6 of 7 subjects by Month 3 post-surgery. Twelve (12) months after surgery, 6/7 subjects gained normal head control and 4/7 could sit independently. At 18 months, 2 subjects could walk with 2-hand support. Both the primary and secondary endpoints of the study were met. Midbrain gene delivery in children with AADC deficiency is feasible and safe, and leads to clinical improvements in symptoms and motor function.</p>

              <p id="Par3">Aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive neurodevelopmental disorder that typically presents in infancy, and is characterized biochemically by deficiency of the catecholamines (dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine) and serotonin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Approximately 135 patients with this condition have been reported in the literature worldwide, though the true incidence is unknown<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. The AADC enzyme catalyzes the synthesis of dopamine and serotonin from their respective precursors. Children with AADC deficiency cannot metabolize levodopa to dopamine, and for this reason, patients typically do not respond to treatment with exogenous levodopa. In addition, they derive little or no benefit from other medical therapies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. The majority of patients experience severe long-term physical and intellectual disability, and are at risk of premature death from complications related to the disease.</p>
              <p id="Par4">AADC deficiency causes a variety of motor, autonomic, and behavioral symptoms. The motor symptoms include hypokinesia, hypotonia, dystonia, and oculogyric crises (OGC). OGC are one of the cardinal features of the disease, and are characterized by episodes of intermittent or sustained tonic vertical (usually upward), horizontal, or convergent deviation of the eyes, sometimes accompanied by dystonia or other involuntary movements of the face and body. Episodes typically last for hours and occur several times per week<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Catecholamine and serotonin deficiency also cause non-motor symptoms such as emotional lability, sleep disturbance, and excessive sweating. Moderate to severe motor and intellectual disability is present in at least 70% of the patients described to date<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par5">A number of surgical strategies have been used to treat adult patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD), a neurodegenerative disorder in which brain AADC activity is progressively lost due to disease progression or cell death. These include placement of deep brain stimulation electrodes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, cell transplants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, and gene therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Most clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of gene therapy for PD have utilized an adeno-associated virus type 2 (AAV2), encoding a neurotrophic factor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> or the <italic>DDC</italic> gene (hAADC), delivered by a direct surgical procedure to the putamen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. The rationale for selection of the putamen as the anatomic target in PD for <italic>DDC</italic> gene therapy is that transduction of the post-synaptic cells that express dopamine receptors in the putamen may provide sufficient AADC activity to cause an increase in local metabolism of exogenous levodopa (i.e., dopaminergic medication) and a subsequent increase in striatal levels of dopamine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par6">In contrast to previous studies in PD, we hypothesized that patients with AADC deficiency would benefit from AAV2-hAADC delivery to two specific regions of the midbrain: the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and the ventral tegmental area (VTA). The rationale for the selection of the midbrain target as opposed to the putamen is that dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain and their axonal projections are structurally intact in children with AADC deficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the mood and autonomic symptoms that accompany severe motor impairment may be attributable in part to dopamine deficiency beyond the nigrostriatal system, and thus would not be treated by putaminal transduction.</p>
              <p id="Par7">AAV2-hAADC gene delivery to the putamen for children with AADC deficiency has been investigated in Taiwan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> and Japan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. In all, 14 subjects in Taiwan (ages 1.7–8.4 years, total dose 1.5 × 10<sup>11</sup> vg in 160 µL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> or 1.81 × 10<sup>11</sup> vg in 160 µL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>) and 6 subjects in Japan (ages 4–19, total dose 2 × 10<sup>11</sup> vg in 200 µL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>) were treated with bilateral intraputaminal infusion of AAV2-hAADC. The authors reported some clinical improvements, but OGC persisted in all subjects. Only 2 of the 12 patients in the latter two studies who had been followed for at least 2 years gained the ability to sit independently<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par8">By delivering AAV2-hAADC to the SNc and VTA, our goal was to increase AADC enzyme activity in midbrain dopaminergic neurons, thereby rescuing dopamine biosynthesis and dopaminergic neurotransmission in nigrostriatal, mesolimbic, and mesocortical pathways. Midbrain delivery also takes advantage of anterograde axonal transport of AAV2 from these regions to deliver AAV2-hAADC to neuroanatomically appropriate brain regions like the striatum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. To maximize safety and targeting accuracy of the gene vector in this trial we developed and utilized a MR-guided gene delivery platform<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. The primary aims of this trial were to demonstrate the safety of the procedure and detect biomarker evidence of increased brain AADC activity. Secondary aims were to evaluate clinical improvements in OGC and motor function after gene delivery.</p>
              <p id="Par9">The therapeutic approach described in this report has the potential to improve disease-related symptoms and motor function in patients with AADC deficiency. The success of this general strategy provides confirmation of targeted gene therapy as a tool to effectively treat other genetic disorders of the central nervous system (CNS). In particular, the techniques described in this study validate the use of efficient viral vectors, brain imaging, and optimized delivery tools as an overall framework for other clinical applications.</p>

                <title>Target distribution of the vector</title>
                <p id="Par11">Using real-time MR imaging, we were able to confirm accurate placement of the infusion catheter at each target (bilateral SNc and VTA) for all 7 subjects (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A–C</xref>, see Online Methods for details). The pattern of distribution followed a roughly oval shape surrounding the catheter tip. In 1 subject, at one target, there was perivascular spread of the contrast agent along a brainstem vessel. Our previous studies have demonstrated that the distribution of the gadoteridol closely matches distribution of the infused AAV2 vector<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Based on anatomic boundaries identified on the pre-procedural MR scans, infusion of 50 µL into the SN resulted in mean coverage (mean ± SD) of approximately 174 ± 49 mm<sup>3</sup> with one suboptimal infusion due to leakage along the perivascular space which was excluded from analysis (n = 13). Infusion of 30 µL into VTA resulted in coverage of 107 ± 23 mm<sup>3</sup> (n = 14), (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>).

                <title>Evidence of increased brain AADC activity after gene delivery</title>
                <p id="Par12">We performed 6-[<sup>18</sup>F]-fluoro-<sc>L</sc>-DOPA (FDOPA) PET imaging at Baseline, Month 3, and Month 24 to look for evidence of a change in brain AADC activity after gene delivery. Integrity of the nigrostriatal pathway as described by Lee et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> was confirmed by imaging of the dopamine transporter (DaTscan™) in all subjects at Screening (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>). Pre-operative FDOPA PET demonstrated no evidence of FDOPA uptake in the striatum or other brain regions (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1E, F</xref>), consistent with absent AADC activity. Post-operative images at both Month 3 and Month 24 demonstrated increased FDOPA uptake in the midbrain (site of gene delivery, Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1G</xref>, and Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1A</xref>) and also in brain regions that receive dopaminergic projections from the midbrain. A diffuse increase of FDOPA signal was detected in both putamen and caudate nucleus (striatum) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1H</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1B</xref>). Detection of increased FDOPA uptake in the striatum is consistent with our hypothesis that the AAV2-hAADC vector and AADC protein both undergo anterograde axonal transport via the intact nigrostriatal pathway into nigrostriatal terminals with accompanying enzymatic conversion of levodopa into dopamine.</p>
                <p id="Par13">Neurotransmitter metabolites were assayed in CSF on 2 separate occasions before the procedure (at screening and on the day of surgery), and four times after the procedure at months 3, 6, 12, and 24. (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). At baseline, concentrations of the dopamine metabolite, homovanillic acid (HVA), were &lt;17% of the lower limit of normal in all subjects (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref> and Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). HVA concentration increased significantly 3 months after gene delivery compared to the mean of the two baseline measurements (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0078, one-tailed Wilcoxon signed-rank test, <italic>n</italic> = 7).

For example, 5 h per week of moderate episodes (grade 2: eye deviation associated with involuntary facial movements) would be represented by a score of 10, while 10 h per week of severe symptoms (grade 3: whole body dystonia) would result in a score of 30.

The total score, which ranges from 0 to 100 percentage points, is derived as an unweighted average of scores in five dimensions (lying and rolling; sitting; crawling and kneeling; standing; and walking, running, and jumping). The GMFM-88 was selected for this study as a tool to assess motor function because it was developed to assess children with motor impairment due to an insult to the developing brain early in life (cerebral palsy), as occurs in AADC deficiency, and because the GMFM can accurately test and measure changes in children who have severe motor impairment.</p>

              <p id="Par27">MR-guided convection-enhanced delivery (CED) of AAV2-hAADC into the midbrain can be performed safely in children with AADC deficiency. Children with AADC deficiency experience a combination of disabling motor and autonomic symptoms, and severe motor and developmental disability. Minimal spontaneous improvement occurred in our study subjects prior to enrollment. All 7 subjects exhibited measurable clinical improvements in both symptoms and motor function following gene delivery. OGC resolved completely in 6 of 7 subjects. Although there was some variation in the rate and degree of motor function improvement, 4 of the 5 subjects who had been followed for at least 18 months after gene delivery gained the ability to sit independently, and 2 of the 5 gained the ability to walk with 2-hand support within that time period. Substantiating these clinical observations, there was associated biomarker evidence of increased brain AADC activity by measurement of HVA in CSF and FDOPA PET imaging.</p>
              <p id="Par28">Direct infusion of AAV2-hAADC into the SNc and VTA is technically feasible and was performed without surgical complications in this series of patients. Successful delivery of the <italic>DDC</italic> gene therapy vector required identification of the anatomic targets, accurate placement of an intracranial catheter, and subsequent confirmation of vector delivery. This approach was accomplished through the use of real-time MR imaging in conjunction with co-infusion of a MR contrast agent. Pre-operative identification of the SNc and VTA using high-resolution MR imaging allowed for planning of catheter trajectories designed to prevent passage through eloquent regions. An MR-guided navigation system allowed direct intra-operative confirmation of catheter placement into the selected targets. Finally, vector infusion was monitored with continuous MR imaging that confirmed accurate and reproducible distribution of the infusate.</p>
              <p id="Par29">Infusion of AAV2-hAADC resulted in measurable changes in clinical function and dopamine production suggesting that restoration of AADC activity in physiological regions (midbrain) can reverse the pathologic phenotype observed in primary AADC deficiency. We observed dramatic improvements in symptoms, including OGC, irritable mood, and sleep dysfunction. These changes became apparent soon after gene delivery, typically within the first 3 months. Caregivers reported that these changes, particularly the resolution of OGC and improvements in sleep, had a major positive impact on the child’s and family’s quality of life.</p>
              <p id="Par30">Improvements in motor function unfolded over a longer time course, and the rate of improvement varied considerably between subjects. Greater improvement was not obviously associated with either higher vector dose (Cohort 2) or with younger age in this small group of subjects. All 7 subjects had severe motor impairment at baseline, with severe hypotonia, minimal voluntary movements, and lack of head control in most cases. After gene delivery, the time to attain head control in 6 subjects ranged from 2 to 14 months, while the time to attain independent sitting ranged from 7 to 21 months. GMFM-88 total scores improved by more than 7 points in all subjects, and in 2 subjects (baseline ages 6 and 8 years) who gained the ability to walk with 2-hand support, eat and drink by mouth, and communicate either verbally or with the aid of an augmentative communication device, the observed change in score was &gt;20 points. This magnitude of motor function improvement in our subjects would not be expected to occur in the natural course of AADC deficiency for patients in this age range (4–9 years) who have severe motor impairment. In a retrospective study of 63 patients (age range 6 months to 36 years), 11 subjects with a mild-moderate disease phenotype were able to walk independently<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. In those 11 subjects, the potential for motor development was evident in early childhood, with all having attained the ability to sit independently by age 4 years. In contrast, the subjects in our gene therapy trial had absent head control at Baseline ages of 4 years and above, and therefore would not have been expected to proceed to sit, stand, or walk independently based upon what is known about the typical course of developmental outcomes in this disease.</p>
              <p id="Par31">We propose that the broad range of clinical benefits we observed are attributable to physiological restoration of dopamine synthesis, storage, release, and reuptake in the pre-synaptic terminal projections arising from midbrain dopaminergic neurons. Dopaminergic neurons in SNc and VTA send highly arborized projections into the striatum and nucleus accumbens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Thus, AAV2-AADC transduction of SNc and VTA neurons would be expected to result in restoration of AADC activity in widespread regions outside the midbrain, as demonstrated by the distribution of changes in FDOPA PET uptake that we observed in the caudate nucleus and the putamen in our subjects after gene delivery.</p>
              <p id="Par32">Two groups in Taiwan and Japan have previously investigated infusion of AAV2-AADC into the bilateral putamen.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Concentrations of CSF HVA after surgery remained below 25% of the normal range in the majority of subjects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. OGC were reported to become less severe and less frequent after dosing. In the cohort of 10 patients described by Chien et al, who were on average younger than the subjects in our cohort, 6/10 subjects had gained head control at 12 months, and 2/8 could sit independently after 2 years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. In the 6-subject cohort described by Kojima et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, which included 4 subjects over age 10 years, none gained the ability to sit independently at 2 years.</p>
              <p id="Par33">Diffuse restoration of AADC activity in dopamine terminals in both the caudate nucleus and pre- and post-commissural putamen, as seen after midbrain administration of AAV2-hAADC in our study, is likely to underlie the consistent improvement in both motor and non-motor symptoms that we observed in our subjects. We suspect that dopamine transmission in mesocortical and mesolimbic pathways may also have improved, but detection of AADC activity in anatomical regions such as the nucleus accumbens and amygdala was unfortunately constrained by the limits of PET resolution possible in this study.</p>
              <p id="Par34">HVA levels in the CSF constitute a direct biomarker of dopamine metabolism. Low baseline levels of HVA represent deficient activity of endogenous AADC and point to failure of dopamine synthesis. Restoration of AADC in midbrain dopaminergic neurons leads to significant and consistent increases in HVA concentration. We believe that restoration of this dopaminergic biomarker in the CSF is directly correlated with diffuse and physiological activity of AADC in the dopaminergic brain circuitry in AADC deficient children. We did observe a persistent elevation of 3-OMD after gene delivery in all subjects, which is consistent with some degree of residual AADC deficiency. The marked clinical improvements we observed in our subjects therefore did not require complete restoration of AADC function, but the localization of that function, not only the extent, may be a key determinant of clinical outcomes. Serotonergic brain circuitry remained unaffected as demonstrated by lack of 5-HIAA increase in the CSF since we restricted our gene delivery to the midbrain, without any targeting of brain stem nuclei.</p>
              <p id="Par35">The durability of AADC transduction for children with AADC deficiency is unclear, but clinical data from subjects with PD (&gt;4 years) and pre-clinical data from non-human primates (&gt;8 years)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> suggest that long-term and possibly life-long expression persists.</p>
              <p id="Par36">Gene therapy, i.e. gene replacement with functional genes, is a potentially revolutionary therapeutic approach for many human diseases. However, many technical hurdles exist for treatment of complex diseases which include optimization of gene expression, anatomic localization of gene expression, and availability of appropriate endpoints to measure efficacy. From a technical perspective, AADC deficiency has several favorable features. First, gene replacement and expression in a specific small anatomic area, midbrain dopaminergic neurons, has a large clinical impact. This gene therapy clinical study is the first designed to prospectively utilize axonal transport of viral vectors to disseminate the therapeutic gene along brain circuitry affected by the gene mutation. Second, the surgical and imaging tools currently available, particularly MR-guided CED, permit highly accurate delivery to virtually any region of the CNS with a favorable risk profile. And finally, direct imaging by FDOPA PET provides a non-invasive tool to assess enzyme activity in the treated subjects. Although this was an early phase clinical trial with safety as the primary objective, the results obtained are consistent with successful <italic>DDC</italic> gene delivery and expression in the human CNS. The gene therapy approach described here represents many years of careful work to develop and to understand vector tropism, axonal transport, methods, and devices for gene delivery and application of MRI technology to maximize safety and gene delivery. This work provides a framework for the treatment of other human CNS genetic diseases, and iterative refinement of the individual components of this approach will facilitate broader application.</p>

The main exclusion criteria were medical co-morbidities judged to confer excessive surgical risk (such as baseline requirement for home ventilatory support, structural brain malformation, and coagulopathy), a history of previous stereotactic neurosurgery, and receipt of any investigational agent within 60 days prior to Baseline and during study participation.</p>

                <title>Surgical procedure</title>
                <p id="Par43">The surgical procedure was performed in a 3T interventional MRI suite. A combination of volumetric T1, slab T2, and slab inversion recovery sequences were acquired prior to the procedure and bilateral VTA and SNc infusion sites and trajectories were identified using standard software packages (iPlan v3.0, Brainlab, Germany). The trajectories were designed to avoid cortical veins and arteries, and the ventricular system. Following general anesthesia, the subjects’ heads were immobilized with an MRI-compatible head-holder. A bicoronal scalp incision was made and two small craniotomies created in the right and left frontal regions using the pre-selected entry points. The patient was then transported to the intra-operative MR unit and skull-mounted aiming devices (SmartFrame®, ClearPoint Neuro Inc. (formerly MRI Interventions Inc.)) were mounted over each craniotomy site. The trajectory and depth were refined based on intra-operative MR images acquired after placement of the targeting device. An end-lumen ceramic and fused silica cannula with a progressive bullet-shaped step design (ClearPoint Neuro Inc. (formerly MRI Interventions Inc.)) connected to an infusion pump with a syringe was inserted into the SNc. The location of the catheter was confirmed with a high-resolution MR scan prior to vector infusion. Fifty microliters (50 µL) of the AAV2-hAADC vector and 2 mM of a chelated gadolinium contrast agent (Gadoteridol (ProHance<sup>®</sup>, Bracco)) were infused into the SNc by convection-enhanced delivery (CED), or pressurized infusion. The catheter was withdrawn and repositioned using new target coordinates for the VTA. This site was infused with 30 µL. A similar infusion protocol was repeated on the opposite side. The total infusate volume was 160 μL of vector for each subject (80 μL per hemisphere). Calculations were made of the total volume of infusate and percentage of VTA and SN coverage by gadoteridol signal.</p>

                <title>Outcome measures</title>
                <p id="Par44">Primary outcome measures assessed safety and biomarker evidence of increased brain AADC activity. Safety of the procedure was evaluated by brain MRI 48 h post-surgery, caregiver report of symptoms at each study visit, neurologist rating of post-surgery involuntary movements (dyskinesia) at each study visit, and caregiver diary of sleep and behavior symptoms at selected visits. Evidence of biological AADC activity was measured by [<sup>18</sup>F]FDOPA PET and analysis of CSF neurotransmitter metabolites before and after surgery. Secondary outcome measures assessed clinical efficacy as expressed by improvements in symptoms and motor function. Caregivers kept a detailed log of the duration and severity of all OGC (OGC Log) before and after surgery. A checklist of AADC deficiency-related symptoms was reviewed at each study visit. Caregivers periodically recorded sleep and behavior observations in a 7-day diary. Gross motor function was evaluated using the Gross Motor Function Measure-88 (GMFM-88). All measures are described in further detail below, grouped by category (clinical/laboratory/imaging).</p>

                  <title>Clinical measures</title>
                  <p id="Par45">A systematic assessment of adverse events and side effects was performed at each visit with the study neurologist (Screening, Baseline, Weeks 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and Months 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24). Information was recorded on an Adverse Events (AE) Log which included type of AE, dates of onset and resolution, severity, and perceived relationship to experimental therapy (Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). The severity of each AE was rated based on the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0 (CTCAE; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/CTCAE_4.03.xlsx">https://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/CTCAE_4.03.xlsx</ext-link>). A general medical and a full neurologic examination was conducted at each study visit with selected examinations recorded on video.</p>
                  <p id="Par46">At each study visit with the neurologist (see timepoints above), a standard checklist of AADC deficiency-related symptoms was reviewed, in which parents were asked to judge the severity of each symptom as “major” (frequent and/or severe), “minor” (infrequent and/or mild), or absent. Subjects were also examined by the neurologist at each visit to assess the severity of involuntary movements, or dyskinesia. A dyskinesia score, based on the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) was calculated by assessing the severity of involuntary movements in each of 7 body regions on a scale of 0 (none) to 4 (severe), for a maximum possible score of 28 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>).</p>
                  <p id="Par47">Caregivers documented the duration and severity of all OGC that occurred during the study period, beginning 2 months prior to surgery, in an OGC Log. OGCs typically occur 2–3 times per week and each episode lasts from 30 min to 8 h; therefore, the average weekly duration and severity of episodes can be accurately and reliably quantified. We created a 3-point scale to describe episode severity based on clinical experience: Grade 1 (mild) = eye deviation only; Grade 2 (moderate) = eye deviation associated with involuntary facial movements; Grade 3 (severe) = eye deviation associated with dyskinesia or dystonia of the trunk and/or limbs. Parents were trained at the initial screening visit to complete the OGC log by documenting a start time, end time, and severity score (1–3) for each episode. They then prospectively recorded all observed episodes throughout the study period. An OGC severity score, consisting of a product of the duration (hours) and severity (grade 1–3) was calculated by summing the number of hours of each severity category per calendar month, and then calculating the weekly (7-day) average score for that month. For example, a score of 15 may represent 5 h per week of severe (severity score 3) symptoms, 15 h per week of mild (severity score 1) symptoms, or an intermediate number of hours of symptoms of mixed severity.</p>
                  <p id="Par48">A standardized behavior and sleep diary was used to capture sleep and mood dysfunction resulting from brain dopamine dysregulation. Subject’s caregivers were trained in the completion of a symptom diary by study center personnel. The symptom diary was completed twice during the period between the Screening and Baseline visits, each over a consecutive 7-day period at least 1 month apart. Follow-up observations for 7-day periods were recorded at Week 6 and Months 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 after surgery.</p>
                  <p id="Par49">Gross motor function was evaluated using the GMFM-88. The total score was derived as an unweighted average of the five dimension scores: lying and rolling (17 items); sitting (20 items); crawling and kneeling (14 items); standing (13 items) and walking, running, and jumping (24 items). Each dimension score was defined as percentage of maximum score for the dimension in question, and the maximum possible total score was 100%. The evaluations were performed by a pediatric physical therapist and recorded on video at Baseline, 3, 6 12, 18, and 24 months after gene delivery. The assessments were then independently scored by two therapists, the one who had performed the test in-person, and a second therapist who reviewed each recorded session on video (post-hoc, blinded to the timepoint of each assessment). When the total scores of the two independent assessments were within 2% points of each other, the score of the original (in-person) assessor was retained. When there was a difference of &gt;2 points between the total scores, a third reviewer (TSP) reviewed the video to determine each individual item’s final score and ensure accurate and consistent scoring across subjects.</p>
                  <p id="Par50">The parents of all the patients participated in a formal survey interview using the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale, Second Edition (VABS-II), a measure of adaptive behavior and developmental functioning for individuals from birth through 90 years of age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. This tool is administered to the primary caregiver of an individual being assessed and provides information in various domains of functioning. Specifically, there are four domains (Communication, Daily Living Skills, Socialization, and Motor Skills), up to 11 subscales (three each for all domains except Motor, which has two), and an overall Adaptive Behavior Composite Score. Standard scores (population mean = 100, SD = 15) are produced for the domain and composite scores, scaled scores (called v-scale scores, with a population mean = 15, SD = 3) are produced for the subscale scores, age equivalents can also be generated and may be combined to determine an overall Adaptive Behavior Composite score. Strong internal consistency, test–retest reliability, and validity have consistently been demonstrated. However, due to the significant global developmental delays and limited abilities of our subject cohort, there was no utility in calculating formal standard, scaled, and/or composite scores. Instead, raw score comparisons were reviewed across time points to assess any positive developmental progress (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). The VABS-II scale was administered at Baseline, 12 and 24 months after surgery.</p>
