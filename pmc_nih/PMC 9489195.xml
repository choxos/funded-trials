                <title>PURPOSE</title>
                <p>Multidisciplinary molecular tumor boards (MTBs) interpret next-generation sequencing reports and help oncologists determine best therapeutic options; however, there is a paucity of data regarding their clinical utility. The purpose of this study was to determine if MTB-directed therapy improves progression-free survival (PFS) over immediately prior therapy in patients with advanced cancer.</p>
                <sec>
                  <title>METHODS</title>
                  <p>This single-arm, prospective phase II clinical trial enrolled patients with advanced cancer with an actionable mutation who received MTB-recommended targeted therapy between January 1, 2017, and October 31, 2020. MTB-recommended both on-label (level 1 evidence) and off-label (evidence levels 2 and 3) therapies. Of the 93 enrolled patients, 43 were treated frontline and 50 received second-line or greater-line therapy. The primary outcome was the probability of patients treated with second-line or greater-line MTB-directed therapy who achieved a PFS ratio â‰¥ 1.3 (PFS on MTB-directed therapy divided by PFS on the patient's immediately prior therapy). Secondary outcomes included PFS for patients treated frontline and overall survival and adverse effects for the entire study population.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>RESULTS</title>
                  <p>The most common disease sites were lung (35 of 93, 38%), gynecologic (17 of 93, 18%), GI (16 of 93, 17%), and head and neck (7 of 93, 8%). The Kaplan-Meier estimate of the probability of PFS ratio â‰¥ 1.3 was 0.59 (95% CI, 0.47 to 0.75) for patients treated with second-line or greater-line MTB-directed therapy. The median PFS was 449 (range 42-1,125) days for patients treated frontline. The median overall survival was 768 (range 22-1,240) days. There were four nontreatment-related deaths.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>CONCLUSION</title>
                  <p>When treated with MTB-directed therapy, most patients experienced improved PFS compared with immediately prior treatment. MTB-directed targeted therapy may be a strategy to improve outcomes for patients with advanced cancer.</p>

              <p>Although many targeted therapies are more efficacious and tolerable than cytotoxic chemotherapy,<sup><xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>-<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> clinical use remains challenging because of the complexity of applying NGS results to patient care.<sup><xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> To overcome this challenge, many institutions have implemented multidisciplinary molecular tumor boards (MTBs)<sup><xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>-<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> to prescribe optimal targeted therapies. Furthermore, the availability of an MTB increases oncologists' willingness to use NGS tests.<sup><xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Although many institutions have implemented MTBs, data supporting their clinical utility are limited.

MTB structure and review.
</title>
                  <p>The University of Kentucky MCC MTB serves as a consulting service where physicians submit cases for review. MTB participants include medical and gynecologic oncologists, genetic counselors, pharmacists, nurses, pathologists, radiologists, and basic scientists. Redacted patient history, histopathology, radiology, and genomic results are discussed. Each genomic pathogenic or likely pathogenic alteration is reviewed to determine its function, oncogenicity, availability of any targeted therapeutics, or clinical trials. MTB recommendations may include physician's choice standard therapy, clinical trial referral, targeted therapy with an FDA-approved on-label or off-label therapy, or additional testing, including recommendations for germline testing.</p>
                  <p>If a targeted therapeutic recommendation is made, on-label options are prioritized, followed by clinical trials and off-label options with the highest level of evidence. All recommendations are provided to the treating oncologist in a letter that includes evidence levels. The University of Kentucky Healthcare Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee developed a consensus guideline for grading evidence, which is available in the Data Supplement. Level 1 evidence included FDA-approved indications and National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelineâ€“recommended therapies. Evidence level 2 included drugs with an FDA-approved indication for the specific mutation in another disease type and phase II or III clinical trial evidence for activity in the disease of interest. Evidence level 3 included FDA-approved drugs for the specific mutation in another disease type with case report or phase I clinical trial evidence for activity in the disease of interest. Preclinical evidence or evidence of pathway inhibition was considered category 4 and not recommended.</p>

                <title>Outcome Measures</title>
                <p>The prespecified primary end point was the probability of patients treated with second-line or greater-line MTB-directed therapy who achieved a growth modulation index (GMI) â‰¥ 1.3. GMI is calculated as PFS2/PFS1, where PFS2 is PFS on MTB-directed therapy and PFS1 is PFS on the patient's immediately prior therapy. Von Hoff et al<sup><xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> previously used this definition to define clinical benefit. PFS was defined as the time interval between the treatment start date and the date of clinical or radiographic disease progression as documented by the treating physician, date of death, or date of last follow-up, whichever occurred first. As PFS is expected to decrease with each subsequent therapy, an improvement in subsequent PFS suggests clinical benefit.<sup><xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup></p>
                <p>Prespecified secondary outcomes included overall survival for all patients and treatment-related adverse events. PFS for patients treated with frontline MTB-directed therapy was an additional outcome but was not prespecified because of the Protocol amendment. Documentation of treatment-related adverse events included event duration, severity, temporal relationship to the receipt of study therapy, and if event resulted in study withdrawal. Toxicities were graded according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0.<sup><xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup></p>

                <title>Statistical Analysis</title>
                <p>Sample size was calculated on the basis of research results from the study by Von Hoff et al.<sup><xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> In this study, the null hypothesis was that â‰¤ 15% of patients had PFS2/PFS1 â‰¥1.3 and final results indicated that 27% of patients experienced PFS2/PFS1 â‰¥1.3.<sup><xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> The alternative hypothesis for the present study was that â‰¥ 27% of patients had GMI â‰¥ 1.3 versus a null hypothesis of â‰¤ 15% of patients had GMI â‰¥ 1.3.<sup><xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> To obtain 85% power with a 5% significance level, 93 patients were required, with one interim analysis planned on enrollment of 37 patients on the basis of a two-stage Simon's design.<sup><xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Stopping bound for futility was set at less than or equal to six patients with GMI â‰¥ 1.3.</p>
                <p>Patient demographic, disease, treatment, and molecular characteristics were assessed with descriptive statistics. Separate analyses were performed for patients treated with MTB-directed second or greater line of therapy (cohort 1) and patients treated with MTB-directed frontline therapy (cohort 2). Since ignoring censoring of PFS2 using a simple proportion could result in an underestimated probability <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>(GMI &gt; 1.3), the probability <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>(GMI &gt; 1.3) was assessed by the Kaplan-Meier method.<sup><xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> For cohort 2, the Kaplan-Meier method was used to evaluate PFS with 95% binomial CIs.</p>

                <p>As of April 15, 2021, the probability of patients treated with second-line or greater-line MTB-directed therapy achieving GMI â‰¥ 1.3 was 0.54 (27 of 50); 95% CI, 0.40 to 0.68; the null hypothesis of 0.15 was rejected (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; .0001). A Kaplan-Meier estimate of <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>(GMI â‰¥ 1.3), which accounted for censoring, was 0.59 (95% CI, 0.47 to 0.75; Fig <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A). The median baseline PFS1 for this cohort was 145 (range 35-1767) days, the median PFS2 was 186 (range 22-1,240) days, and the median GMI was 2.053 as estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method.

                <p>We compared survival outcomes for patients treated with second-line or greater-line MTB-directed therapy by evidence level (level 1 <italic toggle="yes">v</italic> level 2 or 3 evidence; Data Supplement). The Kaplan-Meier estimate of <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>(GMI â‰¥ 1.3) was 0.61 (95% CI, 0.39 to 0.77), and the median PFS ratio was 2.053 (95% CI, 0.85 to 2.88) for patients treated with therapies with level 1 evidence. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>(GMI â‰¥ 1.3) was 0.57 (95% CI, 0.34 to 0.74), and the median PFS ratio was 1.551 (95% CI, 0.54 to 2.56) for patients treated with therapies with level 2 or 3 evidence. There was no difference between these groups (log-rank test; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = .54), suggesting that benefit of MTB-directed therapy was similar regardless of the evidence level.</p>
                <p>In cohort 2, the Kaplan-Meier estimate of the median PFS on MTB-directed frontline therapy was 449 (range 42-1,125) days (Data Supplement). In the entire cohort, the median overall survival on MTB-directed therapy was 768 (range 22-1,240) days (Data Supplement).</p>
                <p>Exceptional responses were noted in both cohorts. One patient with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma treated with pembrolizumab experienced a PFS2/PFS1 of 31.79. Although the indication for this on-label therapy was <italic toggle="yes">PDCD1LG2</italic> amplification, which is predictive of clinical response in this disease,<sup><xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> this patient was subsequently tested for PD-L1 expression, which was also positive. One patient with a <italic toggle="yes">PTEN</italic>-mutated ovarian cancer experienced a PFS2/PFS1 ratio of 5.12 on (evidence level 3) everolimus, consistent with a previous report suggesting benefit in this population.<sup><xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> Before the FDA site-agnostic approval of pembrolizumab for high TMB,<sup><xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> one patient with squamous cell carcinoma arising from an ovarian teratoma was treated with frontline MTB-directed (evidence level 2) pembrolizumab for a TMB of 25 and experienced a PFS of 880 days.</p>

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>This prospective phase II trial demonstrated a survival benefit of MTB-directed therapy over immediately prior therapy. The probability of patients treated with MTB-directed second-line or greater-line therapy experiencing GMI â‰¥ 1.3 was 0.59. These results are superior to those previously reported by Von Hoff et al,<sup><xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> where 27% (18 of 66) of patients demonstrated a PFS ratio â‰¥ 1.3<sup><xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> and comparable with those reported by Radovich et al,<sup><xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> which showed that 43% (19 of 44) of patients achieved a PFS ratio â‰¥ 1.3. Differences are likely related to increased availability of targeted therapies, including immune checkpoint inhibitors. The patients most likely to achieve a PFS ratio â‰¥ 1.3 in these publications were breast and colon cancers<sup><xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> and sarcomas.<sup><xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> Although our study enrolled few patients with sarcoma and breast cancer, 8 of 9 (89%) patients with GI cancer, 4 of 5 (80%) patients with head and neck cancer, and 8 of 14 (57%) patients with gynecologic cancer experienced PFS2/PFS1 â‰¥1.3. This demonstrates the benefit of MTB-directed care across a wide variety of tumor types.</p>
              <p>Personalized cancer therapies are quickly becoming approved for multiple molecular targets and primary disease sites. This results in more difficult decisions for patients whose tumors harbor more than one actionable mutation. MTBs may help oncologists choose the most efficacious therapy option, especially when multiple options are available. Although a benefit of the MTB is identifying off-label therapies, oncologists are more likely to use NGS testing to support on-label therapies.<sup><xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> The present study demonstrates similar evidence of benefit for patients treated with on-label and off-label therapies, which supports the continuous practice of MTB off-label recommendations.</p>
              <p>Although most MTB studies include few or no patients treated with up-front targeted therapy, patients treated with frontline MTB-directed therapy in this study experienced a median PFS of 14.9 months (449 days). Sixty percent (26 of 43) of patients in this cohort had advanced or metastatic NSCLC, where NGS sequencing and targeted therapy are frontline.<sup><xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> Our findings echo the report of Koopman et al,<sup><xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> describing a median PFS equal to 6.3 months in patients with NSCLC receiving MTB-directed frontline therapy. Although 60% of patients treated with frontline MTB-directed therapy in our study had a diagnosis of NSCLC, the other 40% with varying histologies also benefitted.</p>
              <p>Frequency of adverse events was consistent with previous MTB studies,<sup><xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> and toxicities were as expected for the anticancer agents used in the study.</p>
              <p>A strength of this study is its prospective, interventional design. As most previous MTB-related studies are observational, we provide evidence of benefit of MTB-directed care. The statistical design with the use of the novel GMI end point and the Kaplan-Meier method to adjust for censoring is another strength as it compares MTB-directed therapy with the patients' immediately prior therapy, allowing the patient to serve as their own control. Of the 139 patients whom the MTB identified to be eligible for at least one clinical trial, five patients pursued these opportunities. It is important to note that these patients were excluded from this analysis as we felt that it was unethical to count their outcomes in two clinical trials.</p>
              <p>Limitations include the possibility of selection bias as this was a single-arm study that only enrolled patients with an actionable mutation and received MTB-directed therapy; therefore, benefit is confined to patients with targetable mutations. This study was conducted at a single-institution tertiary referral center with a largely rural, Appalachian population and may not be generalizable to other populations. Furthermore, this was an unblinded, nonrandomized study with clinical disease assessments and PFS calculated by the study investigators. This could result in less precise assessment and bias in ascertaining PFS; however, patients were usually managed by the same treating oncologist for both regimens, and measurement error is likely similar between the MTB-directed and immediately prior regimens. To minimize bias, study investigators used predefined criteria to assess PFS.</p>
              <p>Finally, because of the markedly better-than-anticipated outcomes demonstrated in the planned interim analysis, only 50 patients were enrolled into cohort 1 despite initial sample size calculations requiring 93 patients to detect GMI â‰¥ 1.3 in 27% of patients. As a result, an IRB-approved Protocol modification permitted enrollment of patients treated with frontline MTB-directed therapy into a second cohort to total 93 patients.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, this prospective study demonstrates that patients with advanced cancer with targetable mutations experience survival benefit when receiving MTB-directed care. Additional trials in disease-specific populations and with randomized designs are warranted.</p>
