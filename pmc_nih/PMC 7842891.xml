              <abstract>
                <p>Tissue mechanics is central to pregnancy, during which maternal anatomic structures undergo continuous remodeling to serve a dual function to first protect the fetus in utero while it develops and then facilitate its passage out. In this study of normal pregnancy using biomechanical solid modeling, we used standard clinical ultrasound images to obtain measurements of structural dimensions of the gravid uterus and cervix throughout gestation. 2-dimensional ultrasound images were acquired from the uterus and cervix in 30 pregnant subjects in supine and standing positions at four time points during pregnancy (8-14, 14-16, 22-24, and 32-34 weeks). Offline, three observers independently measured from the images of multiple anatomic regions. Statistical analysis was performed to evaluate inter-observer variance, as well as effect of gestational age, gravity, and parity on maternal geometry. A parametric solid model developed in the Solidworks computer aided design (CAD) software was used to convert ultrasonic measurements to a 3-dimensional solid computer model, from which estimates of uterine and cervical volumes were made. This parametric model was compared against previous 3-dimensional solid models derived from magnetic resonance frequency images in pregnancy. In brief, we found several anatomic measurements easily derived from standard clinical imaging are reproducible and reliable, and provide sufficient information to allow biomechanical solid modeling. This structural dataset is the first, to our knowledge, to provide key variables to enable future computational calculations of tissue stress and stretch in pregnancy, making it possible to characterize the biomechanical milieu of normal pregnancy. This vital dataset will be the foundation to understand how the uterus and cervix malfunction in pregnancy leading to adverse perinatal outcomes.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>To date, there has been a lack of clinical, translational, and basic science research in the field of reproductive biomechanics and bioengineering. To illustrate, although parturition (labor and delivery) is so common that every human has experienced it, there are currently no clinical tools to effectively predict when delivery will happen, how long pregnancy will last, and any complications which may arise. This lack of understanding of fundamental pregnancy biomechanics makes it extremely challenging to understand and address abnormal pregnancy conditions such as preterm birth (PTB, delivery before 37 weeks gestation), which affects 10% of deliveries worldwide and carries short- and long-term health consequences from death in the neonatal period to lifelong disability [<xref rid="pone.0242118.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p>
              <p>The mechanical integrity and function of reproductive tissues is clearly critical to pregnancy outcome [<xref rid="pone.0242118.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0242118.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The uterus, fetal membranes, and cervix each have dynamic, biological, and mechanical roles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0242118.g001">Fig 1</xref>); these tissues must remodel and stretch to accommodate the growing fetus while it develops <italic>in utero</italic>, and then do the opposite, i.e. contract, deform, or rupture, to facilitate safe delivery of the fetus. Failure and mistiming of these essentially mechanical events contribute to major obstetrical complications such as PTB [<xref rid="pone.0242118.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0242118.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p>

              <p>The vital knowledge gap in fundamental pregnancy physiology exists in part because it is challenging to obtain direct quantitative data on how the uterus, fetal membranes, and cervix change throughout pregnancy as pregnancy is a protected environment. This is why we propose a biomechanical parametric modeling approach. Our ultimate goal is to facilitate precision medicine for parturition via development of personalized computational models to characterize a patient-specific biomechanical environment in pregnancy. As a step toward that, the goal of the present work is to provide time-course maternal anatomy data and corresponding 3-dimensional computer aided design (CAD) models on a cohort of low-risk patients with normal singleton pregnancies.</p>
              <p>We acquired imaging data with a standard clinical ultrasound imaging system for practical reasons because compared to other imaging modalities, ultrasound is relatively inexpensive, convenient, and low risk. Fortunately, we found it is feasible to use 2D images to obtain accurate measurements of maternal anatomy to create a CAD model for comprehensive visualization of maternal anatomy. Here, we report: 1) values of critical anatomic structures in normal gestation based on images from quick 2D ultrasound data acquisitions, 2) reproducibility and reliability of each individual measurement and its value to the overall model, 3) effect of gestational age, gravity, and parity on maternal geometry 4) corresponding simplistic and robust 3D parametric CAD models of the uterus and cervix (Solidworks, Dassault Systémes, Vélizy-Villacoublay, France), 5) estimates of time-course uterine and cervical volumes throughout pregnancy, and 6) a comparison study of the parameterized 3D solid model to MRI-derived solid models.</p>
              <p>The data and models generated in this study establish a quantitative foundation for computational analysis of pregnancy. Additionally, the 3D solid modeling method provides the critical foundation to understand how these reproductive tissues may malfunction in pregnancy and allow for novel avenues to design biomedical devices which can be used to prevent adverse outcomes such as PTB.</p>

              <title>Materials and methods</title>
              <p>Two-dimensional (2D) ultrasound acquisitions from the uterus and cervix were taken from 30 women at four time points (8w0d-13w6d, 14w0d-16w6d, 22w0d-24w6d, and 32w0d-34w6d gestation) during pregnancy and stored for offline measurements of dimensions of the uterus and cervix. Reproducibility and reliability of each parameter and its potential contribution to the model was assessed and correlations between parity, maternal age, and gestational age were evaluated. Parameterized patient-specific models were built using Solidworks for all patients and time points using the validated dimensions. Estimates of uterine and cervical tissue volume were determined from these models. Shape parameterization effects were explored by applying the 2D ultrasound measurement protocol to, and comparing the resulting parametric model with, segmented MRI solid models.</p>

                <title>Patients</title>
                <p>Flyers describing this study were given to low-risk obstetric clinics whose providers deliver and refer to Utah Valley Hospital in Provo Utah. Interested patients called L.C.C., who reviewed eligibility criteria with them. Thirty patients ages 18-41 were recruited when they were in the 1st trimester (&lt;14 weeks gestation) from Valley Womens Health in Provo, Utah from July to December of 2017. Exclusion criteria included history of preterm birth, prior cesarean delivery for failure to progress in labour (failure of the cervix to soften/dilate), previous cervical surgery (including cerclage/LEEP/cone), collagen vascular disease, or known uterine malformation. Inclusion criteria included singleton pregnancy in the first trimester and maternal age 18-45 years old. This study was approved by the institutional review boards at Intermountain Healthcare and the University of Wisconsin, and each subject provided written informed consent.</p>
                <p>The age, race, ethnicity, pregnancy history, estimated gestational age (EGA) at each visit, EGA at delivery, and delivery outcomes were recorded for each patient. Details about this cohort, along with study size rationale, are published in Carlson et al. [<xref rid="pone.0242118.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The estimated date of delivery (EDD) was confirmed by ultrasound crown-rump length at the first study visit. One patient delivered preterm (at 34 weeks 5 days) and was therefore excluded from analysis. Of the remaining 29 patients included in the final analysis, 9 were nulliparous (first pregnancy) and 20 multiparous (at least 1 previous delivery). Of these, none of the pregnancies were considered high-risk and no pregnancy issues were found. Patient demographics are reported in <xref rid="pone.0242118.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.</p>

                <title>Ultrasound data acquisition</title>
                <p>All ultrasound examinations were done by the same sonographer (J.D.) and acquisitions overseen by the same engineer (L.C.C.). Scanning was performed using a Siemens ACUSON S3000 ultrasound system (Siemens Healthcare, Ultrasound Business Unit, Mountain View, CA, US). The designated research sonographer (J.D.) was certified for cervical length measurement through the Perinatal Quality Foundation’s Cervical Length Education and Review (CLEAR) program (url:perinatalqualityfoundation.org). Transabdominal measurements followed the protocol established by Saul et al. 2008 [<xref rid="pone.0242118.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p>
                <p>Each participant underwent ultrasound an exam at four different time points: 1st trimester (8w0d-13w6d gestation), early 2nd trimester (14w0d-16w6d gestation), mid 2nd trimester (22w0d-24w6d gestation), and 3rd trimester (32w0d-34w6d gestation). The rationale for performing two evaluations during the 2nd trimester is that 16-24 weeks currently appears to be the most critical period for preterm birth-associated cervical change in pregnancy [<xref rid="pone.0242118.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. During each visit, six B-mode ultrasound images of the uterus and cervix were acquired (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0242118.g002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0242118.g004">4</xref>), three with the patient supine and three standing. These included transabdominal (TA) sagittal views of the uterus and cervix, a TA axial view of the uterus, and a transvaginal (TV) sagittal view of the cervix and lower uterine segment. Patients emptied their bladders prior to scanning.</p>

                <p>TA sagittal and axial scans were acquired using the SieScape extended field-of-view imaging feature on the ultrasound system, which automatically registers adjacent images together as the transducer is swept across the abdomen. The resulting panoramic image is not dependent on the speed of image acquisition. Examples of this extended field-of-view imaging in the sagittal and axial views for a participant at 32 weeks are shown in Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0242118.g002">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0242118.g003">3</xref>, respectively. For TV acquisitions, the transvaginal transducer was placed into the anterior fornix of the vagina, the image optimized, and the landmarks identified (internal and external os, canal). All measurements of the dimension parameters were taken from deidentified ultrasound images ImageJ Software [<xref rid="pone.0242118.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] (NIH, Besthesda, MD). A representative selection of images from the first few patients was used by L.C.C. to instruct the two research sonographers on making measurements. The 3 research team members then independently recorded measurements on the entire dataset.</p>
                <p>The 16 parameters describing dimensions of the uterus and cervix were based upon previous work [<xref rid="pone.0242118.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. From TA sagittal images, the inferior-superior intrauterine diameter (UD1) was measured as the longest dimension from the fundus to the lower uterine segment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0242118.g002">Fig 2</xref>). From the midpoint of UD1, the perpendicular distance to the anterior (UD2) and posterior (UD3) intrauterine walls were measured. To quantify the position of the cervix in relation to the uterus, the perpendicular cervical offset (PCO) distance of the cervical internal os to UD1 was measured. Additional posterior dimensions (UD3a &amp; UD3b) perpendicular to UD1 were taken at 25% and 75% of UD1 from the superior intrauterine wall, respectively, to describe the curvature of the posterior uterine wall due to the boundary of the spine. Uterine wall thicknesses at the fundus (UT1) and anterior uterine wall (UT2) were also measured in the TA sagittal scan. However, if UT1 and UT2 were not clear in the TA sagittal scan, additional ultrasound images were taken at the specific location of the unclear measurement.</p>
                <p>From the TA axial images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0242118.g003">Fig 3</xref>), left-right uterine diameter (UD4) and uterine wall thickness at either the left or right wall (UT3) were measured. The TA axial scan was done at the widest section of the uterus, where UD4 represents the largest left-right axial intrauterine diameter. Again, if UT3 was not clear in the TA axial scan, then an additional ultrasound was taken at the left or right wall to obtain the wall thickness measurement. Left and right wall thicknesses were assumed to be the same.</p>
                <p>From the TV images, uterine wall thickness at the lower uterine segment (UT4), cervical length (CL), cervical outer diameter (CD1), inner cervical canal diameter (CD2), and the anterior utero-cervical angle (AUCA) were measured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0242118.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Care was taken to exclude from the CL the isthmus (IS), where the cervical mucosa ends [<xref rid="pone.0242118.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. During the TV exam, quantitative ultrasound data were also acquired from the cervix to measure tissue softness, as published in Carlson et al [<xref rid="pone.0242118.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], for future integration into our models of information about tissue microstructure.</p>

                <p>To assess reproducibility (interobserver variability) and reliability of the measurements, the inter-class correlation coefficient (ICC) was estimated (p-value is for testing H<sub>0</sub>: ICC = 0). The quality of each parameter was categorized according to the Cicchetti (1994) Guideline as follows: poor (less than 0.40), fair (between 0.40-0.59), good (between 0.60-0.74), and excellent (between 0.75-1.00) [<xref rid="pone.0242118.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p>

                <p>The parametric solid model created in Solidworks was used to estimate uterine and cervical volume over the course of gestation for all patients in both the supine and standing positions.

              <p>Overall uterine diameters collected via transabdominal ultrasound and dimension measurements collected via transvaginal ultrasound have excellent and good agreement between observers. As expected, all uterine diameters increase with gestation, while lower uterine segment thickness (UT4) and isthmus length (IS) decrease. The anterior uterocervical angle shifts posteriorly with gestation. Parity influences the lower uterine segment thickness (UT4) and cervical length (CL) measurement trends. Multiparous patients have a greater rate of lower uterine segment thinning, compared to nulliparous patients, and cervical lengths that remain constant with gestation. Nulliparous patients’ cervical length decrease throughout gestation. Maternal position, supine vs. standing, was not significant for lower uterine segment thickness (UT4), cervical length (CL), and isthmus length (IS). However, maternal position affected uterine diameters (UD1-UD4, UD3a, and UD3b) and anterior uterocerivcal angle (AUCA). The parametric solid modeling method is able to automatically generate models based on patient-specific dimension measurements in 91% of cases. All ultrasonic dimension data and corresponding solid models are available at Columbia University’s Academic Commons (dimensions: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.7916/d8-g3bz-yj53">https://doi.org/10.7916/d8-g3bz-yj53</ext-link>, models: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.7916/d8-tchz-hs47">https://doi.org/10.7916/d8-tchz-hs47</ext-link>).</p>

                  <p>The majority of intrauterine diameter measurements (UD1-4, UD3a) and lower uterine wall thickness measurement (UT4) showed excellent agreement between observers (<xref rid="pone.0242118.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, ICC&gt;0.75). The inferior perpendicular distance from the inferior-superior axis to the posterior intrauterine wall (UD3b) showed good agreement between observers (0.60&lt;ICC&lt;0.74). Good agreement was also demonstrated for cervical length (CL), isthmus length (IS), and anterior uterocervical angle (AUCA). Fair agreement between observers (0.40&lt;ICC&lt;0.59) was noted for the outer cervical diameter (CD1) and poor agreement (ICC&lt;0.40) was seen for uterine wall thicknesses at the fundus, anterior uterine wall, and left or right uterine wall (UT1-UT3), along with the posterior cervical offset (PCO) and inner cervical canal diameter (CD2). Parameters with fair or poor agreement were removed from further analysis.

                  <p>The intrauterine diameter measurements accounting for the posterior uterine wall at 25% and 75% along the inferior-superior axis (UD3a and UD3b) show the lowest ICC values of all intrauterine diameters, likely because of difficulty in viewing posterior features in the TA sagittal view. The inconsistency in image quality also precludes measurement of posterior uterine wall thicknesses, and in models that posterior wall thickness is assumed to be equal to the anterior wall thickness (UT2). As expected, the sum (UD23) of the perpendicular distance from the midpoint of the inferior-superior intrauterine diameter (UD1) to the anterior (UD2) and posterior (UD3) intrauterine wall shows a higher ICC value than the measurements individually, likely because it spans the entire anterior-posterior intrauterine diameter, making it independent of the placement of UD1.</p>
                  <p>The significantly higher ICC value for the lower uterine segment thickness (UT4) as compared to the other uterine wall thicknesses parameters (UT1-UT3) is undoubtedly due to the use of TV ultrasound to obtain this image. As compared to TA transducers, TV transducers provide better image resolution because they operate at a higher frequency [<xref rid="pone.0242118.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], they acquire data directly from the structure instead of having several tissue layers to penetrate, and the image covers a much smaller area so the features appear larger, all of which contribute to a more precise measurement. The ICC value for uterine thickness measurements captured using TA transducers could be improved by taking taking individual, zoomed in ultrasound images of the uterine wall at the fundus, anterior wall, and left or right wall.</p>
                  <p>Besides uterine thickness measurements, several other parameters showed fair or poor agreement between observers: PCO, CD1, and CD2. The poor agreement between observers for posterior cervical offset (PCO) measurements may also be attributed to variable inferior-superior intrauterine diameter (UD1) placement, as it is used as the end point for this dimension. Additionally, identification of the internal cervical os is often difficult in TA sagittal scans (this is why the clinical gold standard for measurement of the cervix is TV), most likely the primary cause for poor agreement on the PCO parameter. The fair agreement for the outer cervical diameter (CD1) is likely a result of inadequate measurement definition; the location along the cervix to measure the diameter was not specified. The poor agreement between observers for the inner cervical canal diameter (CD2) can be attributed to inadequate visualization of the cervical canal in some images, and the small magnitude of the measurement (single pixel differences can have large effects on the measurement value). This finding is consistent with previous reports describing characterization of the mucous plug, which is assumed to fill the inner cervical canal diameter [<xref rid="pone.0242118.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p>
                  <p>Previously studies report isthmus length (IS) and anterior uterocervical angle (AUCA) to be considered repeatable measurements, while cervical length (CL) repeatability varies [<xref rid="pone.0242118.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0242118.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. These reports are in accordance with the good agreement found for IS and AUCA, and the good agreement between sonographers for CL is most likely due to their uniform training and certification.</p>

                  <p>The dramatic increase of the uterine diameter over the course of gestation is expected, as the uterine cavity must expand to accommodate the growing fetus. The decrease in the isthmus length (IS) and lower uterine segment thickness (UT4) is also an expected finding, due to normal remodeling throughout gestation [<xref rid="pone.0242118.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0242118.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0242118.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p>

                  <p>The dependence on parity suggests possible permanent mechanical and structural changes that occur during the remodeling events of pregnancy. For a multiparous patient, the increased rate of thinning of the lower uterine segment suggests two possible mechanisms: 1) the mechanical load exerted by the contents of the amniotic sac is shifting faster towards the lower part of the uterus and/or 2) uterine tissue becomes softer in subsequent pregnancies. As for a multiparous cervix, there is not enough evidence in the literature to statistically determine if the cervix becomes mechanically softer with each pregnancy. One study found that women with a history of previous vaginal deliveries have softer cervices than nulliparous women [<xref rid="pone.0242118.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p>

                  <title>Effect of position</title>
                  <p>Maternal position (supine vs. standing) also influences maternal geometric measurements. Maternal position vs. gestation age interaction (column 6 in <xref rid="pone.0242118.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) is significant for all intrauterine diameters (UD1-UD4, UD3a, and UD3b) and the anterior uterocervical angle (AUCA) where the LMM slopes are higher in the standing position, except for AUCA, where the angle decreases with standing. Maternal position is not significant for lower uterine segment thickness (UT4), cervical length (CL), and isthmus length (IS).</p>
                  <p>The effect of gravity has long been a curiosity in the study of pregnancy biomechanics. Bedrest has been demonstrated to be ineffective at reducing the rate of preterm birth [<xref rid="pone.0242118.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The maternal anatomy measurements here confirm the cervix does not further deform when a woman stands from a supine position, nor does the lower uterine segment thin. Whether the cervix deforms after longer periods of standing (i.e. viscoelastic creep) remains to be determined. However, uterine shape does change with position. Specifically, the uterus becomes flatter in the anterior-posterior direction and wider in the left-right direction when in the supine position when compared to the standing position. This is quantitatively observed by comparing the ratio of the anterior-posterior intrauterine diameter (UD23) to the left-right intrauterine diameter (UD4) in the standing and supine position, where in 86% of cases the ratio is larger when standing than in supine. Therefore, gravity does have an effect on uterine axial shape.</p>

                <p>The solid CAD models provide a visualization of uterine and cervical shape and size change throughout gestation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0242118.g007">Fig 7</xref>) and provide a structural foundation to calculate the mechanical loading environment of pregnancy. All solid models (STL files) generated from the workflow described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0242118.s001">S1 Appendix</xref> are freely available through the Columbia University Library’s permanent Academic Commons collection (url: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.7916/d8-tchz-hs47">https://doi.org/10.7916/d8-tchz-hs47</ext-link>). With 29 patients scanned at 4 time points in two positions measured by 3 sonographers, 696 sets of parametric measurements were taken and used to build models. For visits 1-3 (8w0d-13w6d, 14w0d-16w6d, and 22w0d-24w6d gestation), the <italic>spline method</italic> better represents the posterior uterine wall, and for visit 4 (32w0d-34w6d) the <italic>quarter ellipse method</italic> is a better method (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0242118.s001">S1 Appendix</xref> for method description). Of the 696 patient-specific parametric model builds attempted, 632 usable models are generated (91% automatic build rate). Of these models, 70 require slight edits, such as altering the fillet type or radii.</p>

                <p>Cases failing to generate usable models have issues in four categories: an extreme anterior uterocervical angle (51 cases), a posterior cervical offset (PCO) larger than posterior intrauterine diameters (7 cases), or loft function failure (6 cases). Cases with an extreme anterior uterocervical angle (AUCA) fail because the cervical cylinder does not terminate correctly on the uterine body. Of these cases, 45% were visit 1, 23% were visit 2, 14% were visit 3, and 18% were visit 4. As observed in ultrasound, the CL is not typically a straight line and is frequently measured using several segments, especially early in pregnancy. Therefore, in order to model these cases, the curvature of the cervix may need to be captured. For cases where the loft function failed, Solidworks is not able to complete the loft for the outer uterine body, where 66% of cases are at visit 1, 17% at visit 2, and 17% at visit 4. These models may require additional guide curves in order to loft, or may call for an inferior-superior loft instead of left-right. The cases where the PCO is greater than posterior intrauterine diameters (UD3 and UD3b) is fairly consistent across visits. In these cases, a different measurement protocol must be used to characterize the posterior wall, as discussed in model validation in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0242118.s002">S2 Appendix</xref>.</p>
                <p>It is observed, though not quantified, that the sagittal shape of the parametric model does not always produce a good match to the TA sagittal scan. For the anterior side, this occurs when the uterine wall is not a half ellipse. For the posterior side, this occurs when the spline does not fit the actual posterior wall shape well. The spline parameters in the models are automatically fit and no attempt is made to vary them to match individual’s posterior wall shapes. This could be remedied through the use of an alternate measurement method, as discussed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0242118.s002">S2 Appendix</xref>, or a method of capturing spline parameters from ultrasound images. Future validation of the model must be done for use in rigorous analysis of the entire gravid uterine and cervical environment. However, these low fidelity models are useful for educational and visualization purposes. Additionally, the shape and size of the lower uterine segment and cervix match well in the sagittal plane between the ultrasound and MRI-derived CAD models (S1 Fig in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0242118.s002">S2 Appendix</xref>), but improvement is still seen with an alternative measurement method. Hence initial structural analysis can be conducted of this critical <italic>stress concentration</italic> region [<xref rid="pone.0242118.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] using a subsection of the CAD models reported here, though model accuracy is still unquantified.</p>

                <p>Uterine tissue volume tends to increase at an increasing rate over the gestational ages included in this study. This result is in accordance with previous studies, which report an S-shaped curve to describe qualitatively how uterine tissue weight changes during gestation [<xref rid="pone.0242118.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In future work, further agreement between Gillespie and parametrically estimated uterine volume can be achieved by collection of very late gestation ultrasounds to determine if tissue volume plateaus as reported. Uterine volume inconsistency between supine and standing may arise from a number of factors, including poor repeatability of uterine thickness measurements and uterine contractions occurring at time of ultrasound acquisition.</p>
                <p>It is assumed, as pregnancy tissue remodeling occurs, the isthmus disappears. Due to this conclusion, it is difficult to determine if a lack cervical volume trends are a result of tissue volume changes are truly reflective of no change in tissue volumes, inconsistent cervical boundary assignment, or some combination thereof. There is currently no universally accepted method of distinguishing a boundary between the cervix and the uterus. The method used to distinguish cervical tissue from uterine tissue, described above, does not offer a rigorous delineation of tissues. While this inconsistency will not greatly influence trends in uterine volume, it has the potential to substantially skew cervical volume trends due to the smaller volume of the cervix and greater influence an equally sized error will have. It is possible that shear wave elasticity imaging could be used to better delineate between the cervical and uterine tissue, which in future work could provide a patient-specific uterocervical junction boundary.</p>

                <title>Comparing dimensions to previously published data</title>
                <p>The choice of proportions to portray the uterus and cervix is informed by previous investigations of gravid geometry. Published in 1950, the last holistic study of pregnant uterine shape reports gestational-age trends of greater sagittal and transverse uterine dimensions measured from x-rays as well as uterine weights recorded retrospectively from hysterectomies executed at various stages of gravidity [<xref rid="pone.0242118.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. All data are reported either through qualitative description or graphical sketches [<xref rid="pone.0242118.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. This study concludes uterine weight increases until the 20th week of gestation, coinciding with the most rapid increase in the transverse measurement of the fundus [<xref rid="pone.0242118.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. At the 20th week of gestation the uterus is spherical and proceeds to elongate into a “cylindrical” shape until delivery [<xref rid="pone.0242118.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. A prior study of the gravid morphology in monkeys identified three stages of uterine development: 1. growth of the myometrium through hypertrophy accounting for the uterus’s increase in weight during early pregnancy, 2. uterine growth through some hypertrophy but predominantly hyperplasia, and 3. elongation and stretching of the uterus until term [<xref rid="pone.0242118.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In 2010, a longitudinal anatomical and cellular investigation of the myometrium in pregnant mice supported the earlier study’s assertion, finding that growth in early gestation was due to hypertrophy while most growth after mid-gestation was due to hyperplasia of the smooth muscle myocytes [<xref rid="pone.0242118.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p>
                <p>Ultrasound investigations of the myometrium have developed differing analyses of gestational trends in thickness. Durnwald et al (2008) found a significant negative linear relationship between myometrial thickness and gravidity at the fundus, anterior wall, posterior wall, right and left-side walls, and lower uterine segment [<xref rid="pone.0242118.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. However, in an inquiry of the same five measurements, Degani et al (1998) reported only the lower uterine segment showed a significant negative correlation with gestational age [<xref rid="pone.0242118.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Similarly, Degani et al discovered the myometrial dimensions were not significantly different from one another while Durnwald et al found the fundus was thinner than the upper uterine segment during second and third trimesters [<xref rid="pone.0242118.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0242118.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Durnwald also showed multiparous women exhibited thicker uterine walls at five of the six measured sites [<xref rid="pone.0242118.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Our own examination reviewed the myometrium at the fundus, anterior wall, side wall, and lower uterine segment.</p>
                <p>Cervical dimensions are among the most scrutinized aspects of pregnancy, both clinically and academically. Various risk-scoring methods based on cervical diameter, dilation, length, position, and consistency have been developed from consistently found statistical correlation, though with low prognostic success [<xref rid="pone.0242118.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Short cervical length has long been associated with PTB and the time since conception at which the measurement is taken impacts its predictive nature [<xref rid="pone.0242118.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0242118.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In the first trimester, the isthmus length correlates with PTB while cervical length does not and as gestation progresses, the cervical length measurement predicts a lower risk for the patient over all [<xref rid="pone.0242118.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0242118.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Recent research has also shown uterocervical angle (UCA), describing the angle at which the cervix connects with the lower uterus, also correlates with likelihood of PTB and indeed shows higher sensitivity to risk than cervical length [<xref rid="pone.0242118.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The choice of UCA, cervical length, cervical dilation, cervical diameter and isthmus length as part of our study is based on these studies.</p>

                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p>To characterize and model maternal anatomy in normal gestation, we made several simplifications to allow for implementation in the clinical setting. 2D ultrasound images allowed for data collection from more patients than if we used more detailed imaging modalities, such as 3D ultrasound or MRI. However, the 2D ultrasound images have a lower quality than other imaging techniques and preclude vision of certain anatomic features, such as the posterior uterine wall. Additionally, though the number of patients provides compelling trends in maternal anatomy evolution with gestation, a more extensive sample set would be necessary to draw population-level conclusions. The parametric modeling method, an improvement in capturing sagittal uterine shape compared to previous parametric models, is not assumed to be the most accurate method of generating patient-specific geometry. It is instead a first attempt at including more geometric sophistication. Uterine volume estimation validation is also limited, as the MRI-derived solid models used as ground-truth are from patients at greater gestational ages than those observed in this study. Thus, the novelty of the presented parametric modeling method lies in the ability to quickly generate patient-specific solid models for visualization, education, and ideation on the biomechanics of the uterus and cervix throughout gestation. It is not a rigorous basis for calculating gravid mechanical loading, though future computational studies may prove it to be so. Nevertheless, this method is foundational to our future studies of calculating stretch and stress in the pregnancy, but we have not validated its quantitative accuracy at the time of publication. While we work towards this validation, we acknowledge the importance of sharing our longitudinal measurements of the uterus and cervix in pregnancy and a straightforward method to create solid models from them.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>This work presents longitudinal 2D ultrasound dimension measurements which characterize the overall shape and position of the uterus and cervix, along with a framework to implement them into patient-specific parametric CAD models. In this study, the interobserver variability between measurements is explored, with measurements of intrauterine diameters, lower uterine segment thickness, anterior uterocervical angle, isthmus, and cervical length having the best repeatability. Measurements of cervical diameters, posterior cervical offset, and uterine thicknesses taken from transabdominal ultrasound show fair to poor agreement between observers. These findings are promising in refining a 2D ultrasound dimension measurement protocol that is easily integrated into clinical practice. They are also useful in establishing structural models to facilitate biomechanical calculations of tissue stress, stretch, growth and remodeling of the uterus and cervix for pregnancies at low-risk of preterm birth.</p>
              <p>Linear mixed effect models (LMM) are calculated for all measurements, taking into account gestational age, parity, and position. Our results regarding growth of the intrauterine cavity with gestational age are intuitive, since intrauterine diameters increase with gestation to accommodate the growing fetus. The LMM models also provide insight to the effect of gravity on axial uterine shape, which becomes more oblong in the supine position compared to standing. Parity is shown to have an effect on changes in lower uterine segment thickness and cervical length with gestation, indicating a shift in mechanical loading of the uterus and cervix in subsequent pregnancies.</p>
              <p>The solid modeling framework is able to automatically generate patient-specific models in 91% of cases using Solidworks, a commercially available CAD software. Additional modeling frameworks will need to be developed in order to capture all uterine and cervical shapes. Uterine and cervical volume throughout gestation is estimated using the patient-specific models. Uterine volume is shown to increase with gestational age, which is in agreement with existing literature. No clear trend in cervical volume with gestational age is deduced. The current phase of the framework produces low-fidelity models appropriate for visualization and educational purposes. In future studies, the solid models will be incorporated into a finite element analysis workflow to calculate tissue stress and strain. The model’s viability for finite element analysis of mechanical loading during pregnancy will be validated and necessary refinements made such that biomechanical phenomena of pregnancy can be probed. This will aid in distinguishing maternal geometry that results in a mechanically higher risk of preterm birth.</p>

              <p>Reviewer #1: Longitudinal ultrasonic dimensions and parametric solid models of the gravid uterus</p>
              <p>and cervix</p>
              <p>The goal of the study is to provide time-course maternal anatomy data and corresponding 3-dimensional computer aided design (CAD) models on a cohort of low-risk patients with normal singleton pregnancies. The data and models generated in this study provide the critical foundation to understand how these reproductive tissues may malfunction in pregnancy and allow for novel avenues to design biomedical devices which can be used to prevent adverse outcomes such as PTB.</p>
              <p>Introduction</p>
              <p>- Line 6: consider rephrasing “how well it will all go” to “any complications which may arise”</p>
              <p>- Two time points overlap: 8-14 and 14-16 weeks. Were women in the 14th week of pregnancy allocated to both groups? As stated later in the methods section, I believe you mean the groups to be 8w0d-13w6d and 14w0d-16w6d.</p>
              <p>Methods &amp; Materials</p>
              <p>- Study design is not specifically stated</p>
              <p>- Eligibility criteria are given as women in the first trimester of pregnancy. How were the included subjects selected from the overall cohort of eligible patients?</p>
              <p>- Inclusion criteria should be specifically stated (singleton pregnancy)</p>
              <p>- Explain how the study size was arrived at. Was there a sample size calculation performed? If not, explain rationale for recruiting 30 subjects.</p>
              <p>- Were fetuses affected by growth restriction or macrosomia included in the cohort? What about polyhydramnios or oligohydramnios? These changes could impact uterine size measurements.</p>
              <p>- Why was failure to progress in labor in a prior pregnancy an exclusion criteria?</p>
              <p>- Perhaps state that panoramic imaging is not dependent on speed of image acquisition to help orient readers to this newer imaging technique</p>
              <p>- Is the correct terminology panoramic imaging or extended field-of-view imaging?</p>
              <p>- Line 96: internal os (not ostia)</p>
              <p>- Line 97: Fiji image processing package</p>
              <p>- Line 123: mucosa</p>
              <p>- The CL may be affected by maternal bladder filling. Was this accounted for and standardized in your protocol?</p>
              <p>- Excellent job describing and illustrating methods used for each measurement</p>
              <p>- Line 155: the video summary was very helpful</p>
              <p>- Validation was performed with comparison to MRI images of uterine volume at 38 weeks. Is this an appropriate comparison given that the model was built with volumes taken at 34w or below?</p>
              <p>Results</p>
              <p>- Line 174: most of the measurements described in the methods for uterine dimensions/diameters were obtained using TA imaging – but here you state uterine dimensions and diameters by TV imaging. Is this a typo?</p>
              <p>- Line 201: consider renaming this variable as endocervical canal width since you cannot confirm that you are measuring the mucous plug itself by ultrasound</p>
              <p>- Do you propose some parameters to reduce variability in UD1 placement and thereby improve ICC for PCO?</p>
              <p>- Do authors have any explanation for why UT1-UT3 measurements had poor ICC or how this could be optimized in future protocols?</p>
              <p>- Line 236: It has previously been reported that…</p>
              <p>- Line 290: It is observed that</p>
              <p>- Line 306, 315, 320, 324: consider using weeks gestation instead of visit number</p>
              <p>- Line 347: of 22.1%</p>
              <p>- Line 359: a lack of cervical volume trends are truly reflective of no change in tissue volumes,…</p>
              <p>- Line 362: Could you use elastography to better delineate between these two tissues?</p>
              <p>Conclusion</p>
              <p>- No changes suggested</p>
              <p>Tables/Figures</p>
              <p>- Figure 1 – consider adding an * to identify which structures will be evaluated by your protocol</p>
              <p>- Table 1 – it might be important to include additional subject demographics in your table. Maternal body mass index can significantly impact ultrasound imaging quality (in particular may affect posterior uterine measurements in these women). History of prior C/S could affect the UT4 measurement.</p>
              <p>- Figure 2 – might be helpful to clarify that the sagittal view was taken at maternal midline (perhaps include another coronal uterine outline like you do in figure 3). I believe the correct terminology is “extended field of view imaging” rather than panoramic.</p>
              <p>- Figure 4 – again might be helpful to state sagittal view at the maternal midline</p>
              <p>- Figure 7 – consider changing visit 1 to 8-13w, visit 2 to 14-16w etc.</p>

              <p>Overview </p>
              <p>We thank the reviewer for the comments and the punctual response, especially during this time. We also thank the editors for giving us an opportunity to strengthen and clarify our work given the reviewers comments. We give detailed response below, and we have provided the location of manuscript updates. </p>
              <p>Detailed Response to Comments Introduction </p>
              <p>• Line 6: consider rephrasing “how well it will all go” to “any complications which may arise” </p>
              <p>– We have replaced ”how well it will all go” with ”any complications which may arise”. </p>
              <p>– Please see Line 6: any complication which may arise. </p>
              <p>• Two time points overlap: 8-14 and 14-16 weeks. Were women in the 14th week of pregnancy allocated to both groups? As stated later in the methods section, I believe you mean the groups to be 8w0d-13w6d and 14w0d-16w6d. </p>
              <p>– Thank you for catching that oversight. We replaced ”8-14, 14-16, 22-24, and 32-34 weeks” with ”8w0d-13w6d, 14w0d-16w6d, 22w0d-24w6d, and 32w0d-34w6d” </p>
              <p>– Please see Lines 48, 91-92, 322-324: 8w0d-13w6d, 14w0d-16w6d, 22w0d-24w6d, and 32w0d-34w6d gestation. </p>
              <p>Methods &amp; Materials </p>
              <p>• Study design is not speciﬁcally stated </p>
              <p>– A study design section has now been added. </p>
              <p>– Please see Line 59-61: This was a longitudinal study of ultrasound dimension measurements in women at low-risk for preterm birth at 8w0d-13w6d, 14w0d-16w6d, 22w0d-24w6d, and 32w0d.34w6d gestation. </p>
              <p>• Eligibility criteria are given as women in the ﬁrst trimester of pregnancy. How were the included subjects selected from the overall cohort of eligible patients? </p>
              <p>– Flyers were given to low-risk OB clinics whose providers deliver and refer to Utah Valley Hospital in Provo. Interested patients called Lindsey Carlson and she went through the eligibility criteria with them. </p>
              <p>– Please see Line 63-65: Flyers describing this study were given to low-risk obstetric clinics whose providers deliver and refer to Utah Valley Hospital in Provo Utah. Interested patients called L.C.C., who reviewed eligibility criteria with them. </p>
              <p>• Inclusion criteria should be speciﬁcally stated (singleton pregnancy) </p>
              <p>– We have added ”Inclusion criteria included singleton pregnancy in the ﬁrst trimester and maternal age 18-45 years old.”. </p>
              <p>– Please see Line 71-72: Inclusion criteria included singleton pregnancy in the ﬁrst trimester and maternal age 18-45 years old. </p>
              <p>• Explain how the study size was arrived at. Was there a sample size calculation performed? If not, explain rationale for recruiting 30 subjects. </p>
              <p>– This research was done in tandem with research on measuring cervical sti.ness using shear wave elasticity imaging. Details on sample size rationale are published in the corresponding paper. We have added ”along with study size rationale” to indicate where study size rationale can be found. </p>
              <p>– Line 76-77: Details about this cohort, along with study size rationale, are published in Carlson et al. </p>
              <p>•Were fetuses a.ected by growth restriction or macrosomia included in the cohort? What about poly.hydramnios or oligohydramnios? These changes could impact uterine size measurements. </p>
              <p>–None of the pregnancies were high-risk and no pregnancy issues were found. One patient delivered preterm and was excluded from analysis. </p>
              <p>–Line 82-83: Of these, none of the pregnancies were considered high-risk and no pregnancy issues were found. </p>
              <p>•Why was failure to progress in labor in a prior pregnancy an exclusion criteria? </p>
              <p>–Stage 1 failure to progress in labor is basically failure of the cervix to soften and dilate. We wanted to exclude these cases because we were trying to ﬁnd pregnancies that would be as normal as possible. Because the record often doesn’t say whether failure to progress is stage 1 or 2, it was best to just assume the failure to progress was stage 1. Other reasons for cesarean section would not indicate problems in terms of cervical behavior, so those patients were not excluded. </p>
              <p>–Line 68-69: prior cesarean delivery for failure to progress in labour (failure of the cervix to soften/dilate) </p>
              <p>•Perhaps state that panoramic imaging is not dependent on speed of image acquisition to help orient readers to this newer imaging technique </p>
              <p>–We added ”The resulting panoramic image is not dependent on the speed of image acquisition”. </p>
              <p>–Please see Line 104-105: The resulting panoramic image is not dependent on the speed of image acquisition. </p>
              <p>•Is the correct terminology panoramic imaging or extended ﬁeld-of-view imaging? </p>
              <p>–The terms are similar, with panoramic being descriptive of the image itself and extended ﬁeld-of.view being descriptive of the scanning technique. We will use extended ﬁeld-of-view for consis.tency, except when discussing the style of the resulting image (1 occurrence). </p>
              <p>–Line 102, 106, Fig. 2 caption, Fig. 3 caption: extended ﬁeld-of-view. </p>
              <p>•Line 96: internal os (not ostia) </p>
              <p>–Replaced ”ostia” with ”os”. We have also changed all instances of inner and outer os to internal and external os for consistency. </p>
              <p>–Line 109: internal and external os </p>
              <p>•Line 97: Fiji image processing package </p>
              <p>–Replaced ”Fiji (ImageJ)” with ”ImageJ software” and added ”(NIH, Bethesda, MD)”. This reference style was chosen using an already published PLOS One research article as a resource (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0178488">https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0178488</ext-link>). </p>

              <p>–Replaced ”mucousa” with ”mucosa”. </p>
              <p>–Line 137: where the cervical mucosa ends </p>
              <p>•The CL may be a.ected by maternal bladder ﬁlling. Was this accounted for and standardized in your protocol? </p>
              <p>–All patients emptied their bladders prior to scanning. We added ”Patients emptied their bladders prior to scanning”. </p>
              <p>–Line 101: Patients emptied their bladders prior to scanning. </p>
              <p>•Excellent job describing and illustrating methods used for each measurement </p>
              <p>– Thank you! </p>
              <p>• </p>
              <p>Line 155: the video summary was very helpful </p>
              <p>– Thank you! </p>
              <p>• Validation was performed with comparison to MRI images of uterine volume at 38 weeks. Is this an appropriate comparison given that the model was built with volumes taken at 34w or below? </p>
              <p>– This is indeed a limitation to the validation of the parametric modeling method’s ability to estimate uterine volume, and we agree that a stronger case for volume estimation would be made with MRI-derived geometries from gestational ages which correspond to those used in this study. Even with limited access to MRI images stacks of pregnant anatomy, we still feel it is important to share our validation results. The following has been added to the Limitations section of the paper: ”Uterine volume estimation validation is also limited, as the MRI-derived solid models used as ground-truth are from patients at greater gestational ages than those observed in this study.” </p>
              <p>– Line 444-446: Uterine volume estimation validation is also limited, as the MRI-derived solid models used as ground-truth are from patients at greater gestational ages than those observed in this study. </p>
              <p>Results </p>
              <p>• Line 174: most of the measurements described in the methods for uterine dimensions/diameters were obtained using TA imaging – but here you state uterine dimensions and diameters by TV imaging. Is this a typo? </p>
              <p>– This is not a typo, but it is an opportunity for clariﬁcation. The overall uterine diameters, collected via TA imaging, show excellent agreement between observers, as well as dimension measurements collected via TV imaging. Dimension measurements that are not uterine diameters (uterine wall thickness, posterior cervical o.set) do NOT show excellent agreement between observers. Thus, we added ”collected via transabdominal ultrasound” after ”overall uterine diameters” to make this sentence more clear. </p>
              <p>– Line 188-190: Overall uterine diameters collected via transabdominal ultrasound and dimension measurements collected via transvaginal ultrasound have excellent and good agreement between observers. </p>
              <p>• Line 201: consider renaming this variable as endocervical canal width since you cannot conﬁrm that you are measuring the mucous plug itself by ultrasound </p>
              <p>– We have replaced all instances of referring to this measurement with ”inner cervical canal diam.eter” for consistency. </p>
              <p>– Line 135, 216, 249, 253, 649, Fig. 4 caption: inner cervical canal diameter </p>
              <p>• Do you propose some parameters to reduce variability in UD1 placement and thereby improve ICC for PCO? </p>
              <p>– We do not believe that substantial reduction of variability in the PCO measurement would be gained through additional parameters on UD1. Placing the UD1 measurement is the ﬁrst dimen.sion taken, and most measurements taken in the sagittal plane depend on its placement. That being said, UD1 has the highest ICC value of all measurements taken. In fact, all measurements that span the entire intrauterine cavity (UD1, UD23, and UD4) have the highest ICC values of the 16 parameters measured. All measurements that rely on UD1, besides the PCO, have excel.lent or good agreement. The PCO is unique in that it relies on the internal cervical os, which is di.cult to see in TA sagittal scans. We believe this is the primary cause of the PCO having poor agreement. We have changed the verbiage to reﬂect this belief. </p>
              <p>– Line 241-247: The poor agreement between observers for posterior cervical o.set (PCO) measure.ments may also be attributed to variable inferior-superior intrauterine diameter (UD1) placement, as it is used as the end point for this dimension. Additionally, identiﬁcation of the internal cervi.cal os is often di.cult in TA sagittal scans (this is why the clinical gold standard for measurement of the cervix is TV), most likely the primary cause for poor agreement on the PCO parameter. </p>
              <p>• Do authors have any explanation for why UT1-UT3 measurements had poor ICC or how this could be optimized in future protocols? </p>
              <p>– We have added ”The ICC value for uterine thickness measurements captured using TA transducers could be improved by taking taking individual, zoomed in ultrasound images of the uterine wall at the fundus, anterior wall, and left or right wall.” </p>
              <p>– Line 236-239: The ICC value for uterine thickness measurements captured using TA transducers could be improved by taking taking individual, zoomed in ultrasound images of the uterine wall at the fundus, anterior wall, and left or right wall. </p>
              <p>•Line 236: It has previously been reported that. . . </p>
              <p>–We have replaced ”It has previously been reported” with ”Previous studies report” </p>
              <p>–Line 255-256: Previously studies report isthmus length (IS) and anterior uterocervical angle (AUCA) to be considered repeatable measurements </p>
              <p>•Line 290: It is observed that </p>
              <p>–We have removed ”it is observed” and instead written ”uterine shape does change” </p>
              <p>–Line 309-310: However, uterine shape does change with position </p>
              <p>•Line 306, 315, 320, 324: consider using weeks gestation instead of visit number </p>
              <p>–We have taken the opportunity to remind the reader of the visit gestational windows in line 306, but think that repetition throughout the rest of the section is unnecessary. </p>
              <p>–Line 324-326: For visits 1-3 (8w0d-13w6d, 14w0d-16w6d, and 22w0d-24w6d gestation), the spline method better represents the posterior uterine wall, and for visit 4 (32w0d-34w6d) the quarter ellipse method is a better method </p>
              <p>• Line 347: of 22.1% </p>
              <p>–We have replaced ”or” with ”of” </p>
              <p>–Line 366: average error between supine and standing of 22.1% </p>
              <p>•Line 359: a lack of cervical volume trends are truly reﬂective of no change in tissue volumes,. . . </p>
              <p>–We have added ”are truly reﬂective of no change in tissue volumes” </p>
              <p>–Line 378-380: it is di.cult to determine if a lack cervical volume trends are a result of tissue volume changes are truly reﬂective of no change in tissue volumes, inconsistent cervical boundary assignment, or some combination thereof </p>
              <p>•Line 362: Could you use elastography to better delineate between these two tissues? </p>
              <p>–Yes, absolutely, and it is currently something we are investigating in terms of trying to identify the isthmus using elasticity imaging. </p>
              <p>–Line 386-388: It is possible that shear wave elasticity imaging could be used to better delineate between the cervical and uterine tissue, which in future work could provide a patient-speciﬁc ute.rocervical junction boundary. </p>
              <p>Tables/Figures </p>
              <p>•Figure 1 – consider adding an * to identify which structures will be evaluated by your protocol </p>
              <p>–An * was added to uterine fundus, uterus, lower uterine segment, cervix, internal os, cervical canal, and external os. In the ﬁgure description, ”Asterisks (*) indicate structures evaluated in the protocol” was added. We have also changed all instances referring to the internal os, external os, and exocervix to use this verbiage, rather than inner os, outer os, and ectocervix for consistency. </p>
              <p>–Fig. 1 caption: Asterisks (*) indicate structures evaluated in the protocol </p>
              <p>–Line 244, 541, Fig. 2 caption, Fig. 5 caption: internal, external, OR exocervix </p>
              <p>•Table 1 – it might be important to include additional subject demographics in your table. Maternal body mass index can signiﬁcantly impact ultrasound imaging quality (in particular may a.ect posterior uterine measurements in these women). History of prior C/S could a.ect the UT4 measurement. </p>
              <p>–Three patients had a previous c-section, which has been included in Table 1. There were no BMIs larger than 30. </p>
              <p>–Table 1 caption: There were no patients with a BMI larger than 30. </p>
              <p>•Figure 2 – might be helpful to clarify that the sagittal view was taken at maternal midline (perhaps include another coronal uterine outline like you do in ﬁgure 3). I believe the correct terminology is “extended ﬁeld of view imaging” rather than panoramic. </p>
              <p>–A coronal view of the uterus with a dashed line from inferior to superior along the maternal midline was added. In the ﬁgure description, ”coronal uterine outline with the ultrasound sweep location shown with a dashed line” was added. </p>
              <p>–Fig. 2 caption: coronal uterine outline with the ultrasound sweep location shown with a dashed line, and a representative illustration of measurements taken from ultrasounds of the uterus and cervix in the sagittal view </p>
              <p>•Figure 4 – again might be helpful to state sagittal view at the maternal midline </p>
              <p>–In the ﬁgure description, ”at the maternal midline” was added. </p>
              <p>–Fig. 4 caption: representative illustration of measurements taken from ultrasounds of the cervix and lower uterine segment in the sagittal view at the maternal midline </p>
              <p>•Figure 7 – consider changing visit 1 to 8-13w, visit 2 to 14-16w etc. </p>
              <p>–In the ﬁgure caption, we added ”for visits 1-4 (8w0d-13w6d, 14w0d-16w6d, 22w0d-24w6d, and 32w0d-34w6d gestation)”. </p>
              <p>–Fig. 7 caption: for visits 1-4 (8w0d-13w6d, 14w0d-16w6d, 22w0d-24w6d, and 32w0d-34w6d ges.tation)</p>
