                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>An essential component to improving maternal and newborn outcomes is antenatal care. A trial of group antenatal care was implemented in Ghana where 7 health care facilities were randomized to be intervention sites and 7 control sites continued traditional antenatal care. Group antenatal care, where 10–14 women with similar due dates meet together for visits, includes traditional components such as risk assessment with increased opportunity for education and peer support. The study aim was to assess and report the process evaluation of the implementation of a group antenatal care intervention.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Process evaluation data were collected alongside intervention data and included both quantitative and qualitative data sources. Midwives at the health facilities which were randomized as intervention sites completed tracking logs to measure feasibility of the intervention. Research team members traveled to intervention sites where they conducted structured observations and completed fidelity and learning methods checklists to determine adherence to the model of group antenatal care delivery. In addition, midwives facilitating group antenatal care meetings were interviewed and focus groups were conducted with women participating in group antenatal care.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>In the majority of cases, midwives facilitating group antenatal care completed all components of the meetings with fidelity, following best practices such as sitting with the group rather than standing. Across 7 intervention sites, 7 groups (622 pregnant women) were documented in the tracking logs and of these participants, the majority (74%) attended more than half of the meetings, with 32% attending all 8 group meetings. Three themes were identified in both the midwife interviews and focus groups with pregnant women: 1) information sharing, 2) sense of community, and 3) time management challenges. An additional theme emerged from the focus groups with the women: women who had already given birth noticed a disconnect between what they learned and treatment received during labor and birth.</p>

                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p>This process evaluation determined that group antenatal care can be implemented with fidelity in low and middle-income countries. Time management was the biggest challenge, however both midwives and pregnant women found the model of care not only acceptable, but preferable to traditional care. The knowledge shared and sense of community built during the meetings was a valuable addition to the individual model of antenatal care.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Maternal and infant health have long been at the forefront of global health initiatives. Through concerted efforts to improve maternal and newborn health, some progress has been made. In 1990, newborn deaths worldwide were 5 million and by 2019 that had decreased to 2.4 million [<xref rid="pone.0291855.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. During the same time period the maternal mortality ratio (MMR—number of maternal deaths during a given time period per 100,000 live births) reduced by 38% to 211 per 100,000 live births [<xref rid="pone.0291855.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, the MMR is still three times higher than the goal set by the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of less than 70 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births by the year 2030 [<xref rid="pone.0291855.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The newborn death rate NMR of 27/100 is more than twice as high as the goal set by the SDGs of less than 12 newborn deaths per 1000 live births by the year 2030 [<xref rid="pone.0291855.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Moreover, there has not been consistent improvement across countries with 99% of maternal deaths occurring in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) [<xref rid="pone.0291855.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Sub-Saharan African countries alone account for 86% of maternal deaths with an MMR of 415/100,000 and NMR of 27/1000; bearing the brunt of the loss of lives among newborns and mothers [<xref rid="pone.0291855.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. While death rates for both mothers and newborns consistently trended downward between 2000 and 2019, there is preliminary evidence that progress has stalled or in some cases been negated by the global COVID-19 pandemic [<xref rid="pone.0291855.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. This underscores the importance of implementing measures to improve maternal and newborn health that can be sustainable through events such as pandemics.</p>
              <p>Antenatal care (ANC) defined by the World Health Organization as “care provided by skilled health-care professionals to pregnant women and adolescent girls to ensure the best health conditions for both mother and baby during pregnancy” [<xref rid="pone.0291855.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] is one approach to reducing negative outcomes for mothers and infants. Providing comprehensive ANC is challenging especially in resources constrained countries. Long waiting times, lack of continuity of care by caregivers, and hurried consultations due to heavy workload on health providers results in dissatisfaction and missed visits [<xref rid="pone.0291855.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Traditionally, ANC involves individual, brief, regular visits with a maternity care provider that focuses on risk reduction of complications such as preeclampsia [<xref rid="pone.0291855.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. An innovative alternative to the traditional model of ANC is group care which places clinical assessment, education and social support into a group setting. These group meetings retain the risk assessment components of ANC care such as monitoring blood pressure while providing an opportunity for education, empowerment and support. In the group ANC model, women with similar estimated due dates are organized into groups that meet at regular intervals during pregnancy. Meetings typically last 1–2 hours which allows time for more in-depth discussions and participation from group members. The groups remain stable throughout which offers the additional benefit of social support from the group.</p>
              <p>A National Institute of Health funded study (Clinical Trial # NCT04033003) entitled “Group antenatal care to promote a healthy pregnancy and optimize maternal and newborn outcomes: A cluster randomized controlled trial” (GRAND) has been implemented in Ghana to determine the effectiveness of the group ANC model of care. This report focuses on the process evaluation of the implementation of the intervention (group ANC). The overarching goal of the GRAND study is to determine whether group ANC facilitated by trained midwives, utilizing a fixed group model of 10–14 pregnant women by gestational age for the duration of the pregnancy, improves outcomes when compared with participants in routine, individual antenatal care. The randomization occurred at the facility level whereby 7 facilities were randomized to routine ANC and 7 were randomized to offer group ANC to pregnant women seeking ANC at the facility. Primary outcomes include birth preparedness, complication readiness, increased care-seeking behavior, and improved maternal and newborn outcomes. Enrollment in the study and participating in group ANC was voluntary. The project used a Health Literacy Skills Framework and details of the framework and project protocol have been described elsewhere [<xref rid="pone.0291855.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p>
              <p>While program outcomes measure the success of an intervention, a process evaluation is important to understand why an intervention is, or is not, successful and to ensure that the outcomes seen are a result of the intervention, particularly when implementation occurs in different cultures and contexts [<xref rid="pone.0291855.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Preliminary data indicates that group ANC is feasible and may result in better outcomes for mothers and newborns in lower resourced countries [<xref rid="pone.0291855.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], however larger studies of this method of ANC delivery are needed, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa given the unacceptably high rates of maternal and neonatal mortality and morbidity [<xref rid="pone.0291855.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. To that end, we developed and implemented a process evaluation of the group ANC intervention at the onset of the GRAND study to monitor fidelity, or the extent to which the group ANC intervention was implemented as planned (<xref rid="pone.0291855.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) and identify issues and barriers in a timely manner [<xref rid="pone.0291855.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p>

                <p>During the summer of 2019, research team members with expertise in group ANC from the United States met with research partners in Ghana to conduct a train-the-trainer course for a selected group of midwives that would then serve as champions to train the midwives working at the intervention sites. The training was undertaken in the same manner in which the group ANC would be conducted; in small groups, in a circle, where discussion and participation were encouraged. The ten champion trainers then traveled to the districts where they were supported by members of the research team as they trained an additional 52 midwives as facilitators for group ANC. Each training session lasted 3 full days and included opportunities for each midwife to practice being the facilitator. Each participant was given a Facilitator Guide and a set of facilitation tools to use to prepare for and use during each group ANC meeting.</p>

Beginning with the initial groups in fall 2019, and continuing at intervals throughout the study period, members of the Ghana research team who had also participated as champion trainers traveled to the intervention site health facilities to observe the facilitation of group ANC meetings. Observations occurred during one of the later (5, 6 or 7) group ANC meetings. Observations included whether content was delivered as intended, whether women were encouraged to actively participate in group discussions and activities, whether picture cards were used as written in the Facilitators Guide, and whether feedback was provided to participants during demonstrations. During these observations the research team members completed both the Fidelity Checklist Scale and the Learning Methods Checklist (<xref rid="pone.0291855.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0291855.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref> Checklists).</p>

                <p>To analyze the qualitative data from the focus groups and interviews, a qualitative comparison approach was used. Qualitative comparison is useful when more than one standpoint of a phenomenon is of interest [<xref rid="pone.0291855.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In this case we were interested in comparing and contrasting the experience of group ANC for both the midwives and the pregnant participants. First, the research team immersed themselves in the data by reading and re-reading the transcripts. Midwive’s responses in the interview transcripts were analyzed thematically for codes (recurring words or phrases) by one team member and the pregnant participants responses from the focus groups were analyzed in a similar manner by another team member. The codes were reviewed by the research team to developed themes separately for each of the data sources. Authors then met to compare and contrast the themes to identify similarities and differences in the participant’s experience with group ANC. In order to describe the experience of group ANC in an easy to understand manner, qualitative description, where the results are kept as close to the words of the participants, was used [<xref rid="pone.0291855.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The use of an audit trail composed of methodological and analytical documentation and validation with other research team members was used to achieve validity [<xref rid="pone.0291855.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p>

                  <p>Midwives indicated that starting on time was a challenge because not all of the women were there on time, and they needed to decide whether to finish all the material or end on time. They expressed optimism that time management would get easier with subsequent meetings: <italic toggle="yes">“We are hoping that our next meeting things will be a bit faster then we minimize the number of hours or minutes we used today</italic>.<italic toggle="yes">”</italic> (Site 3 midwife).</p>

                <title>Focus groups with participants</title>
                <p>A total of 10 focus group discussions with a total of 92 participants (5–13 women per group) were conducted after the final group ANC meetings. One focus group was conducted at 4 intervention sites and 2 focus groups were conducted at 3 of the sites. Some women in the groups had already delivered and attended with their newborns. Focus groups lasted approximately 30 minutes. Participants were overwhelmingly positive about their participation in group ANC and hoped it would continue. Qualitative, thematic analysis of focus group data revealed that participant experiences resulted in three themes identical to those in the midwifery interviews: 1) sense of community, 2) information sharing, 3) time management challenges, and an additional theme unique to the pregnant women; 4) disconnect.</p>

                  <title>Sense of community</title>
                  <p>Some participants expressed initial reluctance to participate that was quickly overcome. “<italic toggle="yes">On the first day it was scary…but after I got involved</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">I realized it’s comfortable and good and it is helping me too”</italic> (Site 4 participant). Overwhelmingly, participants expressed they were happy they joined and were proud of their participation. As one participant said after the last group ANC visit, <italic toggle="yes">“Everyone has become a graduate in pregnancy”</italic> (Site 3 participant).</p>
                  <p>Participants in each group expressed their happiness that the midwives demonstrated respectful maternity care. <italic toggle="yes">“You play with us</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">you make us happy</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">and you also teach us well…we tend to forget some burdens we bring from home”</italic> (Site 4 participant). They appreciated being treated with kindness and patience by the midwives who gave out their phone numbers, calling, and even visiting participants in their homes. <italic toggle="yes">“The way the midwives treat them (us) it shows that they have love for the pregnant woman”</italic> (Site 3 participant).Women felt a sense of connection with the midwives. <italic toggle="yes">“I have never come across midwives like these…I feel they already knew us”</italic> (Site 7 participant).</p>
                  <p>Women came back after their babies were born to share with others. They expressed a desire to continue group ANC so other women could participate. “<italic toggle="yes">When I went to deliver my first born</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">I didn’t get this kind of treatment…I want you to continue with it so that everyone will benefit to help all women who give birth”</italic> (Site 5 participant). Participants asked that the meetings continue through the postnatal period. Some suggested they be involved in teaching others. <italic toggle="yes">“I hope that there are other pregnant women who also need the education…We could come and also teach them what we did that helped us”</italic> (Site 2 participant).</p>
                  <p>Participants enjoyed meeting new friends and relied on others for support. <italic toggle="yes">“I am happy because you have brought togetherness and love between us and that makes me happy”</italic> (Site 4 participant). Some even suggested having a fund for those with more financial need.</p>

                  <title>Information sharing</title>
                  <p>Participants were able to recall all topics covered. What is evident from the data is that it was important to participants that the <italic toggle="yes">why</italic> was included. <italic toggle="yes">“At first you think it is normal</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">but due to the teaching you will know that the sickness you have is not normal and why you need to take the medicine”</italic> (Site 3 participant). Knowledge helped to quell fears and dispel myths. <italic toggle="yes">“It has taken away the fear we used to have when pregnant”</italic> (Site 4 participant). Participants discussed learning about the importance of preparation for birth–specifically transportation, supplies and saving money for emergencies.</p>
                  <p>Participants expressed enthusiasm for the group ANC model of care where participants check one another’s blood pressure and weights with the supervision of the midwife, expressing feelings of empowerment and agency. <italic toggle="yes">“I was excited because…I check my BP and weigh myself”</italic> (Site 2 participant). They gained confidence to ask questions of care providers. <italic toggle="yes">“We were able to understand that when you come and they check you</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">you can ask how it is”</italic> (Site 4 participant).</p>
                  <p>Participants in group ANC are given a booklet to take home as a helpful reminder of things they learn in the meetings. <italic toggle="yes">“It’s still helping because when I see some signs and I don’t understand I open the book to check to see if it’s a danger sign or it’s normal”</italic> (Site 5 participant). Participants used the booklet to share the information with friends and family members which helped validate the information as correct. <italic toggle="yes">“Sometimes when I go and tell my husband that we learned these things</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">at times he doesn’t believe me</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">but I show him the book”</italic> (Site 5 participant). Participants recalled the topics regarding partner communication and suggested that partners be encouraged to attend some meetings. <italic toggle="yes">“They taught us how we should communicate with our partners…they taught us how to talk to our partners so that they can understand and support us”</italic> (Site 5 participant).</p>
                  <p>Women who had experienced traditional ANC in prior pregnancies indicated that group ANC was preferred. Participants expressed greater knowledge acquisition and feelings of support during group ANC. “<italic toggle="yes">This will be my 5</italic><sup><italic toggle="yes">th</italic></sup>

Participants shared that it was hard for them to arrive on time. <italic toggle="yes">“Looking at the time scheduled for us</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">it is difficult for some of us to access vehicles”</italic> (Site 6 participant).

                  <p>At times participants who had already given birth saw a disconnect between the group ANC teaching and the birth experience. In other words, participants were empowered to advocate but on the maternity ward they were not always treated with respect. One participant recalled being discounted by the staff: “<italic toggle="yes">I told them that the baby was coming</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">they told me that it is not yet time and that I am not the one to tell them the time to check me</italic>” (Site 1 participant).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Maternal and infant mortality in LMICs remains unacceptably high and women and infants that survive pregnancy and childbirth often suffer long term sequalae. Often, the traditional approach to ANC provides little in the way of education and counseling about health-promoting behaviors. To provide the most benefit, ANC must provide quality care that is respectful and valued by both the provider and the patient.</p>
              <p>Group ANC models of care have been implemented successfully in LMIC countries with promising, but not consistent outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0291855.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0291855.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. While group ANC in Rwanda did not result in a difference in gestational age at birth or number of ANC visits attended [<xref rid="pone.0291855.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], participants felt they had increased knowledge and support and a closer relationship with their providers [<xref rid="pone.0291855.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. A study in Malawi found that women in the group ANC arm of the study were more likely to receive comprehensive services such as blood pressure screening at each visit and demonstrated increased knowledge of health-related topics than women assigned to individual antenatal care [<xref rid="pone.0291855.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. A pilot study conducted in Malawi and Tanzania found that participants in group ANC were better able to communicate with their partners and their partners were more likely to be tested for HIV [<xref rid="pone.0291855.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Preliminary research in Ghana demonstrated an increase in health literacy or more specifically, how to recognize and prevent problems, when to access care, breast feeding and family planning methods [<xref rid="pone.0291855.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Moreover, evidence from Kenya suggests group ANC may be associated with an increase in facility-based births as well as family preparedness for birth [<xref rid="pone.0291855.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p>
              <p>Feasibility of implementing group ANC has been explored previously and our results are similar [<xref rid="pone.0291855.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0291855.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. CenteringPregnancy was adapted and implemented in Mexico and found to be feasible and acceptable to both the health care professionals and pregnant women [<xref rid="pone.0291855.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Adequate space for the group meetings and recruitment were the biggest challenges in this context [<xref rid="pone.0291855.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. A generic model of group ANC was developed by researchers in India, using elements from CenteringPregnancy and Home-Based Life Saving Skills [<xref rid="pone.0291855.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Feasibility and acceptability were explored qualitatively by demonstrating one meeting to key informants (maternity care providers, administrators and pregnant women). Participants were supportive of the model of care, finding it more comprehensive, educational, and empowering vs. traditional care [<xref rid="pone.0291855.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p>

                  <title>System</title>
                  <p>Training adequate numbers of facilitators in this model of group ANC can be time consuming and costly. Using a train-the-trainer model of implementation, we were able to train champion trainers who then trained midwives at the intervention sites which increased efficiency. Training workshops occurred in small groups similar to the model of group ANC meetings so they could practice the facilitation techniques.</p>
                  <p>A concern expressed by the participants as well as the midwives was that of time management. Midwives stated that often women did not come on time. Some participants were frustrated when they came on time and the meeting did not start at the allotted time while others had issues with being on time due to transportation issues. Strategies for time management were addressed in “reminder” messages sent to the midwife facilitators.</p>

                <sec id="sec037">
                  <title>Midwives</title>
                  <p>The midwives were able to administer the group ANC curricula with fidelity to the format using the techniques they learned and practiced in the training. The midwives that were interviewed all expressed a preference for group ANC over the standard, individual care model, feeling like it resulted in more education and a stronger sense of community. Each midwife was given a Facilitators Guide which they indicated helped them to cover everything in each meeting. The majority of midwives followed the steps of the ANC visit according to the Facilitators Guide, however there were some components that needed to be reinforced. This included the midwife asking open ended questions to facilitate discussion which may be contrary to the traditional educational delivery approach.</p>
                  <p>In the majority of cases, the midwives conducted the meetings in accordance with the group ANC model of care. The midwives delivered the content intended for that meeting and the observers noted that the pregnant women were encouraged to participate in group discussions. At times, activities such as demonstrations were omitted due to time constraints. The midwives utilized the picture cards and the Facilitators Guide consistently.</p>
                  <p>In Ghana, it is common for midwives to either work in the antenatal or intrapartum area and not in both. Because of that, some participants who gave birth before the final meeting focus group session described a disconnect between what they learned in the meetings and the care they received at the time of birth. Future implementation of group ANC should include training and information for midwives attending births as well as those in the ANC clinics.</p>

                  <title>Pregnant women</title>
                  <p>The research team was able to recruit pregnant participants willing to enroll in the study and participate in group ANC despite some delay due to the COVID pandemic. Of the participants, the majority attended four or more of the 8 meetings. One approach to encouraging attendance was reminder texts and phone calls by the midwives, although reasons for non-attendance were not collected. Given that the traditional model of ANC in Ghana included 4 visits, attendance at 8 visits by more than 1/3 of the women is encouraging. Women who participated in group ANC voiced enthusiasm for the model of care and wished for it to continue. Having the opportunity to tell stories, voice opinions and ask questions in the group gave them a sense of empowerment as did self-checking blood pressures and weights. They enjoyed having materials to take home to share with friends and family. One of the most salient findings was that group ANC created a sense of community and also a connection to the midwives that they did not experience with prior antenatal care.</p>

                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p>Implementation of the group ANC intervention and the ensuing process evaluation were impacted by the pandemic, as described above. However, the research team in Ghana and the midwife facilitators were committed to the program success. Fortunately, most of the group meetings were held outside which limited risk of COVID transmission and participants and midwives were required to wear masks during the meetings. While attempts were made by the midwives and research assistants to reach who stopped attending meetings, we do not have data on reasons for discontinuation and can only speculate that while some miscarried or moved, others may have not enjoyed or been dissatisfied with group antenatal care.</p>
                <p>Process evaluations are increasingly incorporated into health intervention research, providing value by documenting the barriers and facilitators of the intervention components [<xref rid="pone.0291855.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Our process evaluation was designed to monitor and document fidelity to the core components of the group ANC intervention. As noted, challenges were faced in time management, yet overall acceptability by midwives and women as well as fidelity to the group ANC model was high. Group ANC was preferable to those who have given birth prior to this pregnancy which highlights the value of community and underscores the need to keep content updated to the newest available information.</p>

                <title>Conclusion</title>
                <p>Significant shifts in clinical practice do not happen easily or quickly. Valid, reproducible evidence must exist for practice guidelines to change. Implementation of group ANC in this context was not without challenges, one of which was time management, however our findings contribute to the growing evidence that group ANC in LMICs is safe, feasible and that women find it beneficial. We advocate for future research focusing on the scale-up of group ANC in LMICs to address the unacceptable high rates of maternal and newborn mortality.</p>

              <p>Additional Editor Comments:</p>
              <p>This was a manuscript that describes the process evaluation for a cluster randomized trial that compared group antenatal care and the traditional model of antenatal care. The purpose of the process evaluation was to identify and document patient, provider, and system barriers and facilitators to program implementation.</p>
              <p>Process evaluations usually are carried out examine the extent to which a program is operating as intended by assessing progress at attaining desired goals and objectives with a view of sustaining progress made and realigning focus when barriers to attaining program objectives are encountered.</p>
              <p>The manuscript has been well written, however there are areas of the manuscript that needs to be revised to improve the quality of the article.</p>
              <p>Background</p>
              <p>Page 2, line 27: Interviews-Please change to interviewed</p>
              <p>Page 3, lines 62: Antenatal care (ANC) defined by the World Health Organization (5)</p>
              <p>Comment: Consider removing the reference (5) since this is still reflected at the end of the whole statement.</p>
              <p>Page 3, line 64: Please delete P.1 in the reference in bracket.</p>
              <p>Page 4, line 82: Details of the project have been described elsewhere (7).</p>
              <p>Comment: The study noted that details of the project have been described elsewhere. However, the quoted reference cannot be accessed thereby making review of the detailed project protocol impossible. This reference should be properly cited. Additionally, it is not completely in order that a funded cluster randomized trail protocol was not registered or published before commencement of the study. A more detailed description of what was done should be included in this manuscript in the absence of a link for readers to assess the detailed protocol. This will enable easy understanding of the entire project from which the process evaluation is being conducted.</p>
              <p>Methods</p>
              <p>Comment: It may be worthwhile to explain the theoretical framework(s) considered for the conduct of the trial. This will help readers to interpret the process evaluation findings</p>
              <p>Comment: This process evaluation did not mention or consider the other arm of the cluster randomized study. It is therefore not clear how the interpretation of findings at the end of the study would be done if this important arm was completely not mentioned in the process evaluation. This is a major flaw in the design of the process evaluation.</p>
              <p>Results</p>
              <p>Page 10, lines 201-205</p>
              <p>Comment: One of the essences of process evaluation is to see whether the project is on track to deliver on intended goals as well as shape modifiable factors to help achieve the expected outcomes. It would have been appropriate to include opportunities to track this group of women as their non-attendance could be from dissatisfaction with how the project is being implemented. Their loss has closed an opportunity to learn and improve thereby diminishing the benefits of the process evaluation.</p>
              <p>Page 12, lines 254-257:</p>
              <p>Comment: If truly the participants were called and visited at home, the 11% lost to follow up should have been identified and interviewed on the possible reasons for their non-continuity with the ANC rather than speculating the reasons in the discussion section.</p>
              <p>Page 14, line 293: Time management challenges</p>
              <p>Comment: This barrier or challenge should be discussed in the discussion section on how to improve this before the end of the project</p>
              <p>Page 15, line 303.</p>
              <p>Comment: It will be appropriate to consider expanding on this in the discussion section. For example, will there be need to consider including recent advancements and information during the ANC sessions so that even those who have delivered before will look forward to learning something new?</p>
              <p>Additional comment on the result: The qualitative component should please be reported in accordance with the COREQ guideline with attachment of same as a supplementary material. </p>
              <p>Discussion</p>
              <p>Page 15, lines 310-324</p>
              <p>Comment: These appeared like repetitions of what had been said in the background section. Preferably a statement or two on the essence of process evaluation and followed by the discussion of findings would suffice.</p>
              <p>Lessons learnt particularly the challenges and obstacles to implementation have not been discussed. Hence losing a component of the essence of process evaluation.</p>
              <p>The result and discussion should be revised to include the control arm of the study which an important 50% of the study design.</p>
              <p>On a general note, the reviewers require that:</p>
              <p>1.The results and discussion section should include the control arm of the cluster randomized trial</p>
              <p>2.The reference of the study protocol being considered for review should be properly cited. However, if the link is not available for readers to assess, authors should include a brief description of what was done in the groups. </p>
              <p>3. The discussion section should highlight implications of the barriers and challenges to uptake of the group antenatal care and possible ways of addressing these barriers towards attaining the project goals.</p>

              <p>Reviewer #1: the clients are randomized into two groups (one received routine ANC and the other group ANC).Authors should provide the findings from the routine ANC group (primary outcomes) in the result section.</p>
              <p>The discussion should be based on the availability of the data above.</p>
              <p>Authors should use statistical analysis to compare the two models of ANC to make inference</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: The article demonstrated a process evaluation of a randomized controlled trial of group antenatal care in Ghana. The research design is interesting, and the research is generally well performed. The key uncertainties were identified and the most important questions to be addressed were selected. The researchers combined both quantitative and qualitative data on key process variables, however, there are some deficiencies throughout the manuscript that would need further clarification.</p>
              <p>Specific comment</p>
              <p>Title:</p>
              <p>Line 1: ‘Are’ should be capitalized</p>
              <p>Abstract</p>
              <p>Lines 25/27/39: correct typographical errors. Authors may consider hiring a copyeditor.</p>

              <p>Line 85: qualify care seeking eg care seeking behaviour</p>
              <p>Line 95: may qualify study eg GRAND study</p>
              <p>Line 99 to 103: should be paraphrased to reflect the aim of the study not results.</p>
              <p>Methods</p>
              <p>It is suggested to add subheadings and write them in order for example, Study setting and design, sample size, research team/data collection, data analysis (more details), ethics statement (approval no. should be included)</p>
              <p>Line 108-117 can be under study setting and design, however, more context should be added.</p>
              <p>Line 118-119: it is unclear who the process evaluators were and if they were separate from the outcome evaluators. If same, how do the authors ensure the results are not biased.</p>
              <p>Line 118-165 should be under data collection and should be further elucidated</p>
              <p>Line 121: Table 2 should not cross a page</p>
              <p>Line 154: It is suggested the word ‘dose’ be defined in the introduction section as well as ‘fidelity’, being the key components of the process evaluation.</p>
              <p>Results</p>
              <p>A brief demographics of the participants (both midwives and women) included in the study may be provided</p>
              <p>Line 178: correct typographical error</p>
              <p>Line 180: the word ‘Never’ should be in parenthesis</p>
              <p>Line 180-182: this is not what is reflected in Figure 1</p>
              <p>Figure 1: ‘Never’ was on the scale and ‘Missing’ on the figure, there should be consistency.</p>
              <p>Proper title and axes labels should be added.</p>

              <p>Line 256: is this statement made by a pregnant woman? If yes, why the use of the word “them”</p>
              <p>Line 313: cross-check</p>
              <p>Line 320: clarify reference</p>
              <p>Discussion</p>
              <p>It is unclear if the discussion was in line with the aim of process evaluation. More context should be given about process evaluation including the data collection tools while relating the information to the GRAND study.</p>
              <p>Barriers and facilitators to the implementation of group antenatal care identified from this process evaluation should be elucidated.</p>
              <p>The answers to the questions listed in lines 128-131 should be discussed to describe the fidelity of the model while the results of the tracking logs should be discussed to describe the dose of the model.</p>
              <p>Conclusion</p>
              <p>Line 379-383 may be moved to the discussion section.</p>

              <p>Page 3, lines 62: Antenatal care (ANC) defined by the World Health Organization (5)</p>
              <p>Comment: Consider removing the reference (5) since this is still reflected at the end of the whole statement.</p>
              <p>Page 3, line 64: Please delete P.1 in the reference in bracket. Interviews changed to interviewed</p>
              <p>(5) removed</p>
              <p>P.1 deleted</p>
              <p>Page 4, line 82: Details of the project have been described elsewhere (7). The study noted that details of the project have been described elsewhere. However, the quoted reference cannot be accessed thereby making review of the detailed project protocol impossible. This reference should be properly cited. Additionally, it is not completely in order that a funded cluster randomized trail protocol was not registered or published before commencement of the study. A more detailed description of what was done should be included in this manuscript in the absence of a link for readers to assess the detailed protocol. This will enable easy understanding of the entire project from which the process evaluation is being conducted. I apologize that this was not clear. The protocol has since been published and the reference has been updated (page 5 line 100). The protocol was registered and available at <ext-link xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04033003?term=04033003&amp;draw=2&amp;rank=1" ext-link-type="uri">https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04033003?term=04033003&amp;draw=2&amp;rank=1</ext-link></p>
              <p>It may be worthwhile to explain the theoretical framework(s) considered for the conduct of the trial. This will help readers to interpret the process evaluation findings Reference has been made to the Protocol Paper text was added to this paper (p5 l99-100)</p>
              <p>This process evaluation did not mention or consider the other arm of the cluster randomized study. It is therefore not clear how the interpretation of findings at the end of the study would be done if this important arm was completely not mentioned in the process evaluation. This is a major flaw in the design of the process evaluation. I apologize that the way it was written in the last draft was confusing. This was a process evaluation of the intervention (group antenatal care) rather than of the entire randomized study. We have added clarification of this throughout the paper. Thank you for helping us add clarity. To this end we also revised the title from “The process evaluation of a Group Antenatal Care Intervention” vs. Process evaluation of an RCT…”</p>
              <p>Page 10, lines 201-205</p>
              <p>Comment: One of the essences of process evaluation is to see whether the project is on track to deliver on intended goals as well as shape modifiable factors to help achieve the expected outcomes. It would have been appropriate to include opportunities to track this group of women as their non-attendance could be from dissatisfaction with how the project is being implemented. Their loss has closed an opportunity to learn and improve thereby diminishing the benefits of the process evaluation. This is definitely a challenge, attempts were made to follow up with women when they did not attend but we do not have data as to reasons for discontinuation. We agree, this would have been valuable information to have and include and have added this to the limitations of the study (page 20 line 424)</p>
              <p>Page 12, lines 254-257:</p>
              <p>Comment: If truly the participants were called and visited at home, the 11% lost to follow up should have been identified and interviewed on the possible reasons for their non-continuity with the ANC rather than speculating the reasons in the discussion section. That we did not collect reasons which was a limitation of the study. A point of clarification is that it was not part of the protocol call and/or visit, this was an observation made by the participants. </p>
              <p>Page 14, line 293: Time management challenges</p>
              <p>Comment: This barrier or challenge should be discussed in the discussion section on how to improve this before the end of the project Thank you for this suggestion, a section was added to the discussion “Facilitators and barriers (page 18 line 377)</p>
              <p>Page 15, line 303.</p>
              <p>Comment: It will be appropriate to consider expanding on this in the discussion section. For example, will there be need to consider including recent advancements and information during the ANC sessions so that even those who have delivered before will look forward to learning something new? Interesting point, those who had given birth before expressed their preference for group ANC which highlights the value of not only the education but also community. Additional information added (page 20 line 433-435)</p>
              <p>Additional comment on the result: The qualitative component should please be reported in accordance with the COREQ guideline with attachment of same as a supplementary material. Additional text regarding the qualitative component was added to the manuscript and a 32 item COREQ checklist was added to the supplementary material . </p>
              <p>Page 15, lines 310-324 These appeared like repetitions of what had been said in the background section. Preferably a statement or two on the essence of process evaluation and followed by the discussion of findings would suffice. Thank you for this observation, this content has been revised with some that was not repetition of the introduction moved there and the repetitious content was deleted. </p>
              <p>Lessons learnt particularly the challenges and obstacles to implementation have not been discussed. Hence losing a component of the essence of process evaluation. Thank you for this observation – a sub-section titled “Facilitators and barriers” has been added</p>
              <p>The result and discussion should be revised to include the control arm of the study which an important 50% of the study design. I apologize for our lack of clarity that led to confusion on the part of all reviewers. This was a process evaluation of the implementation of the intervention not both arms of the study – We have made changes throughout the manuscript</p>
              <p>The results and discussion section should include the control arm of the cluster randomized trial This was a process evaluation of the implementation of the intervention not both arms of the study – We have made changes throughout the manuscript and appreciate the confusion this caused</p>
              <p>The reference of the study protocol being considered for review should be properly cited. However, if the link is not available for readers to assess, authors should include a brief description of what was done in the groups This has been updated to include the reference which is now published and available – thank you. </p>
              <p>The discussion section should highlight implications of the barriers and challenges to uptake of the group antenatal care and possible ways of addressing these barriers towards attaining the project goals. Thank you for this suggestion. A sub-section titled “Facilitators and Barriers” has been added. </p>
              <p>Reviewer 1 </p>
              <p>the clients are randomized into two groups (one received routine ANC and the other group ANC).Authors should provide the findings from the routine ANC group (primary outcomes) in the result section. I apologize for our lack of clarity that led to confusion on the part of all reviewers. This was a process evaluation of the implementation of the intervention not both arms of the study – We have made changes throughout the manuscript</p>
              <p>The discussion should be based on the availability of the data above. Apologies - See above</p>
              <p>Authors should use statistical analysis to compare the two models of ANC to make inference Apologies - See above</p>
              <p>Reviewer 2 </p>
              <p>Title: Line 1: ‘Are’ should be capitalized Thank you for noticing this – the title has been edited to correct PLOS-ONE format</p>
              <p>Title: Line 1: ‘Are’ should be capitalized Abstract</p>
              <p>Lines 25/27/39: correct typographical errors. Authors may consider hiring a copyeditor. Thank you for your attention to these details, the corrections have been made.</p>
              <p>Line 64: clarify reference</p>
              <p>Line 82: First sentence of line 82 may come at the end of the paragraph, while line 82-87 should be moved to line 78.</p>
              <p>Line 82: correct spelling of ‘elsewhere’ The corrections have been made, thank you</p>
              <p>Line 85: qualify care seeking eg care seeking behaviour Edited to care seeking behavior, thank you</p>
              <p>Line 95: may qualify study eg GRAND study Edited to GRAND study, thank you</p>
              <p>Line 99 to 103: should be paraphrased to reflect the aim of the study not results. This was edited to reflet the aim (p 6 114-119)</p>
              <p>It is suggested to add subheadings and write them in order for example, Study setting and design, sample size, research team/data collection, data analysis (more details), ethics statement (approval no. should be included) Thank you for this suggestion, subheadings were added, however they did not fit as well into the traditional sub-headings given that this was a process evaluation. </p>
              <p>Line 108-117 can be under study setting and design, however, more context should be added. These edits were made, thank you </p>
              <p>Line 118-119: it is unclear who the process evaluators were and if they were separate from the outcome evaluators. If same, how do the authors ensure the results are not biased. The champion trainers (who also conducted the training) conducted the process evaluation. The outcome evaluation was collected by the Research assistants. </p>
              <p>Line 118-165 should be under data collection and should be further elucidated This content was moved to data collection and some additional clarification was added</p>
              <p>Line 121: Table 2 should not cross a page Corrected, thank you</p>
              <p>Line 154: It is suggested the word ‘dose’ be defined in the introduction section as well as ‘fidelity’, being the key components of the process evaluation. Thank you for this suggestion, for clarity, rather than placing the definitions in the introduction, “dose” and “fidelity” were defined at the first point in which they were introduced in the manuscript. </p>
              <p>A brief demographics of the participants (both midwives and women) included in the study may be provided None for this group of participants</p>
              <p>Line 178: correct typographical error</p>
              <p>Line 180: the word ‘Never’ should be in parenthesis</p>
              <p>Line 180-182: this is not what is reflected in Figure 1</p>
              <p>Figure 1: ‘Never’ was on the scale and ‘Missing’ on the figure, there should be consistency.</p>
              <p>Proper title and axes labels should be added.</p>
              <p>Line 182: it is unclear who made the comments, you may wish to specify</p>
              <p>Line 182: ‘midwives’ rather than ‘midwife’</p>
              <p>Figure 2: Proper title and axes labels should be added.</p>
              <p>Line 226: Paraphrase eg a sense of community or community partnership</p>
              <p>Line 240: indicate the number of intervention sites the focus groups were held</p>
              <p>Line 256: is this statement made by a pregnant woman? If yes, why the use of the word “them”</p>
              <p>Line 313: cross-check</p>
              <p>Line 320: clarify reference Typographical errors were corrected, thank you. </p>
              <p>“Never” was placed in quotations</p>
              <p>Thank you for finding the discrepancy between the text and Figure 1. This was corrected in the manuscript. As there were no “never” responses it was not included on the figure</p>
              <p>Thank you for bringing this lack of clarity to our attention. We clarified in the manuscript that the comments were added on the Fidelity Checklist sheets by the champion trainers during their observation of the group ANC meetings. </p>
              <p>“community” was edited to “a sense of community”</p>
              <p>All intervention sites had at least 1 focus group and 2 were conducted at 3 of the sites. This information has been added to the manuscript.</p>
              <p>Line 313 – this content was moved to the introduction and seems to be consistent across all articles I could find that the pandemic has resulted in worsening outcomes for mothers and neonates. </p>
              <p>We recognize that the use of “them” is confusing, it was how it was translated from Twi to English. We added “us” in parenthesis for clarity.</p>
              <p>Line 320 – this content was removed from the manuscript in response to an earlier reviewer suggestion</p>
              <p>It is unclear if the discussion was in line with the aim of process evaluation. More context should be given about process evaluation including the data collection tools while relating the information to the GRAND study. The discussion section has undergone revision with these suggestions in mind</p>
              <p>Barriers and facilitators to the implementation of group antenatal care identified from this process evaluation should be elucidated. A sub-section titled “facilitators and barriers” has been added</p>
              <p>The answers to the questions listed in lines 128-131 should be discussed to describe the fidelity of the model while the results of the tracking logs should be discussed to describe the dose of the model. This has been incorporated into the discussion section</p>
              <p>Line 379-383 may be moved to the discussion section. This content was moved to the discussion section</p>
              <p>Please give a concise conclusion. The conclusion was edited for conciseness.</p>

              <p>“With group antenatal care, pregnant women know they are not alone”: The process evaluation of a group antenatal care intervention in Ghana.</p>
              <p>PLOS ONE</p>
              <p>Dear Dr. Zielinski,</p>
              <p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE’s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.</p>
              <p>In addition to Reviewer #1's comment below, kindly address the following comments:</p>
              <p>In complying with the journal standards, I will suggest the authors clearly articulate and describe the study population and settings, sample size calculation, how the sample size for each study components were derived, and the data collection procedure for these components. It is unclear the way these sections currently reads. For instance lines 237-243 (page 12 of the manuscript) include useful information that will help readers understand the study population and study setting, yet not described in the methods. It is unclear what these intervention sites are.  </p>
              <p>For easy of understanding and replication of the study, I will suggest the methods section follow this order: Study design, study setting, study population, sampling, data collection process, data analysis and ethical approval. See example below:</p>
              <p>Pilgrim N, Jani N, Mathur S, Kahabuka C, Saria V, Makyao N, et al. Provider perspectives on PrEP for adolescent girls and young women in Tanzania: The role of provider biases and quality of care. PloS one. 2018; 13(4):e0196280. <ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0196280" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0196280</ext-link> PMID: 29702659</p>
              <p>I also struggled to understand the data collection processes. The authors claimed they conducted both in-depth interviews (IDIs) and focus group discussions (FGDs) but did not clearly define the processes they followed in conducting these interviews. It is unclear how the data was collected and analyzed. For instance, how many IDIs and FGDs were conducted; how many participants were included in each FGDs. Also, they need to state what measures were used to determine the inclusion criteria for participating in the IDIs and FDGs. More so, the demographic characteristics of the participants should be include.</p>
              <p>The qualitative analysis plan is vague. It is unclear what types of analyses was performed for both the IDIs and FGDs. For instance, the authors mentioned in lines 207-213 (page 10-11), that “Qualitative data were analyzed thematically…”, but failed to describe in detail how the data from the participants were analyzed. Was this done inductively and deductively or both? These are very useful details and yet not discussed in depth. I would like to see a clear analysis plan in the methods. This should clearly be stated for easy replication of the study.</p>
              <p>I found it very difficult to understand and follow the results section due to the style adopted. The way the qualitative data is presented makes it difficult to read. All quotes should be referenced using codes to protect the identity of the participants. I will suggest using codes such as the ones used in Pilgrim N, Jani N, Mathur S, Kahabuka C, Saria V, Makyao N, et al. Provider perspectives on PrEP for adolescent girls and young women in Tanzania: The role of provider biases and quality of care. PloS one. 2018; 13(4):e0196280. <ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0196280" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0196280</ext-link> PMID: 29702659. </p>
              <p>Also, lines 114-115 on page 6 of the manuscript states that "The purpose of this process evaluation was to identify and document patient, provider, and system barriers and facilitators...", however, the results and discussions did not present the barriers and facilitators differentiating these levels. I will suggest that the findings are categorized according to these levels. For example which are patient, provider barrier and/or facilitators, and which are systems barriers and/or facilitators. </p>

              </p>
              <p>Suggested revision: Clearly articulate and describe the study population and settings, sample size calculation, how the sample size for each study components were derived, and the data collection procedure for these components </p>
              <p>Author’s response: Thank you for this suggestion. We added content to better describe the study participants, setting and data collection procedures. Since this is a process evaluation, sample size calculations were not included in this report. The study protocol is referenced in the text.</p>
              <p>Suggested revision: The authors claimed they conducted both in-depth interviews (IDIs) and focus group discussions (FGDs) but did not clearly define the processes they followed in conducting these interviews. It is unclear how the data was collected and analyzed. For instance, how many IDIs and FGDs were conducted; how many participants were included in each FGDs. Also, they need to state what measures were used to determine the inclusion criteria for participating in the IDIs and FDGs. More so, the demographic characteristics of the participants should be include. </p>
              <p>Authors response: More information has been added regarding how the interviews and focus groups were conducted. Inclusion criteria has been added. Regarding demographic characteristics. This data was collected for the group ANC outcome evaluation and will be included in those reports, however for the process evaluation the focus group data were analyzed and presented without using any identifiers such as demographic data or facility name. We did not collect demographic data for the midwife facilitator participants. </p>
              <p>Suggested revision: It is unclear the way these sections currently reads. For instance lines 237-243 (page 12 of the manuscript) include useful information that will help readers understand the study population and study setting, yet not described in the methods. It is unclear what these intervention sites are. Authors response: Additional content has been added that describes the study population, setting and intervention sites. </p>
              <p>Suggested revision: For easy of understanding and replication of the study, I will suggest the methods section follow this order: Study design, study setting, study population, sampling, data collection process, data analysis and ethical approval. See example below: </p>
              <p>Authors response: The methods section has been modified to follow the order suggested</p>
              <p>Suggested revision: The qualitative analysis plan is vague. It is unclear what types of analyses was performed for both the IDIs and FGDs. For instance, the authors mentioned in lines 207-213 (page 10-11), that “Qualitative data were analyzed thematically…”, but failed to describe in detail how the data from the participants were analyzed. Was this done inductively and deductively or both? These are very useful details and yet not discussed in depth. I would like to see a clear analysis plan in the methods. This should clearly be stated for easy replication of the study. </p>
              <p>Authors response: We agree that the qualitative analysis was not well described in the manuscript. We used a qualitative comparison design but did not identify that in the manuscript. We added the steps taken in the analysis and added a reference for qualitative comparison designs. </p>
              <p>Suggested revision: I found it very difficult to understand and follow the results section due to the style adopted. The way the qualitative data is presented makes it difficult to read. All quotes should be referenced using codes to protect the identity of the participants. I will suggest using codes such as the ones used in Pilgrim N, Jani N, Mathur S, Kahabuka C, Saria V, Makyao N, et al. Provider perspectives on PrEP for adolescent girls and young women in Tanzania: The role of provider biases and quality of care. PloS one. 2018; 13(4):e0196280. <ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0196280" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0196280</ext-link> PMID: 29702659. </p>
              <p>Authors response: As this was the report of a process evaluation, we did not collect identifiers for the participants and thus did not need to use codes to protect the identity of the participants. Regarding the presentation of the qualitative data, we used a presentation style similar to a process evaluation published in Plos One in 2021 that seems a better fit for this manuscript as it is also a process evaluation: Arthur K, Christofides N, Nelson G. Process evaluation of a pre-adolescent transdisciplinary health intervention for inter-generational outcomes. PLoS One. 2021 Dec 23;16(12):e0261632. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0261632.

              <p>Dear Dr. Zielinski,</p>
              <p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE’s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.</p>
              <p>To ensure the Editors are able to recommend that your revised manuscript is accepted, please pay careful attention to each of the comments below. This way, we can avoid future rounds of clarifications and revisions.<!-- </div> --></p>
              <p>Constructive comments were proposed to the authors to improve the structure of the paper, however, some of these comments were not addressed. Specifically:</p>
              <p>
                <list list-type="bullet">
                  <list-item>
                    <p>I found it difficult to understand and follow the results section due to the style adopted. The way the qualitative data is presented makes it difficult to read. All quotes should be referenced using codes to protect the identity of the participants. I will suggest using codes such as those used in Pilgrim et al 2018... The paper cited by the authors, in their rebuttal letter, also used the same reporting style, referencing the quotes with codes (Quintile 1 educator, Quintile 2 educator etc). See page 10 under <bold>Quality of implementation</bold> "Another educator encouraged participation by directing her questions to learners who did not volunteer to answer questions. <italic toggle="yes">“Children don’t answer questions in my class except for the ones that speak excellent English. Other children sit quietly and try not to answer because of their lack of confidence to speak English, so when I teach I ask questions to the quieter children”</italic> (Quintile 1 educator). See also page 12 under <bold>Acceptability </bold><italic toggle="yes">“The workbook and information in it, that was delivered, speak directly to the syllabus. I will use the workbooks again next year to make things easier to teach”</italic> (Quintile 4 educator).</p>
                  </list-item>
                  <list-item>
                    <p>Also, lines 114-115 on page 6 of the initial manuscript states that "The purpose of this process evaluation was to identify and document patient, provider, and system barriers and facilitators...", however, the results and discussions did not present the barriers and facilitators, differentiating these levels. i will suggest the findings are categorized according to these levels. For example, which of these results are patient, provider barriers and/or facilitators, and which are systems barriers and/or facilitators.  </p>
