                <p id="Par1">Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (ASCT) improves survival in multiple myeloma (MM). However, many individuals are unable to collect optimal CD34<sup>+</sup> hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) numbers with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) mobilization. Motixafortide is a novel cyclic-peptide CXCR4 inhibitor with extended in vivo activity. The GENESIS trial was a prospective, phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study with the objective of assessing the superiority of motixafortide + G-CSF over placebo + G-CSF to mobilize HSPCs for ASCT in MM. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients collecting ≥6 × 10<sup>6</sup> CD34<sup>+</sup> cells kg<sup>–1</sup> within two apheresis procedures; the secondary endpoint was to achieve this goal in one apheresis. A total of 122 adult patients with MM undergoing ASCT were enrolled at 18 sites across five countries and randomized (2:1) to motixafortide + G-CSF or placebo + G-CSF for HSPC mobilization. Motixafortide + G-CSF enabled 92.5% to successfully meet the primary endpoint versus 26.2% with placebo + G-CSF (odds ratio (OR) 53.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) 14.12–201.33, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001). Motixafortide + G-CSF also enabled 88.8% to meet the secondary endpoint versus 9.5% with placebo + G-CSF (OR 118.0, 95% CI 25.36–549.35, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001). Motixafortide + G-CSF was safe and well tolerated, with the most common treatment-emergent adverse events observed being transient, grade 1/2 injection site reactions (pain, 50%; erythema, 27.5%; pruritis, 21.3%). In conclusion, motixafortide + G-CSF mobilized significantly greater CD34<sup>+</sup> HSPC numbers within two apheresis procedures versus placebo + G-CSF while preferentially mobilizing increased numbers of immunophenotypically and transcriptionally primitive HSPCs.

              <p id="Par3">Multiple myeloma (MM) is the second most common hematologic malignancy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, historically associated with median overall survival (OS) of 24–30 months. However, the development of high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT), immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs), proteasome inhibitors (PIs), anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and other novel therapies has greatly expanded therapeutic options for newly diagnosed MM. Currently, median OS exceeds 45–82 months with ASCT playing a central role in the treatment paradigm for MM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par4">Autologous stem cell transplantation in MM has been shown to improve event-free survival and OS compared with conventional chemotherapy alone in previously untreated standard-risk MM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. However, the effectiveness of ASCT relies, in part, on the ability to collect sufficient hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), typically from peripheral blood (PB). A minimum of ≥2 × 10<sup>6</sup> CD34<sup>+</sup> cells kg<sup>–1</sup> are necessary, while infusion of optimal numbers of ≥5–6 × 10<sup>6</sup> CD34<sup>+</sup> cells kg<sup>–1</sup> is associated with improved engraftment, disease-free survival and OS compared with lower transplant doses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Clinically, CD34 expression remains the most common immunophenotypic cell surface marker defining human HSPCs. However, multicolor fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) have illustrated the heterogeneous nature of CD34<sup>+</sup> HSPCs, identifying immunophenotypically and transcriptionally distinct CD34<sup>+</sup> subsets ranging from primitive hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) capable of long-term self-renewal and multilineage potential to relatively differentiated, lineage-committed progenitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par5">Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is widely considered the standard agent for PB HSPC mobilization. Nevertheless, despite the use of G-CSF in mobilization of HSPCs to the PB and after multiple days of apheresis, 40–50% of patients with MM remain unable to collect optimal numbers of HSPCs for ASCT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. The addition of chemotherapy to G-CSF may incrementally increase mobilization, but also prolongs HSPC mobilization with multiple apheresis days and chemotherapy-related toxicities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Meanwhile, protracted mobilization substantially increases the financial and logistical burden to both patients and the healthcare system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par6">The interaction between CXCL12 and its receptor, CXCR4, is critically involved in the retention of HSPCs within the bone marrow and blockade of CXCR4 mobilizes HSPCs to PB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Previous studies have shown the low-affinity (inhibitory constant (Ki), 652 nM), short-acting CXCR4i, plerixafor + G-CSF enhanced mobilization of CD34<sup>+</sup> HSPCs to PB compared with G-CSF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. However, despite up to eight injections of G-CSF, four injections of plerixafor and four apheresis procedures, 15–35% of patients remained unable to mobilize optimal HSPC numbers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Preclinical and clinical data suggest that CXCR4 expression on CD34<sup>+</sup> HSPC subsets is variable, with relatively lower CXCR4 expression on primitive CD34<sup>+</sup> HSCs and multipotent progenitors (MPPs) compared with higher expression on certain lineage-committed CD34<sup>+</sup> progenitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. These studies suggest that optimization of CXCR4 blockade may increase CD34<sup>+</sup> HSPC mobilization and mobilize differential HSPC subsets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par7">Motixafortide (BL-8040) is a selective cyclic-peptide inhibitor of CXCR4 with high affinity (Ki, 0.32 nM), long receptor occupancy and extended clinical activity (&gt;48 h)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. In a phase 1, two-part study (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02073019">NCT02073019</ext-link>), motixafortide administered to healthy subjects was safe, well tolerated and led to a sustained five- to seven-fold increase in PB CD34<sup>+</sup> HSPCs, enabling collection of a median of 11.2 × 10<sup>6</sup> CD34<sup>+</sup> cells kg<sup>–1</sup> in one leukapheresis. In another, single-arm, open-label, dose-escalation study (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01010880">NCT01010880</ext-link>), motixafortide administered before ASCT to patients with MM undergoing standard HSPC mobilization was safe, well tolerated and led to significant increases in PB CD34<sup>+</sup> HSPCs.</p>
              <p id="Par8">Therefore, this phase 3 study (GENESIS) was designed to compare the safety and efficacy of motixafortide + G-CSF versus placebo + G-CSF in patients with MM undergoing HSPC mobilization before ASCT (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03246529">NCT03246529</ext-link>). In addition, immunophenotypic and transcriptional profiling was performed via multicolor FACS and scRNA-seq of CD34<sup>+</sup> HSPCs mobilized on the GENESIS trial, as well as a contemporaneous, prospectively enrolled cohort of demographically similar patients with MM mobilized with plerixafor + G-CSF (protocol no. 201103349) and three cohorts of healthy, allogeneic HSPC donors (allo-donors) undergoing single-agent mobilization with motixafortide, plerixafor or G-CSF alone (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02639559">NCT02639559</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00241358">NCT00241358</ext-link>, protocol no. 201106261, respectively).</p>

Uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) clustering was performed, with cell identity determined by cross-referencing of gene expression profiles with previously published datasets and genes reported as reliable markers of lineage commitment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref><bold>–</bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.

                <p id="Par23">The proportion of each transcriptionally defined HSPC cluster in healthy allo-donors (mobilized with G-CSF, plerixafor or motixafortide alone) and in patients with MM (mobilized with placebo + G-CSF, plerixafor + G-CSF or motixafortide + G-CSF) was evaluated (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). Notably, healthy allo-donors receiving motixafortide alone mobilized a higher proportion of transcriptionally primitive HSC1 cells (25.73%) relative to both plerixafor (1.35%) and G-CSF (1.63%). In addition, allo-donors receiving CXCR4i mobilization with either motixafortide or plerixafor mobilized a higher proportion of MDP1 and MDP2 cells relative to those mobilized with G-CSF alone (MDP1, G-CSF 1.46% versus CXCR4i 9.78% and MDP2, G-CSF 0.31% versus CXCR4i 1.98%). By contrast, within the MM cohorts similar proportions of HSC2–6, CLPs and GMPs were mobilized across the three mobilization regimens. However, the large proportion of MLPs mobilized by all regimens in the allo-donor cohorts (33.56%) was notably lower in patients with MM mobilized with placebo + G-CSF (3.66%). However, this large population of MLPs was preserved when either motixafortide or plerixafor was added to G-CSF mobilization in patients with MM (26.18%), suggesting that MLPs may be uniquely reduced in the G-CSF mobilized HSPC graft of patients with MM and that the addition of CXCR4i with either motixafortide or plerixafor to G-CSF may preserve this population within the HSPC graft in those patients. Taken as a whole, these data suggest that the mobilization regimen used in both allo-donors and patients with MM has an important impact on the proportion of various HSPC subsets mobilized. In addition, the presence of underlying MM, recent exposure to MM-targeting therapies, advanced age or a combination of factors may further impact mobilization of particular HSPC subsets.</p>
                <p id="Par24">Differential gene expression (DEG) analysis across all subsets identified unique transcriptional profiles for each CD34<sup>+</sup> HSPC subset, with specific differences based on mobilization regimen (motixafortide versus plerixafor) and donor type (allo-donor versus patient with MM). Within the HSC1–6 and MLP populations in healthy allo-donors, the HSC1 population was preferentially mobilized at higher numbers by motixafortide compared with either plerixafor or G-CSF (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c,d</xref>). When comparing motixafortide with G-CSF or plerixafor-mobilized HSCs in the allo-donor cohort, we found <italic>EGR1</italic>, <italic>JUNB</italic>, <italic>NR4A1</italic>, <italic>IER2</italic> and <italic>RPS26</italic> to be notably upregulated, which has been associated with enhanced quiescence and self-renewal (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e,f</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. By plotting the expression of these markers relative to single-cell populations, most of the expression of these genes is driven by HSC1 and HSC5. Moreover, these genes have markedly higher expression in HSCs mobilized by the long-acting CXCR4i motixafortide relative to either the short-acting CXCR4i plerixafor or G-CSF alone. In addition, <italic>KAT7</italic> (HBO1), <italic>BMI1</italic>, <italic>PBX1</italic> and <italic>MEIS1</italic> and a related network of genes, which have been associated with HSC maintenance, quiescence and self-renewal, were highly expressed in the HSC5 population mobilized by motixafortide relative to plerixafor or G-CSF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Similarly, HSC2–6 cells mobilized in allo-donors with motixafortide, but not plerixafor or G-CSF, expressed increased levels of <italic>JUNB</italic> and <italic>NR4A1</italic>. By contrast, gene expression profiles of the HSC1–6 and MLP populations were more homogenous within the MM cohorts, potentially reflecting the impact of recent MM-targeting induction therapies on the bone marrow niche, as well as increased age and/or a pre-existing diagnosis of MM. Nevertheless, motixafortide + G-CSF preferentially mobilized a higher proportion of the transcriptionally primitive HSC1 population (31.42%) relative to either plerixafor + G-CSF (17.36%) or placebo + G-CSF (22.77%) in patients with MM.</p>
                <p id="Par25">Gene set enrichment analysis of upregulated genes in the primitive HSC1 population relative to other HSC/MLP populations indicated increased EGF- and TNF-α/NFκB-related signaling, which have been associated with hematopoietic regeneration and/or regenerative potential. Meanwhile, HSC5 expressed upregulated HBO1-related genes associated with self-renewal and quiescence relative to other HSC/MLP populations. To further evaluate EGF, TNF-α/NFκB and HBO1 pathway signaling within each HSC1–6 and MLP subset across patient/treatment/disease characteristics (allo-donor versus MM) and mobilization regimen, pathway expression scores were generated for each pathway (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">8</xref> and <xref rid="Sec11" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>). These data demonstrated numerically higher average levels of EGF-, TNF-α/NFκB- and HBO1-related gene expression with the use of the long-acting CXCR4i motixafortide as compared with short-acting CXCR4i with plerixafor or G-CSF alone, within most HSC1–6 and MLP subsets in healthy allo-donors, whereas the differences in gene expression scores for EGF-, TNF-α/NFκB- and HBO1-related genes in HSC1–6 and MLP subsets in the MM cohorts were relatively similar across mobilization regimens. In summary, extended CXCR4i with motixafortide mobilizes HSC populations, with upregulated gene expression profiles associated with enhanced self-renewal, quiescence and regeneration in healthy allo-donors.</p>

              <p id="Par26">The effectiveness of ASCT relies, in part, on the ability to collect an adequate number of HSPCs. The ‘ideal’ HSPC mobilization regimen would be rapid, robust, reliable, well tolerated and capable of safely mobilizing an optimal number of CD34<sup>+</sup> HSPCs in nearly 100% of patients in one apheresis day. Although G-CSF remains the most widely used mobilization agent, 40–50% of patients remain unable to collect an optimal number of HSPCs with G-CSF alone despite multiple injections and up to four apheresis days<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. In addition, 15–35% of patients remain unable to collect optimal numbers of cells despite up to eight injections of G-CSF, four injections of plerixafor and four apheresis days<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Therefore, the ideal mobilization regimen remains elusive. In addition, progressive improvements in transplant-related care have enabled ASCT to be safely performed in patients with MM ≥65 years of age, increasing from 11% of ASCTs in 2000 to 36% of ASCTs in 2019 (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>). Similarly, advances in induction therapy have established three-drug (IMiDs, PIs and glucocorticoids) and four-drug induction regimens (IMiD, PI, glucocorticoids and anti-CD38 mAbs) as the standard of care for newly diagnosed transplant-eligible patients with MM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. However, increased age, exposure to lenalidomide and four-drug induction therapy are all associated with impaired HSPC mobilization, further emphasizing the unmet need for more effective HSPC mobilization regimens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par27">In this international, phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, patients were representative of the typical MM population undergoing ASCT in the current era, with a median age of 63 years and 70% of patients receiving lenalidomide-containing induction therapy. Despite the presence of these risk factors for poor HSPC mobilization, 92.5% of patients treated with one injection of motixafortide + G-CSF collected ≥6 × 10<sup>6</sup> CD34<sup>+</sup> cells kg<sup>–1</sup> within two apheresis days versus 26.2% mobilized with placebo + G-CSF (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001). In addition, 88.8% of patients mobilized with motixafortide + G-CSF collected ≥6 × 10<sup>6</sup> CD34<sup>+</sup> cells kg<sup>–1</sup> in one apheresis day versus 9.5% with placebo + G-CSF (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001), with a median of 10.8 × 10<sup>6</sup> CD34<sup>+</sup> cells kg<sup>–1</sup> collected in one apheresis with motixafortide + G-CSF. By comparison, in a contemporary cohort of demographically similar patients with MM prospectively enrolled in parallel to the GENESIS trial and mobilized with plerixafor + G-CSF, 50.0% of patients collected optimal numbers of CD34<sup>+</sup> cells kg<sup>–1</sup> in one apheresis (median, 5.47 × 10<sup>6</sup> CD34<sup>+</sup> cells kg<sup>–1</sup>). Meanwhile, motixafortide + G-CSF was well tolerated with rapid and durable engraftment kinetics. Motixafortide + G-CSF as upfront HSPC mobilization also significantly reduced both G-CSF usage and the number of apheresis days required to collect the optimal number of HSPCs.</p>
              <p id="Par28">Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the efficacy of G-CSF alone, chemotherapy + G-CSF, plerixafor + G-CSF and motixafortide + G-CSF to mobilize optimal HSPC numbers (≥6 × 10<sup>6</sup> CD34<sup>+</sup> cells kg<sup>–1</sup>) in the current era of MM therapy are lacking. In addition, comparisons between the present study and previous trials should be undertaken with caution, acknowledging the limitations of cross-trial comparisons. The largest previous RCT comparing plerixafor + G-CSF with placebo + G-CSF in patients with MM was published in 2009, with a median patient age of 58 years and only 5.9% of patients receiving lenalidomide before HSPC mobilization. In the context of relatively younger patients with minimal lenalidomide exposure compared with current practice, 17.3% of patients in the placebo + G-CSF arm and 54.2% in the plerixafor + G-CSF arm mobilized to goal in one apheresis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Other contemporary studies commonly utilize pre-apheresis PB CD34<sup>+</sup> counts to screen for poor mobilizers, and add pre-emptive plerixafor mobilization in patients predicted to fail mobilization with G-CSF alone, making direct comparisons difficult<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Meanwhile, other studies targeted lower mobilization goals (≥2–3 × 10<sup>6</sup> CD34<sup>+</sup> cells kg<sup>–1</sup>), limited premobilization lenalidomide exposure, used alternative growth factors or allowed more than four apheresis days to collect to goal, again making direct comparisons difficult<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, most RCTs and nonrandomized interventional trials in patients with MM since the development of CXCR4is for HSPC mobilization have reported that currently available regimens frequently yield suboptimal CD34<sup>+</sup> numbers despite multiple injections and multiple days of apheresis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Thus it appears, based on these data, that a single injection of motixafortide added to G-CSF substantially improves on currently approved mobilization regimens in terms of the rapidity, robustness and reliability of HSPC mobilization for ASCT in patients newly diagnosed with MM following modern induction therapy in the current era.</p>
              <p id="Par29">There is also an increasing appreciation of the immunophenotypic and transcriptional heterogeneity of CD34<sup>+</sup> HSPCs, ranging from primitive HSCs capable of long-term self-renewal and multilineage potential down to differentiated, lineage-committed progenitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Moreover, the impact of extended CXCR4i with motixafortide relative to short-acting CXCR4i with plerixafor on graft composition remains incompletely understood. Previous studies evaluating PB HSPCs mobilized by plerixafor compared with those mobilized by G-CSF or collected from bone marrow in allo-donors demonstrated that plerixafor increased mobilization of strongly CXCR4<sup>+</sup>, lineage-committed plasmacytoid dendritic cell progenitors (pDCPs) comprising nearly 25% of the HSPC graft<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. We observed that motixafortide mobilized a similar proportion of pDCPs compared with plerixafor; but also mobilized a significantly higher number of combined HSCs, MPPs and CMPs compared with plerixafor. This unique impact of extended CXCR4i with motixafortide relative to short-acting CXCR4i with plerixafor may be due to the observation that these more primitive HSPC subsets are less strongly CXCR4<sup>+</sup> at baseline, and thus are preferentially mobilized at higher numbers by extended CXCR4i with motixafortide. Also of note, scRNA-seq suggests that extended CXCR4i with motixafortide in healthy allo-donors mobilizes transcriptionally unique subsets of HSCs (HSC1 and HSC5; Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), which exhibit upregulated transcriptional programing associated with enhanced self-renewal, regeneration and quiescence (<italic>EGR1</italic>, <italic>JUNB</italic>, <italic>BTG2</italic>, <italic>NR4A1</italic>, <italic>MYB</italic>, <italic>IER2</italic>, <italic>EGR3</italic>, <italic>BMI1</italic>, <italic>PBX1</italic>, <italic>MEIS1</italic> and <italic>KAT7</italic> (HBO1)). Recent work by Desterke et al. revealed that quiescence markers (<italic>EGR1</italic>, <italic>JUNB, BTG2</italic> and <italic>NR4A1</italic>) and other genes (<italic>MYB</italic> and <italic>IER2</italic>) were upregulated in long-lived HSCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. The self-renewal transcription factor <italic>EGR3</italic>, which suppresses cell cycle progression, is upregulated in motixafortide-treated clusters and is also highly expressed in primitive HSCs during leukemic transformation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Shepard et al. observed that HSCs in JAK2 mutant myeloproliferative neoplasms harbored defective self-renewal properties, while robust self-renewal capacity and HSC repopulation was noted when <italic>BMI1</italic>, <italic>PBX1</italic> or <italic>MEIS1</italic> were overexpressed within mutant myeloproliferative neoplasms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Additionally, Yang et al. observed that the histone lysine acetyltransferase <italic>KAT7</italic> (HBO1) and a related network of genes is necessary for HSC maintenance and self-renewal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par30">The clinical implications of the observed immunophenotypic and transcriptional heterogeneity within CD34<sup>+</sup> HSPC subsets mobilized with various regimens remain unclear. This study was not designed to evaluate how differences in the total number of CD34<sup>+</sup> cells infused, or the number of specific HSPC subsets infused, might impact clinical outcomes. In addition, given that extended immunophenotyping was performed on only a subset of patients mobilized at Washington University in St. Louis (<italic>n</italic> = 37), comparative analyses between cohorts are probably underpowered. Nevertheless, in a post hoc pooled analysis, a significant association was observed between increasing total number of CD34<sup>+</sup> cells infused and faster TPE. These data suggest that infusion of higher numbers of CD34<sup>+</sup> cells (≥7 × 10<sup>6</sup> CD34<sup>+</sup> cells kg<sup>–1</sup>) may result in faster TPE. This observation is supported by previous publications suggesting that infusion of &gt;6 × 10<sup>6</sup> CD34<sup>+</sup> cells kg<sup>–1</sup> is associated with improved long-term platelet recovery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. In addition, we observed that patients infused with the upper quartile (&gt;75th percentile) of GMPs alone had significantly faster TPE (13 versus 19 days). These data suggest that the number of GMPs within the HSPC graft specifically contributed to platelet engraftment kinetics, which may indicate that the CD34<sup>+</sup> HSPC subset immunophenotypically defined in this study as GMPs (CD45RA<sup>+</sup>/<sup>−</sup>CD123loCD38<sup>+</sup>/<sup>−</sup>CD10<sup>–</sup>) contains a population of megakaryocytic progenitors capable of rapidly reconstituting platelet engraftment. Based on our gating strategy, this observation is consistent with a recent report demonstrating that unipotent megakaryocyte progenitors lie within the CD34<sup>+</sup> CD38<sup>+</sup> CD45RA<sup>–</sup> population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par31">In conclusion, the upfront use of a single injection of motixafortide added to G-CSF resulted in rapid, robust and reliable mobilization of optimal numbers of CD34<sup>+</sup> HSPCs in patients with MM undergoing ASCT. Moreover, extended CXCR4i with motixafortide preferentially mobilized increased numbers of immunophenotypically and transcriptionally primitive HSCs. Future studies may consider similar regimens for HSPC-based, gene-edited platforms where the optimal HSPC collection goal is typically much higher (10–15 × 10<sup>6</sup> CD34<sup>+</sup> cells kg<sup>–1</sup>) than that of ASCT (5–6 × 10<sup>6</sup> CD34<sup>+</sup> cells kg<sup>–1</sup>), given losses of HSPC-viability-associated gene/base editing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. In addition, regimens mobilizing higher proportions of primitive HSCs may be particularly advantageous for HSPC-based, gene-edited therapies given that the long-term effectiveness of such therapies relies on the successful ability of modified HSPCs to establish stable, long-term engraftment.</p>

                <p id="Par33">The GENESIS trial included a preplanned, lead-in, single-arm, open-label period previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>, demonstrating that motixafortide + G-CSF was safe, well tolerated and resulted in 82% (9 of 11) of patients with MM mobilizing ≥6 × 10<sup>6</sup> CD34<sup>+</sup> cells kg<sup>–1</sup> within two apheresis days. The preplanned review of these Part 1 data led the independent data monitoring committee (DMC) to recommend transitioning to Part 2 of the study. In the prospective, phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter Part 2 of the study, 122 patients undergoing ASCT were enrolled at 18 sites across five countries and were randomized 2:1 to receive either motixafortide + G-CSF or placebo + G-CSF for HSPC mobilization before ASCT for MM. Key eligibility criteria included: patients 18–78 years of age with a confirmed diagnosis of MM; an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0–1; and adequate organ function undergoing first ASCT in first or second complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) (according to IMWG Response Criteria). Sex and/or gender were recorded for demographic purposes, as self-reported by the participant. Patients were excluded if they had undergone prior HCT or failed previous HSPC collection attempts (see full inclusion and exclusion criteria in supplemental GENESIS trial protocol). Randomization of eligible patients was performed using an interactive web response system and was conducted in permuted blocks with stratification by response status (CR versus PR) and baseline platelet count (&lt;200 × 10<sup>9</sup> l<sup>–1</sup> or ≥200 × 10<sup>9</sup> l<sup>–1</sup>). Randomization was performed by the clinical research coordinator, who was not involved in direct patient care. All patients, investigators and providers/staff were blinded to treatment assignment. All patients received G-CSF (10 mcg kg<sup>–1</sup>) on days 1–5 (and 6–8, if needed). Patients received either motixafortide (1.25 mg kg<sup>–1</sup>, subcutaneous injection) or placebo on day 4 (and 6, if needed). Apheresis began on day 5 (four blood volumes), with the primary and secondary endpoints of collecting ≥6 × 10<sup>6</sup> CD34<sup>+</sup> cells kg<sup>–1</sup> in up to two or one apheresis days, respectively. Apheresis continued on days 6–8 if needed. Total CD34<sup>+</sup> cells kg<sup>–1</sup> were analyzed locally to determine whether patients met the primary endpoint, and all samples were subsequently sent for assessment by a central laboratory. Patients who did not collect ≥2 × 10<sup>6</sup> CD34<sup>+</sup> cells kg<sup>–1</sup> by day 8 proceeded to rescue mobilization. To assess the impact of each mobilization regimen on PB CD34<sup>+</sup> cells and the relationship to collection of CD34<sup>+</sup> HSPCs via apheresis, peripheral blood CD34<sup>+</sup> HSPC counts were assessed using both local and central laboratories at the following time points: day 0 (baseline), before first dose of G-CSF; day 4, before first dose of motixafortide/placebo but after four doses of G-CSF; and day 5 (apheresis day 1), after first administration of motixafortide or placebo and after five administrations of G-CSF. The number of CD34<sup>+</sup> cells infused for ASCT was determined independently by each investigator according to local practice; however, a minimum of ≥2 × 10<sup>6</sup> CD34<sup>+</sup> cells kg<sup>–1</sup> was required. Although initial power calculations called for 177 patients to be enrolled in Part 2 of the study, a preplanned interim analysis after 122 patients were enrolled was performed by an independent unblinded statistician and these results were communicated only to the independent DMC for review, leading the DMC to recommend halting the study due to statistically significant efficacy favoring the motixafortide + G-CSF mobilized cohort (prespecified threshold <italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.0108678).</p>

The proportion of patients collecting to the stated CD34+ cell/kg targets are presented with odds ratio (OR), 2-sided 95% confidence intervals (CI) and p-values based on CMH analysis on an intent-to-treat basis. Median numbers of CD34+ cells/kg collected and infused are presented as median values with range (minimum, maximum); but without comparative statistics as this was not a pre-specified analysis. Time-to-engraftment was assessed by Kaplan-Meier analysis and is presented as the median time to event with 2-sided 95% CI and p-values. Graft durability was assessed by CMH, as previously described, and presented with OR, 2-sided 95% CI and p-value. Progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) was assessed using Cox’s proportional hazard’s model and is presented as proportion not meeting event at 1-year with hazard ratio (HR), two-sided CI and p-values. A hierarchical method for multiple endpoint testing was utilized to control for multiple comparisons. The final column represents the apheresis and clinical outcomes observed in the contemporaneous MM cohort mobilized with plerixafor+G-CSF on a separate, prospective protocol conducted in parallel to the GENESIS Trial. Statistical comparisons between primary/secondary endpoints for patients mobilized on the GENESIS Trial and those mobilized with plerixafor+G-CSF were not pre-planned; nor performed.</p>
