                <p id="Par1">Poor tissue penetration remains a major challenge for antibody-based therapeutics of solid tumors, but proper dosing can improve the tissue penetration and thus therapeutic efficacy of these biologics. Due to dose-limiting toxicity of the small molecule payload, antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are administered at a much lower dose than their parent antibodies, which further reduces tissue penetration. We conducted an early-phase clinical trial (NCT02415881) and previously reported the safety of an antibody-dye conjugate (panitumumab-IRDye800CW) as primary outcome. Here, we report a retrospective exploratory analysis of the trial to evaluate whether co-administration of an unconjugated antibody could improve the intratumoral distribution of the antibody-dye conjugate in patients. By measuring the multiscale distribution of the antibody-dye conjugate, this study demonstrates improved microscopic antibody distribution without increasing uptake (toxicity) in healthy tissue when co-administered with the parent antibody, supporting further clinical investigation of the co-administration dosing strategy to improve the tumor penetration of ADCs.</p>

              <p id="Par3">Antibody-based therapeutics comprise the largest portion of the growing number of anticancer drugs. However, poor tissue penetration remains a major hurdle limiting the efficacy of these biologics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Proper dosing of antibody-based biologics is an important factor in improving tissue penetration and thus therapeutic efficacy for treating solid tumors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Antibody–drug conjugates (ADCs), which combine the antigen specificity of antibody and the potency of cytotoxic agents, are an emerging class of antibody bioconjugates that could benefit from improved tissue penetration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Owing to the dose-limiting toxicities of the potent cytotoxic payload, ADCs are usually administered at a much lower dose with narrower therapeutic window compared to their parent antibodies, which may result in decreased penetration into solid tumors. Even with serial dosing, the continuous internalization of the ADC can prevent delivery to all cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. To date, ~100 ADCs are being tested in over 400 clinical trials. Of the nine FDA approved ADCs, ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) was the only approved agent for solid tumors until recently (with enfortumab vedotin-ejfv, fam-trastuzumab-deruxtecan-nxki, and sacituzumab govitecan-hziy gaining approval between December 2019 and April 2020), whereas the remaining agents treat hematological malignancies. Dosing strategies that maximize tumor penetration and minimize delivery to off-target tissue (toxicity) could expand the therapeutic window of ADCs and improve their therapeutic benefit.</p>
              <p id="Par4">There is clinical precedence that manipulating dosing strategies can mitigate ADC toxicity. For example, administration of a lower dose of gemtuzumab ozogamicin at a higher frequency produces less toxicity and improves tolerability, such as lower thrombocytopenia and fewer abnormal liver function indicators<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. In another clinical trial, reducing the weekly dosing of coltuximab ravtansine to once every 2 weeks lowered the toxicity to nervous system and ocular toxicities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Although reducing the dose and increasing dosing frequency improves tolerability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, the lower plasma concentrations can result in lower tumor uptake, which affects therapeutic results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Furthermore, intratumoral drug distribution remains unknown since changes to dosing strategies are typically only measured from plasma that does not necessarily reflect intratumoral drug levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par5">An alternative ADC-dosing strategy proposes that co-administration of the parent or unlabeled antibody (loading dose or LD) with the ADC compound could overcome the binding site barrier of antibodies and thus improve the distribution of ADCs within the tumor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. In preclinical studies, trastuzumab has been administered with a therapeutic dose of T-DM1 at a ratio of 0:1, 1:1, 3:1, and 8:1 into tumor-bearing mice. Using the co-administration strategies, T-DM1 penetrated beyond the perivascular region to tumor areas further away from the vasculature, and the improved penetration also resulted in better therapeutic efficacies. Moreover, the benefit of this dosing strategy in high-antigen expression tumors was confirmed in a more recent preclinical study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. However, as a mouse model cannot recapitulate the complexity of human tumors, the clinical utility of this dosing strategy remains unknown. Clinical validation is critical to elucidate the potential impact of a loading dose and to quantify, to what extent, if any, it improves the tissue penetration. If this dosing strategy works in human patients, this could have a major impact on the ADC development given the dose-limiting toxicities of these agents and the number of clinical trials on ADCs.</p>
              <p id="Par6">Although poor tissue penetration has been recognized as a bottleneck for antibody-based therapeutics for decades, it has only recently been characterized with cellular resolution in human tumors by our group, using a near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence-labeled antibody (panitumumab-IRDye800CW) as an imaging tool<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. This early-phase clinical trial (NCT02415881) provided a suitable dataset to test the preclinical hypothesis that a loading dose of antibody could improve the microscopic distribution of the antibody–dye conjugate in a clinical setting. The primary outcome of this trial was pre-defined as the safety profile of panitumumab-IRDye800CW and was previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Here, we report a retrospective ad hoc analysis of the clinical trial to evaluate the co-administration dosing strategy in the clinic. We hypothesize that the fluorescently labeled antibody might be used as a surrogate to measure the intratumoral distribution of ADCs. The rationale is that as long as the fluorophore or the cytotoxic drug is conjugated appropriately (not dramatically change the binding site or physicochemical properties), it has minimal influence on the pharmacokinetics and tissue penetration of the antibody. Our previous studies have demonstrated that the pharmacokinetics and toxicity of antibody–dye conjugates (i.e., panitumumab-IRDye800CW and cetuximab-IRDye800CW) mirror the parent antibody in macaques and human patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. It has also been reported that proper conjugation of a parent antibody without too many drug payloads resulted in a similar pharmacokinetics to the parent antibody<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. In the current study, we comprehensively evaluate the impact of co-administering the unconjugated antibody on the uptake and distribution of the antibody–dye conjugate at both the macroscopic and microscopic levels in clinical tumors. This study demonstrates improved intratumoral distribution of the antibody–dye conjugate with lower uptake in healthy tissue when co-administered with a loading dose of the parent antibody, which support the possibility of applying the co-administration dosing strategy to ADCs to expand their therapeutic window in solid tumors in the clinic.</p>

                <title>Heterogeneity of intratumoral antibody–dye distribution</title>
                <p id="Par10">Sub-saturating doses of systemic antibody resulted in heterogeneous distribution of the antibody–dye conjugate within the entire tumor mass and microscopically within tumor nests (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). In large tumors, antibody delivery to the tumor interior was substantially lower than the periphery (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>), despite the homogenous EGFR expression across the tumor (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>). The fluorescence intensity plot (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>) showed a slowly decreasing trend as the tumor cells were further away from the edge of the tumor mass, which was previously shown to be correlated with the higher vessel density and lower stromal density at the perphery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, and elevated interstitial pressure in the interior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. At the microscopic level, we noted varying degrees of antibody diffusion into the tumor nests despite consistent EGFR expression (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b, c</xref>). The saturation of the tumor nests depended on their location relative to the edge of the tumor mass. At sub-saturating doses (consistent with ADC dosing), the peripheral tumor nests showed constant fluorescence intensity across the tumor nest, whereas more centrally located tumor nests had gradually decreasing fluorescence as distance from the edge of the tumor nests increased (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3f</xref>). The negative correlation between drug delivery and distance from the tumor edge at the microscopic and macroscopic level suggests that antibody first saturates peripherally located receptors. Although distribution is clearly heterogeneous, the distinct pattern of antibody penetration into tumors at the microscopic scale supports the development of a stalled saturation front in tumors due to plasma clearance and/or local tumor cell consumption<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, often referred to as the “binding site barrier”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><title>Antibody–dye distribution demonstrated both macroscopic and microscopic heterogeneity within the solid tumor.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Antibody–dye uptake (NIR: near-infrared) was higher in the tumor periphery or edge (especially the epithelium) than that in the tumor interior (Scale bar: 2 mm). <bold>b</bold>, <bold>c</bold> Antibody penetrated deeper into tumor nests located close to the edge of the bulk tumor than tumor nests located further away from the tumor edge, which was not attributable to EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) expression (Scale bar: 50 μm). <bold>d</bold> EGFR expression level is similar across the entire tumor (Scale bar: 2 mm). <bold>e</bold> The fluorescence intensity negatively correlated with increasing distance from the edge of the bulk tumor. <bold>f</bold> The fluorescence intensity plot depicted varying degree of antibody penetration into tumor nests: 1. fully saturated tumor nests at the periphery; 2. partially saturated tumor nests; 3. poorly penetrated tumor nests at the center of the tumor.

                <p id="Par11">After whole-tumor reconstruction using individual 5 mm thick tissue sections (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>), we were able to quantify the fluorescence distribution over the entire tumor using macroscopic imaging. We found that the tumor mean fluorescence intensity (MFI), interquartile range (IQR), entropy, and uniformity in the LD group were similar to those in the non-LD group (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b–e</xref>). Next, we analyzed fluorescence distribution from the microscopic imaging of 5 µm histological slides (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4f</xref>). Although tumor MFI in the LD were similar to that in the non-LD group, the IQR and entropy of fluorescence signal over the tumor area of histology slides was significantly lower in the LD group than the non-LD group, whereas the uniformity of the LD group was significantly higher than that of the non-LD group (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4g–j</xref>). These data suggested that co-administration of unlabeled antibody did not decrease the uptake of antibody–dye conjugate, but rather improved the homogeneity of antibody distribution across the tumor, which can only be measured by microscopic imaging but not the macroscopic imaging. Furthermore, factors that we and others have correlated with antibody delivery, including the vessel area fraction, EGFR area fraction, α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA) area fraction (activated stromal density), and tumor size, were not significantly different between the two groups (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4k–n</xref>).

                <p id="Par12">To quantitatively compare the antibody penetration between the two dosing cohorts, we divided each tumor into small square regions and measured the antibody penetration in each square region as the ratio of NIR fluorescence-positive area to EGFR-positive area, and plotted a heatmap to visualize its distribution (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). When quantifying the overall antibody penetration, as measured by the ratio of NIR to EGFR over the entire tumor area, no difference was found between the LD and non-LD dosing groups (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>). However, when taking into account the micro-regional variations using the square regions, the IQR of region-based antibody penetration ratio across the tumor section was significantly lower in patients receiving a loading dose compared with the patients in the non-LD group (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>) and the Pearson’s correlation coefficient between the fluorescence and the EGFR expression of the square regions across each tumor was significantly higher in the LD than the non-LD dose group (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>). Moreover, the antibody penetration ratio of neighboring regions were significantly more correlated in tumors receiving the LD dose compared to tumors in the non-LD dose group (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5e</xref>). All these metrics indicated reduced heterogeneity of antibody distribution in the LD group. Furthermore, if we decrease the current square size by twofold, the antibody distribution in the LD is still significantly lower than the non-LD group (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1a</xref>). However, if we increase the current square size by twofold, there is no statistically significant differences in antibody distribution per square between the LD and non-LD group any more (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1c</xref>), suggesting that the improved distribution is “averaged over” and the squares measure the macroscopic distribution, which is not expected to differ.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><title>Antibody–dye has more homogenous spatial distribution across tumor when co-administered with the unlabeled antibody.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Each tumor was gridded into small square regions and antibody penetration within each square region was quantified as the ratio of fluorescent positive area to EGFR-positive area. <bold>b</bold> The ratio of fluorescence to EGFR over the entire tumor area was not significantly different between the LD and non-LD group (Scale bar: 5 mm). <bold>c</bold>–<bold>e</bold> Comparison of three metrics, including interquartile range (IQR), Pearson’s correlation coefficient between fluorescence and EGFR expression and CLCM correlation, all reflected less heterogeneity in antibody penetration across tumors in patients with loading dose (*<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05; ns: <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05). <bold>f</bold>, <bold>g</bold> Co-administration of parent antibody could overcome binding site barrier and improve antibody–dye distribution within the tumors. <bold>f</bold> As fluorescent antibody extravasates from blood vessels (red tube), it immediately binds EGFR in the tissue (represented by cells in the cube). <bold>g</bold> By co-administering non-fluorescent antibody, the same amount of fluorescent antibody reaches the tissue, but these antibodies compete for binding sites locally in the tissue.

                <title>Slight downward trend in tumor uptake with increasing doses</title>
                <p id="Par14">In preclinical models, tumor uptake measured by percent injected dose per gram (%ID g<sup>−1</sup>) was predicted to remain constant prior to saturation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Consistent with this prediction, when sub-saturating doses of antibody–dye were delivered, the loading dose did not affect the MFI of both macroscopic and microscopic imaging. Although tumor uptake in %ID kg<sup>−1</sup> showed a slight downward trend with higher doses of total antibody (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>), this trend disappeared when normalizing by vessel area fraction (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>), which suggests that this was caused by the variations in vessel density between the two groups. However, we have observed more frequent saturation of the tumor nests located at the tumor periphery in the LD group (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c–e</xref>) compared with the non-LD group (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6f–h</xref>), suggesting an alternative possibility that regional saturation of tumor cell nests in the periphery allowed washout in this area while cells in the tumor core remained untargeted. Antibodies can theoretically diffuse ~1 mm before washing out of the tumor if they are in a saturated region with no binding sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.

The recent FDA approval of five ADCs in nine months provides new hope for realizing Paul Ehrlich’s magic bullet<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. In particular, the multiple mechanisms of action of ADCs, from both the antibody and payload<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, have the potential to drive strong immune responses and pair with immune checkpoint inhibitors (as seen with the promising 73.3% overall response rate (ORR) in urothelial carcinoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>). However, owing to dose-limiting toxicity of the small molecular payload, ADCs are usually administered at a much lower dose than their parent antibody and their efficacy is significantly limited by the binding site barrier that leads to inadequate tissue penetration. Several notable failures of ADCs have occurred over the past few years, but the recent success of four different ADCs for solid tumor indications is notable owing to the higher antibody doses in these regimens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Presumably, higher antibody doses could increase tissue penetration, but current methods for imaging, such as positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), do not have sufficient resolution to measure intratumoral antibody distribution in the clinic. Here, we use a NIR fluorescently labeled antibody, originally developed for intraoperative imaging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, to track the intratumoral distribution of antibody at single-cell resolution. We demonstrated that co-administration of the parent antibody with the antibody–dye conjugate significantly improved the distribution of the antibody–dye conjugate in human patients while lowering uptake in healthy tissue. Our previous data suggested that injecting unconjugated antibody can saturate the antibody sink, and prolong imaging time window<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. However, there was no measurable benefit of using a loading dose in terms of increasing tumor-to-background ratio for surgical imaging. The current study shows that a loading dose can be beneficial in reducing the binding site barrier and increasing tissue penetration of antibody–dye conjugates, which supports the possibility for applying the same dosing strategy for ADCs that warrant further clinical investigation.</p>
              <p id="Par16">The macroscopic uptake of an antibody therapeutic at a given tumor region (e.g., tumor periphery vs interior) is driven by its vascularity or the permeability surface area product (independent of the loading dose)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, whereas the microscopic distribution is dependent on the amount of binding sites available for a given antibody<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Because antibodies bind to their targets much faster than they diffuse, their penetration in tumor tissue is severely limited (e.g., the “binding site barrier”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>). Prior to a saturating dose of antibody (which was not achieved here), this limits the impact of a loading dose to improving penetration on the microscopic scale. By adding the loading dose, we are not changing the fluorescent antibody uptake in a given region, but we are blocking some binding sites so that fluorescent antibody can penetrate deeper into the tumor cell nest, overcoming the “binding site barrier” and leading to improved antibody distribution in the tumor at the microscopic level despite minimal change at the macroscopic (e.g., whole tumor) scale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. We also noted that given the large intratumoral heterogeneity of clinical tumors (e.g., the tumor morphology and vessel density), the improvements in distribution are more difficult to detect by eye than in more uniform preclinical animal models. Therefore, we developed image analysis techniques to quantify the relative changes of the intratumoral antibody distribution and penetration. Importantly, both preclinical<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> and clinical studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> showed that even when the improvement in microscopic distribution is hard to detect by eye, the improved antibody penetration still has significant impact in therapeutic efficacy. In theory, if the antibody dose is high enough, the antibody will reach all (accessible) binding sites within the tumor and saturate both the interior and periphery of the tumor, which has been shown in preclinical studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. However, the limitation of doing a clinical study is that we cannot inject any dose of antibody–dye into the patients. With the clinically acceptable low doses of antibody–dye (consistent with ADC clinical dosing), we successfully demonstrated that statistically significant improvement of distribution and penetration can be detected at the microscopic scale, but not at the macroscopic scale. This proof-of-principle study is an important first step towards translating the dosing strategy into the clinic.</p>
              <p id="Par17">To quantify antibody distribution, we chose a more empirical approach rather than mechanistic analysis. Because of the limitations, such as fixed tissue requiring alignment of adjacent slices for EGFR, vessels and fluorescent antibody, and the heterogeneous morphology of the tissue, etc., a mechanistic modeling approach is challenging. Therefore, we opted for a more empirical approach (which uses more image processing and fewer model assumptions) to validate the improved microscopic distribution. Although a variety of quantitative metrics have been reported in the literature to measure tumor heterogeneity, there are no standardized metrics and the selection of heterogeneity measurements depends on the specific problem at hand<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. For example, in this study, we chose IQR, which is defined as the 1st quartile subtracted from the 3rd quartile<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>, because it is a measure of statistical dispersion and can be used to describe the overall extent of the fluorescence intensity distribution (i.e., antibody–dye distribution); we chose entropy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup> because it is a statistical measure of randomness/uncertainty in the image values and reflect the diversity of the fluorescence intensity distribution (i.e., antibody–dye distribution). We also used the uniformity because it measures the degree of uniformity or homogeneity in fluorescence intensity distribution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par18">Although this study showed similarities with preclinical studies in terms of healthy tissue uptake, it showed a slightly decreasing trend in tumor uptake (%ID kg<sup>−1</sup>), which was different from preclinical prediction and suggested the inherent complexity in human tumors. One possibility is owing to variations in vessel density since the decreasing trend in tumor uptake disappeared after normalizing by vessel area fraction. An alternative hypothesis that could not be completely ruled out by the data is regional saturation of tumor cell nests in the periphery allowed washout in this area while cells in the tumor core remained untargeted, suggesting that both the microscopic distribution (binding site barrier) and macroscopic distribution (periphery vs interior) interact to determine the overall tumor uptake (%ID kg<sup>−1</sup>). Additional data, collected with different antigen targets in diverse tumor types, can shed light on this issue. Taken together, our study suggests that co-administration strategy would decrease off-target uptake and toxicity to healthy tissue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup> while maintaining tumor uptake and improving distribution.</p>
              <p id="Par19">This study highlights the tumor distribution of therapeutic antibodies at clinically relevant doses (consistent with ADC dose) at subcellular resolution. Molecular imaging of radiolabeled antibodies has provided insight into the dosing and distribution on a macroscopic scale, but the inherent spatial limitations of PET and SPECT do not yield cellular resolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. Autoradiography is another way to study the biodistribution of radiolabeled antibodies in biological samples. However, it has several limitations for measuring antibody microdistribution compared with fluorescently labeled antibodies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. These include the lack of cellular resolution (at typical specific activities and relevant antibody doses), the risk of exposing patients to radioactivity, challenges in quantification due to artifacts, and extremely long exposure times (e.g., for tritiated samples) required to accumulate enough signal (on the orders of days to months), etc. However, it is at the cellular level that antibodies engage their target, traffic through the endocytotic machinery, interact with immune cells, and generally perform their pharmacodynamic function. The cellular distribution is critical to this role as demonstrated by preclinical models. It is also consistent with clinical data, such as the increase in response rate of an anti-MUC16 ADC from 17% ORR to 45% ORR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> when the antibody dose was increased from 2.4 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> to 5.2 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> (although the drug to antibody ratio was decreased from 3.5 to 2, which maintained a similar cytotoxic payload dose). However, cellular distribution is typically not available during these trials. Therefore, the ability to measure this distribution in human tumors in early-phase clinical development, while technically challenging, could help advance the clinical translation of antibody-based therapeutics.</p>
              <p id="Par20">NIR fluorescence imaging is advancing as an intraoperative procedure to guide precision tumor resection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. Many of the same antibodies are used for imaging and therapy, providing a unique opportunity to track their distribution at the single-cell resolution. Although the antibody–dye conjugate (panitumumab-IRDye800CW) was used as a surrogate for ADC delivery, there are several similarities between the two: both panitumumab and trastuzumab (the parent antibody of trastuzumab emtansine and trastuzumab deruxtecan) bind to targets that belong to the ErbB family (EGFR/HER1 and HER2, respectively), and both receptor expression levels are high. Furthermore, the large size of the antibody generally controls the pharmacokinetics of antibody–dye and ADCs. Both drug conjugation and fluorescent labeling are often conducted with the goal of minimizing any impact on plasma clearance and distribution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par21">This work shows that antibody dose can have a major impact on microscopic distribution. These differences would go undetected at the macroscopic level, such as via PET imaging. PET and SPECT provide non-invasive dynamic imaging and whole-body antibody distribution, but they cannot capture cellular detail. The macroscopic NIR imaging showed the same total tumor uptake of antibody, the metric captured by PET and SPECT given the several millimeter spatial resolution. In contrast, microscopic analysis indicated significant differences in the tissue and cellular distribution, below the resolution of clinical scanners but important for efficacy, suggesting the complementary nature of optical molecular imaging and nuclear imaging to measure antibody distribution.</p>
              <p id="Par22">In summary, given the safety of NIR imaging (no ionizing radiation), high sensitivity (detectable at therapeutic to sub-therapeutic doses), and ability to capture multiscale distribution within the tumor, NIR imaging could be a valuable tool in the development of antibody-based therapeutics. With the antibody–dye conjugates serving as a surrogate for ADCs, these results support the pursuit of higher antibody doses with ADCs to improve tissue penetration and expand the therapeutic window of ADCs.</p>

                <p id="Par23">A non-randomized prospective dose-ranging study was performed in patients with biopsy-proven HNSCC that were scheduled for surgical resection of the primary tumor for curative intent. The study protocol was approved by the Stanford University Institutional Review Board and the FDA (NCT 02415881), and written informed consent was obtained from all patients. The study was performed in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975 and its amendments, FDA’s ICH-GCP guidelines, and the laws and regulations of the United States. A total of 24 patients met eligibility criteria and were enrolled in this study between 09/2016-03/2018. Patients in this study received intravenous infusion of a total antibody dose of 0.3 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> to 2.6 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> (including both panitumumab and panitumumab-IRDye800CW) 1–5 days prior to surgery. More specifically, the loading dose cohort received an intravenous infusion of 100 mg of panitumumab followed by 0.5 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> or 1 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> of panitumumab-IRDye800CW, whereas patients in the non-loading dose cohort received an intravenous infusion of 25 mg or 50 mg of panitumumab-IRDye800CW. Specifically, panitumumab was intravenously administrated over 1 hour followed by a 15 min observation period. Thereafter panitumumab-IRDye800CW was intravenously administered over 1 hour also followed by 1 hour of monitoring. Because of the slow uptake of antibodies in tumor tissue and continual internalization by cells, very little antibody reaches the tumor prior to administration of the antibody–dye conjugate 15 minutes later. Therefore, the sequential administration of panitumumab and panitumumab-800CW is effectively co-administration.</p>
                <p id="Par24">The primary outcome of the clinical trial (NCT 02415881) was pre-defined as the safety profile of panitumumab-IRDye800CW. The secondary outcomes were pre-defined as (1) the efficacy of panitumumab-IRdye800CW to identify cancer compared with surrounding normal tissue and (2) the optimal timing of the surgical procedure to maximize the tumor to background ratio. These outcomes have been previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. The current study is a retrospective ad hoc analysis using the clinical data set from the same clinical trial. The objective of the current study is to evaluate whether a loading dose of an unconjugated antibody could improve the microscopic distribution of an antibody–dye conjugate in a clinical setting.</p>

In brief, serial histology tissue sections were cut from a representative tissue block of each patient, with one slide stained for H&amp;E, two slides immunohistologically stained with EGFR (pre-diluted), αSMA (dilution 1:1000), and ERG (ETS-related gene, a nuclear transcription factor stain for endothelial cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>; dilution 1:1000), and one slide for fluorescence microscopic imaging to characterize the microscopic antibody distribution. In brief, the micro-sections were dewaxed with xylene and rehydrated through gradient ethanol into water, followed by 4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole nuclei staining. The whole-tumor region within each micro section was then scanned by a customized NIR fluorescence microscope (Leica Microsystems Inc. Chicago, IL) using the tile scan function with a NIR filter (excitation/emission: 774 nm/789 nm) at a resolution of 0.65 µm/pixel. Individual tiles were stitched into a single large mosaic image for subsequent analysis.
