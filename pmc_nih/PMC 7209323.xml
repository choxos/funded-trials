At baseline and 3-month evaluations, CFA (72-hour stool, weighed food record) and height (HAZ), weight (WAZ) and BMI (BMIZ) Z-scores were calculated. Fasting plasma fatty acid (FA) concentrations were also measured.</p>

                  <p>Subjects in the low CFA subgroup had significantly improved CFA (+7.5±7.2%, mean 86.3±6.7, p = 0.002), and reduced stool fat loss (-5.7±7.2 g/24 hours) following three months of Encala<sup>TM</sup> treatment. These subjects also had increased plasma linoleic acid (+20%), α-linolenic acid (+56%), and total FA (+20%) (p≤0.005 for all) concentrations and improvements in HAZ (0.06±0.08), WAZ (0.17±0.16), and BMIZ (0.20±0.25) (p≤0.002 for all). CFA and FA were unchanged with placebo in the low CFA group, with some WAZ increases (0.14±0.24, p = 0.02).

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>The treatment of dietary fat malabsorption to optimize growth and nutritional status in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and pancreatic insufficiency (PI) is a key challenging component of standard clinical care[<xref rid="pone.0232685.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Although CFTR modulators have shown great promise improving nutritional status[<xref rid="pone.0232685.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], there is limited evidence on the effect of modulators on fat absorption. One study reported an improvement in fat absorption with Ivacaftor therapy[<xref rid="pone.0232685.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], but there are no data in individuals with more severe (non-gating) mutations. Even with recommended doses of pancreatic enzyme medications, residual dietary fat malabsorption is common and contributes to weight and stature growth faltering in children and poor weight status in adults. These conditions are associated with a decline in lung function and reduced survival[<xref rid="pone.0232685.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0232685.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. To address this clinical need, a readily absorbable structured lipid technology (Encala™ [previously LYM-X-SORB™], Envara Health, Wayne, PA) was developed and tested as an oral nutritional supplement to increase dietary fat absorption and to increase effective caloric intake. Encala™ was evaluated in a randomized placebo controlled trial[<xref rid="pone.0232685.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] that reported the supplement was safe and well tolerated in children and adolescents with CF and PI, and treatment improved dietary fat absorption, growth, choline and essential fatty acid (FA) status in the participants over 12 months of treatment [<xref rid="pone.0232685.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0232685.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The objective of this subgroup analysis was to determine if the effect of three months of Encala™ treatment varied by subject degree of dietary fat malabsorption at baseline.</p>

              <sec id="sec010">
                <title>Design</title>
                <p>In this double-blind placebo-controlled study, subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to daily supplementation to be consumed as part of each meal and snack with either Encala™ or placebo. The random allocation sequence was generated by the CHOP research pharmacy who assigned participants to groups with stratification for age and sex; the rest of the research team was blinded to treatment allocation. Encala™ powder was mixed with a wide range of participant-selected foods and beverages and was comprised of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), monoglycerides and fatty acids. LPC is water-soluble, does not require lipase for digestion/absorption of associated fatty acids and generally fosters lipid absorption in the upper gastrointestinal tract [<xref rid="pone.0232685.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0232685.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Encala™ was complexed to sugar and wheat flour, to provide a taste neutral, dissolvable powder. The placebo was a powder of similar appearance, taste and consistency, composed of trans-fat free vegetable shortening, flaxseed triglyceride, and sunflower triglyceride. The placebo and Encala™ had similar calories (152 kcal/32g packet), total fat (5.4g/32g packet), and macronutrient distribution (protein 6%, carbohydrate 58%, lipid 34% kcal). Subjects age 5.0–11.9 years received two packets/d (64 g powder) providing 304 kcal/d, and age subjects 12.0–17.9 years received three packets/day (96 g powder) providing 456 kcal/d. Both Encala™ and placebo were provided in sealed packages with identical appearances so participants and staff were blinded to group assignment. All subjects continued their pancreatic enzyme regime and other aspects of care (medications, physical therapy, and diet) as prescribed by their CF center.</p>
                <p>All study visits were conducted at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) at baseline, three, and 12 months and the protocol was approved by the CHOP Institutional Review Board (IRB) and each participating CF Center (Eastern Virginia Medical School IRB, Children’s National Medical Center IRB, Yale University School of Medicine IRB, University of Virginia IRB, Schneider Children’s Hospital IRB (now: Cohen Children’s Medical Center), St. Joseph’s Children’s Hospital IRB, and Monmouth Medical Center IRB). The data from the baseline and three-month visits were selected for this analysis. This protocol was registered as Study of Lym-X-Sorb (Encala™) to Improve Fatty Acid and Choline Status in Children with Cystic Fibrosis and Pancreatic Insufficiency, NCT00406536.</p>
                <p>Pulmonary function was assessed and predicted percentage FEV<sub>1</sub> calculated[<xref rid="pone.0232685.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0232685.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated (kg/m<sup>2</sup>) from weight using a digital scale (Scaletronix, White Plains, NY) and standing height using a stadiometer (Holtain, Crymych, UK) measured by research staff. Weight, height and BMI were compared to Centers for Disease Control reference standards to generate age- and sex-specific Z scores[<xref rid="pone.0232685.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Total body fat mass, lean body mass, and percentage fat were measured by whole-body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA; Delphi A, Hologic, Inc., Bedford, MA).</p>
                <p>Dietary intake was measured using 3-day weighed records and analyzed for energy and fat intake (Nutrition Data System, Minneapolis, MN)(17]. Subjects were trained for diet collection by research staff and provided food scales, measuring cups and spoons. Energy intake was reported as kcal/day and as percent Estimated Energy Requirement (%EER) for active children and adolescents[<xref rid="pone.0232685.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0232685.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. A 72-hour stool sample was collected and total fat content determined (Mayo Medical Laboratories, Rochester, MN), and CFA was calculated[<xref rid="pone.0232685.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. For the 3-month dietary assessment, the calorie and fat content of Encala™ and placebo supplements were included in the daily energy and fat intake data, adjusted for adherence[<xref rid="pone.0232685.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p>
                <p>Quantitation of morning fasting plasma FA was performed in two steps: 1) acid-base hydrolysis; 2) hexane extraction/derivatization with pentafluorobenzyl bromide (Mayo Medical Laboratories). Separation/detection was accomplished by capillary gas chromatography electron-capture negative ion-mass spectrometry, with quantitation based on analysis in selected ion-monitoring mode using stable isotope-labeled internal standards[<xref rid="pone.0232685.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p>

                <p>Descriptive statistics are presented as frequency counts and percentages for categorical variables and mean ± standard deviation (SD) for continuous variables. In addition to the randomization groups (placebo vs. Encala™) for this analysis, subjects were assigned to one of two fat malabsorption subgroups based upon their CFA at baseline: 1) low baseline CFA subgroup with CFA below the cohort median of 88%; and 2) high baseline CFA subgroup with CFA equal to or above the median of 88%. Two-sample t-test (unpaired) or Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables and chi-square tests of independence for categorical variables compared characteristics at baseline between randomization groups (placebo vs. Encala™), and also between low and high baseline CFA subgroups. Two-sample t-tests were also used to determine differences between randomization groups for outcomes at three months and for the 3-month change in outcomes. Paired t-tests were used to determine significance of change in outcomes within randomization groups for the low CFA and high CFA subgroups separately. Stata 12.0 (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX) was used with significance at 0.05.</p>

For those in the low CFA subgroup, three-month Encala™ treatment improved CFA significantly (7.5±7.2%, 78.9±7.5 to 86.3±6.7%, p = 0.002), with a significant drop in stool fat loss (-5.7±7.2 g/24 hours) and no change in dietary fat intake. At the same time, plasma linoleic acid increased 20%, α-linolenic acid 56%, γ-linolenic 51%, docosapentaenoic acid 45%, and arachidonic acid by 23% (p&lt;0.05). Total plasma fatty acid concentration increased by 20% (p≤0.005), with similar increases in total saturated, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids, and HAZ (0.06±0.08), WAZ (0.17±0.16), and BMIZ (0.20±0.25) all increased (p≤0.002). CFA status did not change with placebo treatment in the low baseline CFA subgroup. The low baseline CFA group receiving placebo treatment had significant reductions in dietary monounsaturated fatty acids (-0.3 ± 0.4 mmol/L) and plasma docosahexaenoic acid (-17%) with an increase in plasma eicosapentaenoic acid (31%) and WAZ (0.12±0.17, p’s&lt;0.05).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Encala™ was evaluated initially as a nutritional supplement in 2002 in children with CF and PI[<xref rid="pone.0232685.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This novel compound was synthesized from known lipolysis products of dietary fats, including lysophosphatidycholine, monoglyceride and fatty acids. Lepage, et al.[<xref rid="pone.0232685.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] published the results of two studies testing the safety and efficacy of Encala™. In the preliminary study, a liquid Encala™ test meal was consumed by healthy adults and by adolescents with CF and PI taking no pancreatic enzyme medication and plasma triglyceride absorption followed over 12 hours. Total triglycerides absorbed from Encala™ did not differ between the CF and healthy subjects and established that pancreatic enzymes were not required for Encala™ digestion and absorption in the context of CF and PI. In the 12-month double blind randomized, placebo-controlled CF clinical trial that followed, Encala™ and an active, isocaloric placebo supplements were tested in a cookie form in children and adolescents. The results showed that the Encala™ supplement was safe and was a well-absorbed source of dietary fat energy that Encala™ use led to better clinical outcomes in growth, fat-soluble vitamins and essential fatty acid status in this cohort of children with CF and PI. However, the cookie format and taste were not optimal (Dr. Yesair, BioMolecular Products, personal communication), and research and development continued to address the supplement taste and format characteristics. The improved Encala™, now a taste-neutral powder that was mixed with subject-selected, preferred foods and beverages, was used in the double blind, randomized, active placebo-controlled clinical trial reported here.</p>
              <p>The main outcomes from our RCT study showed that in a large cohort of children and adolescents with CF and PI cared for at ten different centers and on recommended CF diet and pancreatic enzyme regimens, daily oral Encala™ powder was safe and more effective than the energy and macronutrient-matched placebo. Increased dietary fat absorption (CFA) and fasting plasma fatty acid status and growth were observed[<xref rid="pone.0232685.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Previous reports also documented that Encala™ supplementation, compared with active placebo, improved choline (serum and muscle stores), amino acid, vitamin A and E, total body muscle stores and resting energy expenditure status in these school aged children with CF, PI and mild lung disease[<xref rid="pone.0232685.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0232685.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0232685.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p>
              <p>In this current subgroup analysis of subjects with baseline and three-month observations, Encala™ was particularly effective in subjects who experienced more severe dietary fat malabsorption prior to intervention. Low baseline CFA value indicated more dietary fat excreted in stool and a more severe malabsorptive clinical status. In this group, Encala™ treatment improved CFA by 7.5%, a magnitude that was both highly clinically and statistically significant and improved plasma fatty acid and growth status compared to placebo. Given the success of CFTR modulators in improving nutritional status, such as BMI, in patients with some genotypes more data are also needed to determine the efficacy of nutritional treatment in patients with CF taking CFTR modulator therapies. There are limited data on the impact on fat absorption with modulator therapy, particularly in patients with more severe mutations.</p>
              <p>Encala™ was developed to improve dietary fat absorption, especially absorption long chain fatty acids including the two essential fatty acids, and to supply more calories per gram ingested than medium chain fatty acids, which are a common ingredient in therapeutic nutrition products. Investigators have documented persistent, residual dietary fat malabsorption in spite of optimized, modern pancreatic enzyme medication and treatment regimens for patients with CF and PI for the past two decades[<xref rid="pone.0232685.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0232685.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Kalivianakis et al.[<xref rid="pone.0232685.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] in CF and PI studies, suggested that this residual fat loss was due to reduced gut mucosal uptake of long chain fatty acids and/or to incomplete solubilization of long chain fatty acids in the gut lumen. As such, this residual malabsorption was not the result of impaired lipolysis (pancreatic lipase mechanism), and thus will not be reduced or eliminated by increased dose of pancreatic enzyme medication[<xref rid="pone.0232685.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Their work in a fat malabsorption rat model showed that some of the long chain fatty acid absorption impairment was attributable to chronic bile acid deficiency. Chronic bile acid depletion is an established component of the spectrum of disease in patients with CF and PI[<xref rid="pone.0232685.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p>
              <p>Lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) is the backbone of the Encala™ technology and has unique metabolic characteristics; most importantly LPC directly enhances dietary fatty acid absorption in the gut, enhances transfer of fatty acids to the lymphatic system and improves fatty acid retention in mucosa[<xref rid="pone.0232685.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Intraluminal micellar LPC is extensively absorbed in the gut[<xref rid="pone.0232685.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In contrast, phosphatidylcholine, the common phospholipid in the diet, directly suppresses dietary fatty acid absorption as described by Homan and Hamelehle[<xref rid="pone.0232685.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] in the Caco-2 cell line. Peretti et al.[<xref rid="pone.0232685.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] provided a full review of the mechanisms of lipid absorption in CF.</p>
              <p>Few patients with CF and PI have a CFA ≥ 93%, the generally accepted range of absorption in health children and adults[<xref rid="pone.0232685.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0232685.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Encala™ supplementation addresses this residual long chain fatty acid malabsorption, as the Encala™ -delivered fatty acids are not dependent upon the action of lipase or bile acids for effective digestion and absorption in the CF gut. Despite having similar daily dietary energy and total fat intake as subjects receiving placebo, those receiving Encala™ had significantly improved absorption of linoleic, α-linolenic, γ-linolenic, arachidonic, docosapentaenoic acid and total fatty acids including saturated, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fat classes. The improvement in fatty acid status may have also affected growth. There was improvement in growth and fatty acid status with Encala™ treatment in subjects with high baseline CFA fat malabsorption, but this improvement was less than in the low baseline CFA subgroup. The placebo group showed some improvements, as this group also received additional energy from the active placebo. This analysis demonstrates Encala™ provided greater benefits to children with CF and PI with more severe baseline residual dietary fat malabsorption. This is particularly important as these were the patients with the greatest need for nutritional treatment as they had the poorer growth and more severe disease.</p>
              <p>Malnutrition due to chronic malabsorption is an important intervention target in CF care as it affects growth, development, pulmonary function, immune system function, and survival[<xref rid="pone.0232685.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Participants had dietary patterns that adhered to CF recommendations, with high calorie intake (124% EER) and high fat intake (42% energy; 103 g per day)[<xref rid="pone.0232685.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0232685.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Participants also followed the recommended pancreatic enzyme medication use regimen for meals and snacks[<xref rid="pone.0232685.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] but had a mean baseline CFA of 84%, a value lower than the 93% reference for healthy people[<xref rid="pone.0232685.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0232685.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Numerous studies have demonstrated pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) decreases fat malabsorption[<xref rid="pone.0232685.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], however, PERT does not fully remedy fat malabsorption in patients with CF and PI. Further, individuals at higher risk for fat malabsorption may not attain the same improvements with enzyme treatment as those with a lower risk[<xref rid="pone.0232685.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Woestenenk and colleagues[<xref rid="pone.0232685.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] completed a retrospective cross-sectional analysis of 224 children and adolescents with CF and PI prescribed PERT. The authors reported the median CFA varied (86–91%), and 24% had a CFA below 85% and CFA did improve following PERT. The lower CFA group also had significantly lower WAZ and BMIZ compared to the higher CFA group. Often, gastric acid-reducing agents are prescribed as adjunct therapy based on the theory that these medications reduce the gastric and duodenal acid environment and improve the efficacy of PERT. However, a recent Cochrane Database Systematic Review determined there was limited evidence that adjunct therapy to reduce gastric acid improved nutrition status[<xref rid="pone.0232685.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. New therapies, such as Encala™, are needed for patients that have residual fat malabsorption after optimizing PERT. Encala™ supplementation significantly improved CFA (+7.5%) when assessed after three months of treatment in the absence of change in dietary fat intake. The increase in CFA attained in the lower CFA group supplemented with Encala™ is clinically significant and warrants use as an adjunct therapy for individuals with CF on enzyme medications, with residual fat malabsorption.</p>
              <p>Currently, enzyme medications are the only available treatment for dietary fat malabsorption and are a cornerstone of CF therapy. Enzyme products are a combination of all digestive enzymes and other components derived from porcine pancreas. There are non-capsule enzyme options to treat fat malabsorption, such as an immobilized lipase-only containing device available for use with enteral tube feeding (RELiZORB® Alcresta Therapeutics, Inc, Newton, Massachusetts, USA)[<xref rid="pone.0232685.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], a bacterial-derived lipase-only product suspended in a liquid solution for use with meals (Burlulipase, Nordmark Arzneimittel, Uetersen, DE)[<xref rid="pone.0232685.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and a non-enteric coated enzyme powder (Viokase, Axcan Pharma US, Inc., Mont-saint-hilaire, Quebec, CA). Although lipase containing drugs improve triglyceride digestion in lipase-limited diseases, Encala™ is the only non-enzyme approach and has demonstrated improved fat absorption, growth, and nutritional status when used in conjunction with PERT. In the present study, we observed significant improvement in plasma fatty acid status following Encala™ treatment in individuals with greater fat malabsorption. Notably, supplementation increased essential fatty acid (linoleic and α-linolenic acid), arachidonic acid, docosapentaenoic acid and total fatty acid absorption. The increased dietary fat absorption and improved energy intake was reflected in the clinically significant growth in weight and height (HAZ, WAZ and BMIZ). Only WAZ improved with placebo supplementation in the lower CFA group, and this is likely due to the caloric density design of the placebo.</p>
              <p>Given the exploratory nature of this analysis, there are some limitations. The lower and higher CFA groups in this study were defined for this study as the median CFA at baseline (88%) to provide a balanced distribution of participants. There is no generally accepted or proposed evidence-based definition for classification of individuals with CF and PI at high and low degree of fat malabsorption by CFA value. CFA is used mostly in the research setting and for FDA evaluation of new pancreatic enzyme products. For the cohort of subjects with a CFA both at baseline and the three month follow-up, there was a greater proportion of participants randomized to Encala™ in the lower CFA group. The unbalanced distribution was related to the original Encala™/placebo randomization procedure for all subjects with sex/age blocks that did not include CFA, as CFA was an outcome variable. There was no difference in mean CFA between subgroups at baseline and there were clinically significant improvements in CFA in the low CFA Encala™ group. There was variation in individual response as indicated by the standard deviation. The original study did not specify this subgroup analysis, however this additional evidence provided data and experience to inform future research and clinical care.</p>
              <p>In summary, subjects with low baseline CFA and more severe fat malabsorption had a dramatic improvement in CFA with Encala™ treatment, accompanied by improved plasma fatty acid and growth status. Based on these results and clinical trial experience, Encala™ was well-accepted and reduced residual fat malabsorption in patients with CF and PI. These data indicate that Encala™ was efficacious in patients with CF and suggest efficacy in other exocrine pancreatic insufficiency diagnoses and malnutrition in need of improved energy absorption and weight gain. Further investigation is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of Encala™ supplementation to improve fat absorption and treat or prevent malnutrition in patients with other diagnoses.</p>

              <p>Reviewer #1: An team of nutrition investigators conducted a 2007-2011 double-blind placebo controlled dietary supplement study using LYM-X-SORBTM (LXS), a readily absorbable structured lipid technology developed to increase dietary fat absorption, in CF subjects with pancreatic insufficiency ages 5-18. The overall 12 month study demonstrated that the oral LXS supplementation was safe and more effective than the energy and micronutritent-matched placebo supplement and resulted in increase daily fat absorption and fasting plasma fatty acid status and growth as published in ref 9, related parts of the study being published in refs 8, 10 &amp;11. In the present report the authors have harvested data gathered at baseline and the three month visit from 40 LXS supplemented and 46 placebo supplemented subjects. Findings in this secondary analysis showed LXS to be most effective in subjects with more severe baseline malabsorption of fat. The authors present solid data supporting their conclusions, the findings are of translational value to clinical medicine and the discussion is both informative and relevant. A story case is made for more widespread use of LXS in CF patients with continuing fat malabsorption after optimizations for dosing of PERT.</p>
              <p>Comments</p>
              <p>1. A major issue needing to be addressed by the authors concerns the modifying effects of CFTR modulator therapies on fat malabsorption. Unlike the subjects of a decade ago, most CF patients are now receiving CFTR corrector and potentiator therapies known to be modifiers of intestinal absorption... and this significantly impacts the translational value of this paper. There are now publications addressing this issue.</p>
              <p>2. It would be useful if the authors could mention the effects of LXS to increase 20:5 and 22:6 absorption. To what extent are these values low in CF because of absorption issues vs. deficiencies in desaturases?</p>
              <p>3. Line 127 and 180, what is CP?</p>
              <p>4. Do the authors have any information on the effects of LXS on carotenoid absorption?</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Stallings et al. performed a secondary analysis of a multicenter RCT focusing on the effects of 3-month supplementation with a readily absorbable structured lipid versus placebo in 66 patients with cystic fibrosis aged 10.3±3.0 years, which has been reported previously to be well tolerated and exert beneficial effects on fat absorption, growth and nutritional and essential fatty acid status.</p>
              <p>In the present manuscript the effects in patients with coefficient of fat absorption (CFA) below versus above 88%, the median baseline CFA of the study group, were analyzed. Patients with lower than median CFA receiving the supplement showed improved CFA, anthropometry (weight, BMI z scores) and plasma essential fatty acids (linoleic, α-linolenic acid) and those receiving placebo only showed improved weight z scores (due to additional energy intake from the supplement), while patients with higher than median CFA (both treatment and placebo groups) had improvements in weight z scores and some plasma fatty acids.</p>
              <p>The authors concluded that the supplement provided greater benefits to CF patients with more severe baseline residual dietary fat malabsorption and that it enhanced dietary energy absorption, weight gain and fatty acid status.</p>
              <p>Overall, the RCT has been well designed and conducted using state-of-the-art methodologies and complying with human intervention study standards. However, this study has a few strong limitations:</p>
              <p>(1) The main difficulty arises from the fact that the RCT was not designed and powered for detecting a difference in the treatment effects between patients with CFA below versus above the median CFA of the entire study group.</p>
              <p>(2) The threshold of CFA 88% is not clinically or pathophysiology based, but determined by group characteristics and data distribution.</p>
              <p>(3) There is an unbalanced distribution of 63% of the treatment group showing CFA &lt;88%, while only 39% did so in the placebo group.</p>
              <p>(4) Improvement of fat absorption at the level of the mean changes in CFA (7.5 � 7.2 %) and stool fat excretion (5.7 �7.2 g/d) reported for the group with CFA &lt;88% receiving the supplement are clinically relevant, but the standard deviations are very high, suggesting that only a few patients may have responded that well.</p>
              <p>(5) In the absence of dietary fatty acid intake data changes in plasma fatty acid concentrations are difficult to explain by improved intestinal fatty acid absorption.</p>
              <p>Given that fat malabsorption-associated improvements are clinically relevant in CF patients, it is suggested that the authors address the following recommendations for further exploration of the results:</p>
              <p>As a consequence of (1) some real differences might not have been detected while others could have been observed by chance. For instance, there were significant changes in plasma linoleic and alpha-linolenic acid in the CFA&gt;88% group receiving placebo, which is difficult to explain. Student’s paired tests were applied for testing time effects within treatment groups. When using for instance 2-way repeated measures ANOVA across the treatment groups, the likelihood to observe significant changes by chance could be minimized.</p>
              <p>To overcome (2) the limitation of an arbitrary threshold rather than one supported by clinical or pathophysiological criteria, it is suggested that differences in the treatment effects are studied across the entire range of baseline CFA instead of splitting the group by the median CFA and/or as an additional approach. It is suggested that the authors visualize and analyze the data in that way. This could possibly even help detect a real clinically relevant threshold (if such exists in this study).</p>
              <p>Regarding (3), even though the differences in baseline CFA were not significant between treatment and placebo group, the impact of this imbalance on the results should be taken care of by additional statistical analysis.</p>
              <p>Given (4) the high standard deviations of 7.5÷7.2 % for CFA and 5.7÷7.2 g/d for stool fat excretion in the CFA &lt;88% and treatment group, a closer look at the data of this subgroup is suggested, including, for instance, the impact of absence versus presence of CF-associated cholestatic liver disease – which may have been more (or even exclusively) prevalent in CFA&lt;88%.</p>
              <p>(5) Even though the 3-day weighed dietary records performed before and after the intervention may be too short in duration to definitely exclude possible effects of changes in dietary intake, they could be helpful in this regard. It is therefore suggested to include fatty acid intake data in the present manuscript. Studying the improvements in plasma FA in relation to improvements in CFA by using regression analysis could help support a mechanistic explanation of improved intestinal absorption proposed in the manuscript.</p>
              <p>Minor point:</p>
              <p>λ-linolenic acid should read γ-linolenic acid.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: This article is certainly very interesting and useful as it proposes to investigate whether the effect of 3 months of LXS treatment varied by the participants degree of dietary fat malabsorption at baseline. The paper is well written and highly readable, however they some minor comments worth addressing.</p>
              <p>Minor</p>
              <p>Perhaps not essential but it would it be good to include a rationale for looking at 3 month time-point. Clinical reason?, or more to do with immediate effects of the intervention?</p>
              <p>It would perhaps be more clear and transparent that this was a subgroup analysis. Calling it a secondary analysis might imply that the analysis is based on one of the secondary objectives from the main RCT, but it isn’t.</p>
              <p>In the methods section, it would be help if the sections were labelled clearly or made distinguishable, ‘outcomes’, ‘statistical analysis’</p>
              <p>Result section, it’s worth mentioning that 86 participants completed 3 months (according to the Fig 1), however 66 children had data available for the ‘subgroup’ analysis.</p>
              <p>Lines 118 – 121 (page 9), also give actual numbers as you have done for low CFA group.</p>

              <p>Reviewer #1: An team of nutrition investigators conducted a 2007-2011 double-blind placebo controlled dietary supplement study using LYM-X-SORBTM (LXS), a readily absorbable structured lipid technology developed to increase dietary fat absorption, in CF subjects with pancreatic insufficiency ages 5-18. The overall 12 month study demonstrated that the oral LXS supplementation was safe and more effective than the energy and micronutritent-matched placebo supplement and resulted in increase daily fat absorption and fasting plasma fatty acid status and growth as published in ref 9, related parts of the study being published in refs 8, 10 &amp;11. In the present report the authors have harvested data gathered at baseline and the three month visit from 40 LXS supplemented and 46 placebo supplemented subjects. Findings in this secondary analysis showed LXS to be most effective in subjects with more severe baseline malabsorption of fat. The authors present solid data supporting their conclusions, the findings are of translational value to clinical medicine and the discussion is both informative and relevant. A story case is made for more widespread use of LXS in CF patients with continuing fat malabsorption after optimizations for dosing of PERT.</p>
              <p>Comments</p>
              <p>1. A major issue needing to be addressed by the authors concerns the modifying effects of CFTR modulator therapies on fat malabsorption. Unlike the subjects of a decade ago, most CF patients are now receiving CFTR corrector and potentiator therapies known to be modifiers of intestinal absorption... and this significantly impacts the translational value of this paper. There are now publications addressing this issue.</p>
              <p>This is a great point. We conducted a literature search of modulator therapies and fat malabsorption and there is little information on the impact of fat absorption. A recent study from our group (Stallings VA et al., J Peds, 2018) that evaluated CFA and fecal calprotectin (marker of inflammation) in subjects with gating mutations and showed that CFA increased significantly (+1.5%) in participants who were pancreatic insufficient (PI) after ivacaftor treatment, and calprotectin was reduced in both PI and PS. Studies also report that Ivacaftor can alter microbial communities (Ooi CY et al., Sci Rep, 2018) and partially restored this disruption of bile acid homeostasis (van de Peppel IP et al., J Cyst Fibros, 2019), which could affect fat absorption. However, in individuals with more severe (non-gating) mutations, there are no data related to fat malabsorption. There is evidence of improved intestinal pH (Gelfond D et al., Clin Transl Gastroenterol, 2017) which could help pancreatic enzyme function, but this is speculative.</p>
              <p>A comment about this this issue of impact of modulator therapy was added to the introduction and discussion.</p>
              <p>2. It would be useful if the authors could mention the effects of LXS to increase 20:5 and 22:6 absorption. To what extent are these values low in CF because of absorption issues vs. deficiencies in desaturases?</p>
              <p>Thank you for this suggestion. We added plasma eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA: C20:5w3), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA: C22:6w3), and docosapentaenoic acid (DPA: C22:5w3) concentrations at baseline comparing both CFA groups and treatment (randomization) groups in Table 1, and also the baseline, 3 month, and 3-month changes for each treatment/CFA group in Table 2.</p>
              <p>There is evidence that fatty acid desaturase activity is actually increased in people with cystic fibrosis via stimulation of the AMP-activated protein kinase in the absence of a functional CFTR protein (Freedman SD et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1999; Mimoun M et al., J Nutr, 2009; Njoroge SW et al., Biochim Biophys Acta, 2011; Seegmiller AC, Int J Mol Sci, 2014). Low values in CF are a result of poor absorption and the impact of altered (increased and decreased pathways) metabolism may play a role.</p>
              <p>3. Line 127 and 180, what is CP?</p>
              <p>Thank you for this question. We have corrected this error to “CF”, not “CP”.</p>
              <p>4. Do the authors have any information on the effects of LXS on carotenoid absorption?</p>
              <p>Upon review, we do not have data on the effects of LXS on carotenoid absorption.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Stallings et al. performed a secondary analysis of a multicenter RCT focusing on the effects of 3-month supplementation with a readily absorbable structured lipid versus placebo in 66 patients with cystic fibrosis aged 10.3±3.0 years, which has been reported previously to be well tolerated and exert beneficial effects on fat absorption, growth and nutritional and essential fatty acid status.</p>
              <p>In the present manuscript the effects in patients with coefficient of fat absorption (CFA) below versus above 88%, the median baseline CFA of the study group, were analyzed. Patients with lower than median CFA receiving the supplement showed improved CFA, anthropometry (weight, BMI z scores) and plasma essential fatty acids (linoleic, α-linolenic acid) and those receiving placebo only showed improved weight z scores (due to additional energy intake from the supplement), while patients with higher than median CFA (both treatment and placebo groups) had improvements in weight z scores and some plasma fatty acids.</p>
              <p>The authors concluded that the supplement provided greater benefits to CF patients with more severe baseline residual dietary fat malabsorption and that it enhanced dietary energy absorption, weight gain and fatty acid status.</p>
              <p>Overall, the RCT has been well designed and conducted using state-of-the-art methodologies and complying with human intervention study standards. However, this study has a few strong limitations:</p>
              <p>(1) The main difficulty arises from the fact that the RCT was not designed and powered for detecting a difference in the treatment effects between patients with CFA below versus above the median CFA of the entire study group.</p>
              <p>We agree that the RCT a priori plan did not specify this analysis. However, the RCT results and interest in applications from our clinical colleagues led us to conduct this post hoc subgroup exploratory analysis. These facts are presented in the methods section, so the reader is aware that this was an exploratory analysis with associated limitations. </p>
              <p>(2) The threshold of CFA 88% is not clinically or pathophysiology based, but determined by group characteristics and data distribution.</p>
              <p>We agree there is no evidence-based, generally accepted cut-point for ‘typical’ or ‘best attainable’ CFA in people CF and PI. In addition, a cut-point is unlikely to be established since the CFA test is employed almost exclusively for research studies and for FDA evaluations of new pancreatic enzyme efficacy (all studies with small sample sizes). CFA reference value for healthy individuals is generally accepted as 93% or greater. A soon to be published paper from our group (Bashaw, et al 2020), confirms this value is still meaningful in a contemporary sample of healthy volunteers using the same study method as in this report. </p>
              <p>After discussions with our biostatistician and consideration of feasibility (sample size, contrast between groups) with our data set, the approach to use the median for this subgroup analysis was employed.</p>
              <p>The following comments were added to the limitations section: </p>
              <p>The low and high CFA groups in this study were defined for this study as the median CFA at baseline (88%) to provide a balanced distribution of participants. There is no generally accepted or evidence based definition for classification of individuals with CF and PI at high and low risk of fat malabsorption by CFA value. CFA is used mostly in the research setting and for FDA evaluation of new pancreatic enzyme products.</p>
              <p>(3) There is an unbalanced distribution of 63% of the treatment group showing CFA &lt;88%, while only 39% did so in the placebo group.</p>
              <p>Agree, and this is related to the original (Encala/placebo group) randomization procedure for all subjects with sex/age blocks. It did not include CFA, as CFA was an outcome variable. We have included this in the limitations section.</p>
              <p>(4) Improvement of fat absorption at the level of the mean changes in CFA (7.5 � 7.2 %) and stool fat excretion (5.7 �7.2 g/d) reported for the group with CFA &lt;88% receiving the supplement are clinically relevant, but the standard deviations are very high, suggesting that only a few patients may have responded that well.</p>
              <p>A higher standard deviation in the low CFA group was expected given that the range was wider (52-87%) than that of the high CFA where the range was lower (&gt;88 and &lt;100%) and has a ceiling effect since no one is above 100%. As part of preparing this response, we carefully reviewed the CFA for each individual; there were no outliers nor implausible data. In subjects who improved, all but 2 subjects improved between +1 and +16%, except 2 of 31 subjects, who improved &gt;16%. In subjects who had decreased CFA, all subjects decreased between -1 and -16%, except 2 of 31 subjects who decreased &gt;-16%. We confirmed that the results were not driven by ‘only a few patients may have responded that well’.</p>
              <p>(5) In the absence of dietary fatty acid intake data changes in plasma fatty acid concentrations are difficult to explain by improved intestinal fatty acid absorption.</p>
              <p>Given that fat malabsorption-associated improvements are clinically relevant in CF patients, it is suggested that the authors address the following recommendations for further exploration of the results:</p>
              <p>As a consequence of (1) some real differences might not have been detected while others could have been observed by chance. For instance, there were significant changes in plasma linoleic and alpha-linolenic acid in the CFA&gt;88% group receiving placebo, which is difficult to explain. Student’s paired tests were applied for testing time effects within treatment groups. When using for instance 2-way repeated measures ANOVA across the treatment groups, the likelihood to observe significant changes by chance could be minimized.</p>
              <p>We appreciate the comment to reconsider the analysis. We are evaluating changes over time and this analysis is only a two measurement/data set-- from baseline to 3 months. A repeated measure ANOVA would be most suitable when there are comparisons among more than two groups or three or more time points (Park E et al., Korean J Lab Med, 2009; Bergh DD et al., Acad Manage J, 1995). We have chosen Student’s paired t-test for the time effects within each treatment groups (change from baseline to 3-months), and the Student’s unpaired t test for the difference between treatment groups in the 3-month change as the most suitable analysis since only two groups are compared. Therefore, we consider our analysis appropriate for this data set and subgroup analysis. </p>
              <p>To overcome (2) the limitation of an arbitrary threshold rather than one supported by clinical or pathophysiological criteria, it is suggested that differences in the treatment effects are studied across the entire range of baseline CFA instead of splitting the group by the median CFA and/or as an additional approach. It is suggested that the authors visualize and analyze the data in that way. This could possibly even help detect a real clinically relevant threshold (if such exists in this study).</p>
              <p>Baseline CFA Range Question: As a standard component of our analysis, we did visualize the baseline CFA data, looking for outliers, implausible data, and as you suggested, potentially obvious cut-points to consider. The results showed: n=4 subjects between 50-50.9% (lowest was 52%); n=5 between 60-60.9%; n=11 between 70-70.9%; and n=21 between 80-90%. There were n = 25 &gt;90%, including n=14 between 90-&lt;93%, and n=11 in the reference range for healthy people (≥93%). Our assessment was there was a good distribution across the %CFA results, there was no suggestion of specific clustering that was not expected in this outcome in CF/PI subjects, and all data were used in the analysis. The approach to use the median, with balanced sample size in both groups, was selected for the subgroup/exploratory analysis to determine if there was a different response to Encala vs Placebo intervention in subjects with more severe fat malabsorption at baseline.</p>
              <p>We established a working definition of low and high baseline CFA for ‘use in this project’, and do not suggest it be used as a clinical endpoint. In the methods section, we have made it clear, that the cut point/definition is for the purpose of data analysis in the paper. CFA is not used in clinical care (burden of complete 3-day stool and accurate diet intake), so it is unlikely that clinicians will misinterpret/misuse this information for clinical care. </p>
              <p>Regarding (3), even though the differences in baseline CFA were not significant between treatment and placebo group, the impact of this imbalance on the results should be taken care of by additional statistical analysis.</p>
              <p>We recognize the unbalanced groups, however, this is an exploratory sub-group analysis of a study with balanced groups initially (110 subjects randomized to treatment [n=54] and placebo [n=56]). We suggest this analysis, with the reviewers-directed clarification and additions to the limitation section, is an acceptable approach for secondary, subgroup analysis. We agree and recommend future studies consider similar questions with appropriate design and adequate sample size.</p>
              <p>Given (4) the high standard deviations of 7.5÷7.2 % for CFA and 5.7÷7.2 g/d for stool fat excretion in the CFA &lt;88% and treatment group, a closer look at the data of this subgroup is suggested, including, for instance, the impact of absence versus presence of CF-associated cholestatic liver disease – which may have been more (or even exclusively) prevalent in CFA&lt;88%.</p>
              <p>Please see the response above (4) regarding the standard deviation values mentioned or we’ve also copied it here:</p>
              <p>A higher standard deviation in the lower CFA group was expected given that the range was wider (52-87%) than that of the high CFA where the range was lower (&gt;88 and &lt;100%) and has a ceiling effect since no one is above 100%. As part of preparing this response, we carefully reviewed the CFA for each individual; there were no outliers nor implausible data. In subjects who improved, all but 2 subjects improved between +1 and +16%, except 2 of 31 subjects, who improved &gt;16%. In subjects who had decreased CFA, all subjects decreased between -1 and -16%, except 2 of 31 subjects who decreased &gt;-16%. </p>
              <p>Low CFA Group: Upon review of individual, raw data, there were no outliers. Rather, there is a large range of CFAs in the low CFA group (52-87%). </p>
              <p>Significant liver disease and any other significant diagnosis that might impact dietary intake, growth or body composition were exclusion criteria for subjects to participate in this study. There were no subjects with cholestatic liver disease.</p>
              <p>(5) Even though the 3-day weighed dietary records performed before and after the intervention may be too short to definitely exclude possible effects of changes in dietary intake, they could be helpful in this regard. It is therefore suggested to include fatty acid intake data in the present manuscript. Studying the improvements in plasma FA in relation to improvements in CFA by using regression analysis could help support a mechanistic explanation of improved intestinal absorption proposed in the manuscript.</p>
              <p>In nutrition studies, the prospective, three day, weighted food record is considered a high quality method to provide the food intake evidence/data (Johnson RK, Obesity, 2012;Yang JH et al., Nutr Res Pract. 2010; Crawford PB et al., JAND, 1994). Also note, our study specific research staff trains the subjects/families on food intake procedure, provides the digital food scales, measuring cups and spoons, and conducts the follow-up call when indicated, to clarify uncertain entry. The protocol did not call for modification to usual dietary intake, and the interventions (Encala and placebo products) were designed to be added to subjects self-selected, routine/preferred foods. </p>
              <p>As suggested, we added the total, saturated, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated dietary fat intake data to Table 2 and dietary data from the full cohort of participants was reported in Stallings VA et al., J Pediatr Gastroenterol Nutr, 2016, supplemental Table 1. There were no significant differences in intake between groups for total, monounsaturated fat, polyunsaturated fat, or saturated fat classes. The subgroup subjects here are representative of the larger population and therefore, the lack of difference in dietary is not unexpected. Therefore, we respectfully disagree that changes in dietary intake were different between groups, and so unlikely to be the etiology of the plasma results.</p>
              <p>Minor point:</p>
              <p>λ-linolenic acid should read γ-linolenic acid.</p>
              <p>Thank you. We have corrected this.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: This article is certainly very interesting and useful as it proposes to investigate whether the effect of 3 months of LXS treatment varied by the participants degree of dietary fat malabsorption at baseline. The paper is well written and highly readable, however they some minor comments worth addressing.</p>
              <p>Minor</p>
              <p>Perhaps not essential but it would it be good to include a rationale for looking at 3 month time-point. Clinical reason?, or more to do with immediate effects of the intervention?</p>
              <p>The three-month time-point was selected because it was sufficient time for the intervention to have effect on the outcomes of interest, and the 3 month protocol visit provided the a sufficient number of subjects with all the data elements needed for the subgroup analysis. </p>
              <p>It would perhaps be more clear and transparent that this was a subgroup analysis. Calling it a secondary analysis might imply that the analysis is based on one of the secondary objectives from the main RCT, but it isn’t.</p>
              <p>We agree. We have changed the language from “secondary” to “subgroup”.</p>
              <p>In the methods section, it would be help if the sections were labelled clearly or made distinguishable, ‘outcomes’, ‘statistical analysis’</p>
              <p>As suggested, we have created the following labels: Participants, Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria, Design, Outcomes, and Statistics.</p>
              <p>Result section, it’s worth mentioning that 86 participants completed 3 months (according to the Fig 1), however 66 children had data available for the ‘subgroup’ analysis.</p>
              <p>We have included the following sentence to the results:</p>
              <p>Eighty-six participants completed three months on either Encala or placebo, but this subgroup analysis included 66 children and adolescents (10.5±3.0 yrs, 39% female) with both baseline and 3-month visit CFA assessments (stool and diet records). </p>
              <p>Lines 118 – 121 (page 9), also give actual numbers as you have done for low CFA group.</p>
              <p>We added the actual values and amended the low CFA group language to:</p>
              <p>For subjects in the higher baseline CFA subgroup, CFA% (-1.2±4.8% on placebo and -4.4±6.3% on Encala), stool fat (0.3±4.5 g/d on placebo and 2.9±7.3 g/d on Encala) and dietary fat intake did not change with either placebo or Encala treatment. WAZ improved in both groups (0.13±0.28 for placebo and 0.14±0.21 for Encala, p&lt;0.05).</p>

              <p>2. Is the manuscript technically sound, and do the data support the conclusions?</p>
              <p>The manuscript must describe a technically sound piece of scientific research with data that supports the conclusions. Experiments must have been conducted rigorously, with appropriate controls, replication, and sample sizes. The conclusions must be drawn appropriately based on the data presented. </p>

              <p>The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.plosone.org/static/policies.action#sharing">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data—e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party—those must be specified.</p>

              <p>Please use the space provided to explain your answers to the questions above. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: The authors have addressed the concerns raised by this reviewer in their point-by-point reply and have added corresponding additions to their manuscript.</p>
              <p>In contrast to the statement in the reply "As suggested, we added the total, saturated, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated dietary fat intake data to Table 2" and "There were no significant differences in intake between groups for total, monounsaturated fat, polyunsaturated fat, or saturated fat classes." these additional data do not appear in this table. These data should be added as described.</p>
              <p>While it was proposed that "Regarding the unbalanced distribution of 63% of the treatment group showing CFA &lt;88%, while only 39% did so in the placebo group ... this is related to the original (Encala/placebo group) randomization procedure for all subjects with sex/age blocks ... It did not include CFA, as CFA was an outcome variable ... We have included this in the limitations section", this explanation is still missing in the limitations section and should be appropriately addressed in a re-revised version of the manuscript.</p>
              <p>Even though the inclusion/exclusion criteria have been previously reported (refs. 10-12), it would be helpful for the readers to include information regarding "Significant liver disease and any other significant diagnosis that might impact dietary intake, growth or body composition were exclusion criteria for subjects to participate in this study. There were no subjects with cholestatic liver disease" provided in the reply also in the manuscript as this is highly relevant for the present study.</p>

              <p>Reviewer #2: The authors have addressed the concerns raised by this reviewer in their point-by-point reply and have added corresponding additions to their manuscript.</p>
              <p>In contrast to the statement in the reply "As suggested, we added the total, saturated, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated dietary fat intake data to Table 2" and "There were no significant differences in intake between groups for total, monounsaturated fat, polyunsaturated fat, or saturated fat classes." these additional data do not appear in this table. These data should be added as described.</p>
              <p>We have amended the table to include these dietary fats and the statement "There were no significant differences in intake between groups for total, monounsaturated fat, polyunsaturated fat, or saturated fat classes” remains accurate.</p>
              <p>While it was proposed that "Regarding the unbalanced distribution of 63% of the treatment group showing CFA &lt;88%, while only 39% did so in the placebo group ... this is related to the original (Encala/placebo group) randomization procedure for all subjects with sex/age blocks ... It did not include CFA, as CFA was an outcome variable ... We have included this in the limitations section", this explanation is still missing in the limitations section and should be appropriately addressed in a re-revised version of the manuscript.</p>
              <p>We have added the following sentence to the discussion: “The unbalanced distribution was related to the original Encala™/placebo randomization procedure for all subjects with sex/age blocks that did not include CFA, as CFA was an outcome variable.” (line 227-229 in the marked up version)</p>
              <p>Even though the inclusion/exclusion criteria have been previously reported (refs. 10-12), it would be helpful for the readers to include information regarding "Significant liver disease and any other significant diagnosis that might impact dietary intake, growth or body composition were exclusion criteria for subjects to participate in this study. There were no subjects with cholestatic liver disease" provided in the reply also in the manuscript as this is highly relevant for the present study.</p>
              <p> We have added the following sentence under “inclusion/exclusion criteria”: “Liver disease and any other significant diagnosis that might impact dietary intake, growth or body composition were exclusion criteria for subjects to participate in this study. There were no subjects with cholestatic liver disease.”</p>
