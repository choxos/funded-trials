                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Heavy alcohol use among people living with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa can hinder the success of HIV treatment programmes, impacting progress towards United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS goals. Primary partners can provide critical forms of social support to reduce heavy drinking and could be included in motivational interviewing (MI) interventions to address heavy drinking; however, few studies have evaluated MI interventions for couples living with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa. We aim to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a couple-based MI intervention with mobile breathalyser technology to reduce heavy alcohol use and improve HIV treatment outcomes among HIV-affected couples in South Africa.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>We will employ a three-arm randomised controlled trial to assess the efficacy of couple-based MI (MI-only arm) and in conjunction with mobile breathalysers (MI-plus arm) to address alcohol use and HIV outcomes, as compared with enhanced usual care (control arm). We will enrol heterosexual couples aged 18â49 in a primary relationship for at least 6âmonths who have at least one partner reporting hazardous alcohol use and on antiretroviral therapy for 6âmonths. Participants in both MI arms will attend three manualised counselling sessions and those in the MI-plus arm will receive real-time feedback on blood alcohol concentration levels using a mobile breathalyser. Couples randomised in the control arm will receive enhanced usual care based on the South African ART Clinical Guidelines. Feasibility and acceptability indicators will be analysed descriptively, and exploratory hypotheses will be examined through regression models considering time points and treatment arms.</p>

                  <title>Ethics and dissemination</title>
                  <p>The study was approved by the University of California, San Francisco (HRPP; protocol number 21-35034) and Human Sciences Research Council Research Ethics Committee (REC: protocol number 1/27/20/21). We will disseminate the results at local community meetings, community-level health gatherings and conferences focused on HIV and alcohol use.</p>

                <p>In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), alcohol use is described as âadding fuel to the fireâ for people living with HIV (PLWH),<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> threatening the success of HIV treatment programmes and progress towards United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS goals.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2â5</xref> South Africa is severely impacted by HIV, particularly in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) where 27% of adults are infected with HIV.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> At 11 L of pure alcohol per year, South Africa has some of the highest levels of per capita drinking in the world.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Among PLWH who drink in South Africa, 50%â90%âreport heavy alcohol use.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8â10</xref> Notably, South Africa also has some of the highest rates of gender-based violence worldwide,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 12</xref> which is closely linked to heavy alcohol use.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13 14</xref> For PLWH, alcohol use contributes to poor adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and retention in HIV care.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15â17</xref></p>
                <p>Our research in SSA suggests that primary partners are key to the success of alcohol interventions given their critical role in helping people reduce alcohol use and the couple dynamics that intersect with alcohol use.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18â21</xref> In South Africa, partners mitigate the harms of alcohol use by helping drinkers manage their alcohol use while maintaining adherence to ART<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>; however, communication around reducing alcohol use is not always effective and can be limited by gender-based power imbalances. This suggests the need for interventions to build couplesâ communication skills and shared decision-making around alcohol use.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Harnessing this powerful form of social support is critical in a setting where clinical services for alcohol misuse are inadequate and can be costly for patients.</p>
                <p>One approach that has been effective at reducing alcohol use among PLWH is motivational interviewing (MI) in conjunction with mobile technology for real-time feedback on drinking levels.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22â29</xref> MI is a collaborative, goal-oriented style of communication with particular attention to the language of change.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> It is designed to strengthen personal motivation for and commitment to a specific goal by eliciting and exploring the personâs own reasons for change in an atmosphere of acceptance and compassion.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Few MI approaches with couples have been developed for alcohol use, particularly in the African context.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21 31â33</xref> Although Starks articulated a comprehensive framework for MI practice with couples,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> most of the research on feasibility and acceptability (F&amp;A),<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21 35</xref> and preliminary efficacy<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32 36</xref> of the approach has come from the study of male couples in the USA.</p>
                <p>In studies with individuals, daily monitoring of drinking levels, when paired with MI, has a greater effect on drinking than MI alone<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27â29</xref> and we hypothesise that monitoring may have additional benefits with couples. Although primary partners are generally aware of a personâs alcohol use, they may have inaccurate knowledge of drinking amounts and frequency if not drinking together. Accurate knowledge of drinking levels in real time is critical to trigger couplesâ communication as well as timely and tailored social support. Mobile breathalysers have been shown to be a feasible and acceptable strategy for self-monitoring alcohol use in studies with individuals and new products have been developed for dyads that allow for sharing of blood alcohol concentration (BAC) levels with support partners via a mobile app.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37â39</xref> In sum, mobile breathalysers can provide real-time feedback and support, which can be synergistic with an MI approach with couples that fosters couple communication and problem-solving skills to effectively engage with the breathalysers and work together to reduce alcohol use.</p>

                <title>Objectives</title>
                <p>The main aim of this study is to evaluate the F&amp;A of a couples-based intervention for heavy alcohol consumption among HIV-affected couples (Masibambisane, âLetâs work togetherâ in isiZulu). Our primary hypothesis is that Masibambisane will be feasible and acceptable. As exploratory hypotheses, we expect that participants who receive the intervention will report lower number of drinking days and heavy alcohol use (a combined measure of self-report and an alcohol biomarker), and greater rates of viral suppression and adherence to ART at follow-up visits.</p>

                <title>Trial design</title>
                <p>We will conduct a three-arm randomised controlled trial (RCT) with couples randomised to the following arms: (1) an enhanced usual care (EUC) control condition; (2) couple-based MI (MI-only arm) and (3) couple-based MI with mobile breathalysers (MI-plus arm). Couples in arm 2 and 3 will receive three MI sessions over a 60-day period with an experienced counsellor to help strengthen communication and problem-solving skills around alcohol use. Couples in arm 3 will use a mobile breathalyser and app for 60 days and receive the same MI sessions, which will incorporate feedback on BAC results into the sessions. This design will allow us to assess the efficacy of couple-based MI alone and the added synergistic effect of the mobile breathalysers on alcohol use and HIV outcomes (eg, adherence to ART, viral suppression).</p>

                <title>Eligibility criteria</title>
                <p>Couples will be included in the study if they are: (1) in a primary relationship for at least 6âmonths; (2) aged 18â49 and (3) have at least one partner (the âindex patientâ) with a positive Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C) screen (score of 3 or more for women and 4 or more for men; modified to cover the prior 3 months)<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> and on ART for at least 6âmonths. We expect all participants to be on oral ART regimens as long-acting ART was not available at the time of this study in South Africa. All participants living with HIV will be required to have disclosed their HIV status to their partner in the study. Lastly, both partners will separately agree to participate in order for the couple to be enrolled.</p>
                <p>We will exclude participants with an AUDIT-C score greater than 12, indicating risk of severe alcohol use disorder. Participants with severe drinking issues may not benefit from a short-term counseling-based intervention and may need more intensive treatment than our study can provide. Our intervention may also not be appropriate for couples experiencing severe intimate partner violence (IPV). Thus, we will exclude those who fear for their safety by participating in the study and/or report severe IPV in the past 3 months. IPV is assessed using the WHO measure for South Africa, which assesses physical, sexual and emotional violence, and determines whether it is mild, moderate or severe.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> This trial does not place restrictions on concomitant receipt of care for alcohol use or HIV care and treatment.</p>

                <title>Patient and public involvement</title>
                <p>We adapted the Masibambisane intervention from the three-session couples MI intervention protocol originally developed by Starks <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic> for use in the Couples Health Project.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> The original intervention was intended to reduce drug use and enhance primary HIV prevention among male couples in the USA. In contrast, the Masibambisane intervention will address heavy alcohol use among heterosexual couples in South Africa in which at least one partner is living with HIV. The adaptation process therefore had to consider: (1) cultural and linguistic context; (2) reformulation of the new target behaviour (ie, to heavy alcohol use) and (3) integration of the mobile breathalyser component.</p>
                <p>We followed the ADAPT-ITT framework<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> to arrive at the final version of the Masibambisane intervention. Consistent with step 5 in the ADAPT-ITT framework, we conducted focus group discussions (FGDs) with 36 key stakeholders to gain feedback on the intervention content and activities, including perceptions of the mobile breathalyser technology. Key stakeholders included HIV care providers, alcohol vendors, community leaders and couples who drink alcohol. This feedback was integrated in the creation of a modified intervention manual (ADAPT-ITT step 6). The revised manual was reviewed by 8 members of the research team during the intervention training process (ADAPT-ITT step 7)âincluding the counsellors who would deliver the intervention. Their feedback was used to refine and finalise the Masibambisane manual to maximise usability and enhance cultural relevance.</p>

                <title>Masibambisane intervention arms</title>
                <p>Participants in the MI-only and MI-plus arms will receive three in-person manualised MI sessions as a couple with a trained counsellor in the language of their preference (either <italic toggle="yes">isi</italic>Zulu or English). Sessions take place approximately 30 days apart over a period of 2 months. In addition, the index participant in the MI-plus arm will make use of the mobile breathalyser and companion app, which will deliver real-time feedback on the index participantâs BAC levels to both partners for 2âmonths. The couples randomised to MI-plus will receive brief technology training on how to operate the mobile breathalyser and app followed by a short trial period to become familiar with the technology before starting intervention activities. All sessions are conducted with both partners together and each lasts 60â75âmin. The manual will provide guidance on sequencing of content. It is executed in a manner consistent with the spirit, processes and techniques of couples MI outlined by Starks.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34 36</xref></p>

                  <title>Session 1</title>
                  <p>The counsellor first orients the couple to the structure and nature of the intervention and reminds them about the limits of confidentiality. After initial engagement and rapport building, the counsellor invites the couple to reflect on communication strengths and weaknesses before engaging in strengths-based communication skill building. The topic of alcohol use is introduced through the use of a calendar activity developed for Starksâ previous studies.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32 36</xref> Partners who report heavy alcohol use at baseline complete the calendar by indicating days they consumed alcohol in the past 30 days. This serves as an immediate feedback tool that the counsellor uses to catalyse a conversation about alcohol use and evoke relevant change talk. This discussion culminates in the couple identifying what they would like alcohol use to look like in the coming month and developing a shared plan to accomplish that goal. The session ends with the counsellor inviting the couple to notice communication successes and challenges and to schedule a pleasant event together in the coming month (in addition to summarising the coupleâs alcohol-related goals and plans).</p>

                  <title>Session 2</title>
                  <p>The session begins with a check-in on recent communication and goals from the previous session. The couple then completes a values card-sort exercise highlighting shared values and joint goals. For Masibambisane, the standard values card sort deck<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> used in previous MI interventions with couples<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> was modified to increase cultural relevance and translated into isiZulu. Following the card-sort exercise, counsellors refocus the conversation on alcohol use by completing another calendar activity. For participants randomised to couples MI, this procedure mirrors that used in session 1. For couples randomised to MI-plus, the counsellor presents the couple with breathalyser data for the index partner from the prior month, presented in a calendar format. Data for the non-index partner (if also reporting heavy alcohol use at baseline) are added to this calendar. In addition to debriefing the calendar, couples in the MI-plus condition discuss their experiences using the breathalyser and receiving the BAC readings of their partner. After the calendar is created and debriefed, the counsellor further evokes change talk with a series of questions about potential consequences of drinking. Similar to session 1, the discussion culminates in the couple identifying what might be reasonable drinking limits for the coming month and developing a shared plan to accomplish that goal. The session ends with the counsellor inviting the couple to notice communication successes and challenges and to schedule a pleasant event together in the coming month (in addition to summarising the coupleâs alcohol-related goals and plans).</p>

                  <p>The session begins with a check-in on recent communication and goals from the previous session. Similar to session 2, counsellors then refocus the conversation on alcohol use by completing another calendar activity. As in session 2, participants randomised to MI-only complete the calendar following session 1 procedures. Those randomised to MI-plus are presented with a calendar containing prior month breathalyser data. After the calendar is created and debriefed, the counsellor further evokes change talk with a series of questions about potential consequences of drinking specifically for HIV-related healthcare outcomes and the coupleâs communication and sexual interactions. Similar to session 1, this discussion culminates in the couple identifying their drinking goals for the coming month and developing a shared plan to accomplish that goal. Finally, counsellors engage in a termination discussion. This begins by inviting the couple to reflect on their experiences over the past 2âmonths while engaged in the intervention. The couple then looks ahead and considers long-term goalsâincluding specific goals for limits on alcohol useâand constructs a shared plan to accomplish them.</p>

                <p>We will use BACtrack View, which consists of a handheld commercial-grade breathalyser and accompanying mobile app. Index patients will receive twice-daily Short Message Service (SMS) message requests to complete a breathalyser reading at 11:00 hours and again at 20:00 hours. Given the frequent power outages in South Africa, which often result in a loss of cellular service, participants will be allowed to complete missed tests as soon as the power returns. To avoid disruptions in cellular service by having to manually purchase data, we will automatically provide cellular data to perform the tests. We will also provide phones to participants who do not have compatible smartphones and power banks to keep phones and breathalysers charged during power outages.</p>
                <p>To complete a breathalyser test, the participant will log into the mobile phone app and follow a series of prompts to blow into the breathalyser in front of the phone camera, which displays the BAC value, and transmits the BAC value and photo of the participant taking the test to the BACtrack View server for storage. After successfully completing the test, the partner will receive an SMS message informing them of the BAC value from the index patient. The study coordinator is notified of BAC results and/or missed tests and can log into the BACtrack View app to view all tests results completed over a monthly period. A trained technology navigator will be assigned to each couple, who will reach out to couples who are missing tests and will be available for support as couples are getting started with the BAC tests. At the end of each 30-day period, BAC results are mapped onto monthly calendars and used in subsequent MI counselling sessions.</p>

HIV clients are advised that alcohol intake should be fewer than two standard drinks/day for men and one for women, and drinking should not occur daily (at most 5 out of 7âdays per week). After randomisation, couples in the control arm will receive additional alcohol counselling modelled on WHO guidelines and Conroy <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>âs intervention in Malawi, which uses participantsâ baseline AUDIT scores for messaging around alcohol reduction and lasts 10â15âmin.<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> In selecting the control, we chose to balance our ethical obligation to provide basic health information on alcohol use (minimal in this setting), while maximising the generalisability of our findings to inform a future RCT, which will employ a EUC control group. Clinical trial experts recommend the usual care condition over other designs such as a time-and-attention control (TAC) when the long-term goal is to inform implementation science and scale-up.<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46 47</xref> Our long-term goal will be to test the effectiveness of a scalable alcohol intervention. Moreover, because TAC designs have an active but different intervention, there is the risk of positively biased intervention results because the comparison arm can distract participants from making reductions in alcohol use they would have otherwise made.<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46 47</xref></p>

Facilitators and the HSRC research manager will attend a week-long didactic training workshop (in-person, at the HSRC) with Starks <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> Starks is a licensed clinical psychologist and an MI-trainer certified by the Motivational Interviewing Network of Trainers.</p>
                <p>The training workshop will begin with a 1-day introduction to individual MI skills.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> This workshop will focus on the spirit of MI, engaging skills (open questions, affirmations, reflections and summary statements), and recognising change talk (expressions of desire, ability, reasons, need, commitment, activation and taking-steps to change). The first training day will end with a demonstration of couples MI delivered in <italic toggle="yes">isi</italic>Zulu (through a translator) by Starks. Days 2â5 will focus on the spirit, processes and skills of MI with couples. Activities will consist of brief didactic presentations of content interspersed with worksheets to reinforce knowledge acquisition and a wide variety of role-play activities permitting practice. Beginning in day 3, role play activities will be used to introduce counsellors to key aspects of the intervention protocol and facilitate practice with immediate feedback from Starks.</p>

Recruiters will use procedures established at HSRC to identify and recruit participants using a community mobilisation approach. A team of recruiters will target individuals and couples in public areas in the community, including alcohol venues (eg, shebeens, bottle shops), markets, sports grounds, taxi ranks, HIV clinics and community events. Though couples will be targeted together if possible, couples may not be together in public<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> and this could hinder successful recruitment of couples into research studies in the area.</p>

Recruiters will respond to these messages as soon as possible, typically no later than the next working day. Passive recruitment will further be employed through flyers placed at the clinics. Clinic-based outreach teams and care providers will assist in identifying HIV patients who use alcohol use and have been on ART for at least 6âmonths, referring them to HSRC recruiters.

If recruited in person, the screener will take place in a private location identified by the recruiter. Partners in a couple will be screened separately to ensure confidentiality. If the participant cannot complete the initial screener in the field, the recruiter will record their contact information for a later phone screening. Once deemed eligible to continue, the recruiter will inform the index participant that their partner must also be screened. Contact information for the recruited partner will be collected and permission to call them will be obtained. Alternatively, the partner can initiate contact via a âplease call meâ SMS text message. The index participant will be provided with study information to share with the partner.</p>
                <p>Couples meeting initial eligibility criteria will be given a secondary screener in person that asks a variety of questions not limited to IPV. The members of the couple will be screened simultaneously but separately by gender-matched interviewers. The goal is to screen out illegitimate couples or those who experienced severe IPV in the past 3âmonths or have safety concerns. In case a couple is deemed ineligible due to IPV, they will not be informed of the reason for ineligibility to minimise any unintended harms. As part of the second screener, questions about how the couple met will be asked (with the answer not recorded). After completing the second screener, the two recruiters will compare their notes and determine if the couple is legitimate. If not, the recruiters will inform the couple of their ineligibility without providing a specific reason.</p>

                <p>At the 2-month visit, dried blood spot (DBS) samples will be collected from all participants who reported heavy alcohol use at baseline to test for Phosphatidylethanol (PEth), an alcohol biomarker that is well correlated with total alcohol consumption in the prior 2â4 weeks.<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50 51</xref> Additionally, at the 2-month visit, DBS samples will be collected for all index patients living with HIV to test for viral load. We will prepare DBS by pipetting whole blood onto Whatman 903 cards. DBS cards for PEth will be stored at room temperature in locked cabinets and transported to a commercial laboratory in the USA for PEth quantification (16:0/18:1 analogue), with lower limit of quantification of 8âng/mL.<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> PEth is well correlated with breathalyser-assessed number of days drinking over 21 days<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref> and the volume of alcohol consumed in the past 21 days.<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> DBS cards for viral load will be transported on a daily basis to an accredited laboratory in South Africa and processed using the Panther System with a lower limit of detection of 883 copies/mL.</p>

                <p>We will use built-in controls within REDCap to restrict out of range values and prompts will be given to alert the user to missing data or unusual entries. The mobile application displays questions on the screen and then gives interviewers the ability to enter responses directly into the mobile phone or tablet. Once complete, the research instrument (ie, survey, baseline interview) is temporarily stored in a non-readable encrypted file on the device/tablet. When in an area with network coverage or back at the research office, completed forms are uploaded and removed from the tablets approximately every 60âs. If no network signal is present, the data are stored on the mobile device until such time that it detects a network signal. Checks will be placed to ensure correct information has been entered by the HSRC Research Manager. Information from the research instruments is then uploaded to a secured server. The data undergo both internal and external quality checks, conducted by the UCSF Research Manager and the HSRC Data Science Unit. Additionally, incoming data will be monitored daily to identify any unusual or unexpected entries. In cases where such entries are detected, data queries will be generated, and the HSRC team will be contacted to address and resolve these queries.</p>

                <p>On enrolment, we will obtain contact information (eg, two cell phone numbers, directions to households and contact information for up to three other individuals) to facilitate tracking. Participants will be contacted regularly (eg, twice a month) to update contact information and check on location. Prior to the assessment visits, reminder calls and SMS messages will be made to both partners 1âweek before the appointment and again 1â2âdays prior. For participants who miss appointments, we will limit the number of phone call attempts to 3â4 to respect privacy and the right to refuse. There may be special circumstances when outreach workers will be dispatched to participantsâ communities (with their prior consent) such as when calls do not go through.</p>
                <p>We anticipate that we will lose a very small percentage of couples due to break-ups, deaths and migration (&lt;5%), which we have accounted for in recruitment and analysis plans. One assessment will be conducted with each partner separately following the break-up to understand when the couple broke up, whether study participation contributed to the break-up, and if not, other reasons for why the couple broke-up.</p>
                <p>The breakup assessment will also allow us to identify any negative effects of participation on couples. If the study contributed to the break-up or the break-up was a negative experience, we will follow the adverse event logging process. We will continue to follow each partner individually and administer study assessments given that our study outcomes (eg, alcohol use) are at the individual level. This will allow us to explore whether participation in the study, despite the break-up, had any effect on their alcohol use; however, couples who break-up before participation in the intervention will exit the study.</p>

                <p>We will also assess fidelity to the intervention by having the manager or facilitators complete detailed checklists after each session to document activities conducted.

                <p>Although we are not powered to examine treatment effects, we will explore the effect of Masibambisane on the alcohol use among the partner reporting hazardous alcohol use at baseline: number of drinking days in the past 30 days (assessed via the timeline follow-back, assessed at 2âmonths and 6âmonths), non-heavy alcohol use (ie, a composite measure consisting of a negative AUDIT-C score<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> in the past 3âmonths and PEth value &lt;35âng/mL, a recommended cut-off value,<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref> both assessed at 2âmonths), and raw AUDIT-C score (0â12); and among the partner with HIV: optimal ART adherence (95% or higher on the Visual Analogue Scale<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>), and viral suppression (less than 1000 copies/ml per HIV clinical guidelines).<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></p>
                <p>Additional exploratory outcomes include relationship dynamics such as constructive communication (communication patterns questionnaire<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>; alpha=0.69â0.72); alcohol-specific partner social support (adapted based on the social provision scale<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>; alpha=0.84), trust (dyadic trust scale<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>; Î±=0.82), intimacy (emotional intimacy subscale of Sternberg love scale<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>; alpha=0.90), unity (inclusion of self-in-other measure<xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>), relationship satisfaction (couple satisfaction index,<xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref> single item) and sexual satisfaction (couple sexual satisfaction scale<xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>; alpha=0.89). Because we expect that reductions in alcohol use and improvements in relationship dynamics may reduce IPV, we will also explore effects on physical, sexual and emotional violence as measured by the WHO domestic violence module.<xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">63 64</xref> All relationship dynamics and IPV types will be modelled as continuous variables.</p>

                  <p>Although the primary objective is to assess F&amp;A rather than to conduct formal hypothesis tests, we will evaluate exploratory hypotheses as part of the assessment process. For example, we expect that: (1) participants in the MI-only arm will report a greater reduction in the number of drinking days and in lower odds of engaging in hazardous alcohol use than participants in the EUC control arm; (2) participants in the MI-plus arm will report a greater reduction in the number of drinking days and lower odds of engaging in hazardous alcohol use than participants in the MI-only arm. Secondarily, we anticipate that intervention participants will report higher odds of adherence to ART and viral suppression than those in the EUC arm. We also anticipate the intervention participants in both arms will report higher (indicating more positive) scores on relationship dynamics and lower scores on IPV than those in the EUC arm.</p>
                  <p>We will compute descriptive statistics to capture measures of central tendency for continuous variables and proportions for binary variables, by visit and by treatment arm. To explore the effect of Masibambisane on the secondary outcome of number of drinking days, we will use mixed-effects negative binomial regression models including all three time points. Negative binomial models are recommended for count-based outcomes like drinking days.<xref rid="R70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref> For the AUDIT-C score, we will use linear mixed-effects models including all three time points. For optimal adherence to ART, we will use mixed-effects logistic regression models including all three time points. Models will include random effects for participants and couples, and fixed effects for time point and study arm, interaction of time and arm and sex of the index patient. We will also explore the whether the effects are moderated by respondent type (ie, index patient vs partner).</p>
                  <p>To explore effects on biomarker-based outcomes captured only at 2âmonths (eg, heavy alcohol use, viral suppression) and only on index participants, we will use logistic regression models with treatment arm as the main predictor. For heavy alcohol use, which will be collected on both members of the couple, we will cluster based on couple ID to account for non-independent drinking levels within dual-drinking couples. All analyses will use an intention-to-treat approach to include every participant within the analysis based on their original randomisation group. Statistical analyses will be conducted in Stata V.18. If missing data exceed 5%, we will use multiple imputation via chained equations following methods in our prior studies.<xref rid="R71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref></p>

To protect confidentiality, various measures will be taken, including staff training, using research identification numbers instead of names and secure data storage. There is also a risk of loss of privacy, especially when discussing sensitive topics such as HIV and alcohol use. Privacy will be maintained by using coded language and providing participants with strategies to protect their privacy, such as using discreet covers for breathalyser devices and phones. Participants will be assured that their responses will not be shared with their partners, and steps will be taken to address coercion or violence, including referrals to appropriate services.</p>

A data safety and monitoring board (DSMB), composed of three independent experts in the field of HIV and alcohol abuse, has been convened in accordance with NIH policy. They reviewed and approved the study procedures for trial monitoring on 15 November 2022. The DSMB will convene every 6âmonths and also in response to the occurrence of any serious adverse events. Data on anticipated adverse events, including couple dissolution and IPV, will be gathered throughout the study and reported to the DSMB at biannual meetings.
