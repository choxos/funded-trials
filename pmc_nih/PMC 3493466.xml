                <p>T-cell immune responses modulated by T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-containing molecule 3 (Tim-3) during <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb) infection in humans remain poorly understood. Here, we found that active TB patients exhibited increases in numbers of Tim-3-expressing CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, which preferentially displayed polarized effector memory phenotypes. Consistent with effector phenotypes, Tim-3<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> and Tim-3<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell subsets showed greater effector functions for producing Th1/Th22 cytokines and CTL effector molecules than Tim-3<sup>−</sup> counterparts, and Tim-3-expressing T cells more apparently limited intracellular Mtb replication in macrophages. The increased effector functions for Tim-3-expressing T cells consisted with cellular activation signaling as Tim-3<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> and Tim-3<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell subsets expressed much higher levels of phosphorylated signaling molecules p38, stat3, stat5, and Erk1/2 than Tim-3- controls. Mechanistic experiments showed that siRNA silencing of Tim-3 or soluble Tim-3 treatment interfering with membrane Tim-3-ligand interaction reduced <italic>de novo</italic> production of IFN-γ and TNF-α by Tim-3-expressing T cells. Furthermore, stimulation of Tim-3 signaling pathways by antibody cross-linking of membrane Tim-3 augmented effector function of IFN-γ production by CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, suggesting that Tim-3 signaling helped to drive stronger effector functions in active TB patients. This study therefore uncovered a previously unknown mechanism for T-cell immune responses regulated by Tim-3, and findings may have implications for potential immune intervention in TB.</p>

                <title>Author Summary</title>
                <p>Tuberculosis (TB), an infectious disease caused by <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb) infection, remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. While CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell effector functions producing Th1 or cytotoxic cytokines are required to mount anti-mycobacterial immunity, insufficiency or failure to mount anti-mycobacterial effector functions by CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells may lead to impaired immunity against TB. Therefore, it is important to elucidate functional characteristics and regulatory pathways for Mtb-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells during immune responses to Mtb infection. It was postulated that T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-containing molecule 3 (Tim-3) might represent a T-cell exhaustion marker, and expression of Tim-3 on T cells may be linked to progressive loss of secretion of cytokines. Thus, Tim-3 expression on T cells might correlate with T-cell dysfunction and disease pathogenic events. However, T-cell immune responses modulated by Tim-3 in human TB disease remain poorly understood. Here, we found that up-regulation of Tim-3 expression in active human TB disease allows CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells to mount stronger, but not impaired, anti-mycobacterium effector functions. This study therefore uncovers a previously unknown mechanism for T-cell immune responses regulated by Tim-3, and has an important implication for TB diagnostics and therapy.</p>

Therefore, it is important to elucidate functional characteristics and regulatory pathways for Mtb-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells during immune responses to Mtb infection.</p>
              <p>T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-containing molecule 3 (Tim-3) is a membrane protein initially identified as a negative regulator of Th1 immunity in mice <xref rid="ppat.1002984-Sabatos1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002984-SanchezFueyo1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002984-Zhu1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. It was postulated that Tim-3, like other members of T-cell inhibitory molecules such as programmed death 1 (PD-1) <xref rid="ppat.1002984-Sharpe1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002984-Trautmann1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002984-Zhu2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> and co-stimulatory receptor cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) <xref rid="ppat.1002984-Kaufmann2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, might represent a T-cell exhaustion marker <xref rid="ppat.1002984-Zhu2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002984-Vali1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002984-Jin1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002984-GoldenMason1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002984-Sakuishi1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002984-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002984-Jones1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002984-McMahan1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. A number of studies have suggested that abundant expression of Tim-3 on T cells may be linked to progressive loss of secretion of cytokines such as IL-2, TNF-α and IFN-γ in viral infections <xref rid="ppat.1002984-Jin1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002984-GoldenMason1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002984-Jones1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002984-Ju1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002984-Hafler1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> or tumors <xref rid="ppat.1002984-Sakuishi2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002984-Fourcade1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Thus, Tim-3 expression on T cells might correlate with T-cell dysfunction and disease pathogenic events. We have recently shown that Mtb infection can induce significant up-regulation of Tim-3 expression in macaques <xref rid="ppat.1002984-Qiu1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, suggesting that Tim-3 might be involved in host immune responses during Mtb infection in primates. However, it is not known whether Tim-3 expression or Tim-3 pathway plays a role in modulating T-cell immune responses during Mtb infection in macaques and humans. Elucidating how Tim-3 regulates anti-Mtb effector functions of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in human TB will help to understand TB immunopathogenesis and have some implications for immune intervention in TB.</p>
              <p>Given that Mtb-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses are important for anti-mycobacterial immunity, and that Mtb infection drives up-regulation of Tim-3 capable of regulating T-cell effector functions, we hypothesize that Tim-3-expressing CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell subpopulations may play a role in modulating host immune responses during Mtb infection in humans. In the current study, we examined the expression of Tim-3 in TB patients in the context of functional characteristics of Mtb-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Surprisingly, we found that Tim-3-expressing CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in active TB patients exhibit polarized effector memory phenotypes and stronger but not impaired anti-mycobacterium effector functions. Our findings therefore may implicate a new paradigm for T-cell immune responses regulated by Tim-3 expression in human TB.</p>

                <p>To characterize phenotypic and functional profiles of Tim-3-expressing CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, we first examined whether Tim-3 was predominantly expressed in effector memory or central memory/naïve T-cell subsets in active TB.

Based on differential expression of CD45RA and CCR7 <xref rid="ppat.1002984-Hamann1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002984-Sallusto1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002984-Champagne1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, 4 distinct T cell populations were classified as naïve T cells (T<sub>naive</sub>, CD45RA<sup>+</sup>CCR7<sup>+</sup>), central memory T cells (T<sub>CM</sub>, CD45RA<sup>−</sup>CCR7<sup>+</sup>), effector memory T cells (T<sub>EM</sub>, CD45RA<sup>−</sup>CCR7<sup>−</sup>), and RA<sup>+</sup>T<sub>EM</sub> (T<sub>EMRA</sub>, also known as terminally differentiated; CD45RA<sup>+</sup>CCR7<sup>−</sup>) cells. We found that most of Tim-3-expressing CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells freshly isolated from TB patients or stimulated <italic>ex vivo</italic> with Mtb peptide pool displayed CD45RA<sup>−</sup>CCR7<sup>−</sup> T<sub>EM</sub> phenotype, but not CD45RA<sup>+</sup>CCR7<sup>+</sup> T<sub>naïve</sub> or CD45RA<sup>−</sup>CCR7<sup>+</sup> T<sub>CM</sub> phenotype(Supporting Information, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002984.s002">Figure S2</xref>), suggesting a polarization of effector memory phenotype for Tim-3-expressing CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in active TB patients.</p>
                <p>Consistently, Tim-3-expressing CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells expressed low levels of CD27 (Supporting Information, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002984.s003">Figure S3A</xref>, B, C) and CD62L (Supporting Information, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002984.s003">Figure S3D</xref>, E, F). In contrast to a lack of CCR7, CD62L, and CD27 expression, however, we found that Tim-3-expressing CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells expressed high levels of CD127, another effector memory surrogate marker (Supporting Information, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002984.s003">Figure S3G</xref> ,H, I). Furthermore, we determined whether Tim-3-expressing CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells expressed CD27<sup>−</sup>CD45RA<sup>−</sup> effector memory phenotype by co-staining Tim-3, CD27 and CD45RA on CD3<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD3<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, respectively.

                <p>Given that Tim-3<sup>High</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell subsets exhibited greater effector functions of producing Th1 cytokines/cytotoxic molecules and limiting intracellular Mtb growth, we sought to determine a potential signaling mechanism underlying the Tim-3-associated enhancements. Since appropriate activation signaling is usually required for efficient T-cell effector functions in responses to Mtb infection <xref rid="ppat.1002984-Koul1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, we hypothesized that greater T effector functions of Tim-3<sup>High</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell subsets during Mtb infection might be driven by stronger intracellular signaling and activation. To test this hypothesis, we measured the phosphorylation of signaling molecules p38, stat3, stat5, and Erk1/2 in Tim-3<sup>High</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell subsets from active TB patients in comparisons with Tim-3<sup>Low</sup> control subsets. Thus, PBMC from 9 active TB patients were directly stained without <italic>ex vivo</italic> Mtb peptide stimulation or stimulated <italic>ex vivo</italic> with Mtb peptide pool, and the phosphorylated (termed P- for simplicity) p38, stat3, stat5, and Erk1/2 were immunologically stained and quantitated by flow cytometry. We found that expression levels of P-p38, P-stat3, P-stat5, and P-Erk1/2 in Tim-3<sup>High</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell subsets were much higher than those in Tim-3<sup>Low</sup> control subsets in cultures with or without Mtb peptide antigen stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002984-g007">Figure 7</xref>).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>In the current study, we have made several interesting observations regarding Mtb infection-induced increases in Tim-3-expressing CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell subsets, Tim-3-related broad effector functions for producing Th1/Th22/cytotoxic cytokines and limiting intracellular Mtb growth, and potential mechanisms underlying Tim-3 signaling-driven enhancements of effector functions. These findings are considered novel as there are no reports, to our knowledge, for in-depth studies of Tim-3-driven T-cell immune responses in active human TB.</p>
              <p>Interestingly, active TB patients exhibit up-regulation of Tim-3 expression and increases in Tim-3-expressing CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, and Tim-3-expressing T cells predominantly displayed a polarized effector memory phenotype (lack of expression of CCR7, CD62L, or CD27) <xref rid="ppat.1002984-Sallusto2" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Consistently, Tim-3-expressing Mtb-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells in active TB patients also express high levels of another effector memory surrogate marker CD127 (IL-7 Receptor α) <xref rid="ppat.1002984-Kaech1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. It is likely that effector memory phenotypes (CD127<sup>+</sup> but CCR7<sup>−</sup>, CD62L<sup>−</sup> and CD27<sup>−</sup>) not only favor Tim-3-expressing T cells for mounting effector functions of anti-microbial cytokine production and cytotoxicity but also facilitate these effector T cells trafficking to Mtb infection sites or inflamed lung tissues <xref rid="ppat.1002984-Sallusto2" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002984-Kaech1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002984-Ali1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. It is noteworthy that the predominant effector memory phenotypes of Mtb-driven Tim-3-expressing CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in active TB patients differ from virus-induced central memory phenotypic Tim-3-expressing CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in HCV- or HIV-1-infected humans <xref rid="ppat.1002984-GoldenMason1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002984-Jones1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002984-McMahan1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. It has been reported that Tim-3-expressing CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells during HCV or HIV-1 infection display either dominant CCR7<sup>+</sup> central memory or CCR7<sup>+</sup> and/or CD27<sup>+</sup> phenotype profiles with no or low expression of effector surrogate marker CD127 <xref rid="ppat.1002984-GoldenMason1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002984-Jones1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002984-McMahan1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. The discrepancy of Tim-3-expressing phenotypes between Mtb-infected and HCV-infected or HIV-1-infected patients might result from the natures of pathogens/infections and distinct immune responses to virus versus mycobacteria. A dominant central memory and a lack of preferential effector phenotypes for Tim-3-expressing T cells in HCV/HIV-1-infected patients may help to explain why the virus-driven Tim-3-expressing CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells do not adequately produce effector cytokines in response to viral peptide stimulation in vitro <xref rid="ppat.1002984-GoldenMason1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002984-Jones1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002984-McMahan1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. In contrast, the predominant effector memory phenotypes of Tim-3-expressing CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in active TB patients are indeed consistent with enhanced effector functions for these Tim-3<sup>High</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> and Tim-3<sup>High</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell subsets.</p>
              <p>The ability of Tim-3<sup>+</sup> T cells to spontaneously produce cytokines in active TB appears to consist with our recent observation that active Mtb infection, but not SIV/SHIV infection or control setting, allows for intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) detection of cytokine production by T cells without the need for <italic>ex vivo</italic> stimulation with Mtb antigens <xref rid="ppat.1002984-Yao1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002984-RyanPayseur1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002984-Zeng1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Such an ability to <italic>de novo</italic> produce cytokines by T cells from Mtb-infected humans or macaques might be due to the fact that a number of T cells have differentiated into highly activated Tim-3<sup>+</sup> effector cells capable of producing cytokines in response to active TB-driven immune activation and inflammation. This notion is also supported by the finding that latent Mtb infection did not induce large numbers of T cells that spontaneously produce cytokines in cultures, as only ≤2.2% and ≤3.5% cells in Tim-3<sup>+</sup> T cells of LTBI subjects were able to produce cytokines after culture with medium and Mtb peptide, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002984-g002">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002984-g003">Figure 3</xref>). The high levels of Tim-3<sup>+</sup>/cytokine<sup>+</sup> T cells in active TB might be attributed partially to the BCG vaccination background in active TB patients, as all these patients had BCG vaccination history.</p>
              <p>The present study uncovers a surprising finding that Tim-3<sup>High</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> and Tim-3<sup>High</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell subsets exhibited greater effector functions for producing Th1/Th22 cytokines and CTL effector molecules. These enhanced effector functions of Tim-3-expressing T cells in TB are not totally unexpected as anti-microbial effector functions of T cells are usually linked to effector or effector memory phenotypes of these T cells <xref rid="ppat.1002984-Bruns1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002984-Sallusto2" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, and such enhanced effector functions appear to reflect the immunological features of effector memory phenotypes for Tim-3<sup>High</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell subsets. Furthermore, enhanced effector functions of Tim-3-expressing T cells are also supported by the results from our mechanistic studies of cellular activation/signaling molecules as Tim-3<sup>High</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell subsets in active TB patients expressed higher levels of phosphorylated signaling molecules p38, stat3, stat5, and Erk1/2. Despite the fact that the downstream molecular activation events for Tim-3 regulation of T cells are largely unknown <xref rid="ppat.1002984-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, the up-regulated expression of phosphorylated signaling molecules in Tim-3<sup>High</sup> T-cell subsets may help to explain stronger effector functions in Tim-3-expressing CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in active TB. The notion that stronger effector functions are driven by greater signaling in Tim-3-expressing T cells is also consistent with a recent finding that Tim-3 may augment T-cell signaling after a short-term stimulation <xref rid="ppat.1002984-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. This connection is also supported by the data from HIV-1-infected humans since impaired phosphorylation of above intracellular signaling molecules correlates with reduced effector functions of Tim-3-expressing CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in HIV infection <xref rid="ppat.1002984-Jones1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. A recent study reported that Tim-3-expressing CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in TB patients produced lower levels of IFN-γ than healthy controls <xref rid="ppat.1002984-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. However, subtle IFN-γ responses were detected in both TB and control groups due to the use of ESAT-6 protein, instead of peptide pool, for in vitro stimulation <xref rid="ppat.1002984-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. It is important to note that CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells respond poorly to whole protein and that recombinant Mtb ESAT-6 protein actually inhibits T-cell production of IFN-γ <xref rid="ppat.1002984-Wang2" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Future studies using MHC I/peptide and MHC II/peptide tetramers will provide a better system in which to elucidate phenotypes and effector functions of Ag-specific Tim-3<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> and Tim-3<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells.</p>
              <p>Our results suggest that Tim-3-expressing CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell subsets possess much broader repertoire of effector functions than what was previously described. Earlier studies implicated that Tim-3 might be an exclusive cell surface marker for Th1 cells <xref rid="ppat.1002984-Zhu1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, and it remains unknown whether Tim-3-expressing CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in human TB could differentiate into Th22 and Th17 subsets capable of mounting immune responses to Mtb infection <xref rid="ppat.1002984-Yao1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002984-Zeng1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. The current study demonstrates that Tim-3-expressing CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells not only can produce Th1 cytokines(IFN-γ, IL-2), but also produce appreciable amounts of IL-22, IL-4 (data not shown), and IL-17A (data not shown), suggesting that Tim-3<sup>High</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell subset in active TB are capable to differentiate into Th1, Th2, Th22/Th17 cells. Interestingly, Tim-3<sup>High</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell subset in active TB also exhibits broad effector functions producing the above cytokines and cytotoxic molecules. Furthermore, human Tim-3-expressing T cells can function as anti-Mtb effector cells limiting intracellular Mtb growth. Our results are consistent with a recent observation that mouse Tim-3-Gal-9 interaction can lead to inhibition of Mtb replication in macrophages <xref rid="ppat.1002984-Jayaraman1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. The broad effector repertoires of Tim-3-expressing CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells might be advantageous from the standpoints of host immune responses to Mtb infection.</p>
              <p>The findings from our mechanistic experiments suggest that Tim-3 signaling pathways help to enhance effector functions of producing Th1, Th22 cytokines and CTL molecules. Particularly, we show that Tim-3 silencing by siRNA Tim-3 leads to reduced <italic>de novo</italic> production of IFN-γ and TNF-α by Tim-3-expressing T cells, and that soluble Tim-3 treatment interfering with membrane Tim-3-ligand interaction can also decrease Tim-3-driven activation and effector functions of cytokine production. On the other hand, we demonstrate that stimulation of Tim-3 signaling pathway by Ab cross-linking of membrane Tim-3 can enhance effector function of IFN-γ production by CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. These findings appear to be inconsistent with what were reported in HCV- and HIV-1-infected patients <xref rid="ppat.1002984-GoldenMason1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002984-Jones1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. It has been implicated that expression of Tim-3 on CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells may be linked to progressive loss of secretion of Th1 cytokines such as IL-2, TNF-α and IFN-γ in HCV and HIV-1 infections <xref rid="ppat.1002984-Jin1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002984-GoldenMason1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002984-Jones1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002984-Ju1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002984-Hafler1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Nevertheless, these Tim-3-associated negative effects can be explained at least partially by the phenotypic features and impaired activation signaling of Tim-3-expresssing CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in those virus-infected persons. Tim-3-expressing CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in HCV- and HIV-1-infected patients predominantly express central memory phenotypes, rather than effector and effector memory phenotypes <xref rid="ppat.1002984-GoldenMason1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002984-Jones1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>; HIV-1 infection leads to impaired Stat5, Erk1/2, and p38 signaling in Tim-3-expressing CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells <xref rid="ppat.1002984-Jones1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. On the contrary, active TB drives predominant effector memory phenotypes and stronger cellular activation signaling. It is likely that HCV or HIV-1 infection preferentially induces Tim-3-associated central memory or non-effector phenotypes with depression or low levels of cellular signaling, whereas Mtb infection can drive effector memory Tim-3-expressing T cells with enhanced Tim-3 signaling pathways for stronger effector functions. It is noteworthy that studies done to date have only identified Gal-9 as Tim-3 ligand <xref rid="ppat.1002984-Sakuishi1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, and precise Tim-3-induced signaling pathways remain incompletely understood <xref rid="ppat.1002984-Sakuishi1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. From these points of views, we cannot exclude the possibility that viral and Mtb infections would engage in independent co-activation signals in T cells and induce potential different Tim-3 ligands in infected target cells.</p>
              <p>It is currently not known whether increased numbers of Tim-3<sup>High</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T effector cells in active TB patients are detrimental or beneficial in active Mtb infection. Given that such increases are seen in the setting of active TB, Tim-3-expressing T cells might act as over-reactive effector cells and contribute to TB inflammation and pathologic lesions. This notion is supported by the finding that healthy subjects with LTBI exhibited much lower levels of Tim-3<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> and Tim-3<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> T effector cells producing cytokines. Over production of IFN-γ and TNF-α by Tim-3-expressing T cells may indeed elevate degree of inflammation or damages in active TB, although mouse IFN-γ and TNF-α are important for controlling Mtb infection <xref rid="ppat.1002984-Bruns1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002984-Cooper2" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002984-Flynn2" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002984-Flynn3" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002984-MacMicking1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002984-Botha1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002984-Dieli1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002984-Clay1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. On the other hand, increases in Tim-3-expressing CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells might result from host responses to high Mtb burden due to postprimary TB or reactivation TB. These responses, although unable to control TB, might develop as disorganized host defense or otherwise reflect protective potential if immune responses to TB can be well coordinated or if pathogenic events leading to high levels of Mtb burden can be intervened. This scenario appears to be supported by the data from the current study since Tim-3-expressing T cells can produce anti-Mtb cytokines IFN-γ/TNF-α/IL-22, and function as effector cells limiting intracellular Mtb growth in macrophages.</p>
              <p>Thus, the current study demonstrate that Tim-3-expressing CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in active TB patients exhibit polarized effector memory phenotypes and stronger, but not impaired, anti-mycobacterium effector functions. Our findings therefore may suggest a new paradigm for T-cell immune responses regulated by Tim-3 expression in human TB, and have implications for potential immune intervention in TB.</p>

(A) is typical flow cytometric dot plots showing the effect of Tim-3 stimulation using anti-Tim-3 mAb on Mtb-specific IFN-γ response of Tim-3<sup>High</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Numbers in dot plots in each of sub-figure show the percentages of IFN-γ<sup>+</sup>Tim-3<sup>High</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells.
