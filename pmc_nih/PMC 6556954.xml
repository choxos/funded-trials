                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">One in three Head Start children is either overweight or obese. We will test the efficacy of an early childhood obesity prevention program, “¡<italic>Míranos</italic>! Look at Us, We Are Healthy!” (¡<italic>Míranos</italic>!), which promotes healthy growth and targets multiple energy balance-related behaviors in predominantly Latino children in Head Start. The <italic>¡Míranos!</italic> intervention includes center-based (policy changes, staff development, gross motor program, and nutrition education) and home-based (parent engagement/education and home visits) interventions to address key enablers and barriers in obesity prevention in childcare. In partnership with Head Start, we have demonstrated the feasibility and acceptability of the proposed interventions to influence energy balance-related behaviors favorably in Head Start children.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">Using a three-arm cluster randomized controlled design, 12 Head Start centers will be randomly assigned in equal number to one of three conditions: 1) a combined center- and home-based intervention, 2) center-based intervention only, or 3) comparison. The interventions will be delivered by trained Head Start staff during the academic year. A total of 444 3-year-old children (52% females; <italic>n</italic> = 37 per center at baseline) in two cohorts will be enrolled in the study and followed prospectively 1 year post-intervention. Data collection will be conducted at baseline, immediately post-intervention, and at the one-year follow-up and will include height, weight, physical activity (PA) and sedentary behaviors, sleep duration and screen time, gross motor development, dietary intake and food and activity preferences. Information on family background, parental weight, PA- and nutrition-related practices and behaviors, PA and nutrition policy and environment at center and home, intervention program costs, and treatment fidelity will also be collected.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">With endorsement and collaboration of two local Head Start administrators, ¡<italic>Míranos</italic>!, as a culturally tailored obesity prevention program, is poised to provide evidence of efficacy and cost-effectiveness of a policy and environmental approach to prevent early onset of obesity in low-income Latino preschool children. <italic>¡Míranos!</italic> can be disseminated to various organized childcare settings, as it is built on the Head Start program and its infrastructure, which set a gold standard for early childhood education, as well as current PA and nutrition recommendations for preschool children.</p>

                <title>Childhood obesity and energy balance-related behaviors</title>
                <p id="Par27">Childhood obesity is a complex, multifactorial health problem that extends into adolescence and adulthood and leads to increased cardiometabolic risks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], as well as psychosocial and economic burdens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. While the epidemic of obesity remains apparent in preschool children in the United States (U.S.) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], young children aged 3–5 from certain racial/ethnic groups and from low-income families are disproportionally affected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. For example, the prevalence of obesity in Hispanic children aged 3–4 enrolled in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) was 19.1% in New York City and 21.7% in Los Angeles County in 2011 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Obesity (accumulation of excessive adipose tissue) results from the imbalance of energy intake and expenditure and the dysregulation of energy balance-related behaviors (EBRBs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. For preschool children, primary EBRBs include dietary behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>],moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], sedentary behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], and sleep [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Latino children possess higher numbers of risk factors for obesity and dysregulation of EBRBs than non-Latino children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par28">It is recommended that preschool children should engage in ≥90 min (min) of MVPA daily [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], including 60 min of structured play and up to several hours of unstructured play, and should not be sedentary for more than 15 min at a time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. However, these recommendations are not widely endorsed and/or implemented by childcare providers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Furthermore, obese children are less active [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and have lower levels of gross motor skills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] compared to their normal-weight peers. A meta-analysis of 29 studies of preschoolers aged 3–5 found that the average MVPA was 42.8 min/day(d) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], while a 2012 review of five prospective studies linked watching TV &gt; 2 hr/d with increased body mass index (BMI) and skinfolds after controlling for PA in preschool children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Alarmingly, U.S. preschool children spend 73–84% of their waking hours sedentary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Recently, insufficient sleep (≤11 h/d) was linked with increased risk for obesity in preschool children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In a large cohort of U.S. children aged 3–12, those sleeping ≥11 h/d at baseline had a 26% lower risk for being overweight compared to those sleeping 9–10 h/d at the 5-year(y) follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The study also found each additional hour of sleep was associated with a reduction of BMI by .12 standard deviation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Not surprisingly, TV watching leads to insufficient sleep in children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Therefore, effective strategies for promoting MVPA and gross motor skills, reducing sedentary behavior and promoting adequate sleep are critical for obesity prevention in preschool children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par29">Available data reveals that American preschool children do not consume a balanced, healthy diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. According to a cross-sectional analysis of 2005–2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), children of all ages scored far below the minimum federal guideline for good health based on a Health Eating Index-2000 score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. A separate analysis using 2-d dietary recalls of 2007–2010 NHANES found that only 0.01 to 29% of children ≤8 y old met the sex- and age-based food group recommendations for total vegetables, whole grains, refined grains, and energy intake from solid fats and added sugars [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par30">Food environment critically influences the formation of eating preferences and habits during preschool years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Modifications of parent feeding practices such as offering healthier foods or reducing energy-dense food can increase the intake of nutritious food and lower total energy intake in preschoolers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Others showed that consuming sugary drinks was found to be associated with obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], while serving water and limiting sugary drinks may reduce obesity in preschoolers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Strategies addressing these dietary practices can reduce excessive energy intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] without interfering with children’s ability to self-regulate their energy intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par31">An integrated approach is urgently needed to combat childhood obesity by addressing key enablers and barriers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] that influence children’s EBRBs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. An emerging consensus points to four key enablers and/or barriers for the successful prevention of obesity in children attending organized childcare: 1) physical activity (PA) and nutrition policy and environment; 2) staff development and training; 3) parental practices/family engagement; and 4) cultural tailoring of intervention delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Because 60% of preschool children in the U.S. attend organized care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], a multi-level, multi-setting approach to address these key enablers and/or barriers holds great promise to prevent obesity in this age group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].</p>

                <title>Development of ¡<italic>Míranos</italic>! Look at us, we are healthy! (¡<italic>Míranos</italic>!)</title>
                <p id="Par32">In collaboration with local Head Start administrators, a multi-disciplinary research team developed and pilot-tested ¡<italic>Míranos</italic>!, a culturally tailored obesity prevention program to address the needs and challenges facing low-income, predominantly Latino preschool children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Head Start is a federal program that provides school readiness and support services (e.g., health, nutrition, social services) to low-income children aged birth to 5 and their families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Alarmingly, one in three Head Start children is overweight or obese [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], a much higher ratio than the national average. Because Head Start focuses on children’s cognitive and social development as well as health, mandates parent involvement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], and proactively promotes PA and healthy eating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>], obesity prevention in this vulnerable population has great potential for long-term impact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Our overarching goal is to take advantage of the synergy of changes at different levels of influence and in multiple settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] to increase the likelihood of developing long-term health habits that reduce daily energy imbalance gaps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] by targeting multiple EBRBs in the childcare setting and at home.</p>
                <p id="Par33">Working with Head Start administrators, staff and parents, we identified two approaches: the Center-Based Intervention (CBI) focusing on modifying the policies, practices, and environment in Head Start centers and the Home-Based Intervention (HBI) targeting parental health practices and the home environment. We used intervention mapping to identify and develop strategies from evidence-based guidelines and recommendations and published studies to target enablers/barriers in childcare and home environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par34">We conducted a series of pilot studies to develop and refine the ¡<italic>Míranos</italic>! intervention program. The design of the intervention was guided by a systems perspective to: 1) map strategies that address the enablers and/or barriers of obesity prevention in Head Start [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]; 2) coordinate a multilevel effort [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] that will target multiple EBRBs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]; 3) identify mediators and moderators between settings and study outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]; and 4) address cultural relevance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. In developing interventions, we utilized: 1) theories of early childhood development to provide children with cognitively and developmentally appropriate activities;<sup>135</sup> 2) social cognitive theory to increase behavioral knowledge and skills and self-efficacy with direct learning, role-modeling and reinforcement in Head Start staff and parents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]; and 3) a socioecological model to conceptualize interventions at the individual, family, organizational and policy levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Key components of these theories applied to the ¡<italic>Míranos</italic>! intervention are presented in the conceptual model depicted in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p><italic>¡Míranos!</italic> Intervention conceptual model</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12887_2019_1541_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>

                <title>Design and study aims</title>
                <p id="Par35">The study will use a cluster randomized controlled design to test the efficacy of the ¡<italic>Míranos</italic>! intervention in preventing excessive weight gain and promoting the development of healthy habits in young children enrolled in Head Start. The primary end point for the study is a change in BMI at the posttest (7 mo from baseline). Using a three-arm design, 12 Head Start centers will be randomly assigned to one of three conditions in equal number: 1) a combined center- and home-based intervention, 2) center-based intervention only, or 3) comparison. The interventions will be delivered by trained Head Staff staff during the academic year. A total of 444 3-year-old children (<italic>n</italic> = 37 per center) will be enrolled in the study in two cohorts at baseline and followed prospectively 1 year post intervention. The first cohort will be recruited between May 2018 and September 2018. The second cohort will be recruited between May 2019 and September 2019. Outcome assessment will be conducted at baseline (T0), immediate post-intervention (T1), and at the one-year post-intervention follow-up (T2; 21 mo from baseline). The assessment at each time point will take up to 4 days to complete at a center, depending on the size of the center enrollment. We will divide the 12 centers into four groups to assure the manageability of data collection and the intervention delivery. Each group includes a center from each condition to control the extraneous conditions (e.g., weather conditions, organizational events) and secular trends. The intervention will commence in the week following the completion of the assessment.</p>
                <p id="Par36">Specific aims and hypotheses of the study are to:</p>
                <p id="Par37">Aim 1: Test the efficacy of the <italic>¡Míranos!</italic> intervention on healthy weight growth measured by BMI change (primary outcome) in normal weight, overweight and obese children. Hypothesis 1: Children in the combined center- and home-based or center-based intervention conditions will have a significantly smaller increase in BMI (kg/m<sup>2</sup>) compared to children in the comparison condition at T1 and T2.</p>
                <p id="Par38">Aim 2: Test the impact of the <italic>¡Míranos!</italic> intervention on children’s PA and dietary behaviors (secondary outcomes). Hypothesis 2: Children in the combined center- and home-based or center-based intervention condition will have significantly higher levels of MVPA, gross motor skills, sleep duration and intakes of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, as well as lower levels of sedentary behavior, TV watching, and intake of sugar/fructose and fat, compared to children in the comparison condition at T1 and T2.</p>
                <p id="Par39">Aim 3: Evaluate the cost-effectiveness (CE) of the <italic>¡Míranos!</italic> intervention. Standard trial-based CE analysis methods will be used to estimate net intervention costs per unit of BMI reduction in each of the treatment groups compared to the control group, from the program provider perspective. Information on the CE of different intervention approaches will help the decision maker (provider/payer of the program) maximize population health subject to the available resources. This critical information is missing in the current literature.</p>

                <title>Study setting, recruitment, and randomization</title>
                <p id="Par40">Two Head Start administrators in San Antonio, Bexar County, Texas have joined the study as collaborators and agreed to randomize their centers as the study sites. Both organizations have previously worked with the study team in developing and piloting the intervention program. The two organizations represented by these administrators oversee 49 Head Start centers with a total enrollment over 2000 children. According to the published eligibility criteria of the Administration for Children and Families of the U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services, “children from birth to age five who are from families with incomes below the poverty guidelines are eligible for Head Start and Early Head Start services.” Children from homeless and foster families and families receiving other forms of public assistance are also eligible. The study eligibility criteria for the centers and children are displayed in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Children will not be excluded from the study if they do not speak English or have limited English proficiency. After discussing the eligibility issues with the two Head Start organizations, the research team determined that three centers from organization A and nine centers from organization B that meet the center inclusion eligibility criteria will become the study sites. Using statistical software R (version 3.3.2), the centers are randomly assigned to one of the three treatment conditions stratified by the organizations and the center enrollment size so that the centers from both organizations are equally represented in the study.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Study eligibility criteria</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td rowspan="4">Center eligibility</td><td>1.

                <p id="Par41">The recruitment of child participants (participant recruitment) will take place during the registration period in the summer and before the baseline assessment in September by sending a recruitment packet to child’s home. The content of the packet includes: <italic>¡Míranos!</italic> study information sheet, recruitment flyer, informed consent form, and a letter from center director and study PIs. Parents/guardians (parents) may either 1) review the information about the <italic>¡Míranos!</italic> study, complete the informed consent form, and return the signed consent form to the center director in a sealed envelope, or 2) take the packets home and mail the signed consent form in a prepaid envelop to the UTSA research team.

                    <p id="Par44">Center policy and environment are modified based on the current evidence-based recommendations and guidelines and represent significant changes to the ongoing practices in Head Start. Both Head Start organizations have endorsed the proposed modifications and will require the center directors to create a daily schedule and change daily routines to facilitate the implementation of the policy changes at all intervention centers. To increase centers’ compliance, the central office curriculum staff have collaborated with the research team to develop written policies and guidelines and to provide training and technical assistance on new policy and practices. The Head Start program follows the meal pattern guidelines of the Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which is based on the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. The research team has worked with food services staff from center kitchens to incorporate the optional best practice recommendations from CACFP that will further improve the nutritional quality of the meals. These best practices include an increase in the serving frequency of fresh fruit, vegetables, and whole grain foods and a reduction in the serving of sugar and fats. Meal modifications for the intervention centers are covered by supplemental funding from the study. Specifically, meal pattern modification includes 1) serving fruit and vegetables at snacks [2–3 times/week]; 2) adding one serving of a dark leafy green, one of an orange/red fresh vegetable, and one legume/bean serving per week; and 3) utilizing more seasonal fruits and vegetables. To assure the success of implementation, the research team and both Head Start organizations have signed a Memorandum of Understanding to confirm their support for and participation in the study.

                    <p id="Par45">Head Start children will participate in daily PA (30-min structured and 60-min non-structured play) during outdoor/indoor play, learning center time, and transitions. Teachers will use <italic>¡Míranos!</italic> Activity Cards (at least one card/day) and equipment supplied by the study to meet the PA goals (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> for samples of Activity Cards). The Activity Cards are written lesson plans to increase MVPA and teach age-appropriate gross motor skills in structured and unstructured group formats for outdoor and indoor settings. The Activity Cards were designed by physical education specialists according to principles of motor development and can also be used during transitions and learning centers. Portions of the Activity Cards are written based on the storylines of 21 children’s books with nutrition and PA themes that can be readily integrated into daily routine activities (e.g., story time, transition). We also created active learning activities (e.g., learning ladders) that combine literacy and numeracy skills with physical activities, which can be used by the learning centers to increase opportunities for PA. Teachers will also use age-appropriate movement music CDs and dance videos that can be used for brain break activities after 15-min sedentary time and provide PA alternatives for indoors and bad weather days. The teachers will identify and include the structured and non-structured activities into their daily lesson plans. We will develop a training DVD to detail lesson implementation and demonstrate gross motor activities to help teachers develop confidence and overcome challenges in leading the activities and to reinforce key concepts from the staff training.</p>

                    <p id="Par46">The Sesame Workshop bilingual Healthy Habits for Life (HHL) resource kit is the primary source for health education. The HHL uses Sesame Street cartoon characters to promote PA and healthy eating in children aged 3–5. There are 9 modules with short, age-appropriate learning activities, hands-on games, and interactive DVD activities (The Get Healthy Now Show) that can be integrated into daily center routines. Each module has a “Did You Know” fact to promote a key health message to children and parents. At least one storybook will be introduced during story time that is related to the weekly topic of the HHL. Head Start teachers will incorporate HHL activities into their daily lesson plans with a goal of using all activities in each module at least once a week. Health contests will be conducted to increase PA and intake of water, fruit, vegetables, and reduce TV watching and sugar-added drinks in accordance with HHL topics. “Did You Know” facts will be displayed with signboards at center entrance and classrooms to promote evidence-based health messages to children and parents.</p>
                    <p id="Par47">The Head Start center directors and teachers will integrate PA and nutrition education activities into daily lesson and routines following the <italic>¡Míranos!</italic> master intervention schedule during the biweekly lesson planning required by Head Start standards of practice. The <italic>¡Míranos!</italic> master intervention schedule shows the coordination and outlines the weekly activities for each component of the CBI. The teachers will submit their lesson plans to the center director for review and feedback. Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref> shows the expectations and goals for Head Start teachers to deliver the center-based activities. To facilitate the integration of the intervention activities by Head Start teachers, we created a <italic>¡Míranos!</italic> eBook that provides weekly intervention schedules, electronic copies of intervention activities, access to online movement music and videos, and online audio/video versions of the children’s storybooks. Each teacher and center director can access the content of the eBook on an Android tablet. Each intervention classroom is equipped with a Smart TV monitor that can be linked to the eBook to display the eBook content (e.g., HHL poems, HHL video, electronic storybooks) and to show GoNoodle videos and other music videos to the children in the classroom for bad weather days and for transition activities.</p>

The staff wellness manual, created based on information provided by the US Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2015 and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, utilizes Knowles’ Principles of Andragogy to establish topic relevance and social cognitive theory to enhance self-efficacy through goal-setting. The manual contains three main sections: 1) physical activity and hydration; 2) fruits and vegetables; and 3) overall wellbeing. Each section provides benefits for each health behavior, evidenced-based recommendations, examples and tips, suggested exercises or recipes, and goal-setting worksheets. Detailed instructions for use are included along with a weekly calendar that assigns staff wellness manual sections and staff wellness challenges to the <italic>¡Míranos!</italic> content at each site. Center-wide staff challenges, initiated by the center director, coincide with the children’s health contests. Each center director will post flyers 1 week prior and during the staff challenge to encourage participation. Posters to track staff progress will be posted in a staff-only area and center directors will report the number of staff who participated in the challenge and who achieved their goal to receive cash incentives for their center. Participation in the staff wellness program is voluntary and coordinated by the center directors.</p>

During the visits, the Family Service Workers will identify needs and issues, devise an improvement plan, if needed, and provide monitoring and support to parents. We will integrate a protocol into three home visits to develop skills and strategies for parents to promote PA, nutrition, screen time, and sleep at home. Each home visit will have two different health topics that Family Service Workers will introduce to the parent. Home Visit 1 will focus on increasing physical activity and limiting screen time, Home Visit 2 on increasing fruit and vegetable intake and limiting sugary drinks, and Home Visit 3 on healthy eating practices and sleep. As part (~ 15 min) of each home visit, the Family Service Worker will review the two health topics with the parent by providing an informational handout. The parent will then choose one of the health topics to set a family goal and develop a <italic>¡Míranos!</italic> Action Plan (a log for parents to document their participation and progress per the Head Start requirement). The Family Service Worker will guide the parents to establish family rules and develop strategies from a menu of evidence-based strategies to achieve their goal and make the home environment more conducive for healthy behaviors. For example, to implement the rule of sleeping ≥10.5 h/d, parents can remove TVs from children’s bedrooms and establish bedtime routines. The Family Service Worker will record the parents’ chosen rules and strategies in the <italic>¡Míranos!</italic> Action Plan and follow-up with parents after 1 month to track progress. At Home Visits 1 and 3, the Family Service Worker will ask parents to complete the Home Environment Questionnaire to identify the availability and accessibility of healthy and unhealthy foods in the home, electronics and play equipment in the home, and child sleep duration and bedtime routines.

All Head Start staff, including teachers, teaching assistants, Family Service Workers, center directors, food service workers, and custodians, will complete a paid training of up to 20 h depending on the roles of the staff in the study. The training includes online didactic education modules on physical activity and nutrition (8 h, required for all staff) and two half-day in-person training sessions (4–12 h, required depending on roles in the study). The in-person training is designed to familiarize the staff with the ¡<italic>Míranos!</italic> intervention protocol and the physical activity and nutrition policy modifications. Training topics include the study overview and protocol (1.5 h); center policy modifications (1 h); intervention program components (1.5–2.5 h); intervention coordination (30 min); physical activity and gross motor skill instruction (50 min); demonstration of <italic>¡Míranos!</italic> gross motor and physical activities for outdoor and indoor settings, transition and active learning activities, and use of equipment (2 h); health/nutrition education and instruction (50 min); demonstration of <italic>¡Míranos!</italic> health education activities, equipment, and supplies (40 min); and administrative issues (1 h).</p>

Each month, the peer educators will attend a training (1.5<italic>)</italic> with the Head Start Education Specialist (ES) or Education Center Coordinator (ECC) assigned to their center to prepare for parent education sessions. During trainings, peer educators will review information about the topic for the session (i.e., Physical Activity Recommendations and Benefits, Balanced Diet Recommendations, Keeping Healthy Foods in the Home, etc.) by watching a short (10–15 min) video, developed by research staff, that leads peer educators through the information displayed on each of the 6 posters for that session. Peer educators will also receive poster scripts, documents that contain key information for each of the posters that peer educators should relay to parents attending the education sessions. The poster scripts reflect the information presented in the training videos and are supplements that the peer educators will use during education sessions. Peer educators will actively practice the session content by role-playing during each training. Peer educators will pair up and take turns playing the role of center parent while the other practices poster content. At the end of each training, ES/ECC will prompt peer educators to discuss anticipated or experienced challenges during education sessions and problem-solve to address any identified challenges for the next education session.</p>
                  <p id="Par58">Booster trainings (5 h) will be conducted to provide additional training based on needs during the year.

IMIL is an obesity prevention program developed for and endorsed by Head Start for increasing the time in MVPA and structured PA and encouraging children to take healthy food choices by educating Head Start staff and parents. Head Start directors and staff can design their own program using activities and materials (games and gross motor activities, one set of play equipment, nutrition activities, and parent newsletters) from an IMIL kit after a brief training by an IMIL facilitator. The control centers will continue using IMIL. Although a classic “no treatment” control is common in RCTs, our study participants and partners are more receptive to a control condition that offers some attention and benefits. All comparison children will get some education on PA and nutrition via IMIL; in addition, we will deliver a literacy education program to children in comparison centers to increase buy-in and retention. The literacy education program, called Book Bites sponsored by a local grocery chain, will include 30-min sessions that incorporate early childhood literacy and nutritional concepts through interactive book reading activities.</p>

In comparison, our proposed CBI and HBI are longer and more intensive. At 1 year post intervention of the HHHJr. study, mean BMI decreased in the intervention group (baseline: Mean = 0.05, SE = 0.05; follow-up: Mean = 0.02, SE = 0.11) and increased in the control group (baseline: Mean = 0.14, SE = 0.05; follow-up: Mean = 0.64, SE = 0.11) with a mean group difference of − 0.53 (mean change of − 0.03 in the intervention and 0.50 in the control group) and intraclass correlation (ρ) of 0.003. With an average SD of 1.147 (1.153 in intervention and 1.141 in control), the δ was − 0.53/1.147 = 0.462. Similar δ and ρ remained at Year 2 follow-up. Similar δ was also reported in successful community- and primary care-based based pilot studies in preschool Latino children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>]. For this study, a sample size of 12 centers (i.e., 4 centers/group) with 29 children per center will achieve 80% power to detect a group difference (i.e., CBI and C&amp;HBI vs. control) of 0.53 BMI units at T1 and T2 using a two-sided t-test with a significance level of 5%, assuming ρ = 0.003 and SD = 1.147 (PASS Version 11, NCSS Kaysville Utah 2011). The final sample size was increased to 37 (&gt; 29/0.8) children per center (i.e., 37 × 12 = 444 children in total) to account for an attrition rate of 80%.</p>

                  <p id="Par69">For Hypothesis 1, we will first calculate the change in BMI at T1 from T0 and at T2 from T0 for each child. We will then compare the difference in change scores among the three intervention groups using ANOVA test or Kruskal-Wallis test at each time point separately. Multiple comparisons defined by various linear combinations of groups (i.e., CBI-control; C&amp;HBI-control) will be performed to exam the difference in change scores with Bonferroni adjustment. To utilize all three measures from each child, generalized linear mixed effects models (GLMMs) will be used to examine the group differences at different time points with BMI as the response variable, and time (3 levels: T0, T1 and T2) and group (3 levels) and their interaction as the explanatory variables. Two random effects will be included in a GLMM: one to account for the correlation among children nested within the same center, and one to account for the three repeated measures of each outcome within the same child. Center size and cohort, as fixed effects, will be included in the model as well. We will also include baseline BMI, child gender and race/ethnicity, and other covariates (e.g., parent characteristics and health behaviors) in the model as needed. Model fit will be assessed by residual diagnostics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>] to guide the best fit model. For Hypothesis 2, we will use the same statistical procedure for testing Hypothesis 1 to analyze the secondary outcome measures (i.e., MVPA, sedentary behavior, TV watching, sleep, and dietary measures), with baseline BMI as a covariate as well to check for differential effect of intervention associated with children’s level of adiposity. When there are missing data, we will compare the dropouts and completers on demographics and various outcome measures using available data. If data are missing at random (MAR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>], standard computational algorithms such as EM implemented in statistical software allow the use of all the data available to generate appropriate parameter estimates. If the MAR assumption is in doubt, we will conduct sensitive analysis to impute missing data using the multiple imputation with chained equations approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>]. Specifically, we will impute missing values by adjusting for time of measurement and demographics to create 10 imputed datasets. We will then combine the effect sizes using the Rubin’s rules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>]. Stata/SE (version 15, College Station, Texas) or SAS (version 9.3, Cary, North Carolina) will be used for conducting all analyses proposed.</p>

Resource utilization and unit costs for the program perspective will be measured by collecting information on: 1) food preparation records and PA equipment; 2) delivery of classroom activities; 3) delivery of HBI; and 4) staff training including peer parent educators and monetary incentives per school. Net intervention costs will be calculated by subtracting usual program costs in absence of the intervention from the intervention costs. All costs will be discounted at 3% per annum where applicable and will be expressed in 2018 U.S. dollars. The CE will be calculated based on mean BMI reduction for each approach using the individual-level data. The cost and health outcome of each approach will be synthesized to calculate incremental CE ratios (in terms of net intervention cost per unit BMI reduction) compared to the next effective approach. Any dominated or weakly-dominated strategy will be excluded. Sampling (or stochastic) uncertainty inherent in the trial-based economic evaluation will be evaluated using cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (CEACs), which estimate the probability that an intervention would be cost-effective under varying ranges of willingness-to-pay thresholds for a unit reduction in BMI. CEACs will be constructed using nonparametric bootstrapping with 2000 replicates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>]. STATA 14 for Windows (StataCorp LP, College Station, Texas) or SAS (version 9.3, Cary, North Carolina) will be used for conducting the bootstrap analyses.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par75">To our knowledge, the <italic>¡Míranos!</italic> intervention is the first preschool obesity prevention study using an integrated approach to address multiple EBRBs in multiple settings in low-income young children in the United States. The design of the study is informed by recent childhood obesity prevention interventions with considerations of programming and methodological issues identified in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>]. Many of these studies, however, were conducted in Australia and European countries. This study will provide much needed information on the cost-effectiveness of an obesity prevention program in a U.S. child care setting.</p>
              <p id="Par76">The design of this study has several important strengths and weaknesses that may influence the validity and generalizability of the study findings. First, this is a clustered RCT with a long-term follow-up assessment that is made possible by the commitment and support of two Head Start organizations. Findings from this study will provide answers to many questions on the impacts of a multi-faceted intervention targeting both the childcare and home environment. Second, <italic>¡Míranos!</italic> CBI will implement a comprehensive set of center policies and staff training that will address many of the enablers and barriers in a childcare setting. The feasibility and acceptability of these evidence-based policies will be critically examined by the process evaluation data. Previous RCT studies have not provided detailed evaluations of these critical issues in a childcare setting. Third, the intervention activities are tailored to address the barriers facing children and families living in low-income and predominantly Latino communities. A lack of cultural tailoring has been identified as a limitation in previous studies. Finally, <italic>¡Míranos!</italic> intervention is grounded in social cognitive and behavioral theories. This study will test the influences of mediators and moderators on the study outcomes based on the intervention model.</p>
              <p id="Par77">The limitations of the study include the problem of concealment. The Head Start staff are not blinded to the treatment assignment. Concealment of the assignment is not possible because of the need to plan intervention logistics with the administrative staff and conduct the staff training before the start of the school year. It is not clear how staff participation will be biased by this practice. We purposefully enhanced the program for the comparison centers to include the provision of the IMIL program and a parent literacy education program. We hope that the use of an active control program will increase the appeal to the comparison participants and retain them in the study. Another limitation is that the data collection staff will also not be blinded to the treatment assignment. This is especially true for the assessment of the second cohort participants since all of the intervention centers will have many visible signs of <italic>¡Míranos!</italic> intervention. We will address this weakness by conducting a standardized protocol of assessment and close monitoring of the measurement of the primary outcome.</p>
              <p id="Par78">Early childhood obesity is a complex health problem especially among low-income and minority children. There is currently limited evidence on effective prevention strategies based on RCTs in this age group. Designed as an efficacy study, the <italic>¡Míranos!</italic> intervention has been tailored for low-income, Latino preschool children and parents following recent recommendations and guidelines for obesity prevention targeting childcare and home environments. As such, the proposed study can contribute to the evidence base on this important public health concern.</p>
