Limited observational studies suggest that healthy eating patterns with red meat are associated with improved quality of life.ObjectiveThe secondary objectives of this randomized crossover controlled-feeding trial were to assess the effects of following a Mediterranean-style eating pattern (Med-Pattern) with different amounts of red meat on indexes of personal well-being (i.e., perceived quality of life, mood, and sleep) in overweight or obese adults. We hypothesized that following a Med-Pattern would improve these outcomes, independent of red meat intake amount.MethodsForty-one participants [aged 46&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;2 y; body mass index (kg/m2): 30.5&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.6;n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;28 women,n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;13 men) were provided Med-Pattern foods for two 5-wk periods separated by 4 wk of self-selected eating. The Med-Red Pattern contained &#x0223c;500 g/wk (typical US intake), and the Med-Control Pattern contained &#x0223c;200 g/wk (commonly recommended intake in heart-healthy eating patterns) of lean, unprocessed beef or pork compensated with mainly poultry and dairy. Baseline and postintervention outcomes measured were perceived quality of life via the MOS 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey, version 2 (SF-36v2), daily mood states via the Profile of Mood States (POMS), sleep perceptions via the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and sleep patterns via actigraphy. Data were analyzed via a doubly repeated-measures ANOVA adjusted for age, sex, and body mass at each time point.ResultsFollowing a Med-Pattern did not change domains of physical health, mental health, total mood disturbances, sleep perceptions, and sleep patterns but improved subdomains of physical health role limitations (SF-36v2: 93.6&#x02013;96.7%;P&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.038), vitality (SF-36v2: 57.9&#x02013;63.0%;P&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.020), and fatigue (POMS: 2.9&#x02013;2.5 arbitrary units;P&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.039). There were no differences between the Med-Red and Med-Control Patterns (time &#x000d7; pattern,P-interaction&#x000a0;>&#x000a0;0.05).ConclusionFollowing a Med-Pattern, independent of lean, unprocessed red meat intake, may not be an effective short-term strategy to meaningfully improve indexes of personal well-being in adults who are overweight or obese.

              <p>Comprehensive literature assessments show that unprocessed red meat consumption is neutral to cardiovascular disease development (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1–3</xref>) and associated risk factors (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Evidence supports that lean unprocessed red meat can be consumed in a healthy eating pattern, such as a Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) or a Mediterranean-style pattern (Med-Pattern), to improve cardiovascular disease risk factor profiles (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6–9</xref>). Yet, it is still commonly recommended to adopt an eating pattern that is low in red meat (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p>
              <p>Observational research suggests that healthy eating patterns including low to moderate intakes of red meat are associated with improved quality of life (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) and may lower the risk of depression (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13–15</xref>). Conclusions about independent associations between red meat intake and quality of life or mental health outcomes are inconsistent (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), but some research suggests a lower risk of depressive symptoms when red meat is consumed in an otherwise plant-based eating pattern (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). A systematic review of dietary counseling interventions of individuals without clinical mental health diagnoses showed that recommendations to lower red meat consumption were less likely to improve depression and anxiety symptoms than typical-intake controls (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). However, there is a paucity of controlled feeding trials that assessed effects of consuming lean unprocessed red meat in the context of healthy eating patterns on multiple indexes of global personal well-being in adults who are overweight or obese and at risk of developing chronic diseases.</p>
              <p>We previously reported that following a Med-Pattern with ∼500 g lean, unprocessed red meat/wk improves cardiovascular disease risk factor profiles in adults who are overweight or obese (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). The secondary objectives were to assess the effects of following a Med-Pattern with red meat amounts that are typical of US residents (∼500 g/wk) (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) or commonly recommended in heart-healthy eating patterns (∼200 g/wk) (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) on multiple indexes of personal well-being. We hypothesized that following a Med-Pattern would improve indexes of personal well-being, including perceived quality of life, daily mood states, and sleep. We also hypothesized that the inclusion of higher-than-recommended amounts of red meat, as lean unprocessed beef and pork, would not influence Med-Pattern–induced improvements in personal well-being.</p>

                <p>The experimental design was a 16-wk randomized, crossover, investigator-blinded, controlled-feeding study. Participants consumed a Med-Pattern for two 5-wk interventions separated by a washout period of ≥4 wk during which the participants resumed their self-selected unrestricted eating patterns. Personal well-being outcomes, as described below, were measured during both baseline weeks while participants consumed their self-selected unrestricted eating pattern and during the last week of each Med-Pattern intervention. Participants were randomly assigned using an online randomization plan generator (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.randomization.com/">http://www.randomization.com/</ext-link>).</p>

                <p>Male and female volunteers [BMI (kg/m<sup>2</sup>): 25–37; aged 30–69 y] were recruited from the Greater Lafayette, Indiana, community via local advertisements (paper flyers and campus e-mail listserv). Participants were excluded if they habitually consumed a Med-Pattern, as indicated by a score &gt;5 on the 14-item Mediterranean Diet Assessment Tool (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Possible scores range from 0 to 14 points. Inclusion criteria were nonsmokers, nondiabetic, self-reported weight stability (±4.5 kg), and consistent physical activity levels for 3 mo before starting the study. Participants were not excluded if they were previously diagnosed with a mental health disorder as long as the condition and/or all medications were stable for ≥6 mo before and throughout the study. Participant depression scores were calculated at baseline 1 using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>).</p>

                <p>All foods were prepared and provided to participants during the dietary interventions by the NIH-supported Indiana Clinical Research Center Bionutrition Facility at Purdue University. The PREDIMED protocol (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) was used to design the menus, which contained either ∼500 g (Med-Red Pattern) or ∼200 g (Med-Control Pattern) of lean, unprocessed beef or pork/wk but similar amounts of seafood and legumes. Further adjustments were required to match energy and macronutrients via manipulation of predominantly poultry and dairy. Subjects were given the option to consume 150 mL self-selected dry red wine daily. Menus were designed to maintain participants’ baseline 1 body mass. Participants completed daily menu check-off lists to record self-reported deviations from prescribed menus. Detailed descriptions of the Mediterranean patterns have been previously published (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) and are available in<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplemental Tables 1 and 2</xref></bold>.</p>

However, our previous results (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), supported by other research (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6–9</xref>,<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>), showed that healthy eating patterns with lean, unprocessed red meat have cardiometabolic benefits for adults who are overweight or obese. It is important to consider how the recommendation to reduce red meat intake influences outcomes beyond indexes of cardiometabolic health. In particular, personal well-being ramifications should be considered given the associations between red meat–containing healthy eating patterns and high quality of life (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) and better mental health symptoms (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). The current results show that adopting a Med-Pattern, independent of red meat intake, may not meaningfully influence indexes of personal well-being in the short term.</p>
              <p>Our present results suggest that the adoption of a Med-Pattern, independent of red meat intake, increases participants’ energy level (i.e., increased vitality, decreased role limitations due to physical health, and decreased fatigue). These results support observational research that suggests that higher adherence to a Med-Pattern allowing up to 150 g total red meat/d is associated with higher vitality scores than is lower adherence (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). However, vitality differences reported between the lowest- and highest-adherence quintiles were modest (&lt;10%) and the vitality scores of the highest-adherence quintile were poor (&lt;70 out of 100%). Similarly, results from longer-term (12-wk) randomized controlled trials using similar Med-Patterns showed improvements of ∼11–15% in vitality scores and postintervention scores remained &lt;70% (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). The vitality scores reported in these studies are similar to the changes (5% increase from baseline) and end of intervention values (63% at postintervention) documented in our study. Vitality scores are commonly lowest and have the most room for improvement out of all quality-of-life parameters, as shown in the mentioned studies as well as ours. Although significant, the clinical relevancy of these modest improvements should be interpreted with caution when making dietary recommendations.</p>
              <p>The effects of adopting healthy eating patterns on mental health are inconsistent. A systematic review of randomized controlled trials noted that various healthy eating patterns were effective at improving depressive symptoms in ∼50% of studies (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Dietary interventions that were focused on reducing red meat, fat, or cholesterol intake were less likely to improve depressive symptoms than typical-intake control interventions (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Our results showed that adopting a Med-Pattern did not improve mental health (except for slight improvements in vitality) and depression scores in the short-term, with or without reductions in red meat intake. The majority of studies included in the previously mentioned systematic review (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), as well as our study, assessed indexes of personal well-being as secondary outcomes in participants who were mentally healthy. At baseline, our participants had good mental health (∼80% out of 100% on the SF36v2) with low levels of depressive mood states (&lt;2 out of 32 au on the POMS). Therefore, our null results are likely attributable to there being little room for improvement in these outcomes. There is need for investigation with regard to how healthy eating patterns, particularly with recommendations to reduce red meat intake, affect individuals with poor mental health [1 in 6 US adults (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>)].</p>
              <p>Poor sleep quantity and quality are independently associated with an increased risk of obesity (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>), cardiometabolic disease (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>), and depression (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). Over the past few decades, sleep duration of individuals living in the United States has decreased and approximately one-third report sleeping &lt;6 h/night (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). The 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee emphasized the need for more research on how dietary intakes affect sleep in concert with cardiometabolic heath (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). Therefore, we explored this paradigm within our tightly controlled feeding trial using survey-measured and machine-measured indexes of sleep. We reported little effect of adopting a Med-Pattern on short-term changes in indexes of sleep, possibly due to the short intervention duration or lack of statistical power to detect changes. Our post hoc power calculations showed that we were &gt;95% powered to detect a large effect size (Cohen's<italic>d</italic> = −0.83) between baseline and after measurements of perceived sleep quality (PSQI) but &lt;20% powered to detect small to medium effect sizes in global sleep scores (PQSI) or sleep efficiency (actigraphy). Adequately powered, longer-term randomized controlled trials are needed to investigate whether healthy eating pattern interventions, such as a Med-Pattern, can meaningfully improve indexes of sleep, particularly in individuals with poor sleep patterns.</p>
              <p>To our knowledge, this study is the first contribution to the literature about the effects of following healthy eating patterns and red meat on indexes of personal well-being. The majority of published research on this topic consist of observational cohort studies that assigned Med-Pattern scoring systems to FFQ data or randomized controlled trials that were dietary counseling based. This study, although short in duration, was a tightly controlled randomized trial in which all foods and beverages were prepared and provided to participants. This feature is strengthened by a ≥95% self-reported dietary compliance rate and a low participant drop-out percentage (&lt;18%). The inclusion and exclusion criteria of this study were designed to achieve the primary goal of assessing cardiometabolic changes, as previously published (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), and did not include measures of quality of life, mental health, or sleep quality. This resulted in a convenience sample of participants who were fair sleepers and mentally healthy, which was likely a contributor to the largely null results.</p>
              <p>Our results support previous literature that shows that the effects of adopting healthy eating patterns, such as a Med-Pattern, on personal well-being are modest and inconsistent. Furthermore, reducing red meat intake does not enhance improvements in indexes of personal well-being related to adopting a Med-Pattern. There is a need to assess how adopting healthy eating patterns, with and without recommendations to reduce red meat intake, influences long-term changes in perceived quality of life, daily mood, and measures of sleep in populations with poor mental health and dysregulated sleep patterns.</p>
