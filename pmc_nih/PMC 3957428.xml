                <p id="P2">Long-term diet influences the structure and activity of the trillions of
microorganisms residing in the human gut<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>, but it
remains unclear how rapidly and reproducibly the human gut microbiome responds
to short-term macronutrient change. Here, we show that the short-term
consumption of diets composed entirely of animal or plant products alters
microbial community structure and overwhelms inter-individual differences in
microbial gene expression. The animal-based diet increased the abundance of
bile-tolerant microorganisms (<italic>Alistipes, Bilophila</italic>, and
<italic>Bacteroides</italic>) and decreased the levels of Firmicutes that
metabolize dietary plant polysaccharides (<italic>Roseburia, Eubacterium
rectale</italic>, and <italic>Ruminococcus bromii</italic>). Microbial
activity mirrored differences between herbivorous and carnivorous
mammals<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>, reflecting
trade-offs between carbohydrate and protein fermentation. Foodborne microbes
from both diets transiently colonized the gut, including bacteria, fungi, and
even viruses. Finally, increases in the abundance and activity of
<italic>Bilophila wadsworthia</italic> on the animal-based diet support a
link between dietary fat, bile acids, and the outgrowth of microorganisms
capable of triggering inflammatory bowel disease<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. In concert, these results demonstrate that the
gut microbiome can rapidly respond to altered diet, potentially facilitating the
diversity of human dietary lifestyles.</p>

          </front>
          <body>
            <p id="P3">There is growing concern that recent lifestyle innovations, most notably the
high-fat/high-sugar “Western” diet, have altered the genetic composition
and metabolic activity of our resident microorganisms (the human gut
microbiome)<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. Such diet-induced
changes to gut-associated microbial communities are now suspected of contributing to
growing epidemics of chronic illness in the developed world, including obesity<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>
and inflammatory bowel disease<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. Yet,
it remains unclear how quickly and reproducibly gut bacteria respond to dietary change.
Work in inbred mice shows that shifting dietary macronutrients can broadly and
consistently alter the gut microbiome within a single day<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. By contrast,
dietary interventions in human cohorts have only measured community changes on
timescales of weeks<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> to
months<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>, failed to find
significant diet-specific effects<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>, or
demonstrated responses among a limited number of bacterial taxa<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>.</p>
            <p id="P4">Here, we examined if dietary interventions in humans can alter gut microbial
communities in a rapid, diet-specific manner. We prepared two diets that varied
according to their primary food source: a “plant-based diet”, which was
rich in grains, legumes, fruits, and vegetables; and an “animal-based
diet”, which was composed of meats, eggs, and cheeses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). We picked
these sources to span the global diversity of modern human diets, which includes
exclusively plant-based and nearly exclusively animal-based regimes<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> (the latter being the case among some
high-latitude and pastoralist cultures). Each diet was consumed <italic>ad
libitum</italic> for five consecutive days by six male and four female American
volunteers between the ages of 21–33, whose body mass indices ranged from
19–32 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). Study volunteers were observed for four days before
each diet arm to measure normal eating habits (the baseline period) and for six days
after each diet arm to assess microbial recovery (the washout period; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Extended Data Fig. 1</xref>).
Subjects’ baseline nutritional intake correlated well with their estimated
long-term diet (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table
3</xref>). Our study cohort included a lifetime vegetarian (see
<italic>Supplementary Discussion</italic>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Extended Data Fig. 2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 4</xref> for a detailed analysis of his diet and gut
microbiota).</p>
            <p id="P5">Each diet arm significantly shifted subjects' macronutrient intake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a–c</xref>). On the animal-based diet, dietary
fat increased from 32.5±2.2% to 69.5±0.4% kcal and
dietary protein increased from 16.2±1.3% to 30.1±0.5%
kcal (p&lt;0.01 for both comparisons, Wilcoxon signed-rank test; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 5</xref>). Fiber
intake was nearly zero, in contrast to baseline levels of 9.3±2.1 g/1,000kcal.
On the plant-based diet, fiber intake rose to 25.6±1.1 g/1,000kcal, while both
fat and protein intake declined to 22.1±1.7% and
10.0±0.3%, respectively (p&lt;0.05 for all comparisons).
Subjects’ weights on the plant-based diet remained stable, but decreased
significantly by day 3 of the animal-based diet (q&lt;0.05, Bonferroni-corrected
Mann-Whitney U test; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Extended Data
Fig. 3</xref>). Differential weight loss between the two diets cannot be explained
simply by energy intake, as subjects consumed equal numbers of calories on the plant-
and animal-based diets (1,695±172 kcal and 1,777±221 kcal, respectively;
p=0.44).</p>
            <p id="P6">To characterize temporal patterns of microbial community structure, we performed
16S rRNA gene sequencing on samples collected each day of the study (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 6</xref>). We
quantified the microbial diversity within each subject at a given time-point
(α-diversity) and the difference between each subjects' baseline and
diet-associated gut microbiota (β-diversity) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.
1d,e</xref>). Although no significant differences in α-diversity were
detected on either diet, we observed a significant increase in β-diversity that
was unique to the animal-based diet (q&lt;0.05, Bonferroni-corrected Mann-Whitney U
test). This change occurred a single day after the diet reached the distal gut
microbiota (as indicated by the food tracking dye; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Extended Data Fig. 3a</xref>).
Subjects’ gut microbiota reverted to their original structure 2 days after the
animal-based diet ended (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>).</p>
            <p id="P7">Analysis of the relative abundance of bacterial taxonomic groups supported our
finding that the animal-based diet had a greater impact on the gut microbiota than the
plant-based diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). We hierarchically
clustered species-level bacterial phylotypes by the similarity of their dynamics across
diets and subjects (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary
Methods</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary
Tables 7 and 8</xref>). Statistical testing identified 22 clusters whose abundance
significantly changed while on the animal-based diet, while only 3 clusters showed
significant abundance changes while on the plant-based diet (q&lt;0.05, Wilcoxon
signed-rank test; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table
9</xref>). Notably, the genus <italic>Prevotella</italic>, one of the leading
sources of inter-individual gut microbiota variation<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> and hypothesized to be sensitive to long-term fiber
intake<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>, was reduced in our vegetarian subject during
consumption of the animal-based diet (see <italic>Supplementary Discussion</italic>). We
also observed a significant positive correlation between subjects’ fiber intake
over the past year and baseline gut <italic>Prevotella</italic> levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Extended Data Fig. 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 10</xref>).</p>
            <p id="P8">To identify functional traits linking clusters that thrived on the animal-based
diet, we selected the most abundant taxon in the three most-enriched clusters
(<italic>Bilophila wadsworthia</italic>, Cluster 28; <italic>Alistipes
putredinis</italic>, Cluster 26; and a <italic>Bacteroides sp</italic>., Cluster
29), and performed a literature search for their lifestyle traits. That search quickly
yielded a common theme of bile-resistance for these taxa, which is consistent with
observations that high fat intake causes more bile acids to be secreted<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>.</p>
            <p id="P9">Analysis of fecal SCFAs and bacterial clusters suggests that macronutrient shifts
on both diets also altered microbial metabolic activity. Relative to the plant-based
diet and baseline samples, the animal-based diet resulted in significantly lower levels
of the products of carbohydrate fermentation and a higher concentration of the products
of amino acid fermentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a,b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 11</xref>). When we
correlated subjects’ SCFA concentrations with the same-day abundance of
bacterial clusters from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, we found
significant positive relationships between clusters composed of putrefactive
microbes<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> (<italic>i.e</italic>. <italic>Alistipes
putredinis</italic> and <italic>Bacteroides</italic> spp.) and SCFAs that are the
end products of amino acid fermentation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Extended Data Fig. 5</xref>). We also observed significant positive
correlations between clusters comprised of saccharolytic microbes<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> (<italic>e.g</italic>.
<italic>Roseburia</italic>, <italic>E. rectale</italic>, and <italic>F.
prausnitzii</italic>) and the products of carbohydrate fermentation.</p>
            <p id="P10">In order to test whether the observed changes in microbial community structure
and metabolic end products were accompanied by more widespread shifts in the gut
microbiome, we measured microbial gene expression using RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). A
subset of samples was analyzed, targeting the baseline periods and the final 2 days of
each diet (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Extended Data Fig.
1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table
12</xref>). We identified several differentially-expressed metabolic modules and
pathways during the plant- and animal-based diets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Tables 13 and 14</xref>).
The animal-based diet was associated with increased expression of key genes for vitamin
biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>); the degradation of
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>), which
are carcinogenic compounds produced during the charring of meat<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>; and the increased expression of
β-lactamase genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>). Metagenomic
models constructed from our 16S rRNA data<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> suggest that the observed expression differences are due to a
combination of regulatory and taxonomic shifts within the microbiome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Tables 15 and
16</xref>).</p>
            <p id="P11">We next hierarchically-clustered microbiome samples based on the transcription
of KEGG orthologous groups<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>, which
suggested that overall microbial gene expression was strongly linked to host diet.
Nearly all of the diet samples could be clustered by diet arm (p&lt;0.003,
Fisher’s exact test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>), despite the
pre-existing inter-individual variation we observed during the baseline diets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Extended Data Fig. 6a,b</xref>). Still,
subjects maintained their inter-individual differences on a taxonomic level on the diet
arms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Extended Data Fig. 6c</xref>).
Of the three RNA-Seq samples on the animal-based diet that clustered with samples from
the plant-based diet, all were taken on day 3 of the diet arm. In contrast, all RNA-Seq
samples from the final day of the diet arms (day 4) clustered by diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>).</p>
            <p id="P12">Remarkably, the plant- and animal-based diets also elicited transcriptional
responses that were consistent with known differences in gene abundance between the gut
microbiomes of herbivorous and carnivorous mammals, such as the tradeoffs between amino
acid catabolism versus biosynthesis, and in the interconversions of phosphoenolpyruvate
(PEP) and oxaloacetate<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g,h</xref>). The former pathway favors amino acid
catabolism when protein is abundant<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>,
and we speculate that the latter pathway produces PEP for aromatic amino acid synthesis
when protein is scarce<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. In all 14
steps of these pathways, we observed fold-changes in gene expression on the plant- and
animal-based diets whose directions agreed with the previously reported differences
between herbivores and carnivores (p&lt;0.001, Binomial test). Notably, this
perfect agreement is not observed when the plant- and animal-based diets are only
compared to their respective baseline periods, indicating that the expression patterns
in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g,h</xref> reflect functional changes from both
diet arms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table
17</xref>).</p>
            <p id="P13">Our findings that the human gut microbiome can rapidly switch between
herbivorous and carnivorous functional profiles may reflect past selective pressures
during human evolution. Consumption of animal foods by our ancestors was likely
volatile, depending on season and stochastic foraging success, with readily available
plant foods offering a fallback source of calories and nutrients<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. Microbial communities that could
quickly, and appropriately, shift their functional repertoire in response to diet change
would have subsequently enhanced human dietary flexibility. Examples of this flexibility
may persist today in the form of the wide diversity of modern human diets<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>.</p>
            <p id="P14">We next examined if, in addition to affecting the resident gut microbiota, either
diet arm introduced foreign microorganisms into the distal gut. We identified foodborne
bacteria on both diets using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The cheese and cured meats
included in the animal-based diet were dominated by lactic acid bacteria commonly used
as starter cultures for fermented foods<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>: <italic>Lactococcus
lactis</italic>, <italic>Pediococcus acidilactici</italic>, and
<italic>Streptococcus thermophilus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.
4a</xref>). Common non-lactic acid bacteria included several
<italic>Staphylococcus</italic> taxa; strains from this genus are often used when
making fermented sausages<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. During
the animal-based diet, three of the bacteria associated with cheese and cured meats
(<italic>L. lactis</italic>, <italic>P. acidilactici</italic>, and
<italic>Staphylococcus</italic>) became significantly more prevalent in fecal
samples (p&lt;0.05, Wilcoxon signed-rank test; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Extended Data Fig. 7c</xref>),
indicating that bacteria found in common fermented foods can reach the gut at abundances
above the detection limit of our sequencing experiments (on average 1 in
4×10<sup>4</sup> gut bacteria; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 6</xref>).</p>
            <p id="P15">We also sequenced the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the rRNA
operon from community DNA extracted from food and fecal samples to study the
relationship between diet and enteric fungi, which to date remains poorly characterized
(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 18</xref>).
Menu items on both diets were colonized by the genera <italic>Candida</italic>,
<italic>Debaryomyces</italic>, <italic>Penicillium</italic>, and
<italic>Scopulariopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref> and
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Extended Data Fig. 7a</xref>),
which are often found in fermented foods<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. A <italic>Penicillium</italic> sp. and <italic>Candida</italic>
sp. were consumed in sufficient quantities on the animal- and plant-based diets to show
significant ITS sequence increases on those respective diet arms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Extended Data Fig. 7b,c</xref>).</p>
            <p id="P16">Microbial culturing and re-analysis of our RNA-Seq data suggested that foodborne
microbes survived transit through the digestive system and may have been metabolically
active in the gut. Mapping RNA-Seq reads to an expanded reference set of 4,688 genomes
(see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Methods</xref>)
revealed a significant increase on the animal-based diet for transcripts expressed by
food-associated bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b–d</xref>) and
fungi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>; q&lt;0.1, Kruskal-Wallis
test). Many dairy-associated microbes remained viable after passing through the
digestive tract, as we isolated 19 bacterial and fungal strains with high genetic
similarity (&gt;97% ITS or 16S rRNA) to microbes cultured from cheeses fed
to the subjects (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table
19</xref>). Moreover, <italic>L. lactis</italic> was more abundant in fecal cultures
sampled after the animal-based diet, relative to samples from the preceding baseline
period (p&lt;0.1; Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test). We also detected an overall increase
in the fecal concentration of viable fungi on the animal-based diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f</xref>; p&lt;0.02; Mann-Whitney U test).
Interestingly, we detected RNA transcripts from multiple plant viruses <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Extended Data Fig. 8</xref>). One plant
pathogen, Rubus chlorotic mottle virus, was only detectable on the plant-based diet
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4g</xref>). This virus infects spinach<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>, which was a key ingredient in the
prepared meals on the plant-based diet. These data support the hypothesis that plant
pathogens can reach the human gut via consumed plant matter<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>.</p>
            <p id="P17">Finally, we found that microbiota changes on the animal-based diet could be
linked to altered fecal bile acid profiles and the potential for human enteric disease.
Recent mouse experiments have shown high-fat diets lead to increased enteric deoxycholic
concentrations (DCA); this secondary bile acid is the product of microbial metabolism
and promotes liver cancer<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>. In our
study, the animal-based diet significantly increased the levels of fecal DCA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). Expression of bacterial genes encoding
microbial bile salt hydrolases, which are prerequisites for gut microbial production of
DCA<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>, also exhibited
significantly higher expression on the animal-based diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>). Elevated DCA levels in turn, may have contributed to the microbial
disturbances on the animal-based diet, as this bile acid can inhibit the growth of
members of the Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes phyla<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>.</p>
            <p id="P18">Mouse models have also found evidence that inflammatory bowel disease can be
caused by <italic>B. wadsworthia</italic>, a sulfite-reducing bacterium whose production
of H<sub>2</sub>S is thought to inflame intestinal tissue<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. Growth of <italic>B. wadsworthia</italic> is stimulated
in mice by select bile acids secreted while consuming saturated fats from milk. Our
study provides several lines of evidence confirming that <italic>B. wadsworthia</italic>
growth in humans can also be promoted by a high-fat diet. First, we observed <italic>B.
wadsworthia</italic> to be a major component of the bacterial cluster that increased
most strongly while on the animal-based diet (C28; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.
2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table
8</xref>). This <italic>Bilophila</italic>-containing cluster also showed
significant positive correlations with both long-term dairy (p&lt;0.05; Spearman
correlation) and baseline saturated fat intake (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 20</xref>), supporting the proposed link to
milk-associated saturated fats<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>.
Second, the animal-based diet led to significantly increased fecal bile acid
concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Extended Data Fig. 9</xref>). Third, we
observed significant increases in the abundance of microbial DNA and RNA encoding
sulfite reductases on the animal-based diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.
5d,e</xref>). Together, these findings are consistent with the hypothesis that
diet-induced changes to the gut microbiota may contribute to the development of
inflammatory bowel disease. More broadly, our results emphasize that a more
comprehensive understanding of diet-related diseases will benefit from elucidating links
between nutritional, biliary, and microbial dynamics.</p>

on this diet included pork rinds, cheese, and salami. Ingredients for the

Subjects' food items were manually transferred from digital spreadsheets

Samples were kept at −80°C until DNA extraction with the

                <title>OTU clustering</title>
                <p id="P26">We used clustering to simplify the dynamics of thousands of OTUs into a
limited number of variables that could be more easily visualized and manually
inspected. Clustering was performed on normalized OTU abundances. Such
abundances are traditionally computed by scaling each sample's reads to
sum to a fixed value (<italic>e.g</italic>. unity); this technique is intended
to account for varying sequencing depth between samples. However, this standard
technique may cause false relationships to be inferred between microbial taxa,
as increases in the abundance of one microbial group will cause decreases in the
fractional abundance of other microbes (this artifact is known as a
“compositional” effect<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>). To avoid compositional biases, we employed an alternative
normalization approach, which instead assumes that no more than half of the OTUs
held in common between two microbial samples change in abundance. This method
uses a robust (outlier-resistant) regression to estimate the median OTU
fold-change between communities, by which it subsequently rescales all OTUs.</p>
                <p id="P27">To further simplify community dynamics, we only included in our
clustering model OTUs that comprised 95% of total reads (after ranking
by normalized abundance). Abundances for each included OTU were then converted
to log-space and mediancentered.</p>
                <p id="P28">We computed OTU pairwise distances using the Pearson correlation (OTU
abundances across all subjects and time points were used). The resulting
distance matrix was subsequently input into Scipy's hierarchical
clustering function ('fcluster'). Default parameters were used
for fcluster, with the exception of the clustering criterion, which was set to
'distance', and the clustering threshold, which was set to
'0.7'. These parameters were selected manually so that cluster
boundaries visually agreed with the correlation patterns plotted in a matrix of
pairwise OTU distances.</p>
                <p id="P29">Statistics on cluster abundance during baseline and diet periods were
computed by taking median values across date ranges. Baseline date ranges were
the 4 days preceding each diet arm (i.e. days −4 through −1).
Date ranges for the diet arms were chosen so as to capture the full effects of
each diet. These ranges were not expected to perfectly overlap with the diet
arms themselves, due to the effects of diet transit time. We therefore chose
diet arm date ranges that accounted for transit time (as measured by food
dye; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Extended Data Fig.

ended 1 day before the last diet arm meal reached the gut. These criteria led
microbial abundance measurements on the plant-based diet to span days
2–4 of that study arm, and animal-based diet measurements to span days

subsequent analysis. High-quality reads (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 12</xref>
for sequencing statistics) were mapped using SSAHA2<sup><xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>, to our reference bacterial database and the Illumina
adaptor sequences (SSAHA2 parameters: “-best 1 -score 20
-solexa”). The number of transcripts assigned to each gene was then
tallied and normalized to reads per kilobase per million mapped reads (RPKM). To
account for genes that were not detected due to limited sequencing depth, a
pseudocount of 0.01 was added to all samples. Samples were clustered in Matlab
(version 7.10.0) using a Spearman distance matrix (commands: pdist, linkage, and
dendrogram). Genes were grouped by taxa, genomes, and KEGG orthologous groups
(KOs) by calculating the cumulative RPKM for each sample. HUMAnN<sup><xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> was used for metabolic reconstruction
from metagenomic data followed by LefSe<sup><xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>
analysis to identify significant biomarkers. A modified version of the
“SConstruct” file was used to input KEGG orthologous group
counts into the HUMAnN pipeline for each RNA-Seq dataset. We then ran LefSe on
the resulting KEGG module abundance file using the “-o 1000000”
flag.</p>

                <p id="P32">We used Bowtie 2 read alignment program<sup><xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> and the Integrated Microbial Genomes (IMG; version 3.5)
database<sup><xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> to map RNA-Seq reads to a
comprehensive reference survey of prokaryotic, eukaryotic, and viral genomes.
Our reference survey included all 2,809 viral genomes in IMG (as of version
3.5), a set of 1,813 bacterial and archaeal genomes selected to minimize strain
redundancy<sup><xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>, and 66 genomes spanning
the Eukarya except for the plants and non-nematode Bilateria. Reads were mapped
to reference genomes using Bowtie, which was configured to analyze mated
paired-end reads, and return fragments with a minimum length of 150bp and a
maximum length of 600bp. All other parameters were left to their default values.
The number of base pairs in the reference genome dataset exceeded
Bowtie's reference size limit, so we split the reference genomes into
four subsets. Each read was mapped to each of these four subreference datasets,
and the results were merged by picking the highest-scoring match across the
sub-references. We settled tied scores by randomly choosing one of the
best-scoring matches. To more precisely measure the presence or absence of
specific taxa, we next filtered out reads that mapped to more than reference
sequence. Raw read counts were computed for each reference genome by counting
the number of reads that mapped to coding sequences according to the IMG
annotations; these counts were subsequently normalized using RPKM scaling. Our
analysis pipeline associated several sequences with marine algae, which are
unlikely to colonize the human gut. We also detected a fungal pathogen
exclusively in samples from subjects consuming the animal-based diet

misidentified cheese fungus, due to its relatedness to

µL of a 2:1 solution of N,Obis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide and
chlorotrimethylsilane and analyzed by GC-MS. The identities of individual bile
acids were determined by comparison of retention time and fragmentation pattern
to known standards. Both the ratio of cholest-3-ene to deoxycholic acid in the
sample and the amount of internal standard to be added were determined by
integrating peak areas. A known amount of the internal standard, 5®-
cholestane-3®-ol (5®-coprostanol), was added to the second half
of the sample (0.003– 0.07 mmol). The bile acids in the second half of
the sample were converted to their corresponding trimethylsilyl ether
derivatives by the addition of 35 µL of a 2:1 solution of
N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide and chlorotrimethylsilane and analyzed
by GCMS. Amounts of individual bile acids were determined by dividing integrated
bile acid peak area by the internal standard peak area, multiplying by the
amount of internal standard added, and then dividing by half of the mass of
fecal matter extracted. In the event that the first half of the sample contained
cholest-3-ene, the coprostanol peak area in the second half of the sample was
corrected by subtracting the area of the cholest-3-ene peak, determined by
applying the cholest-3-ene:deoxycholic acid ratio calculated from the first half

(ITS1f<sup><xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> and ITS2<sup><xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>) focused on the ITS1 region because it

reactions using 1 ul of the preceding PCR product as the template. In each round
of PCR, sample reactions were performed in triplicate and then combined.
Barcoded amplicons were cleaned, quantified and pooled to achieve approximately
equal amounts of DNA from each sample using methods identical to those used for
