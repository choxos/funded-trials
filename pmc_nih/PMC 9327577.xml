                  <title>Question</title>
                  <p>Does a sleep health education program for children and parents in Head Start improve childhood sleep and related outcomes?</p>

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>This stepped-wedge cluster randomized clinical trial of 519 parent-child (aged 3 years at enrollment) dyads assessing the effects of a 2-week classroom curriculum for children, 1-hour parent workshop, and 1-on-1 parent discussions at home or school yielded largely negative 9- and 12-month outcomes for children’s sleep duration and difficulties and caregiver sleep, attitudes, self-efficacy and beliefs.</p>

                  <title>Importance</title>
                  <p>Preschool-aged children often lack sufficient sleep and experience sleep difficulties. A consistent bedtime routine, falling asleep alone, and other sleep practices reduce difficulties and increase sleep duration.</p>

                  <title>Objective</title>
                  <p>To evaluate the effects of a preschool-based sleep health literacy program on children’s sleep duration and difficulties and on parent sleep knowledge, attitudes, self-efficacy, and beliefs 9 and 12 months after the program.</p>

                  <title>Design, Setting, and Participants</title>
                  <p>This stepped-wedge cluster randomized clinical trial was implemented across the 2018-2019 school year. Head Start preschool personnel delivered interventions and collected outcomes data at baseline and 4 follow-ups. Seven Head Start agencies across New York State were randomized to implement interventions in either fall 2018 or winter and spring 2019. Outcomes were ascertained at 9- and 12-month follow-up. From March 19 through September 28, 2018, Head Start staff recruited (a) English- or Spanish-speaking parents (b) of children 3 years of age on or about September 2018 (c) who planned to remain at the site through the school year. Altogether, 519 parent-child (aged 3 years) dyads completed baseline and (any) follow-up data.</p>

                  <p>Outcomes were the pre- vs postintervention differences measured at baseline and 9-month follow-up for parent-reported child school-night sleep duration per sleep logs, mild or moderate sleep difficulties per a validated questionnaire, and the total and domain scores for parent sleep knowledge, attitudes, self-efficacy, and beliefs. A modified intention-to-treat analysis excluding participants with only baseline data was used.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>The mean (SD) age at enrollment of 519 children was 2.7 (0.1) years, 264 (50.9%) were girls, 196 (37.8%) lived in Spanish-speaking households, and 5 (0.9%) identified as Alaskan Native or American Indian, 17 (3.2%) as Asian American or Pacific Islander, 57 (10.8%) as Black, 199 (37.8%) as White, and 63 (12.0%) as other. Mean sleep durations increased nonsignificantly from baseline by 5.6 minutes (95% CI, −2.3 to 13.6 minutes; <italic>P</italic> = .17) at 9-month follow-up and by 6.8 minutes (95% CI, 0.2-13.7 minutes; <italic>P</italic> = .06) at 12-month follow-up. There was a slight improvement in parental knowledge (1.13 unit increase from baseline; 95% CI, 0.13-2.12 units), but no significant outcomes for parent sleep attitudes (0.16 unit increase from baseline; 95% CI, −0.46 to 0.77 units), self-efficacy (−0.13 unit decrease from baseline; 95% CI, −1.02 to 0.76 units) and beliefs (−0.20 unit decrease from baseline; 95% CI, −0.56 to 0.16 units). Intervention effects for child sleep difficulties were not significant (odds ratio, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.62-2.09). Fewer than 1 in 4 parents accurately perceived their child’s sleep difficulty at 12 months.</p>

              <p>There is growing attention to sleep health in general<sup><xref rid="zoi220668r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> and pediatric<sup><xref rid="zoi220668r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220668r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220668r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> populations. Research in preschool children (approximately 2.5-5 years of age) has prioritized home-based interventions,<sup><xref rid="zoi220668r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> or interventions targeting obesity rather than sleep as a primary outcome.<sup><xref rid="zoi220668r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Despite sleep health disparities,<sup><xref rid="zoi220668r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220668r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> population samples have lacked racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic diversity.<sup><xref rid="zoi220668r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Half of the nation’s preschoolers attend early childhood programs,<sup><xref rid="zoi220668r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> in which promoting sleep health is endorsed by parents and staff.<sup><xref rid="zoi220668r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220668r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220668r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> The federal Head Start early childhood program serves approximately 700 000 diverse, lower-income preschoolers and their families. Research in Head Start finds that healthy sleep improves cognitive and social-emotional function,<sup><xref rid="zoi220668r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> and a randomized clinical trial (RCT) of parent and classroom education resulted in 30 minutes’ longer sleep duration at the 1-month follow-up.<sup><xref rid="zoi220668r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Despite evidence that sufficient quality sleep promotes development and brain function, Head Start does not routinely promote sleep health literacy. One reason may be lack of adequate evidence that sleep routines can be changed, sleep problems reduced, and parent knowledge about sleep improved. Thus, we conducted a primary prevention trial of sleep health interventions in Head Start. This RCT of multilevel interventions grounded in the social and ecological model<sup><xref rid="zoi220668r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220668r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> examined the following 3 outcomes at the 9- and 12-month follow-up: (1) child sleep duration, (2) child sleep difficulties, and (3) parent knowledge, attitudes, self-efficacy, and beliefs (KASB) regarding children’s sleep.</p>

                <p>Head Start agencies from urban, suburban, and rural areas across New York State were selected based on having implemented low health literacy education programs (eg, oral health, obesity prevention).<sup><xref rid="zoi220668r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220668r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220668r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220668r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> This implementation approach from the Health Care Institute at the Anderson School of Management (University of California, Los Angeles) builds Head Start agency capacity to both collect data and implement interventions. The present report follows the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/consort/" ext-link-type="uri">CONSORT</ext-link>) reporting guideline for RCTs. The Office of Human Research Affairs at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York, approved this study. Head Start staff obtained informed consent from participants, and the recruiting staff signed and dated consents on participants’ behalf. Participants were not compensated but received a study-branded child-sized blanket. Agencies received funds to host study-related events (eg, refreshments for the parent workshop).</p>

                <title>Design</title>
                <p>We conducted a pragmatic, stepped-wedge cluster RCT. (Pragmatic trials evaluate the effectiveness of interventions under actual practice conditions.) The trial protocol and statistical plan are available in <xref rid="note-ZOI220668-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 1</xref>. Head Start agencies were randomly assigned to wedge 1 (4 agencies) or wedge 2 (3 agencies). The 23 sites within those agencies collected data at baseline, before and after intervention implementation in wedges 1 and 2 (fall of 2018 and early in 2019, respectively), and at the 1-year follow-up (September 2019) (eFigure in <xref rid="note-ZOI220668-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 2</xref>).

                <p>The study was implemented across the 2018 to 2019 school year. Head Start staff in each wedge received half-day trainings 1 month prior to implementing the ECSEP 1-hour parent workshop, 2-week classroom curriculum, and guided sleep health flip chart discussion (<xref rid="zoi220668t1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Classroom lessons and materials (eg, teddy bear, book) were provided to every classroom in buildings where there were study participants. Parents of all children in classrooms exposed to the intervention were invited to a parent workshop, which may or may not have been in the same building as the classroom. Thus, more parents and children were exposed to ECSEP and related interventions than participated in the study.</p>

The 10th item asked caregivers (yes vs no) whether their child had sleep difficulties. Hypothesized differences between intervention vs control periods were (a) lower mean total scores, (b) lower odds of scores being 8 or higher, and (c) fewer parents reporting a sleep problem (yes vs no) in the 10th item on the Tayside questionnaire.

                  <title>Analysis</title>
                  <p>We conducted a modified intention-to-treat analysis that excluded participants with only baseline data. Summary statistics of continuous variables were calculated as means and SDs; frequency distributions (number and percentage) were calculated for discrete variables. To analyze treatment effects, we fitted generalized linear mixed models with the study outcome variables as dependent variables, an indicator for postintervention status, indicators for the study phase (follow-ups 1-4, baseline as the reference category), and covariates to adjust for age, child sex, Hispanic ethnicity, and race. Random intercepts at the agency and participant levels were included. For continuous outcomes (sleep duration, questionnaire scale scores) the identity link and gaussian distribution were used. The coefficient of the postintervention indicator was the estimate of the mean treatment effect and is presented along with its 95% CI. For dichotomous outcomes (positive Tayside questionnaire score, parent-reported sleep problem), the logit link with a Bernoulli distribution was used. In this model, the treatment was the odds ratio (exponentiated coefficient) of the postintervention indicator, presented with its 95% CI. All analyses were conducted with Stata, versions 16.1 and 17 (StataCorp LLC). A 2-sided value of <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05 or a 95% CI excluding 0 was considered statistically significant.</p>

Hispanic ethnicity was associated with less sleep at follow-up 3 (mean decrease, −33.8 minutes; 95% CI, −45.7 to −21.9 minutes) and at follow-up 4 (mean decrease, −32.4 minutes; 95% CI, −43.9 to −20.9 minutes). The time effects (ie, follow-up 1 minus follow-up 4) factored out the phase effects (ie, intervention). Moreover, an effect modification analysis showed similar non-significant effects among children whose baseline school-night sleep duration was less than 10 hours at follow-up 3 (intervention effect, 4.9-minute increase, 95% CI, −9.6 to 19.5 minutes) or follow-up 4 (intervention effect, 8.7-minute increase, 95% CI, −5.1 to 22.4 minutes). In additional analyses with all logs, not just logs with at least 4 of 5 weeknights, the intervention was similarly associated with nonsignificant mean increases of 5.1 minutes at follow-up 3 (95% CI, −2.7 to 13.0 minutes; <italic>P</italic> = .20) and 6.4 minutes at follow-up 4 (95% CI, −0.5 to 13.2 minutes; <italic>P</italic> = .07).</p>

We included an indicator for each of the 23 sites (in addition to random effects for 7 agencies), as well as person-level covariates (eg, language, ethnicity, and race), and site setting as urban vs rural per US Census data. At the participant level, we evaluated effects of participant language (English vs Spanish), Tayside questionnaire total and sleep difficulty scores at baseline, and total Tayside questionnaire score at the observation point. None of these adjustments led to a different estimate of the intervention effect. The adjusted mean sleep duration at baseline was 25 minutes (95% CI, 0.0-51.6 minutes) shorter in the rural site than in urban sites. However, because this finding was based on a single site, this result may not generalize.</p>

Sleep duration was missing for 75 children at baseline, 70 at follow-up 1, 102 at follow-up 2, and 165 at follow-up 3. We performed multiple imputation by chained equations, with 75 replicates, and applied the Rubin rules, obtaining an intervention effect estimate of 7.8 minutes (95% CI, 0.2-15.4 minutes). In addition, because the data may well be missing not at random, we performed a best case sensitivity analysis in which preintervention missing sleep durations were set to the child’s shortest observed, and postintervention missing sleep durations were set to the longest observed. Missing values of Hispanic ethnicity were set to non-Hispanic, and missing values of sex to female because these categories were more favorable in the observed data. Under these optimistic imputations, the estimated intervention effect was 10.0 minutes (95% CI, 4.7-15.4 minutes).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>This sizeable prospective stepped-wedge cluster RCT implemented a sleep health literacy program for children and parents in Head Start. Assessment of child sleep duration, child sleep difficulties, and parent KASB score outcomes at 9 and 12 months of follow-up failed to show clinically meaningful effects at the individual level. The primary outcome, nighttime sleep duration, increased to clinically insignificant means of 5.6 minutes at 9 months (primary outcome) and 6.8 minutes at 12 months. The intervention led to a slight improvement in parental knowledge, but not in attitudes, self-efficacy, or beliefs. Although child sleep difficulties decreased over time, this decrease was independent of the intervention, perhaps attributable to age or attrition effects. The findings remained essentially unchanged when analyses were adjusted for several covariates (eTable 3 in <xref rid="note-ZOI220668-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 2</xref>). Moreover, an effect modification analysis showed a similarly small effect among children whose baseline school-night sleep duration was less than 10 hours. Findings of this trial have implications for the content focus and sustained impact of sleep education programs and potential for population- vs individual-level impacts.</p>
              <p>Child sleep difficulties were prevalent: two-thirds of children met criteria for sleep difficulties at baseline and nearly half met the criteria 1 year later. However, few parents thought their child had a sleep problem even after exposure to interventions (weighted average of wedge 1 and wedge 2, 12.5% at baseline and 8.7% at 12-month follow-up). This gap between parent perceptions and measures of child sleep problems is consistent with prior research.<sup><xref rid="zoi220668r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220668r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220668r45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> A review of parent knowledge concluded that “more effort . . . be made to ensure that parents understand children’s sleep requirements, what represents good sleep hygiene and also signs of sleep problems.”<sup><xref rid="zoi220668r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Future parent education may require both reinforcement over time and sharper focus regarding what constitutes a sleep problem.</p>
              <p>There is limited translational research on early childhood sleep health or sleep problems in nonclinical sample populations. A previous trial in Head Start of the ECSEP (alone) conducted by our research team found 30-minute increased sleep duration, but no KASB changes, after 1 month.<sup><xref rid="zoi220668r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> The shorter follow-up period in that trial, and that developers of the ECSEP delivered the intervention, may underlie the difference in results. In another trial, school nurses delivered sleep hygiene education, including behavioral sleep strategies, to parents of children 5 years of age with behavioral sleep problems. The intervention group experienced fewer sleep difficulties compared with controls at 6 months (standardized effect size, −0.2; 95% CI, −0.4 to −0.04) but not at 12 months (standardized effect size, −0.9; 95% CI, −2.2 to 0.4). Similarly, school-night sleep duration was longer in their intervention group at 6 months (mean difference, 10.9 minutes; 95% CI, 3.4-18.5 minutes) but not at 12 months (mean difference, −0.8 minutes; 95% CI, −0.83 to 6.8 minutes).<sup><xref rid="zoi220668r46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> Thus, research suggests that sleep education programs will require reinforcement over time along with serial monitoring of parent (eg, KASB) and child (eg, Tayside questionnaire, sleep logs) outcomes.</p>
              <p>Small increments in sleep duration during early childhood may have population level effects because sleep affects the developing brain.<sup><xref rid="zoi220668r47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220668r48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup> Our hypotheses of increased sleep duration of 30 minutes after 9 months (follow-up 3) and of 15 minutes after 1 year (follow-up 4) came from studies finding that 30 to 35 minutes’ extra sleep conferred attention and emotional benefits<sup><xref rid="zoi220668r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> and neurobehavioral gains equivalent to 2 developmental years.<sup><xref rid="zoi220668r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> Those were small studies (&lt;80 participants) of typically developing school-aged children (7-12 years of age) whose sleep was experimentally manipulated across 3 to 5 nights. In real-world conditions, 5 to 7 minutes’ longer nightly sleep across months or years in early childhood may prove meaningful, particularly because nighttime sleep normatively decreases 5 minutes per year between ages 2 and 6 years.<sup><xref rid="zoi220668r49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup> Our precision estimates ranged from 2 minutes’ less nighttime sleep to nearly 14 minutes’ more nighttime sleep.

                <title>Strengths and Limitations</title>
                <p>This study has strengths, including a large sample size, multiple sites, repeated measurements, a racially and ethnically diverse population, and 1 year of follow-up. Intervention materials were either previously tested (ie, the ECSEP) or collaboratively developed, thus increasing acceptability. Most important, this pragmatic trial evaluated the effectiveness of interventions under real-world conditions.<sup><xref rid="zoi220668r54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref></sup> Site staff delivered interventions that met curriculum goals and during the individual and monthly group parent meetings required by Head Start. In addition, fidelity data were consistent with the pragmatic trial.</p>
                <p>The limitations of this study included those associated with stepped-wedge trials, such as respondent burden and practice effects of repeated measures.<sup><xref rid="zoi220668r55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref></sup> The study also lacked objective estimates of sleep duration (eg, actigraphy) although the baseline sleep duration (approximately 10.4 hours) matched that reported by nearly 3000 parents of children aged 3 and 4 years in Head Start.<sup><xref rid="zoi220668r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Additional more systematic fidelity data would provide further context for the interpretation of results.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>The findings from this large, stepped-wedge cluster randomized clinical trial—although largely negative—have implications for the sustained impact, focus, and potential population-level effects of sleep education programs. Sleep education may need to become part of recurrent health-promotion efforts starting in early childhood and continuing through high school. Regarding Head Start specifically, this would mean promoting sleep health similarly to how oral health is promoted, which involves, for example, regular toothbrushing lessons for children. To narrow the gap between parent perceptions and scored ratings of children’s sleep difficulties, the recognition of sleep problems should be central. Finally, data are needed to better understand whether and how small increments of sleep across months and years in early childhood affect development.</p>
