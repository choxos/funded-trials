                  <title>Design:</title>
                  <p>This was a 5-week pilot randomised trial with three groups: in-person grocery shopping, shopping online and shopping online with ‘default’ carts. Participants were asked to shop normally in Week One, according to group assignment in Weeks Two–Four (intervention period), and as preferred in Week Five. All groups received diabetes-friendly recipes via email each intervention week.</p>

                  <p>Sixty-two participants completed the exit survey and fifty-five submitted receipts all 5 weeks. Forty utilised recipes, 95 % of whom indicated recipes were somewhat or very useful. Orange chicken, quesadillas and pork with potato and apples were the most liked recipes. Most Defaults group participants accepted at least some default cart items. Recipes with the highest default acceptance were whole grain pasta and chicken, quesadillas with black beans and chicken with olives. Participants’ primary concerns about the intervention were costs associated with online shopping, inability to select preferred foods and some recipes including ingredients household members would not eat.</p>

          <body>
            <p>In recent estimates, 35 % of adults met criteria for pre-diabetes and 13 % have been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in the USA<sup>(<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>)</sup>. In an observational study of US adults (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> 9939), people living with diabetes had lower healthy eating index scores than people without diabetes<sup>(<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>)</sup>, a known risk factor for adverse metabolic and general health outcomes<sup>(<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>)</sup>. It has been suggested that nutrition interventions which result in improvements in diet quality and significant weight loss reduce diabetes-related health risks<sup>(<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>)</sup> and engender remission for people with pre-diabetes and diabetes<sup>(<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>)</sup>. However, challenges remain in identifying clinically meaningful dietary interventions that are feasible, acceptable and implementable<sup>(<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>)</sup>. Grocery purchases and food selections precede consumption and are strongly correlated with diet quality<sup>(<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>)</sup>. By identifying strategies that make it easier to select and prepare recommended foods, we may be able to promote intake of meals that align with a diet for people with or at-risk for type 2 diabetes.</p>
            <p>In a 2018 review, Jilcott Pitts <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>. summarised that online grocery shopping may offer opportunities for improving food purchases through ‘reduced unhealthy impulse purchases’ and ‘nutrition labelling strategies’<sup>(<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>)</sup>. Conversely, online grocery shopping may have the unintended consequence of decreasing health-promoting purchases, given participants’ hesitance to rely on other people to select their produce and fears around losing money on a product they may not eat<sup>(<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>)</sup>. In an analysis of 137 shoppers from Maine, researchers found that online grocery shopping was associated with lower spending on candy and desserts than shopping in-person<sup>(<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>)</sup>, and in a study of 310 Maryland residents, participants reported purchasing sweets less frequently online than in-store<sup>(<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>)</sup>. However, in the latter study participants also reported purchasing fruits and vegetables less frequently online. Researchers have also raised concerns around retailers marketing ultra-processed sweet and savoury snacks online and how that might impact purchases<sup>(<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>)</sup>. The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic had a tremendous influence on the online food retail market, with more retailers expanding to online platforms and increased retail sales and customers<sup>(<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>)</sup>. Current market research projections suggest that the number of online grocery users is expected to continue to increase year-over-year<sup>(<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>)</sup>. Overall, more research is needed on the potential of the online grocery shopping environment to promote healthy eating, with recent increases in online grocery shopping highlighting the timeliness of such questions.</p>
            <p>Patients with or at-risk for diabetes are one population who may benefit from health promotion efforts in the context of online grocery shopping. Patients with diabetes have reported that ‘unhealthy food is hard to give up,’ ‘nutrition education is difficult to access’ and that ‘it is hard to know what food is healthy’<sup>(<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>)</sup>. Taken together, there is an opportunity to explore interventions that may promote diets recommended for people with or at-risk for type 2 diabetes in an online shopping environment, with initial emerging support for behavioural economic intervention approaches.</p>
            <p>Nudges are one type of behavioural economic intervention that could be introduced in an online grocery shopping environment to promote healthier purchases. Gustafson <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>. randomised 184 adults with no specific dietary needs to in-store grocery shopping, online shopping with no support and online shopping with nudges to encourage participants to shop online and purchase more fruits and vegetables (e.g. meal ideas, recipes, online support group). They found that those who shopped online and received nudges spent more on fruits and vegetables than participants in the in-store or online-only group, without spending more on their grocery bill overall<sup>(<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>)</sup>. Their team reported 70 % adherence across the 8-week study period and provided preliminary evidence that online shopping with nudges may improve food purchasing behaviours.</p>
            <p>Another potential behavioural economic strategy is optimal defaults. Default options are pre-determined or automatic choices. Research has shown that optimal default options increase the likelihood of engaging in a target behaviour (e.g. organ donation, ordering healthier side dishes)<sup>(<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>)</sup>. In a meta-analysis comparing the impact of default options on numerous behaviours, optimal defaults were found to exert a stronger influence on consumer behaviours than pro-environmental behaviours, and defaults related to food choice were particularly promising<sup>(<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>)</sup>. Coffino <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>. recently conducted three pilot studies that explored using prefilled, ‘default’ grocery carts to improve the nutritional quality of grocery purchases specifically<sup>(<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>–<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>)</sup>. In their first study, undergraduates that shopped with prefilled carts purchased more nutrient-dense foods and fewer calories than a nutrition education group in a hypothetical grocery purchasing task<sup>(<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>)</sup>. In two follow-up studies, people who used food pantries and lived in single-resident households were randomised to receive default grocery carts or nutrition education in a single session (study one)<sup>(<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>)</sup> or for 5 weeks (study two)<sup>(<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>)</sup>. Researchers found the default intervention group purchased more nutrient-dense groceries than the nutrition education control in the single time-point study<sup>(<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>)</sup> and over time in the 5-week study<sup>(<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>)</sup>. Given previous success using optimal defaults to improve consumer behaviour more broadly<sup>(<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>)</sup> and specifically to improve grocery selections among undergraduates<sup>(<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>)</sup> and people with financial constraints<sup>(<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>)</sup>, default options may also help other populations make healthier grocery purchases when shopping online.</p>
            <p>Our study differs from the Coffino <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>. and Gustafson <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>. research described above in several ways that extend their findings. First, our study focused on a population with or at-risk for type 2 diabetes and promoted a diet recommended for this population, which broadens the use of defaults to potentially prevent and improve a disease state. To test this approach in the context of everyday shopping, participants in this study did not attend appointments in the laboratory, were not restricted on the amount they could spend or the number of people living in their home and were free to shop in their own environment at their preferred time during the week. Participants were randomised to one of three groups: (1) in-person grocery shopping (‘Control’, <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> 21), (2) online grocery shopping (‘Online’, <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> 21) and (3) online shopping with prefilled ‘default’ grocery carts (‘Defaults’, <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> 23). Participants shopped as usual in Week One of the study, per their group assignment in Weeks Two through Four, and however they preferred in Week Five. All participants received recipes tailored to a diet for people with or at-risk for type 2 diabetes, and the Defaults group had their online grocery carts prefilled with recipe ingredients during each week of the 3-week intervention period. Overall, participants in the Defaults group had improvements in the nutritional quality of grocery purchases compared to participants in the Control and Online groups<sup>(<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>)</sup>.</p>
            <p>In this article, we discuss measures and outcomes specifically relating to the feasibility and implementation of this study. Implementation outcomes have been conceptualised and defined as acceptability (satisfaction with intervention), appropriateness (perceived usefulness), feasibility (practicability), adoption (uptake), cost, fidelity (adherence), penetration (level of spread) and sustainability (long-term durability)<sup>(<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>)</sup>. Previous studies on default interventions present some evidence in support of implementation success, such as high participant acceptance of default items and low dropout<sup>(<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>–<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>)</sup>. Given the emerging evidence supporting the promise of default interventions in the context of online grocery shopping, it is important to report additional data on feasibility and implementation to refine these interventions before implementing and evaluating them on a larger scale. Information, such as effective recruitment strategies, participants’ liking and perceived usefulness of study recipes, acceptance of default grocery cart items by recipe and willingness to use recipes and shop online in the future, could be beneficial to researchers interested in designing online grocery interventions, particularly for those that incorporate default options. Therefore, the goal of this article is to describe relevant components of implementation for this intervention and highlight next steps for subsequent studies to build upon these learnings.</p>

              <p>Study enrolment data were collected from eligibility screeners which included items that indicated whether participants met the inclusion criteria as well as how the participant heard about the study. To measure enrolment feasibility, we calculated the proportion of eligible participants out of the total screened, the proportion of those eligible that enrolled and the proportion of enrolled participants recruited through each method to help researchers identify the best recruitment tactics for future studies and consider potential changes to some eligibility criteria<sup>(<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>)</sup>.

Although grocery stores were designated an essential service and most remained open during US lockdowns, the research team had concerns over how food shortages, limited store hours and store closures may impact the grocery purchasing experience during this time. Eleven participants (17 %) were recruited and completed all study procedures in early 2020, and the remaining 54 (83 %) were enrolled after recruitment started again in May 2020.</p>

Social media advertisements were posted on Facebook once per month from June–October of 2020 and cost $360 USD total, with promotional costs ranging from $70 to $120 per post depending on level of engagement. Posts were also shared, but not promoted monetarily, through our laboratory’s Twitter account. Twenty-three percentage of participants were recruited through listservs or websites, including advertisements sent to email lists maintained by our division, the Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute Buffalo Research Registry, the university’s i2b2 listserv<sup>(<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>)</sup> and postings on our laboratory website.

At the time the study was designed, the online grocery platform used in this study was not accepting any food assistance benefits online; therefore, we excluded people receiving SNAP/WIC from this pilot as they might not have been able to shop online. We also excluded people that did not make purchases from the two largest retailers in the region as there were logistical challenges to populating the prefilled grocery carts with the same or similar default food options across multiple retailers each week.</p>

                  <p>Research staff adapted publicly available DASH diet recipes for this study (e.g. recipes from Mayo Clinic, EatingWell, etc.), which were then edited by a registered dietitian (author JM) to ensure alignment with recommendations for people with or at-risk for type 2 diabetes. Recipes were designed to be applicable to all participants regardless of gender, activity level and disease severity. For this reason, we chose not to adhere to rigid guidelines for calories or specific nutrients, rather we had target ranges for calories, Na, carbohydrates and saturated fat. We aimed for the following parameters for each serving: 45–60 g of carbohydrates, 400–500 calories, variety and balance of food groups (whole grains, fruits, non-starchy vegetables, lean proteins, low-fat dairy), adequate fibre and moderate or low in saturated fat and Na.</p>

Four to nine default ingredients were added to the participants’ carts each week.</p>
                  <p>For a measure of intervention integrity, participants in the Defaults group were asked if they saw the prefilled carts in the online grocery shopping platform (yes/no) in the exit survey. To measure intervention acceptance and appropriateness, exit surveys included an item on whether Defaults participants found the prefilled carts to be useful (not useful at all, somewhat useful, very useful). Research assistants independently double-coded the food receipt data to determine if the Defaults group purchased none (0), some (1) or all (2) of the default items placed into their online shopping carts. For an item to be considered an accepted default, the item had to be accepted exactly as is without modification. For example, if a participant substituted a 16-oz orange juice for a 64-oz orange juice, it was not considered an acceptance of the default, given the participant would have made a modification. Once research assistants coded the receipts, discrepancies were reconciled by a third reviewer, and proportions were calculated to determine the percentage of the sample purchasing none, some or all default items placed into the online shopping carts by week and by recipe.

                <p>The most frequent positive feedback on study recipes was that they were easy to follow. Across all groups, participants received three recipes per week, and some articulated a desire to receive more. Some participants expressed specific recipes and food items (e.g. lentils, quinoa) did not fit with their preferences or their family’s preferences which limited usefulness of those recipes, ‘<italic toggle="yes">Some were tasty. Some were things that I would not eat or be able to convince anyone in my house to eat, Lentil Stew, for example</italic>’. This feedback aligns with descriptive statistics that suggest lentil and quinoa dishes were the least likely to be cooked and enjoyed by participants.</p>

                <p>Of the participants that reported grocery shopping online during the study period (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> 43), most rated the experience as excellent (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> 12, 28 %) or good (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> 16, 37 %), some rated it as OK (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> 12, 28 %) and three rated the experience as poor (7 %). A majority of Online and Defaults participants randomised to grocery shop online during the study period adhered to those instructions for all or most of their shopping (Table <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). In the follow-up survey, two Control participants reported grocery shopping online at least once, which was confirmed by their food receipts. Of the forty-three participants that reported grocery shopping online, 28 % (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> 12) indicated they will not grocery shop online again, 70 % (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> 30) indicated they will do some grocery shopping online and one person indicated they will do all grocery shopping online in the future. There were no group differences on willingness to use online grocery shopping in the future (Table <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">4</xref>).</p>

              <p>Findings from this study suggest that it was feasible to implement an optimal defaults intervention to improve the nutritional quality of grocery purchases for people with or at-risk for diabetes<sup>(<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>)</sup> and collect all study data remotely. Most participants found the methods, data collection and prefilled default grocery carts to be acceptable and useful. Opportunities to further improve participant satisfaction and compliance include providing a greater variety of recipes and default items and/or tailoring recipes and default items to participant and household preferences as well as making improvements to the food receipt forms and/or using a different data collection format for grocery purchasing data.</p>
              <p>Fifty-five (83 %) of our participants had complete protocol adherence, including submitting receipts across all study weeks. A strength of this study is the high rate of participant compliance and retention, though findings should be replicated in longer, larger studies. A systematic review of 174 longitudinal cohort studies reported that ‘flexibility in data collection methods might be most effective in maximizing retention’<sup>(<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>)</sup>. Allowing participants to consent, shop and submit data remotely by email and/or telephone calls may have encouraged compliance and retention and may be a way for researchers to deliver grocery interventions in the future. Another strength is that this study is consistent with other researchers’ findings that suggest providing behavioural economic interventions (e.g. nudges, defaults) through an online grocery shopping platform is feasible and may improve the nutritional quality of purchases<sup>(<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>–<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>)</sup> and extends these findings to support a population with or at-risk for type 2 diabetes.</p>
              <p>A limitation of this study is the homogeneity of the sample, which is predominantly white and college educated. There are several ways to open eligibility criteria in the future to improve heterogeneity. Given that 25 % of people that completed the eligibility screener were excluded for not shopping at one of the study stores, future research could modify or extend the stores that are included, with an eye towards stores in under-resourced neighbourhoods. In the present study, two of the largest grocery chains in the researchers’ geographic area were selected as study stores, to broaden external validity to the extent possible for a pilot study. That decision also helped with the feasibility of filling default grocery shopping carts. Since the design of this study, additional grocery stores are available on the online grocery platform used in this study, offering the potential to include other study stores in the future.</p>
              <p>In addition, 134 people that completed the eligibility screener were excluded for receiving SNAP/WIC benefits. At the time this study was designed, the grocery platform used for this study did not accept electronic benefits as a form of payment and therefore the research team did not want to recruit participants that may not be able to shop online. Since then, SNAP purchasing pilots have expanded, and many retailers are approved to accept SNAP online<sup>(<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>)</sup>. Limits remain for WIC redemption, though the agency supports the transition and has a pilot underway to inform online expansion<sup>(<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>)</sup>. While the current findings have limited generalisability to people with lower-income or people receiving SNAP/WIC, previous research specifically recruited food pantry clients and found prefilled grocery carts to be an effective intervention for improving the nutritional quality of participants’ purchases during a single laboratory visit<sup>(<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>)</sup> and over time<sup>(<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>)</sup>. Future research should aim to recruit a more heterogeneous sample, including people from under-resourced communities, people receiving SNAP and people from racially and ethnically minoritised groups to augment our understanding of whether online grocery shopping interventions are desirable and equitable<sup>(<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>)</sup>.</p>
              <p>Food purchases are an antecedent to food consumption and are strongly correlated with diet quality<sup>(<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>)</sup>. However, another limitation of this study is that food purchases were the only outcome measured over time. In the overarching study, researchers calculated nutritional quality scores to confirm whether participants’ grocery purchases were aligned with recommendations for people with or at-risk for diabetes, and results suggested the Defaults intervention improved the nutritional quality scores based on the receipt data submitted<sup>(<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>)</sup>. However, receipts were not collected for all food purchases (e.g. purchases made at restaurants, corner stores, farmers markets’) and we did not measure actual intake objectively verified with laboratory values (e.g. blood glucose). Future research could collect additional purchasing and intake data and measure laboratory values that would confirm participants are consuming food they purchase during the study and improving health outcomes. Better understanding aspects of implementation, such as default acceptance and study feasaibility, was an exploratory aim reported on in this article. In the future, researchers could design their studies to comprehensively assess aspects of implementation from the outset of a study.</p>
              <p>About 65 % of participants used study recipes, with greater usage in the Defaults group, in which 86 % reported using recipes. Nutrition and cooking education is a widely used strategy to improve dietary outcomes for people with or at-risk for diabetes and one of the best known examples is the diabetes prevention program<sup>(<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>)</sup>. Researchers have suggested that these strategies may be more effective when paired with behavioural interventions or embedded within a multi-component strategy, than when implemented as a standalone intervention<sup>(<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>)</sup>. In our study, we found that nudging participants to purchase specific foods via the default carts also encouraged them to use the healthier recipes that provided instructions on how to prepare those ingredients. This is one example of how behavioural economic interventions may work synergistically with established cooking and nutrition education programs like the diabetes prevention program.</p>
              <p>Most participants in the Defaults group accepted at least one of the ingredients in the default carts each week (82–95 %) which also suggests that the intervention may be acceptable to participants. Out of the standard recipes, acceptance was highest for whole grain pasta and grilled chicken, chicken quesadillas and grilled chicken and olives. Researchers interested in conducting a similar study could use the study recipes most liked by participants (Table <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) with the highest default acceptance (Table <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">4</xref>) and can refer to the primary outcome paper to access a detailed description of recipe ingredients<sup>(<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>)</sup>. That said, while defaults are meant to make it easier for participants to eat more of the nutritious foods they may not already be eating, future studies could also consider innovative ways to provide recipes and populate grocery carts with items that may be more appetising or familiar to participants. One participant suggested ‘<italic toggle="yes">offering a menu of recipes and choices</italic>’ which provides the opportunity for customisation. Instead of assigning the same recipes to everyone, participants could rate a variety of recipes on liking and willingness to consume, and the recipes they rate the highest could be used to populate their default carts.</p>
              <p>Most participants in the Online and Defaults groups were compliant and shopped online, though some continued to supplement online shopping with in-person shopping, and not all participants liked shopping online. One participant dropped out of the study because they did not want to shop online, and of those who shopped online during the study, 28 % indicated they did not plan to shop online in the future. While online grocery shopping is expected to continue to grow<sup>(<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>)</sup> and most participants indicated they would do at least some of their shopping online, not everyone wants to shop using those platforms and previous research suggests this may be particularly true for people with lower income who have heightened concerns around cost and food waste<sup>(<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>–<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>)</sup>. Therefore, researchers could also consider options for adapting prefilled grocery carts for in-store shoppers. Although some shoppers want to go to a physical store to inspect, select and purchase foods, they may still be willing to use a mobile application or website that prepopulates recipes and grocery lists with default items and could use that tool to guide their shopping. Previous qualitative studies found that mothers with low income already search online for new recipes and are open to using this technology, especially if it allows for customisation<sup>(<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>)</sup>.</p>
              <p>The most frequent complaint from participants was challenges with the food receipt form, the tool used to collect food purchasing details that may not be included on a receipt (e.g. product weight, size, quantity or brand). Potential solutions could include partnering with an online platform to see the exact product(s) participants purchased or using food tracking or grocery shopping applications that allow participants to scan barcodes and create food diaries or shopping lists from their purchases, which may be more user-friendly. This study highlights the need for technological and practical advancements that improve the process of collecting purchasing data from participants and reduce the time it takes for study staff to conduct nutritional analysis of receipt data, not just for studies of grocery defaults, but to benefit the broader food purchasing literature.</p>
              <p>In this pilot randomised controlled trial, we found that an optimal defaults intervention aiming to improve grocery purchases using prefilled default grocery carts is an acceptable, feasible and desirable intervention for many people with or at-risk for type 2 diabetes. Using the lessons learned from this study, extension of this research may include expanding inclusion criteria to recruit a more heterogeneous sample, providing participants with more recipe options, prepopulating default carts with items that may be more desirable to participants and members of their household and streamlining the process for collecting detailed receipt data. Future research could increase the study period beyond 5 weeks to identify whether compliance and retention remain high over longer periods of time and whether long-term dietary change is possible. Implementing recommendations identified in this pilot study may increase the likelihood of continued adherence to the study protocol and defaults recommendations.</p>
