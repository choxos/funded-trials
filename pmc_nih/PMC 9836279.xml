                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>The main expectations revolved around access to health-related information, including information on STIs, HIV, and PrEP as well as on how one can protect themselves while engaging in sex work. Initial concerns were around potential breach of confidentiality and fear of arrest. The main facilitators for session attendance were the motivation to learn health-related information, the attitude of facilitators, and the incentives received for participation, whereas main challenges were related to family commitments and work schedules. WESW appreciated the group format of the intervention and found the location and times of the intervention delivery acceptable.</p>

                  <p>Overall, our findings suggest that the HIV risk reduction intervention was appropriate and acceptable to WESW. Yet, WESW experience unique concerns and barriers that need to be accounted for when designing interventions targeting this population, especially in resource-limited settings where sex work is illegal and highly stigmatized.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Women engaged in sex work (WESW) bear the greatest burden of HIV globally [<xref rid="pone.0280138.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0280138.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In 2019, female sex workers had a 30 times greater risk of acquiring HIV than the general female population [<xref rid="pone.0280138.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In Uganda, the HIV prevalence among sex workers is estimated at 31% compared to the national average of 5.4% (15–49 years) [<xref rid="pone.0280138.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Even with advances and expansion in HIV care and treatment, WESW across sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) continue to have suboptimal HIV prevention and treatment outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0280138.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p>
              <p>The unmet HIV prevention and treatment needs within sex work significantly contribute to overall HIV transmission [<xref rid="pone.0280138.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], partly due to challenges associated with coverage of effective HIV prevention and treatment services within this population [<xref rid="pone.0280138.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. More specifically, the criminalization of sex work and punitive legal environments increase vulnerabilities among WESW and further push them into unregulated and unsafe working environments, which increases the risk of engaging in high-risk behaviors, and relatedly their risk for HIV acquisition and transmission [<xref rid="pone.0280138.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0280138.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. These factors combined with poverty, gender-based violence, high mobility, substance use, and intersecting HIV stigma, including at health facilities, limit access to and uptake of HIV prevention and treatment services among WESW [<xref rid="pone.0280138.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0280138.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p>
              <p>While strategies to expand HIV prevention and treatment services could have a considerable impact on the spread of HIV among WESW, the effectiveness of these strategies depend on the extent to which sex workers engage in these programs. Studies have examined the barriers and facilitators for engaging in HIV care and treatment services, including HIV testing and counseling, linkage to HIV care, and treatment adherence [<xref rid="pone.0280138.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0280138.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0280138.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Among WESW, awareness of the existence and importance of services, attitudes toward services, and HIV risk perception determine access and utilization of health services [<xref rid="pone.0280138.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0280138.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0280138.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Indeed, women who perceive themselves to be at a higher risk of HIV are more likely to uptake and continue with services [<xref rid="pone.0280138.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Additionally, stigma may discourage women from accessing services for fear of stigmatization, discrimination, social exclusion and loss of customers or work termination [<xref rid="pone.0280138.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0280138.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0280138.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0280138.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p>
              <p>Location and adequacy of facilities providing health care also impact access to care. Mixed findings have been reported with some women expressing a preference for closer facilities to save time and transportation [<xref rid="pone.0280138.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Other women prefer far facilities away from their residence due to perceived lack of privacy, breach of confidentiality, and stigmatization at health facilities [<xref rid="pone.0280138.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0280138.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Additionally, facility working hours determine whether women access and uptake health services or not [<xref rid="pone.0280138.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0280138.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p>
              <p>Affordability of services, including fees for services, transport, and other costs also determine access and use of health services. Scorgie and colleagues found that women were four times more likely to go for services if they were offered at a low cost or free [<xref rid="pone.0280138.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, even for free services, transportation costs and long wait times may become barriers to service uptake [<xref rid="pone.0280138.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Finally, the appropriateness of services in meeting the needs and expectations of women, especially on the first encounter with health providers influences the continuation of services. Specifically, stigma and discrimination and poor attitudes of health providers, including judgmental treatment, name-calling, and delaying or denying services [<xref rid="pone.0280138.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. These attitudes, combined with unfriendly service protocols, including preconditions for accessing services, such as requiring identity cards, further deter women from accessing care [<xref rid="pone.0280138.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0280138.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0280138.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p>
              <p>While there are studies examining barriers and facilitators to WESW’s access and use of health services related to HIV testing and counseling, and HIV treatment, there is limited research on the acceptability and appropriateness of comprehensive HIV prevention interventions that specifically target WESW, apart from studies that examine the acceptability of specific HIV risk reduction strategies, such as PrEP or condom use among this population [<xref rid="pone.0280138.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0280138.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Also, few studies reported on the feasibility and acceptability of interventions targeting WESW prior to implementation [<xref rid="pone.0280138.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0280138.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] or examined service provider perceptions of feasibility and acceptability of implementing evidence-based practices for preventing HIV/AIDS and STIs among WESW [<xref rid="pone.0280138.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In Uganda, studies among WESW have explored knowledge, attitudes, barriers and facilitators to HIV prevention and treatment services, as well as preference of service delivery models [<xref rid="pone.0280138.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0280138.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. One study examined WESW’ perceptions of HIV self-testing and PrEP use following the intervention [<xref rid="pone.0280138.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0280138.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Yet, WESW’s perspectives on evidence-based comprehensive behavioral HIV risk reduction interventions specifically targeting this population are understudied.</p>
              <p>In this article, we examine WESW’s perspectives on the acceptability and appropriateness of the HIV risk reduction component of a combination intervention delivered in communities in southwest Uganda as these perspectives are critical in ensuring the sustainment and scalability of these interventions.</p>

              <p>The larger study, funded by the National Institute of Mental Health is a randomized clinical trial (2018–2023) that evaluates the efficacy of adding economic empowerment components to traditional HIV risk reduction intervention to reduce new incidences of STIs and of HIV among WESW in HIV hotspots (sites) in the greater Masaka region of Uganda. Please see study protocol for more details [<xref rid="pone.0280138.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Study sites were randomly assigned to three conditions: 1) Control arm receiving HIV risk reduction sessions focused on equipping participating women with the skills to reduce the spread of HIV; 2) Treatment arm 1 receiving HIV risk reduction sessions combined with a matched savings account and financial literacy training with integrated behavioral economics principles, aimed at training participants on issues related to the importance of savings, banking services, budgeting, and debt management; and 3) Treatment arm 2 receiving HIV risk reduction sessions, a matched savings account, financial literacy training, and vocational skills training and mentorship sessions, aimed at economically empowering women for purposes of starting up an income-generating activity. Treatment arms 1 and 2 were combined under Treatment arm 1 due to COVID-19 that interfered with recruitment and data collection.</p>
              <p>Women were eligible to participate if they met the following conditions: 1) 18+ years; 2) reported having engaged in vaginal or anal intercourse in exchange for money, alcohol, or other goods in the past 30 days; and 3) reported engagement in one or more episodes of unprotected sex in the past 30 days (see study protocol for further details, [<xref rid="pone.0280138.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]).</p>
              <p>The study used an embedded experimental mixed methods design [<xref rid="pone.0280138.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] where qualitative data was collected post-intervention across all three arms at 6-month (Time 1), 12-month (Time 2), and 24-month (Time 3) follow-up to be collected).</p>

                <title>Study setting</title>
                <p>The study is conducted in the Greater Masaka region, consisting of 7 political districts. The average HIV prevalence among 15–49-year-olds across the 7 districts was estimated at 9.5%, above the national average of 5.4% (Uganda AIDS Commission, 2021). HIV prevalence among WESW in Rakai and Masaka districts was reported as high as 61% [<xref rid="pone.0280138.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p>

HIVRR session content). The intervention incorporated many of the social cognitive theory’s social-cognitive mediators within the HIV prevention context, including male and female condom use, communication skills, and building social support. The harm reduction approach is a well-accepted pragmatic approach to high-risk behaviors if abstinence from the behavior is not achievable [<xref rid="pone.0280138.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0280138.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and is infused throughout the curriculum.</p>

                <p>All women in the study received four sessions of the evidence-based, HIV/STI risk reduction intervention tested in three previous studies conducted in Central Asia [<xref rid="pone.0280138.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0280138.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The sessions were facilitated by community health workers who participated in a one-week training conducted by one of the study principal investigators and a study consultant with expertise in HIV risk reduction interventions. The 2-hour sessions were delivered twice a week during weekdays for two weeks in groups of 20 to 25 WESW. Sites with one group received the sessions in the morning. At sites with more than one group, the sessions were delivered in the morning and afternoon. WESW received transport refund and lunch at each session that they attended. The attendance rate across four sessions for the whole sample (n = 542) was 72 percent.</p>

                <p>A stratified purposive sampling strategy was used to represent the wide range of experiences [<xref rid="pone.0280138.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The qualitative sampling was based on participants’ attendance of intervention sessions: HIV risk reduction (4 sessions) and financial literacy training (6 sessions). For each of the 19 sites, one participant from the highest, mid (average), and lowest quartiles of the total number of attended sessions was selected [n = 57]. Due to intervention delivery delays related to COVID-19, for Time 1 qualitative data collection, semi-structured interviews were completed with only 20 participants from seven sites across 3 districts. Fifteen participants were from the control arm of the study and five from the combined treatment arm.</p>

                <p>In this study, we report findings from semi-structured in-depth interviews conducted following intervention completion (Time 1) with 20 participants. Data from 17 participants were collected in December 2019. The remaining three interviews were completed in December 2020 given the delays in intervention completion due to COVID-19. The Time 1 interviews focused on: 1) participants’ experiences with the respective intervention and its specific components (i.e., HIVRR, savings, and financial literacy); 2) key multi-level (individual, economic, family, contextual, and programmatic) influences that affected their participation; and 3) perceptions on intervention sustainability.

                <p>Interviews were conducted in Luganda, the widely spoken language in the study region. Interview questions were translated (English to Luganda) and back-translated by two proficient team members. Questions were reviewed and revised by the study team that included native speakers to ensure that they sounded natural and conversational, and conveyed the intended meanings. Interviews were conducted by trained research assistants fluent in both Luganda and English and lasted 38 to 100 minutes (mean = 60 minutes). All interviews were conducted in a private place with only the research assistant and the participant present and were audiotaped.</p>

                <title>Qualitative data analysis</title>
                <p>Interviews were first transcribed verbatim and then translated from Luganda to English by research assistants fluent in both languages. Dedoose analytic software was used for data analysis. We used Proctor et al.’s conceptualization of implementation outcomes to guide our analysis [<xref rid="pone.0280138.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Specifically, we focused on the concepts of acceptability and appropriateness from the consumers’ perspectives–in this case, WESW. Acceptability is defined as the perception that a given treatment, service, practice, or innovation is agreeable, palatable, or satisfactory. Acceptability of a particular intervention or a set of interventions is assessed based on the stakeholder’s knowledge of or direct experience with various dimensions of the implemented intervention, such as its content, complexity, or comfort. Appropriateness refers to the perceived fit, relevance, or compatibility of the intervention, including for the target population.</p>
                <p>We used inductive techniques for thematic analysis of the data [<xref rid="pone.0280138.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0280138.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Thematic analysis allowed us to use preexisting themes, such as barriers and facilitators to participation but also derived subthemes that emerged from the data, such as “sex trafficking” and “concern for confidentiality of information”. Interview transcripts were initially read multiple times and independently coded by three authors using sensitizing concepts informed by the existing literature and the content of the intervention as well as identifying emergent themes (open coding) [<xref rid="pone.0280138.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Broader themes were broken down into smaller, more specific units until no further subcategory was necessary. Initial codes were discussed during team meetings and reorganized when necessary to create a final codebook that was used to code all transcripts.</p>
                <p>The secondary analysis, conducted by two authors, compared and contrasted themes and categories to identify similarities, differences, and relationships among findings. Peer debriefing and audit trail were used to ensure rigor [<xref rid="pone.0280138.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0280138.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The codes and the findings were presented to two members of the research team who were not involved in the data analysis to discuss the plausibility of themes and related findings [<xref rid="pone.0280138.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].</p>

                <p>Participants’ age ranged between 20 to 46 years (mean age: 31.45). Seven participants were sampled in the low attendance, six in average attendance, and seven in high attendance groups from across seven sites. Thirty percent of the participants were married or in a relationship, 90% had primary school education and 10% had secondary education. Fifty percent tested HIV positive and 15% tested positive for any of the STIs (Chlamydia, Gonorrhea, and Trichomonas). The average age at sex work debut was about 24 and the average number of sex partners within the last 30 days was 32 (see <xref rid="pone.0280138.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.

                <title>Program acceptability and appropriateness</title>
                <p>To capture the full picture in terms of acceptability and appropriateness of the intervention, we explored WESW’s expectations and concerns about the program prior to enrolment as well as the barriers and facilitators to their participation after enrolment. We also inquired into their thoughts regarding the different characteristics of the intervention, including group format, day and time of the sessions, and session facilitators.</p>

                  <p>We asked WESW what they expected to get from the Kyaterekera program when they first heard about it. The main expectations revolved around access to health-related information, including information on STIs, HIV, and PrEP as well as on how one can protect themselves while engaging in sex work. For instance, Gloria, engaged in sex work for about 15 years, wanted to learn about alternative ways of reducing risks associated with unprotected sex.</p>

                  <title>Initial concerns about participating in the kyaterekera program</title>
                  <p>We also asked WESW what made them hesitate to participate when they first heard about the Kyaterekera program. While some (about one-third) said they were not concerned about anything, others expressed various concerns that reflected the unique vulnerabilities WESW experience as they navigate their relationships outside their trusted network, including when services are made available. The most cited concern related to program participation was a breach of confidentiality, mentioned by about one-third of our sample. This included being broadcast on TV or on the internet. Anitah, engaged in sex work for more than five years, pointed out the way they were already treated by other people and was particularly concerned about their children learning that she was engaged in sex work. She was then reassured by the research team that her information would be kept confidential.</p>

                  <p>Other WESW also expressed concern that their information would be disclosed on the internet or broadcast on television. In addition to concerns around disclosure on the internet, Alice, engaged in sex work for over 10 years, was also concerned that the information she gave could be used to arrest her. Her worries were eased by the research team. She added that the team <italic toggle="yes">“remained true to your word”</italic>.</p>

                  </disp-quote>
                  <p>Being arrested was a fear shared by other WESW as well, especially given that sex work is illegal in Uganda. For Afiya who had been engaged in sex work for the last couple of years, her worry was exacerbated by the fact that WESW were asked to bring their national identification cards at the time of enrollment for citizenship verification as WESW from other nationalities also worked in the area where the study was conducted.</p>

                  </disp-quote>
                  <p>Gloria, who has been engaged in sex work for about 15 years, was also worried about being arrested, but “<italic toggle="yes">she (the nurse) explained to me that the project aimed at seeing how the female sex workers can live sustainably</italic>.” Ultimately, she was motivated by both the “<italic toggle="yes">hope</italic>” that she would be tested for STIs and by the “<italic toggle="yes">interest of learning how best to protect myself</italic>” and attended all HIV risk reduction sessions.</p>
                  <p>Though mentioned by only two WESW, being taken “<italic toggle="yes">abroad to have sex with animals”</italic> was a concern. These narratives reflected the stories that WESW heard in their work where women were being trafficked abroad and forced to engage in sex with animals, as was also discussed during our community collaborative board meeting.</p>
                  <p>Afiya shared that she was also worried about being killed. Although she was the only one to raise this concern, her narrative points out the harsh realities sex work may entail in Uganda.</p>

                  <title>Facilitators to participation in HIVRR sessions</title>
                  <p>One of the major reasons why WESW kept attending the sessions was the “desire to learn more,” pointing to the high relevance of the session contents to the lives of WESW. Almost all WESW mentioned that they came back to the sessions because they wanted to obtain more information on a range of issues, including information on HIV and STIs, reducing risk behaviors, and <italic toggle="yes">“handling clients”</italic>. For instance, Ruth mentioned that she learned new things in each session <italic toggle="yes">“at zero cost”</italic>.</p>

                  <p>In addition to learning about how to protect herself, especially about condom use, Gertrude, engaged in sex work for five years, was also motivated to come back by the <italic toggle="yes">“inspirational”</italic> messages she heard from facilitators during the sessions. When asked to elaborate, she shared:</p>

                    <p><italic toggle="yes">Gertrude</italic>: <italic toggle="yes">Even your inspirational words that you used to give us about protecting ourselves were motivating us to come back for subsequent sessions</italic>…. <italic toggle="yes">such as we should not leave condoms for more money because a man might force you</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">we should stop using drugs</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">reduce them or stop using them completely so that we can do things when we are conscious about</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">not for the implications of unprotected sex getting to use the condom</italic>.</p>
                  </disp-quote>
                  <p>Kirabo, who had been engaged in sex work for about 10 years, wanted to learn more about how to reduce risk-taking behaviors, including drug and alcohol use and number of sexual partners. Kirabo went on to add that she reduced her drug and alcohol use as well as the number of clients as a result of attending the HIVRR sessions.</p>

                  </disp-quote>
                  <p>A few participants also mentioned that in addition to the content, the way the facilitators and research staff related to them made it easier for them to continue attending the sessions. Alice, Ruth, as well as Flora engaged in sex work for six years, discussed how they appreciated the facilitators’ attitude, care, and attention, underlining the importance of facilitators in engaging and retaining participants, especially among highly stigmatized groups. Ruth talked about how she was treated by the HIVRR session facilitators.</p>

                  </disp-quote>
                  <p>Another common reason mentioned by about three-quarters of the WESW was the incentives offered. WESW received monetary compensation for their time and transport and were offered lunch after each session they attended. Additionally, free condoms were made available to those who wanted them. Free condoms were mentioned by four WESW. Joyce, who recently started sex work, stated that she was “<italic toggle="yes">driven by two factors</italic>: <italic toggle="yes">teaching us about our health and giving us condoms”</italic> and acknowledged that sometimes she attended the sessions to receive free condoms.</p>
                  <p>Half of the WESW in the sample appreciated receiving transport refunds and about one-third receiving food. For instance, Maria, who had been engaging in sex work for five years, pointed out that in addition to learning, what motivated her to attend sessions were the “<italic toggle="yes">compensation and food”</italic>. Afiya stated, <italic toggle="yes">“Sometimes we used to leave our work and come for the sessions because we needed the money”</italic>. Anitah shared that the transport refund made it easier for her to get transport back home and motivated her to attend subsequent sessions: “I used to get a transport refund after every session that I attended. This made it easier for me to get transport means back home. Therefore, it motivated me to attend subsequent sessions.”</p>
                  <p>Sanyu first appreciated the content she learned during the sessions, but also acknowledged being compensated for their time and transport played a role in her participation since she and her colleagues were sometimes “<italic toggle="yes">too poor</italic>”.</p>

                  <title>Challenges to participation in HIVRR sessions</title>
                  <p>When asked about what made it challenging for them to participate in the HIVRR sessions, about one-third of the WESW mentioned family commitments. These included taking care of other family members or loss of relatives. For instance, Gertrude missed sessions to be able to attend to her sick mother who was taken to the hospital. Esther was only able to attend one session because she lost a relative and was away during the remaining three sessions. Viola, engaged in sex work for about five years, talked about her husband’s expectation from her to be home when he arrived, which conflicted with the timing of the sessions.</p>
                  <disp-quote>
                    <p><italic toggle="yes">Viola</italic>: <italic toggle="yes">At times</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">it would be hard for me to keep to the set time for the sessions because my husband usually comes home during that time</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">He expects me to be home by that time</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">yet I also want to attend the session</italic>.</p>

                  <p>Anitah had children in her care and sometimes her commitments to her children conflicted with the timing of the sessions, making it challenging for her. However, she was able to come up with a solution that allowed her to both attend the sessions and make sure her children had food.</p>

                    <p><italic toggle="yes">Anitah</italic>: <italic toggle="yes">I had to prepare food for the children before they returned from school</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">At times</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">I failed to prepare food in time because sessions had taken longer than expected</italic> …<italic toggle="yes">I would use part of the transport refund to buy cooked food for the children after the session had ended</italic>.</p>
                  </disp-quote>
                  <p>About one-fifth of the WESW also discussed how their work and work schedules posed a challenge. Flora stated that sometimes work could conflict with the sessions, but she was able to work around her work schedule to make sure she attended all sessions as she <italic toggle="yes">“decided in my heart and said I have to complete the sessions</italic>.” She also chose to attend to her other chores after the sessions. Grace, engaged in sex work for about five years, also talked about her work, specifically alluding to the <italic toggle="yes">“nature of our job”</italic>. She mentioned that the long work hours at night would leave her tired and sleep deprived.</p>

                  <p>Alice had another business that occasionally made it difficult for her to attend the sessions, especially when sessions ran long or started later than the scheduled time.</p>
                  <p>Other challenges included personal reasons. For instance, Betty, engaged in sex work for a couple of years, and Sanyu were nervous about the results of their HIV testing that was done before the intervention started as they were worried about their HIV status. Both were relieved when they found out they were negative and attended the HIVRR sessions.</p>
                  <p>Ruth and Barbara were concerned about their privacy. Barbara was worried that the other WESW she was attending the sessions with were calling her Neko (woman engaged in sex work) in front of her friends. Ruth was worried about being seen coming to sessions at first, given the <italic toggle="yes">“nature of my work”</italic>, yet she was reassured when she saw other WESW attend the sessions.</p>

                  <p>Grace was in jail at the time HIVRR sessions started. Once she was out, she made sure to attend all other sessions. Other personal reasons included being <italic toggle="yes">“drunk”</italic> and being in <italic toggle="yes">“low mood”</italic>, each mentioned by one WESW. In both cases, WESW shared that they still managed to attend the sessions.</p>

                  <p><italic toggle="yes">Group format</italic>. The eight WESW who responded to this question all shared positive feedback about the group format.

                  <p><italic toggle="yes">Delivery location</italic>. The locations for the sessions were identified in collaboration with the site coordinators at each site who manage WESW (including managers, brothel owners, pimps, lodge owners). WESW were content with the settings where the sessions were conducted. They appreciated that the sessions were held in convenient, quiet, and “isolated” places that allowed them to maintain their privacy. Given the nature of their job, privacy was particularly important to WESW. Grace shared that she liked the venue because <italic toggle="yes">“it was secluded and not everyone would see you and start saying that what are these sex workers doing there</italic>…<italic toggle="yes">”</italic> Joyce shared similar thoughts and liked that the place was private, but not too isolated to draw other people’s attention as to what one might be doing there.</p>
                  <disp-quote>
                    <p><italic toggle="yes">Joyce</italic>: <italic toggle="yes">The place was also isolated</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">It was near to this community</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">and no one could ask you where you were coming from</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">They could easily think that you were going to the market</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">yet you were branching off to this place</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">It was also private; passersby couldn’t easily see us</italic>.</p>
                  </disp-quote>
                  <p>WESW also talked about the quietness of the setting as an important feature as they were able to focus on the content and not get distracted. Betty thought that a quiet place was “<italic toggle="yes">a conducive environment to communicate without any interruption”</italic>. Finally, convenience was also appreciated by a few WESW. Joyce mentioned that the place where the sessions were held was near, which made it easier to attend as she was able to walk when she did not have transport money. Mariam, engaged in sex work for over 10 years, also shared that the place <italic toggle="yes">“could be easily located and accessed”</italic> by WESW.</p>
                  <p>Two WESW had concerns about the setting where the sessions were delivered. These concerns were related to privacy. For instance, Esther stated that most women, including herself, did not like the place where the sessions were held because “<italic toggle="yes">some of them are married</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">so they are doing sex work in hiding"</italic> and the setting was not private enough. Patience, engaged in sex work for four years, also shared that they had to switch settings for the sessions and the current place was less private as <italic toggle="yes">“some people came and peeped through the windows and asked what we were doing</italic>.<italic toggle="yes">”</italic></p>
                  <p><italic toggle="yes">Day and time of the sessions</italic>. The day and time of the sessions were scheduled in consultation with the WESW. Hence, WESW were content with the day and time of the sessions, which were scheduled on the weekdays and in the morning at sites with smaller groups, and morning and afternoon at sites that had a larger number of WESW. WESW appreciated the morning hours as those were the times when they did not have any clients. Some expressed that they would prefer to meet a little later in the day, around noon, so that they would have time to rest or attend to other chores they might have after working through the night. WESW also appreciated the reminder calls from the research team. For instance, Ruth shared that the reminder calls allowed her to plan accordingly and added that people’s attendance depended on how invested they were.</p>

                    <p><italic toggle="yes">Ruth</italic>: <italic toggle="yes">(I wasn’t inconvenienced) because they would call you a day before and inform you about the time and day then you prepare yourself accordingly</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">Besides</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">we were not blamed for missing a session</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">So</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">it was up to you</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">with the interest you have in the program</italic>.</p>
                  </disp-quote>
                  <p>Ruth went on to add that if it were up to her, she would prefer the weekends, especially Sundays when she could attend the sessions after church. Viola and Kirabo also stated that they would have scheduled the sessions on the weekends as they found it more convenient.</p>
                  <p><italic toggle="yes">Facilitators</italic>. WESW appreciated the facilitators delivering the HIVRR sessions. They found the information and the way it was conveyed by the facilitators helpful. Anitah shared that the sessions were covered in detail and questions were encouraged. She added that the facilitators <italic toggle="yes">“gave us enough time during the sessions; they used to review the session for those that came in late such that we all move at the same pace</italic>.<italic toggle="yes">”</italic> Other WESW stated that facilitators used visual aids such as demonstrations and photos, which made it easier for them to understand the content as illustrated by Joyce:</p>
                  <disp-quote>
                    <p><italic toggle="yes">Joyce</italic>: <italic toggle="yes">What was helpful about it was bringing visual aids which we used to learn from</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">It would be hard for us to understand what they were teaching us without them</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">We used visual aids and learned practically instead of just using words</italic>.</p>
                  </disp-quote>
                  <p>WESW were appreciative of being treated with respect and patience. Gertrude shared that the facilitators were always helpful in answering their questions and offering clarification.</p>

                  </disp-quote>
                  <p>Both Ruth and Ritah engaged in sex work for over 20 years, referred to being treated <italic toggle="yes">“humanely”</italic>. Ruth went on to add that this enabled the group to share their thoughts and experiences without any reservation.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>In this study, we explored the acceptability of the evidence-based HIV risk reduction component of a combination intervention that also included an economic empowerment component among WESW in Uganda. We explored the expectations and concerns that contributed to their decisions to participate in the overall program, facilitators, and barriers to their participation in the HIV risk reduction sessions, as well as thoughts on different aspects of intervention delivery. WESW’s expectations mainly centered around access to health-related information and resources as well as information around safe sex practices, which shows that the program was highly relevant and appropriate to the needs of this population. For those who expressed concerns about participation -about two-thirds of our sample, these potential benefits ultimately outweighed their initial concerns around enrolment to the program. However, concerns around confidentiality -including disclosure of their engagement in sex work, being arrested, killed, or trafficked for sex work underline the unique vulnerabilities of WESW. These concerns were also identified in other studies as barriers to access to services and underline the need to effectively address them to facilitate access to interventions as well as other health services designed for this population [<xref rid="pone.0280138.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0280138.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0280138.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0280138.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].</p>
              <p>In addition to being the initial reason for enrolment in the program, the desire to learn more information on HIV/STIs and safer sex practices was the main reason that motivated WESW to continue attending HIV risk reduction sessions. As expected, when WESW find the intervention relevant and applicable to their life circumstances, they are more likely to sustain their participation. Importantly, in addition to content relevance, some WESW also pointed to the fact that being treated respectfully by the facilitators was another factor that facilitated their continued attendance. The same theme emerged when WESW were asked about their feedback on intervention implementation. Stigma WESW experience from service providers is a major factor that interferes with access and retention with health services, including HIV care [<xref rid="pone.0280138.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0280138.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0280138.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0280138.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].</p>
              <p>In addition to not being stigmatized, WESW appreciated that facilitators were patient and took the time to answer questions, underlining the importance of training facilitators/service providers working with this key population to improve WESW’s engagement and retention in services. As indicated before, the HIVRR facilitators delivering this intervention participated in a one-week training that included sensitization around working with WESW in addition to intervention content and delivery. Finally, WESW also stated that monetary compensation for their time and transport, as well as lunches, made it easier for them to attend the sessions. Costs associated with transportation are widely cited as a barrier to attendance [<xref rid="pone.0280138.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0280138.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. By providing transport refund, we aimed at minimizing barriers to WESW’s attendance at the sessions. However, doing so has cost implications for the implementation of the intervention in the real world and its scalability.</p>
              <p>Barriers to HIVRR session participation included family commitments, work schedules, and other personal reasons which primarily centered around privacy and confidentiality. Many women were also caregivers to children or other members of their families. One participant experienced the loss of an extended family member that interfered with her session attendance. In addition, even though the research team worked closely with WESW and their managers to identify the most convenient times for intervention delivery, work schedules still posed challenges for some WESW. Both family and work commitments are common barriers to participation across a wide range of programs and services [<xref rid="pone.0280138.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0280138.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Hence, our findings show that WESW experience some of the same barriers as the general population to accessing and utilizing services [<xref rid="pone.0280138.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].</p>
              <p>However, there were also challenges unique to the life circumstances of WESW, though mentioned by only a few, including being intoxicated or in jail. Concerns around privacy and confidentiality remained a concern for some WESW during the initial sessions, underlying the need to continuously reinforce the message that all information would be kept confidential as well as put in place safeguards to ensure it. While ensuring privacy and confidentiality is critical in any group intervention, doing so is even more critical for WESW given the high level of stigma, discrimination, and other risks associated with disclosure of sex work [<xref rid="pone.0280138.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0280138.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0280138.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0280138.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p>
              <p>Overall, WESW’s feedback on intervention characteristics was positive. WESW who provided feedback on the group format found it helpful. Being in a group with other WESW not only made them more comfortable to share their experiences, but some WESW stated that it also encouraged some to make changes to their risk-taking behaviors. These findings align with the existing evidence on the benefits of group interventions. The group format for behavioral interventions in the context of HIV prevention utilizes the social interactions among group members to enhance the likelihood of acquiring new information and skills, facilitate behavioral change, and enable the group members to learn with and from each other in a safe environment [<xref rid="pone.0280138.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>].</p>
              <p>Except for a few instances, WESW also expressed satisfaction with the locations where the intervention was delivered, emphasizing their convenience and privacy. Similarly, WESW were also generally satisfied with the day and time when the sessions were delivered. Both the delivery location and timing of the sessions were decided upon in collaboration with WESW and their managers in an attempt to minimize potential obstacles to attendance. As discussed before, WESW’s feedback on facilitators delivering the intervention was also positive and emphasized the attention, care, and respect they conveyed during the sessions.</p>
              <p>Overall, our findings suggest that the HIV risk reduction component of our combination intervention was appropriate and acceptable to WESW. From a public health point of view, our findings show that WESW experience unique concerns and barriers to enroll and attend interventions that need to be addressed to increase the acceptability of an intervention. Privacy and confidentiality are one such concern that warrants the attention of service providers and/or program implementers working with WESW. Safeguards to ensure privacy and confidentiality should be incorporated both at the time of enrolment as well as throughout the intervention, including the selection of sites where it will be implemented. In addition, interventions targeting WESW should incorporate both content and sensitivity training for facilitators/service providers to improve access and utilization [<xref rid="pone.0280138.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Finally, working closely with WESW and their managers in the identification of appropriate locations and times may increase the acceptability of an intervention. Alvarez identified the use of group formats and co-creating interventions with the target population [<xref rid="pone.0280138.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], in addition to the use of theoretical frameworks to inform a program/intervention -in our case social cognitive theory, as three program characteristics being particularly effective. From a policy perspective, our findings align with existing evidence that proposes the enactment of policies to create a safe and favorable environment for WESW to access and attend programs and services without fear of being arrested, prosecuted, or discriminated against [<xref rid="pone.0280138.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>].</p>
              <p>Results need to be interpreted in light of study limitations. Due to restrictions related to COVID-19 at the time of qualitative data collection, we collected data from a smaller sample of WESW than originally targeted. Relatedly, WESW in the treatment group were underrepresented. Hence, the findings may not fully represent the experiences of WESW who received the combination intervention.</p>
              <p>Despite these limitations, our study provides important insights into the acceptability of an evidence-based HIV risk reduction intervention among WESW in hot spots in Uganda–a region underserved by evidence-based interventions. Our study is one of the few studies in Uganda, and in SSA, that documents the unique needs and challenges of WESW from their own perspectives when HIV risk reduction programs are provided.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>Overall, our findings suggest that WESW found the HIV risk reduction intervention acceptable and were satisfied with their experiences. Privacy and confidentiality were among the initial concerns and remained as such for the first couple of sessions, underlying the importance of effectively implementing safeguards and conveying them to WESW to ensure their enrolment and utilization. Our findings also highlight the importance of providing sensitization training to facilitators/service providers delivering the intervention. Finally, deciding on the delivery location and time in collaboration with WESW and their managers, when possible, may minimize some of the barriers to access and utilization of services and/or interventions provided. These findings have important programmatic and policy implications in Uganda. The Uganda Government and Ministry of Health identify sex workers as a key population. This population is one of the groups targeted by combination HIV prevention, care and treatment, and social support interventions, as outlined in the National Strategic Plan for HIV and AIDS [<xref rid="pone.0280138.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. As such, given that WESW are a high-risk population for acquiring and transmitting STIs, including HIV, it is important to consider incorporating evidence-based interventions with high acceptability into the national programs and policy efforts and that take into account the unique needs of WESW to address HIV in Uganda.</p>
