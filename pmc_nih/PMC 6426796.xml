                <p>Tissue-resident memory T cells (T<sub>RM</sub>) are newly defined memory T cells (T<sub>M</sub>) distinct from circulating T<sub>M</sub> subsets which have the potential to mount rapid protective immune responses at the site of infection. However, very limited information is available regarding the role and contribution of T<sub>RM</sub> in vaccine-mediated immune responses in humans at the site of infection. Here, we studied the role and contribution of tissue resident memory T cells (T<sub>RM</sub>) located in the terminal ileum (TI) (favored site of infection for <italic>S</italic>. Typhi) following oral Ty21a immunization in humans. We examined TI-lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMC) and intra-epithelial lymphocytes (IEL) CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> subsets obtained from healthy volunteers undergoing medically-indicated colonoscopies who were either immunized with Ty21a or unvaccinated. No significant differences in the frequencies of LPMC CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> and CD8+CD69+CD103â T cells subsets were observed following Ty21a-immunization. However, LPMC CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> exhibited significantly higher levels of cytokines (IFN-Î³, IL-17A, and TNF-Î±) <italic>ex-vivo</italic> in Ty21a-vaccinated than in unvaccinated volunteers. LPMC CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub>
<italic>S</italic>. Typhi-specific responses were evaluated using <italic>S</italic>. Typhi-infected targets and found to produce significantly higher levels of <italic>S</italic>. Typhi-specific IL-17A. In contrast, LPMC CD8+CD69+CD103- T cells produced significantly increased <italic>S</italic>. Typhi-specific levels of IFN-Î³, IL-2, and IL-17A. Finally, we assessed CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> in IEL and observed that the frequency of IEL CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> is significantly lower following Ty21a immunization. However, <italic>ex-vivo</italic> IEL CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> elicited by Ty21a immunization spontaneously produced significantly higher levels of cytokines (IFN-Î³, IL-17A, IL-2, and TNF-Î±). This study provides the first demonstration of the effect of oral Ty21a vaccination on CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> subsets (spontaneous and <italic>S</italic>. Typhi-specific) responses in the LPMC and IEL compartment of the human terminal ileum mucosa, contributing novel information to our understanding of the generation of mucosal immune responses following oral Ty21a-immunization.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Immunological memory is essential for vaccine protection and efficacy and for maintaining long-term immunity following exposure to wild-type pathogens. It is now becoming clear that protective immunity relies on circulating T memory (T<sub>M</sub>) cells, as well as non-circulating T<sub>M</sub> which are abundant in peripheral tissues, especially in mucosal sites (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Tissue resident memory T cells (T<sub>RM</sub>) is a newly defined subset of T<sub>M</sub> which is phenotypically distinct from circulating T<sub>M</sub> subsets (e.g., T central/memoryâT<sub>CM</sub>, T effector/memoryâT<sub>EM</sub>, and CD45RA+ T<sub>EM</sub>âT<sub>EMRA</sub>). After induction, T<sub>RM</sub> persist for a long time in peripheral tissues (particularly intestinal tissues) and represent a non-migratory population of T<sub>M</sub> which has the potential to mediate rapid protective antigen recall responses (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). T<sub>RM</sub> in the human gut are phenotypically characterized by their expression of CD69 (an activation and tissue retention marker via the sequestration of the sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor (S1PR1) which is required for cell egress from tissues (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) and Î±E integrin CD103 (which binds E-cadherin on epithelial cells). The vast majority of T<sub>M</sub> in peripheral blood are CD69â/CD103â whereas in most human tissues, T<sub>M</sub> express high levels of CD69. However, the expression of CD103 is mainly confined to CD8+ T<sub>M</sub> in mucosal sites (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>â<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). New evidences have suggested that T<sub>RM</sub> not only plays an important role in generating antigen specific responses to pathogens but importantly vaccine-generated T<sub>RM</sub> can mediate cross-strains protection, and persist for long periods of time after vaccination (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p>
              <p><italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Typhi (<italic>S</italic>. Typhi), a human restricted pathogen, causes typhoid fever in ~26.9 million individuals yearly leading to around 223,000 deaths worldwide (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>â<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). <italic>S</italic>. Typhi actively invade the mucosal surfaces of the host upon ingestion and subsequently enters the submucosa where it interacts with intestinal lymphoid tissues before reaching the draining mesenteric lymph nodes where it spreads to numerous tissues leading to systemic illness (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). While <italic>S</italic>. Typhi has the potential to enter at any location along the intestine through M cells and epithelial cells (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), the human terminal ileum (TI) is the preferred intestinal active invasion site for <italic>S</italic>. Typhi (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Not much is known regarding the generation of T<sub>RM</sub> immune responses to <italic>Salmonella</italic> in the human terminal ileum. Thus, it is important to understand how oral vaccines (e.g., oral attenuated Typhoid vaccine, Ty21a) induce the generation of site-specific protective memory responses following vaccination resulting in prevention from disease. Currently, two licensed typhoid vaccines are available in the USA for use in humans, including Ty21a (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Ty21a, a Gal E <italic>S</italic>. Typhi mutant strain, is usually given in four spaced doses and achieves a modest level of long-lived protection (60â80%, 5â7 years) (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>â<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p>
              <p>Numerous studies have examined extensively the induction of humoral and B and T cell-mediated immunity (CMI) responses in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) collected from healthy individuals following Ty21a vaccination and other attenuated <italic>S</italic>. Typhi vaccine candidates (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>â<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Recently, we have reported that oral Ty21a immunization elicits significant <italic>S</italic>. Typhi-specific CD8+ T<sub>M</sub>â(T<sub>CM</sub>, T<sub>EM</sub>, and T<sub>EMRA</sub>) responses with multiple functions (cytotoxicâCD107aâ, IFN-Î³, IL-17A, and TNF-Î±) which are unique in human terminal ileum (TI) lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMC) (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Given that a majority of the CD8+ T<sub>M</sub> in the TI mucosa may express the markers for tissue resident T cells, we hypothesized that oral Ty21a immunization would modulate CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> and that most of the <italic>S</italic>. Typhi-specific responses observed at the terminal ileum mucosa would be mediated by CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub>.</p>
              <p>CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> express abundantly the integrin Î±E (CD103), which binds to E-cadherin on intestinal epithelial cells (IEC). It is reasonable to hypothesize that these CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> are poised to migrate to the epithelium compartment and contribute to <italic>S</italic>. Typhi immunity in the TI mucosa. No information is available concerning the role of the intraepithelial (IEL) CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> following oral Ty21a vaccination, largely due to the fact that functional studies with human intestinal IEL are challenging because of the low IEL cell numbers obtained. However, since IEL are likely to contribute to the first line of defense, it is important to understand their role and contribution in oral Ty21a vaccination and <italic>S</italic>. Typhi infection.</p>
              <p>In this study we have characterized CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> from lamina propria (LPMC) and the epithelium (IEL) obtained from terminal ileum biopsies of Ty21a vaccinated and unvaccinated volunteers. We evaluated and compared CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> subsets <italic>ex-vivo</italic> and the <italic>S</italic>. Typhi-specific responses in the two groups of participants following stimulation with autologous target cells infected with wt <italic>S</italic>. Typhi. Finally, we determined the multifunctionality of the elicited responses, i.e., their ability to concomitantly exhibit more than 1 function [e.g., interferon (IFN)-Î³, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-Î±, IL-2 and IL-17A]. These comparisons provide unique insights into the responses generated at the mucosal level by CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> subsets following oral Ty21a immunization.</p>

                <p>Volunteers (Demographics shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM6">Table S1</xref>) were allocated into two groups. The first (<italic>n</italic> = 17) were given orally the Ty21a vaccine (4 doses) (Vivotif enteric-coated capsules; Crucell, Bern, Switzerland). The second group consisted of individuals who were unvaccinated (control group) (<italic>n</italic> = 20) as described in the study design (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Pre-immunized peripheral blood (at least 21 days before colonoscopy) were obtained and on colonoscopy day (day 0), blood and TI biopsies using large capacity forceps were obtained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). PBMC were isolated using density gradient centrifugation and cryopreserved using established methods (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>).</p>

                <p>Terminal ileum LPMC and IEL were isolated as previously reported (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>â<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Briefly, terminal ileum biopsies were collected from volunteers undergoing screening colonoscopy. Biopsies were digested with HBSS (without CaCl<sub>2</sub>, MgCl<sub>2</sub>, MgSO<sub>4</sub>; Gibco, Carlsbad, CA) and 10 mM EDTA (Ambion, Grand Island, NY) while being vigorously shaken for 45 min to isolate IEL. Next, the biopsies were digested enzymatically with collagenase D (100 Î¼g/mL; Roche, Indianapolis, IN) and DNase I (10 Î¼g/mL; Affymetrix, Cleveland, OH) for 45 min. The tissue was then homogenized using a Bullet Blender homogenizer (Next Advance Inc., Averill, NY) to extract LPMC. Subsequently, LPMC were washed and placed into complete medium(cRPMI) (RPMI 1640 [Gibco Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA] which is composed of 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum [BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD], 2 mM l-glutamine [HyClone, Logan, UT], 2.5 mM sodium pyruvate [Gibco], 10 mM HEPES [Gibco], 100 U/mL penicillin [Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO], 100 Î¼g/mL streptomycin [Sigma-Aldrich], and 50 Î¼g/mL gentamicin [Gibco]). Viable number of isolated LPMC were then enumerated using Kova Glastic Slides (Hycor Biomedical, Garden Grove, CA). Finally, LPMC and IEL were stained to phenotype the cells and/or stimulated overnight.</p>

                <p>After overnight stimulation, TI-LPMC and IEL were stained for flow cytometry analysis as reported before (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Briefly, LPMC and IEL were stained using a viability dye (live/dead fixable yellow stain-YEVID) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) to exclude dead cells. Subsequently, Fc receptors on the cell surface were blocked using human immunoglobulin (3 Î¼g/mL; Sigma). Surface staining was subsequently performed. LPMC and IEL were stained with fluorescently labeled monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against CD13-Pacific Orange (conjugated in-house), CD19-BV570 (HIB19, Biolegend, San Diego, CA), CD3-BV650 (OKT3, Biolegend), CD4-PE-Cy5 (RPA-T4, BD), CD8-PerCP-Cy5.5 (SK1, BD), CD45RA-biotin (HI100, BD), CD62L-APC-A780 (DREG-56, eBioscience, San Diego, CA), and CD103-FITC (Ber-ACT8, BD) and incubated at 4Â°C for 30 min. This was followed by washing cells with wash buffer and staining using streptavidin (SAV)-Qdot800 (Invitrogen) for 30 min at 4Â°C. Afterwards, cells were fixed with IC fixation buffer for 20 min at room temperature (catalog No 8222, eBioscience). This was followed by the permeabilization of the cells using IC permeabilization buffer (catalof No 8333, eBioscience) as reported before. For intracellular staining, mAbs directed to interleukin (IL)-17A-BV421 (BL168, Biolegend), IFN-Î³-PE-Cy7 (B27, BD), TNF-Î±-Alexa 700 (MAb11, BD), CD69-ECD (TP1.55.3, Beckman Coulter, Danvers, MA), and interleukin (IL)2-BV605 (MQ1-17H12, Biolegend) were used to stain LPMC and IEL at 4Â°C overnight. Stained cells were kept in 1% paraformaldehyde at 4Â°C until data collection using a customized LSRII flow cytometer (BD). Data were analyzed using WinList version 7 (Verity Software House, Topsham, ME). Antigen specific responses were expressed as the net percentages of positive cells calculated by subtracting the values (percentages) obtained following stimulation with <italic>S</italic>.

                <title>Oral Ty21a-Immunization Does Not Alter CD8<sup>+</sup>-T<sub>RM</sub> Frequencies</title>
                <p>The effects of oral Ty21a-immunization on human TI LPMC CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> function is unknown. To explore whether Ty21a-immunization influences the frequencies of CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> subsets, we first isolated TI LPMC from biopsies obtained from volunteers who either received four doses of Ty21a (<italic>n</italic> = 17) or were unvaccinated (<italic>n</italic> = 20). We then characterized CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> in TI LPMC by using CD69 and CD103 markers following the gating strategy depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>. We observed that TI LPMC CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> exhibit a high frequency (~80%) of CD69+ CD103+ (T<sub>RM</sub>) cells while CD69+CD103â T cells constitute a minor population (~11%) in this representative volunteer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). As expected, circulating PBMC CD8+ T<sub>EM</sub> are mostly CD69<sup>â</sup> CD103<sup>â</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). The distribution of CD3+ CD69+ CD103+ (T<sub>RM</sub>) (shown by red dots) is confined mainly to the CD8+ T compartment with minor populations in CD4+ and CD4â CD8â (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>), while CD3+CD69+CD103â (shown by blue dots) is observed mostly in the CD4+ T subset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). In this study, we will focus on the observations in CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> and CD8+CD69+CD103â T cells subsets. The responses of the CD4+ T<sub>RM</sub> subsets have been compiled in a separate manuscript currently under review. To determine whether the LPMC cell yields obtained from biopsies from Ty21a-vaccinated and unvaccinated volunteers were similar, we compared the number of viable cells per mg of tissue. No differences were observed in either the numbers of LPMC or CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> between the two groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2D,E</xref>). As expected, the cumulative frequencies of CD8+CD69+CD103â T cells were significantly lower than CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> in both groups of participants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>).</p>

                <title>Activation of Terminal Ileum LPMC CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> and CD8+CD69+CD103â T Cells</title>
                <p>Most of our knowledge of CMI responses elicited by <italic>S</italic>. Typhi infection or Ty21a-immunization in humans is based almost exclusively on data derived from blood (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). We have recently reported the first study on LPMC CD8+ T<sub>M</sub> (T<sub>EM</sub>, T<sub>CM</sub>, and T<sub>EMRA</sub>) immune responses following Ty21a oral immunization (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). However, the role and contribution of TI CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> remains unknown following oral Ty21a immunization or wt <italic>S</italic>. Typhi infection.</p>
                <p>To address this important gap, we determined the ability of LPMC CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> and CD8+CD69+CD103â T cells obtained from Ty21a vaccinated (<italic>n</italic> = 17) and unvaccinated (<italic>n</italic> = 20) volunteers to be activated following co-culture with autologous <italic>S</italic>. Typhi-infected or uninfected EBV-B cells or media alone or Î±-CD3/CD28 by assessing their cytokines responses following overnight stimulation. Cytograms in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> depict LPMC CD8+ T cell subset responses from a representative Ty21a vaccinated individual (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref> CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> (CD69+CD103+) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref> CD8+CD69+CD103â). Interestingly, we observed the presence of baseline levels of cytokine production (IFN-Î³, IL-17A, IL-2, and TNF-Î±) in unstimulated LPMC CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> and CD8+CD69+CD103â subsets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3A,B</xref>). Following stimulation with <italic>S</italic>. Typhi-infected targets, we observed substantial net increases (% of <italic>S</italic>. Typhi-infected EBV-B responsesâ% of uninfected EBV-B responses) in the frequencies of CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> and CD8+CD69+CD103â T cells (e.g., IFN-Î³, IL-17A, IL-2, TNF-Î±) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3A,B</xref>). Interestingly, the levels of individual cytokines varied depending on the LPMC subset evaluated. Cytograms in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Figure S1</xref> depict LPMC CD8+ T cell subset responses from a representative unvaccinated individual (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Figures S1A</xref> CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> (CD69+CD103+) and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Figures S1B</xref> CD8+CD69+CD103â). Remarkably, we also observed the presence of baseline levels of cytokine (IFN-Î³, IL-17A, IL-2, and TNF-Î±) in unstimulated LPMC CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> and CD8+CD69+CD103â subsets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Figures S1A,B</xref>). However, following stimulation with <italic>S</italic>.

                <title>Oral Ty21a Immunization Induces Terminal Ileum LPMC CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> and CD8+CD69+CD103â T Cells at Baseline</title>
                <p>We next investigated whether oral Ty21a immunization non-specifically activates CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> and CD8+CD69+CD103â T cells. To this end we used the FCOM function of WinList to determine and compared the frequency of single (<bold>S</bold>) and multifunctional (MF) producing cytokines (IFN-Î³, IL-17A, IL-2, and TNF-Î±) in CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> and CD8+CD69+CD103â T after freshly isolated LPMC were cultured unstimulated overnight. We found that <italic>ex-vivo</italic> unstimulated LPMC CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> and CD8+CD69+CD103â T cells obtained from Ty21a immunized volunteers exhibited significantly higher level of single-producing IFN-Î³ cells than unimmunized volunteers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). No differences in the frequency of unstimulated LPMC CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> and CD8+CD69+CD103â T MF IFN-Î³ were noted for either group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). Next, we observed that <italic>ex-vivo</italic> unstimulated LPMC CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> obtained from Ty21a immunized volunteers exhibited significant increases in IL-17A-S but not IL-17A-MF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). In contrast, <italic>ex-vivo</italic> unstimulated LPMC CD8+CD69+CD103â T cells showed decreases in IL-17A responses following Ty21a immunization with significantly (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) lower levels in IL-17AMF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). Subsequent comparisons of the levels of IL-17A S and MF production LPMC CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> and CD8+CD69+CD103â T cells revealed significantly (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) higher IL-17A S and MF production in LPMC CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> following Ty21a immunization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). We then determined IL-2 in unstimulated LPMC and found that there were no differences in the frequency of IL-2+ S and MF in LPMC CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> following Ty21a vaccination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). In contrast, CD8+CD69+CD103â T cells produce significantly lower IL-2 MF following Ty21a vaccination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). Additionally, we observed significantly (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) higher level of IL-2 MF in LPMC CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> than in CD8+CD69+CD103â T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). Finally, we observed that <italic>ex-vivo</italic> unstimulated LPMC CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> and CD8+CD69+CD103â T obtained from Ty21a immunized volunteers have significantly higher levels of TNF-Î± S than unimmunized volunteers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>).

In contrast, after Î±-CD3/CD28 stimulation, we observed that LPMC CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> obtained from Ty21a immunized volunteers have significant increases in IL-17A S but not IL-17A MF when compared to unimmunized volunteers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">Figure S2B</xref>). Remarkably, after Î±-CD3/CD28 stimulation, the frequency of LPMC CD8+CD69+CD103â IL-17A+ MF decreases significantly following Ty21a immunization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">Figure S2B</xref>). Further, we observed significantly (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) higher levels of IL-17A S and MF in LPMC CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> than in CD8+CD69+CD103â T cells after Î±-CD3/CD28 stimulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">Figure S2B</xref>). Regarding IL-2 production, no differences in IL-2+ S and MF frequencies were found between Ty21a immunized than unimmunized volunteers in LPMC CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">Figure S2C</xref>). In contrast, after Î±-CD3/CD28 stimulation, the frequency of LPMC CD8+CD69+CD103â IL-2+ MF decreases significantly following Ty21a immunization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">Figure S2C</xref>). Finally, we measured TNF-Î± production and found no differences in TNF-Î±+ S and MF frequencies between Ty21a immunized than unimmunized volunteers in LPMC CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">Figure S2D</xref>). However, after Î±-CD3/CD28 stimulation, the frequency of LPMC CD8+CD69+CD103â IL-2+ S increases significantly following Ty21a immunization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">Figure S2D</xref>). These results indicate that oral Ty21a immunization may modulate LPMC CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> (IL-17A) and CD8+CD69+CD103âT cells (IL-17A, IL-2 and TNF-Î±) to exhibit intrinsic differences in their ability to respond to Î±-CD3/CD28 stimulation.</p>

                <p>Although CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> is one of the major subsets located at the site of infection (terminal ileum for <italic>S</italic>.

We hypothesized that CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> would respond strongly and contribute to most of the elicited responses while CD8+CD69+CD103âT cells would also respond albeit differently in magnitude and characteristics following Ty21a immunization. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the ability of CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> and CD8+CD69+CD103âT cells obtained from TI biopsies of Ty21-vaccinated and unvaccinated volunteers to elicit <italic>S</italic>. Typhi-specific responses following stimulation with autologous <italic>S</italic>. Typhi-infected and uninfected targets cells. Cumulative data of <italic>S</italic>.

                <title>Multifunctional Terminal Ileum LPMC CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> and CD8+CD69+CD103âT Cells Responses Following Oral Ty21a-Immunization</title>
                <p>We have previously shown that PBMC and TI LPMC CD8+ T<sub>EM</sub> respond to <italic>S</italic>. Typhi by secreting multiple cytokines simultaneously (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). However, it is unknown whether TI <italic>S</italic>. Typhi-specific CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> cells responses also exhibit multi-functionality. This information will be important in uncovering the granularity of the <italic>S</italic>. Typhi responses in the local mucosa. Thus, we next investigated the multi-functionality of LPMC <italic>S</italic>. Typhi-specific CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> and CD8+CD69+CD103âT responses in Ty21a-vaccinated and unvaccinated volunteers. Using the Winlist FCOM function, TI-LPMC CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> and CD8+CD69+CD103âT responses were analyzed for multiple cytokines/chemokines (IFN-Î³, IL-17A, IL-2, and TNF-Î± (16 possible combinations) and characterized <italic>S</italic>. Typhi-specific responding cells as either single cytokine producers (S) or multifunctional (Sum of double, triple, quadruple, cytokine producers) (MF). First, we analyzed LPMC <italic>S</italic>. Typhi-specific CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> responses associated with IFN-Î³ production and observed that CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> IFN-Î³+ S or MF responses showed no significant differences following Ty21a vaccination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). In contrast, CD8+CD69+CD103â IFN-Î³+ responses were prominently MF following Ty21a vaccination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). Furthermore, the frequency of CD8+CD69+CD103â IFN-Î³+ MF from Ty21a vaccinees was significantly higher (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) than their unvaccinated counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). The level of IFN-Î³+ MF was significantly higher (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) in CD8+CD69+CD103â T cells than in CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). Remarkably, we observed significant increases in LPMC <italic>S</italic>. Typhi-specific CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> IL-17A+ S but not MF following Ty21a vaccination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). In contrast, no significant changes in the levels of <italic>S</italic>. Typhi-specific CD8+CD69+CD103â IL-17A+ S and MF was noted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). Moreover, we found that <italic>S</italic>. Typhi-specific IL-17A+ S and MF production was significantly higher (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) in CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> than in CD8+CD69+CD103âT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). Likewise, comparisons were made for IL-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>) and TNF-Î± (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>) on both cell types. No differences were noted in <italic>S</italic>. Typhi-specific responses in IL-2+ S and MF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>), and TNF-Î±+ S and MF cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>) except for a higher trend in CD8+CD69+CD103â IL-2+ S responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>) following Ty21a immunization. We next investigated the multifunctional nature of CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> responses, particularly related to IL-17A. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figures 7AâE</xref> we show two-parameter cytograms from a representative Ty21a volunteer. We observed that IL-17A+ CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> was co-produced mostly with IL-2 (0.6%), as compared to concomitantly with IFN-Î³ (0.1%) or TNF-Î± (0.1%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figures 7AâC</xref>). Low levels of cytokine co-producing CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> were observed for IFN-Î³+ IL-2+ (0.1%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7D</xref>) and IFN-Î³+ TNF-Î±+ (0.0%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7E</xref>). Finally, we stratified and compared the multifunctional IL-17A+ CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> responses based on the concomitant expression of two (2+ MF), three (3+ MF) or four (4+ MF) effector functions (i.e., co-production of IL-17A with IFN-Î³, IL-2 and/or TNF-Î±). Data are shown as the mean of <italic>S</italic>. Typhi-specific CD8+ IL-17A+ MF T<sub>RM</sub> in the volunteers who responded to Ty21a vaccination (<italic>n</italic> = 10) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7F</xref>). Interestingly, we observed that the majority of the MF responses were of the double-producing (72%) MF subsets (e.g., IL-17A+ IL-2+, IL-17A+ IFN-Î³+ or IL-17A+ TNF-Î±+) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7F</xref>). The quadruple MF subsets represented about a quarter (22%) of the MF responses while the triple MF subsets represented only 6% of the MF responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7F</xref>). We concluded that the CD8+ IL-17A+ MF T<sub>RM</sub> responses were primarily double-producing cells.</p>

                <title>Oral Ty21a Immunization Modulates Terminal Ileum IEL CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub>
<italic>ex vivo</italic></title>
                <p>We have observed that oral Ty21a immunization influences spontaneous production of cytokines by CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> in the lamina propria of the terminal ileum. We hypothesized that oral Ty21a immunization might similarly influence <italic>ex vivo</italic> responses without <italic>in vitro</italic> stimulation in the epithelial compartment of the human terminal ileum. To this end, we investigated the effect of oral Ty21a immunization on spontaneous production of cytokines by IEL CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub>. We first isolated TI IEL from biopsies obtained from volunteers who either received four doses of Ty21a or were unvaccinated and characterized CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> using CD69 and CD103 markers as shown in the gating strategy depicted in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">Figure S3</xref>. We observed that TI IEL CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> constitute the predominant population expressing high levels of CD69 and CD103. However, we observed differences in the frequencies of TI IEL CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> following Ty21a vaccination (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">Figures S3A,B</xref>). We also noted that following Ty21a vaccination, there were higher frequencies of TI IEL CD4+ T cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">Figure S3A</xref>). To determine whether there were differences in cell yields obtained from biopsies of Ty21a-vaccinated and unvaccinated volunteers, we compared the number of viable cells per mg of terminal ileum tissue and observed almost identical cell yields between the two groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM4">Figure S4A</xref>).</p>
                <p>Remarkably, the cumulative data indicated that the frequency of IEL CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> obtained from Ty21a vaccinated individuals were significantly lower than those from unvaccinated volunteers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Figure 10A</xref>). We next measured and compared the frequency of single (S) and multifunctional (MF) producing cytokines (IFN-Î³, IL-17A, IL-2, and TNF-Î±) in IEL CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> obtained from Ty21a vaccinated (<italic>n</italic> = 13) and unvaccinated (<italic>n</italic> = 10) volunteers following unstimulated overnight cultures. We found that <italic>ex-vivo</italic> unstimulated IEL CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> obtained from Ty21a immunized volunteers have significantly higher levels of IFN-Î³ S and MF than unimmunized volunteers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Figure 10B</xref>). Similarly, we found that IEL CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> produced spontaneously significantly higher IL-17A+ S and MF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Figure 10C</xref>) and TNF-Î±+ S and MF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Figure 10E</xref>) following Ty21a immunization.

                <title>Oral Ty21a-Immunization Elicits Terminal Ileum IEL <italic>S</italic>. Typhi Responsive CD8<sup>+</sup> T<sub>RM</sub></title>
                <p>Above we described our observations on the presence of <italic>S</italic>. Typhi responsive CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> in the terminal ileum lamina propria following Ty21a immunization and that CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> express high levels of CD103, integrin Î±E, which is a ligand to E-cadherin found on epithelial cells. Thus, it was reasonable to hypothesize that these CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> are poised to migrate to the epithelium and contribute to <italic>S</italic>. Typhi immunity as IEL. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the ability of IEL CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> obtained from TI biopsies of Ty21-vaccinated (<italic>n</italic> = 7) and unvaccinated (<italic>n</italic> = 6) volunteers to elicit <italic>S</italic>. Typhi-specific responses following stimulation with autologous <italic>S</italic>. Typhi-infected and uninfected targets cells. Net percentages of positive cells were calculated as % of <italic>S</italic>. Typhi-infected EBV-B responsesâ% of uninfected EBV-B responses as previously described.

Remarkably, IEL CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> exhibited significantly (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) higher <italic>S</italic>. Typhi-specific IL-17A responses in Ty21a vaccinated volunteers than their unvaccinated counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Figure 11A</xref>). We also noted that IEL CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> appear to show some increases in the production of IFN-Î³ and IL-2 cytokine following Ty21a-vaccination in some volunteers, which, as a group, did not reach statistical significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Figure 11A</xref>). This is, to our knowledge, the first demonstration of local <italic>S</italic>.

                <p>We have showed above that terminal ileum LPMC CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> respond to <italic>S</italic>.

Thus, we next investigated the multi-functionality of IEL <italic>S</italic>. Typhi-specific CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> responses in Ty21a-vaccinated and unvaccinated volunteers using the Winlist FCOM function. We analyzed IEL <italic>S</italic>.

We observed that the responses were mostly MF, with some individuals showing higher IL-17A, IL-2, IFN-Î³, and TNF-Î± production in S and/or MF cells following Ty21a vaccination, but which, as a group, did not reach statistical significance, likely due to the relatively limited number of participants evaluated.</p>

                <title>Relationship of Multifunctional <italic>S</italic>. Typhi-Specific CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> Responses Between LPMC and IEL</title>
                <p>Because CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> are elicited specifically following oral Ty21a immunization in both the lamina propria and epithelium compartments, albeit differently, we explored the relationship between the generation of <italic>S</italic>. Typhi specific immune responses between LPMC and IEL in an individual by individual basis. To this end we performed Spearman correlation tests between LPMC and IEL CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> S and MF responses in both Ty21a vaccinated and unvaccinated volunteers. We observed that in unvaccinated volunteers, the frequencies of LPMC CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> S and MF (IFN-Î³, IL-17A IL-2, and TNF-Î±) responses were not correlated to their IEL counterparts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM7">Table S2</xref>). However, following Ty21a vaccination, the frequencies of LPMC CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> MF (IL-17A and IL-2) responses, but not S, were significantly correlated to their IEL counterparts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM7">Table S2</xref>). In addition, we analyzed the multifunctional CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub>
<italic>S</italic>. Typhi-specific subtypes elicited following Ty21a immunization in terminal ileum LPMC and IEL (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM5">Figure S5</xref>). We observed that the two major <italic>S</italic>. Typhi MF effector subtypes in LPMC CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> significantly elicited were IL-17A+ IL-2+ and IFN-Î³+ TNF-Î±+ double producers following Ty21a immunization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM5">Figure S5</xref>). Similar comparisons in IEL CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> revealed analogous trends, but they did not reach statistical significance following Ty21a immunization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM5">Figure S5</xref>).</p>
                <p>To further understand the relationship between LPMC and IEL, we measured the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of CD69 and CD103 expressed on CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> from each individual volunteer following Ty21a immunization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Figure 12</xref>). As shown in the cytogram of the representative unvaccinated volunteer, CD69 is expressed at a higher level on CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> obtained from IEL (green line) than in LPMC (blue line) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Figure 12A</xref>). As expected, CD8+ T<sub>EM</sub> obtained from PBMC (red line) expressed much lower levels of CD69 as compared to LPMC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Figure 12A</xref>). We next compared the level of CD69 between IEL and LPMC CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> obtained from either Ty21a vaccinated (<italic>n</italic> = 7) or unvaccinated (<italic>n</italic> = 6) volunteers. Cumulative data shows that in unvaccinated volunteers, the levels of CD69 expression on CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> were significantly (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) higher in IEL than in LPMC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Figure 12B</xref>). In contrast, following Ty21a vaccination, no trends were observed in CD69 MFI levels between these cell subsets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Figure 12B</xref>). Of note, we observed a trend to lower levels of CD69 expression in both IEL and LPMC CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> in vaccinated as compared to unvaccinated participants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Figure 12B</xref>). We also determined the levels of CD103 expression as shown by an unvaccinated representative volunteer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Figure 12C</xref>) where the level of expression of CD103 on CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> was shown to be similar between IEL (green line) and LPMC (blue line) but, as expected, absent in PBMC CD8+ T<sub>EM</sub> (red line) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Figure 12C</xref>). We next compared between the two groups of individuals. Cumulative data indicated that in unvaccinated volunteers, the level of CD103 expression on CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> was similar between IEL and LPMC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Figure 12D</xref>). In contrast, following Ty21a vaccination, we observed significantly higher expression of CD103 in IEL than in LPMC CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Figure 12D</xref>).</p>

                <p>It was previously reported that oral Ty21a immunization elicits both LPMC and PBMC CD8+ T<sub>EM</sub> (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>), and in this study we demonstrated that CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> are elicited in both LPMC and IEL following Ty21a immunization. To enable the pairwise comparison of <italic>S</italic>. Typhi-specific responses in the various compartments, we sampled simultaneously PBMC and terminal ileum biopsies in each volunteer. We hypothesized that the induction of systemic <italic>S</italic>. Typhi responsive CD8+T<sub>EM</sub> would differ in quantity and quality to those elicited in CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> in mucosal tissues (LPMC and IEL) following Ty21a immunization. To explore this hypothesis, we investigated the relationship between the generations of <italic>S</italic>. Typhi-specific immune responses between PBMC CD8+ T<sub>EM</sub> and LPMC CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> on an individual by individual basis. To this end we performed Spearman correlation tests between PBMC CD8+ T<sub>EM</sub> and LPMC CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> S and MF responses in Ty21a vaccinated (<italic>n</italic> = 9) volunteers. We observed that following Ty21a vaccination, the frequencies of PBMC CD8+ T<sub>EM</sub> S (TNF-Î±) responses, but not MF, were significantly negatively correlated to their LPMC counterparts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM8">Table S3</xref>), the level of PBMC CD8+ T<sub>EM</sub> S (TNF-Î±) responses being higher that their LPMC counterparts. Trends toward positive correlations were observed in S and MF IFN-Î³ and MF IL-17A production (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM8">Table S3</xref>). We also explored, using a similar approach, the relationship between the generation of <italic>S</italic>. Typhi-specific immune responses between PBMC CD8+ T<sub>EM</sub> and IEL CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> S and MF responses on an individual by individual basis in Ty21a vaccinated volunteers.

              <p>The ability of tissue resident memory T cells (T<sub>RM</sub>) to rapidly mount strong protective immunity to site-specific infection has increasingly become an important focus to evaluate T cellâmediated responses as part of vaccine development efforts. Here, we determined the effect of oral immunization with the attenuated oral typhoid vaccine Ty21a on human terminal ileum LPMC and IEL CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub>. We established that immunization results in increased spontaneous cytokine production. Importantly, we also observed cytokine production in response to <italic>S</italic>. Typhi-responsive CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub>, which were further increased following Ty21a immunization. These increases following oral Ty21a immunization were primarily in Tc17 in both terminal ileum mucosal compartments, i.e., lamina propria (LPMC) and epithelium (IEL). Moreover, we uncovered that LPMC CD8+CD69+CD103â T cells subsets contributed significantly to <italic>S</italic>. Typhi-specific IFN-Î³, IL-17A, and IL-2 responses following Ty21a immunization. Our results also showed that oral Ty21a immunization influence the ability of LPMC to respond to stimulation through the T cell receptor and the CD28 co-stimulatory molecule using Î±-CD3/CD28 beads. Taken together, these results contribute novel information of the effects of oral vaccination on terminal ileum mucosal responses in humans which could have significant implications in vaccine design and development.</p>
              <p>Enteric pathogens (e.g., <italic>S</italic>. Typhi) or oral Ty21a vaccine strain can actively enter intestinal epithelium at the site of infection (e.g., TI) through a variety of mechanisms including epithelial and M cells invasion (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). The assumption is that following invasion, bacterial antigens activate the innate immune system and are presented to T<sub>M</sub> cells including T<sub>RM</sub> by antigen presenting cells (APC) in the lamina propria and the epithelium eliciting protective adaptive effector immune responses. Given the great difficulties associated with obtaining cells from terminal ileum, the preferred site of infection of the human-restricted <italic>S</italic>. Typhi bacteria in humans, very limited information is available on the responses in the human gut microenvironment. Using this unique model involving oral immunization with an attenuated typhoid vaccine in humans, we observed that vaccination results in increases in the spontaneous production of significantly higher levels of cytokines (IFN-Î³ and TNF-Î±) as single producing effectors in both LPMC CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> and CD8+CD69+CD103â T cells. However, increases in the spontaneous production of IL-17A following Ty21a vaccination were only observed in LPMC CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> S but not LPMC CD8+CD69+CD103â T cells, which had significant decreased in spontaneous IL-17A production. Overall, these results indicate that oral Ty21a immunization influence the ability of LPMC CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> S to become Tc1 and Tc17 effectors, while LPMC CD8+CD69+CD103â T cells exhibit Tc1 effector characteristics. Some of these effects were also observed following stimulation with Î±-CD3/CD28 stimulation. This may be explained by the fact that although LPMC is a relatively homogenous population expressing CD8, CD103, and CD69, they can be composed of multiple cell subsets which differ in their requirements for activation signals and/or on the specific cognate antigens they recognize (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>â<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Thus, the spontaneous production of cytokines by LPMC CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> could be derived from LPMC CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> and a variety of other resident LPMC T cells, such as mucosal associated invariant T cells (MAIT) and natural killer T cells (NKT) following oral Ty21a immunization (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). Further studies will be required to fully understand the contribution of various cell subsets to the observed increase in spontaneous cytokine production following immunization. Importantly, these novel results show that immunization with bacterial oral vaccines may have immunomodulatory effects beyond those that are specific for the vaccine being administered.</p>
              <p>We next provided evidence that oral Ty21a-immunization elicits significant LPMC CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub>
<italic>S</italic>. Typhi-specific responses producing primarily IL-17A. These antigen-specific responses were mostly observed as single-producing effectors suggesting that <italic>S</italic>. Typhi-responsive CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> S are primarily Tc17. Remarkably LPMC CD8+CD69+CD103â T cells were elicited to produce significantly higher <italic>S</italic>. Typhi-specific IFN-Î³, IL-17A, and IL-2 levels following Ty21a vaccination. These results suggest a dichotomy in <italic>S</italic>. Typhi-specific responses in TI following Ty21a immunization whereby LPMC CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> are mostly Tc17 (IL-17A), whilst CD8+CD69+CD103â T cells produced multiple cytokines associated with both Tc1 (IFN-Î³ and IL-2) and Tc17 (IL-17), a set of effector immune responses well-suited for protection against intracellular pathogens.</p>
              <p>We also analyzed whether CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> and CD8+CD69+CD103â T LPMC responses following Ty21a immunization depend on the antigen used for <italic>in vitro</italic> stimulation. To this end we used <italic>S</italic>. Typhi-infected targets (an efficient CD8+ T stimulation) and Ty21a homogenate antigens (a less efficient CD8+ T stimulation) (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>) to stimulate CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> and CD8+CD69+CD103â T cells. Interestingly, our results indicate that following stimulation with Ty21a homogenate antigens, LPMC CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> primarily produced not only significant <italic>S</italic>. Typhi-specific IL-17A <bold>S</bold> responses, but also significant IFN-Î³ MF and TNF-Î± MF T<sub>RM</sub> in the vaccinated group compared to the unvaccinated group. The latter results were not observed with <italic>S</italic>. Typhi-infected targets stimulation, which largely display <italic>S</italic>. Typhi antigens in the context of MHC-I molecules. In contrast, following stimulation with the Ty21a homogenate, LPMC CD8+CD69+CD103â T cells showed no increase in cytokines production by MF or S in the Ty21a vaccinated group. These results suggest that LPMC CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> are more versatile in recognizing and responding to <italic>S</italic>. Typhi antigens primarily as Tc17 effectors than CD8+CD69+CD103â T cells. Of note, we recently reported that Ty21a immunization also elicits the induction of <italic>S</italic>. Typhi-specific CD4+ T<sub>M</sub> to secrete cytokines following <italic>in vitro</italic> stimulation, indicating that multiple effector T cell responses are concomitantly induced (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). Future studies looking at the activation requirements of CD4 and CD8 populations in human tissues would be crucial to better understand these phenomena to advance mucosal vaccines targeting the induction of T cell mediated immunity.</p>
              <p>CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> express abundant levels of integrin Î±E (CD103) which forms a heterodimer with integrin Î²7 and recognizes E-cadherin expressed on the intestinal epithelial cells (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). Intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) have been proposed as being an important cell subset involved in immune responses at mucosal surfaces (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). Thus, we deemed important to also focus on this important cell population following oral immunization in the present human oral immunization model. We describe, for the first time, that oral Ty21a immunization elicits activated IEL CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> responses with significantly increased spontaneous production of cytokines (IFN-Î³, IL-17A, IL-2, and TNF-Î±), both as single cytokine producing and multifunctional effectors. These results are similar to the spontaneous cytokine production described for LPMC populations above and can also represent the combined response of multiple cell subsets (e.g., classical CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub>, MAIT, NKT) which are activated to spontaneously produce cytokines following oral immunization.</p>
              <p>Regarding <italic>S</italic>. Typhi-specific cytokine production, we found that oral Ty21a-immunization elicits significant IEL CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> producing primarily IL-17A, although a few volunteers also exhibited strong IL-2, IFN-Î³, and TNF-Î± production. These antigen-specific responses were observed both as single-producing and multifunctional effectors and may represent IEL derived from conventional CD8Î±Î² T cells recognizing <italic>S</italic>. Typhi antigens presented in the context of MHC class I molecules which have homed to the intestinal epithelium following recognition of their cognate antigen in the intestine (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). Taken together, our findings suggest that adaptive IEL CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> elicited by oral Ty21a immunization as both, Tc1 and Tc17 subsets. In future studies it will be essential to understand the activation properties these IEL T<sub>RM</sub> cells to gain further insights into the mechanism regulating local gut immunity in humans.</p>
              <p>Interestingly, comparisons of CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> located in different compartments (e.g., lamina propria vs. epithelium) indicate a positive relationship in <italic>S</italic>. Typhi-specific CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> MF responses between LPMC and IEL following Ty21a immunization. In addition, we also observed that there are dominant MF subtypes (IL-17A+ IL-2+ and IFN-Î³+ TNF-Î±+ double producers) elicited following Ty21a immunization and that these subtypes were present in LPMC, although they were also observed in IEL from a few volunteers. Taken together, these results suggest that CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> MF may be better poised to shuttle between LPMC and IEL, and, therefore, they are likely to play a major effector function in the epithelium. This observation further substantiate our recent report that <italic>S</italic>. Typhi-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> MF responses correlate with protection against typhoid disease onset in a <italic>S</italic>. Typhi human challenged model (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Thus, MF <italic>S</italic>. Typhi-specific responses elicited int the terminal ileum could be a key factor in protection against typhoid disease. These results are important because of mounting evidence that the MF characteristics of immune responses are significant determinants of effective immunity against pathogens. In fact, the induction of MF responses at higher magnitudes than single cytokine-secreting cells have been shown to be important, including in some cases being associated with protection, in various disease and vaccine models, including HIV, Cytomegalovirus, vaccinia, EBV, <italic>Leishmania, M. tuberculosis</italic>, and Ebola (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>â<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). Thus, it is likely that the development of future generations of improved oral <italic>Salmonella</italic> vaccines need to prioritize the induction of MF CD8+ T<sub>EM</sub> cells in the mucosal microenvironment.</p>
              <p>Finally, we also compared the systemic (PBMC CD8+ T<sub>EM</sub>) and mucosal (LPMC and IEL) CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> compartments. Interestingly, these comparisons indicated that PBMC CD8+ T<sub>EM</sub> MF and LPMC CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> MF have a positive relationship (positive Spearman Rho values), although this correlation did not reach statistical significance likely due to the relatively small number of individuals evaluated. These observations confirm and extend our previous findings of significant positive correlations between LPMC and PBMC CD8+ T<sub>EM</sub> MF cells (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>).</p>
              <p>In closing, we provide the first evidence of the induction of increased spontaneous and <italic>S</italic>. Typhi-specific cytokine production by CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> in the lamina propria and intestinal epithelium of the human terminal ileum mucosa following oral immunization with Ty21a. These results contribute novel insights into our understanding of the generation of gut local immunity in humans following immunization with oral attenuated bacteria and suggest that CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> play a key role in protection following immunization and/or infection with <italic>S</italic>.

Typhi-infected autologous EBV-B cells and the produced cytokines (IFNÎ³, IL-17A, IL-2, and TNFÎ±) determined. Anti (Î±)-CD3/CD28 stimulation was used as a positive control in both subsets while unstimulated LPMC CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> or CD8+CD69+CD103â T cells alone was used as a negative control. In addition, unstained cell controls were used to place the delimiters for LPMC auto-fluorescence. The percentage of positive cells in the gated regions is shown above the corresponding black boxes.</p>
