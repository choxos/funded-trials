                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>South Africa is among the countries with the highest prevalence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including <italic toggle="yes">Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> (CT) and <italic toggle="yes">Neisseria gonorrhoeae</italic> (NG). In 2017, there were an estimated 6 million new CT, 4.5 million NG and 71 000 <italic toggle="yes">Treponema pallidum</italic> infections among South African men and women of reproductive age.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="sec002">
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>We evaluated STI prevalence and incidence and associated risk factors in 162 women aged 18–33 years old, residing in eThekwini and Tshwane, South Africa who were part of the Evidence for Contraceptive Options and HIV Outcomes (ECHO) trial. Women were randomised to use depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (n = 53), copper intrauterine device (n = 51), or levonorgestrel (n = 58) implant. Lateral vaginal wall swab samples were collected prior to contraceptive initiation and at months one and three following contraceptive initiation for STI testing.</p>

                <sec id="sec003">
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>There were no significant differences in STI incidence and prevalence across contraceptive groups. At baseline, 40% had active STIs (CT, NG, <italic toggle="yes">Trichomonas vaginalis</italic> (TV), <italic toggle="yes">Mycoplasma genitalium</italic> (MG) or herpes simplex virus-2 shedding across all age groups– 18–21 years (46%), 22–25 years (42%) and 26–33 years (29%). The incidence of STIs during follow-up was exceptionally high (107.9/100 women-years [wy]), with younger women (18–21 years) more likely to acquire CT (75.9/100 wy) compared to 26–33 year olds (17.4/100 wy; p = 0.049). TV incidence was higher in the 26–33 year old group (82.7/100 wy) compared to the 18–21 year olds (8.4/100 wy; p = 0.01).</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>Although the study participants received extensive counselling on the importance of condom use, this study highlights the high prevalence and incidence of STIs in South African women, especially amongst young women, emphasising the need for better STI screening and management strategies.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Sexually transmitted infections (STI) continue to be a global health concern. Most STIs are asymptomatic, often undetected and are therefore left untreated [<xref rid="pone.0294285.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0294285.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Both asymptomatic and symptomatic STIs can affect fertility, increase risk of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, and can enhance HIV shedding at genital mucosal sites [<xref rid="pone.0294285.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0294285.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. South Africa is one of the countries with the highest prevalence of STIs, including <italic toggle="yes">Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> (CT) and <italic toggle="yes">Neisseria gonorrhoeae</italic> (NG), as well as HIV. In 2017, there were an estimated 6 million new CT, 4.5 million NG and 71 000 <italic toggle="yes">Treponema pallidum</italic> infections among South African men and women of reproductive age [<xref rid="pone.0294285.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. STI prevalence generally varies by age, sex and pathogen [<xref rid="pone.0294285.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0294285.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. A 2018 meta-analysis among women in South Africa reported higher CT and NG prevalence among younger (18–24) as compared to older (25–49) women (15% vs. 7.0% and 5% versus 3%, respectively) [<xref rid="pone.0294285.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. On the other hand, syphilis and herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) were more prevalent in older compared to younger women (4% versus 2% and 78% versus 39%, respectively) and <italic toggle="yes">Trichomonas vaginalis</italic> (TV) prevalence was similar (9% versus 8%) [<xref rid="pone.0294285.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Among younger women, those aged 20–24 years have been found twice as likely to be infected with a curable STI (CT, NG, syphilis or TV) and HSV-2 when compared to those aged 15–19 years and also more likely to have a STI compared to their male counterparts [<xref rid="pone.0294285.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p>
              <p>Multiple behavioral and social factors increase STI risk among young women including inconsistent or lack of condom use, multiple sexual partners [<xref rid="pone.0294285.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0294285.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], physical and sexual partner violence or coercion, alcohol use and older sexual partners [<xref rid="pone.0294285.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0294285.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Relationship power inequity, reduced access to sexual health resources [<xref rid="pone.0294285.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and decreased educational and economic opportunities and unemployment [<xref rid="pone.0294285.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0294285.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0294285.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] also contribute to increased STI risk among young women. Biological factors may also influence a woman’s susceptibility to STIs, such as a nonoptimal vaginal microbiome, aberrant inflammation, or decreased protective immunity [<xref rid="pone.0294285.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Data on whether contraceptive use affects STI acquisition are inconclusive [<xref rid="pone.0294285.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0294285.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], in large part due to the lack of data from prospective and randomized studies. However contraceptive use alters the vaginal microbiome [<xref rid="pone.0294285.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0294285.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and a non-optimal vaginal microbiome has been associated with increased risk of STIs [<xref rid="pone.0294285.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The Evidence for Contraceptive Options and HIV outcomes (ECHO) trial [<xref rid="pone.0294285.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], which evaluated HIV incidence among women randomized to depo-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA-IM), copper-Intrauterine device (copper IUD) or levonorgestrel (LNG) implant, reported 20–28% CT and 4–9% NG prevalence among South African trial participants at baseline depending on the province [<xref rid="pone.0294285.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Here, we expand on this previous work by testing for additional STIs, including TV, <italic toggle="yes">Mycoplasma genitalium</italic> (MG) and HSV-2 shedding and evaluate factors associated with STI baseline prevalence and acquisition over three-months following contraceptive randomization.</p>
              <p>The aim of the study was to investigate the prevalence and incidence of STIs among South African women and to compare incidence between contraceptive arms, age groups, study sites, and according to condom use and semen detection.</p>

                <title>Study participants</title>
                <p>The participants in this sub-study were enrolled at the Setshaba Research Centre (SRC) in Tshwane (n = 53) and MatCH Research Unit (MRU) in eThekwini (n = 109) as part of the ECHO trial [<xref rid="pone.0294285.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. ECHO evaluated HIV incidence among 7800 women randomised to DMPA-IM, the LNG implant or the copper-IUD in South Africa, Kenya, Zambia and Eswatini between December 2015 and September 2017 [<xref rid="pone.0294285.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Women enrolled were nonpregnant, HIV-seronegative, aged 16–35 years, sexually active, seeking effective contraception, had no medical contraindications to the contraceptive methods included in the trial, and had no reported use of injectable, intrauterine or implantable contraception in the previous 6 months. Approximately equal numbers of women in each contraceptive arm were enrolled in this sub-study (51 in the copper IUD group, 53 in the DMPA-IM group, and 58 in the LNG implant group). Demographic, behavioural, and clinical data were collected on standardised case report forms in the parent ECHO trial. Women received HIV and STI risk reduction counselling, HIV testing, syndromic STI treatment and treatment of any diagnosed infection, and were offered male and/or female condoms at each visit. Partner testing and counselling for any study participant was also offered. The University of the Witwatersrand and University of Cape Town Human Research Ethics Committees approved this study and all participants provided written informed consent.</p>

                <title>Specimen collection and processing</title>
                <p>For this sub-study, lateral vaginal wall swab samples were collected between June and December 2017 for STI diagnosis and prostate specific antigen (PSA), a biomarker of semen, testing. Specimens were collected at three timepoints—at baseline (immediately before contraceptive method initiation), month one (M1), and month three (M3). Almost all (96%) participants completed all three visits. Samples were collected by placing Dacron swabs on the lateral vaginal wall and rotating 360 degrees, prior to storage at -80°C for a median time of 23 months (range 21–28 months).</p>
                <p>Frozen lateral vaginal wall swabs were thawed on ice overnight at 4⁰C prior to elution in 1 mL of phosphate buffered saline (PBS; Sigma-Aldrich, P5493). Tubes were vortexed for 60 seconds and incubated at 4⁰C for 1 hour. Excess mucus was then scraped off the inner wall of the tubes and each tube was vortexed again for 30 seconds.</p>

                <title>STI testing</title>
                <p>All participants were tested for CT and NG using a nucleic acid amplification test on the GeneXpert instrument system at screening, the final visit and as clinically indicated in the ECHO trial. Additionally, HSV-2 serologic testing was conducted at screening and final visits as part of the parent trial at Bio Analytical Research Corporation South Africa [<xref rid="pone.0294285.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Syndromic management was provided at screening; participants with positive CT/NG results not treated at screening were recalled for treatment when results became available. Additional testing for active STIs was conducted as part of the present sub-study as follows. DNA from swab eluants was extracted using the Roche Nucleic acid Kit 1 (Cat. No. 03730964001) and the MagNa Pure Compact Instrument (Product no. 03731146001) and 100μl of the extracted DNA was stored at -20°C until testing. STI testing was conducted using the STD Direct Flow Chip Kit (Master Diagnostica®—Ref: MAD-003938M-HS12). DNA was amplified using multiplex PCR followed by hybridisation according to the manufacturer’s instructions for the detection of multiple STI causing organisms including <italic toggle="yes">Chlamydia trachomatis</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Neisseria gonorrhoeae</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Mycoplasma genitalium</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">hominis</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Ureaplasma urealyticum/parvum</italic>, HSV-1 and 2 and <italic toggle="yes">Treponema pallidum</italic>. The results were analysed using hybriSoft analysis software (Master Diagnostica®). Vaginal swabs were also tested for the presence of <italic toggle="yes">T</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">vaginalis</italic> as described by Schirm <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0294285.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Primers and JOE-labeled probe targeting <italic toggle="yes">T</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">vaginalis</italic>-specific 2-kb repeated sequence was employed using ViiA 7 Real-Time PCR System (ThermoFisher Scientific). Samples were processed in duplicate and those with mean cycle threshold (Ct) values &lt;40 were considered positive. Wells with no DNA served as negative controls, and standard curves using serial dilutions of <italic toggle="yes">T</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">vaginalis</italic> genomic DNA were included.</p>

                <title>PSA measurement</title>
                <p>Swab eluants were transferred into filter centrifuge tubes (Corning® Costar® Spin-X® tubes Sigma-Aldrich, <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/product/sigma/cls8160?lang=en&amp;region=ZA" ext-link-type="uri">CLS8160</ext-link>) and centrifuged for 10 min at 4000 Relative Centrifugal Force (RCF). Filters were removed and the supernatants vortexed for 10 seconds at a low speed. PSA as a marker of recent unprotected sex was measured using Human Kallikrein 3/PSA Quantikine ELISA (R&amp;D Systems, US–catalog no. DKK300). Reagent preparation and assay procedures were conducted according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Samples were analysed on an ELISA plate reader Spectramax 250 for PSA at 450nm.</p>

                <title>Data analysis</title>
                <p>Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, USA) and R Studio (R Studio Software, USA). Women were grouped by age to include approximately equal numbers within each group (18–21; 22–25; 26–33 years). We used the Fisher exact test to compare baseline STI prevalence between groups, including age group, contraceptive group (copper-IUD, LNG implant and DMPA-IM) and Chi-Square test for PSA detection (detected/not detected), condom use (yes/no) and site (eThekwini/Tshwane). Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare weight, height, body mass index and number of sex acts in the past three months. We compared STI incidence over the three-month follow-up period between groups using the Kaplan-Meier method. P-values were adjusted for multiple testing using a Bonferroni correction [<xref rid="pone.0294285.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Incidence was defined as the total number of new cases/ total person-time at risk and prevalence was defined as the total number of affected individuals/ total number of individuals in the population.</p>

However, CT incidence was higher among women aged 18–21 years (75.9/100 wy) compared to those aged 22–25 and 26–33 years (31.6/100 wy and 17.4/100 wy respectively), with a significant difference between the 18–21 and 26–33 year age groups (p = 0.049; <xref rid="pone.0294285.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>). In contrast, STI incidence was higher for TV in the 26–33 year age group (82.7/100 wy) compared to the 18–21 and 22–25 year age groups (8.4/100 wy and 50.5/100 wy respectively), with a significant difference between the 18–21 and 26–33 year age groups (p = 0.01; <xref rid="pone.0294285.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>). Although STI incidence between sites was relatively similar, there was a nonsignificant trend towards a greater incidence of multiple active STIs at the eThekwini site compared to the Tshwane site (48.9/100wy and 8.3/100wy respectively; <xref rid="pone.0294285.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Table</xref>, p = 0.06). When the data were stratified by age group, 26–33 year old women at eThekwini were more likely to acquire a STI compared to women of the same age at Tshwane (p = 0.002; <xref rid="pone.0294285.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>).</p>

              <p>STIs have a major impact on both sexual and reproductive health and, in addition to their individual pathogenic effects, increase the risk of HIV, adverse pregnancy outcomes and infertility. Understanding factors that influence STI prevalence and incidence is critical for the implementation of effective management strategies to reduce the burden of these infections and associated adverse outcomes. Similar to previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0294285.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0294285.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0294285.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0294285.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], our study found a high burden of STIs in South African women, with 40% of women having an active STI, 19% having CT, 29% TV, 38% HSV-2 seropositivity and 10% having more than one active STI. During the three-month follow-up period, we observed a high incidence (107.9/100wy) of any active STI.</p>
              <p>Younger women (18–21 years) had a higher prevalence of CT compared to older women (26–33 years), 29% vs 8% respectively. This is similar to the prevalence reported in the ECHO parent study that recorded CT prevalence of 20–28% in South African women at baseline and found that younger women were more likely to have a CT infection than older women [<xref rid="pone.0294285.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In contrast, and as expected, HSV-2 seropositivity was higher in the older age groups (22–25 and 26–33; 44% and 53% respectively) compared to the younger age group (18–21; 16%). Similar to the prevalence data for 18–21 year-olds, this age group was more likely to acquire CT during the follow-up period while older women aged 26–33 were more likely to acquire TV. Previous studies have hypothesized that long-lasting partial immunity to CT may develop [<xref rid="pone.0294285.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and this may explain the difference in prevalence and incidence observed between age groups. On the other hand, more frequent sexual activity reported by older women could account for the greater incidence of TV. We did not find any statistically significant differences in STI incidence between contraceptive arms, but there was a trend towards higher incidence of CT and any STI in the DMPA-IM arm compared to the LNG implant users through three months. In contrast, an analysis of CT and NG prevalence following 18 months of contraceptive use in the ECHO parent study, which included all clinical sites, found that CT was less prevalent in women using DMPA-IM compared to LNG implant users [<xref rid="pone.0294285.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. This difference between our analyses and that of the parent study may be explained by socio-behavioral differences between the women enrolled at different clinical sites in South Africa and other countries. For example, reported sexual activity differed between Tshwane and eThekwini and TV prevalence at the Tshwane site was almost three times that of eThekwini while other STI infections were similar between sites. CT and NG prevalence rates at the eThekwini study site in Kwa-Zulu Natal (21% and 3% respectively) were comparable to the prevalence reported in this province in the ECHO parent study [<xref rid="pone.0294285.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], however, CT prevalence was double in the Gauteng province overall compared to the Tshwane study site in this study (20% vs 10% respectively). Additionally, other behavioral factors may play a role, including differences in smoking, educational level or clinical factors such as cervical ectopy. Additionally, contraceptive-associated risk may change with use over time with long-acting methods, such as decreasing LNG implant release rates over time.</p>
              <p>We measured PSA as a biomarker of semen to evaluate the relationships between recent unprotected sexual intercourse, reported condom use and STI incidence. Only 13% of individuals tested positive for PSA at baseline and, while PSA was not associated with reported condom use, it was significantly associated with reporting of recent vaginal sexual acts. We did not find any association between PSA positivity across all visits and STI incidence, and we did not observe significant differences in PSA detection between age groups, study sites or contraceptive arms. However, a study by Deese et al. [<xref rid="pone.0294285.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], investigating PSA detection frequency in another sub-study of the ECHO clinical trial showed that PSA was detected less frequently in women randomised to DMPA-IM compared to copper-IUD and LNG implant. These data suggest that women using copper-IUD and LNG implant may have had condomless vaginal sex more frequently than women using DMPA-IM. Other studies have shown that PSA is associated with bacterial vaginosis prevalence and is involved in cytokine changes in the female genital tract [<xref rid="pone.0294285.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0294285.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p>
              <p>This study had several important strengths including randomization to contraceptive method, high adherence to contraceptive method and testing for STIs and other co-factors. However, limitations include the small sample size, short follow-up period, and limited power to evaluate differences between some of the STIs between the different groups. It would also be vital to study the STI incidence and prevalence rates in women living with HIV as this cohort included only seronegative women. This has importance as previous studies have reported a bidirectional relationship between HIV and STIs, with women with HIV more likely to have a STI compared to HIV-negative women [<xref rid="pone.0294285.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and STIs associated with increased risk of HIV acquisition [<xref rid="pone.0294285.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Overall, this study adds to the limited data available on contraceptive use and STI acquisition [<xref rid="pone.0294285.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p>
              <p>In conclusion, this study found a high prevalence and incidence of STIs, especially in young women who are also most at risk of HIV infection in South Africa [<xref rid="pone.0294285.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0294285.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0294285.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0294285.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0294285.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. These findings highlight the need for better STI diagnosis and management in this setting where STIs are only treated if women present with signs or symptoms [<xref rid="pone.0294285.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], even though most infections are asymptomatic and remain untreated [<xref rid="pone.0294285.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Other factors that may contribute to high STI prevalence include limited education about STIs and their prevention, highlighting the need to empower the youth by educating them on sexual and reproductive health as well as encouraging proper use of condoms. The introduction of low-cost point-of-care (POC) STI testing in these settings will be of critical importance to effectively manage these infections. A recent study in South Africa found that POC testing, expedited partner therapy and immediate treatment of women with STIs successfully reduced STI prevalence after 12 weeks [<xref rid="pone.0294285.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. A South African research team is currently working on a Genital Inflammation Test (GIFT) for identifying women with asymptomatic STIs and bacterial vaginosis who are at risk for HIV acquisition [<xref rid="pone.0294285.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0294285.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. This intervention in conjunction with syndromic management may help lower the STI burden among South African women.</p>

              <p>Reviewer #1: This is an interesting study finding an alarmingly high prevalence and incidence of STIs among a population highly vulnerable to HIV. I think changes need to be made to the structure and the methodology before it is published. I will gladly review it again more thoroughly once my main concerns have been addressed. These are:</p>
              <p>1. I find it unclear what the aim of the analysis is. Is it to estimate STI prevalence and incidence in this population, or is it to explore the possible relationship between type of contraceptive and STI incidence? Please make the aim clear, explicitly with an aim statement at the end of the Introduction and implicitly throughout the narrative of the paper.</p>
              <p>2. I would request that a statistician also review the paper. I have a number of concerns:</p>
              <p>a. Incidence should be defined</p>
              <p>b. The reason for using keplan meier and the benefit of that approach is unclear to me</p>
              <p>c. The reason for plotting the age groups separately is also unclear. Is it to test a hypothesis that incidence would differ by age? The age categories seem somewhat arbitrary. How were they decided upon?</p>
              <p>General language suggestions:</p>
              <p>There are too many accronyms. As a minimum, I suggest referring to the MRU site as the eThekwini site instead, and the SRC as the Tschwane site.</p>
              <p>Define wy when first used</p>
              <p>I’m not sure this makes sense: ‘seeking effective contraception with no medical contraindications to trial contraceptive methods’</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Very good piece of research. I have a few minor comments.</p>
              <p>In the introduction I would reccomend changing the statements to "can cause shedding" and "can affect fertility" as it is not true in 100 percent of cases. I also reccomend splitting up the long list of reasons why women may be more susceptible to acquiring an sti. The list is long and the references need to match the risk factors presented. Also categories such as "gender inequality" is too broad. It is important to be more specific as to how these risks arise and why they are specific to young women.</p>
              <p>There are some formatting issues in the table where the rows are not vertically aligned. And I think each table needs a description of the p-value definition. Particularly table 3 which has a "P-value" column alongside three columns under the heading "p-value". Descriptions in the text or table caption would improve clarity for the reader.</p>
              <p>I also think the discussion should mention that the individuals in the cohort are also hiv seronegative and discuss the bias that may arise from this restriction.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: Review for "Prevalence and incidence of sexually transmitted infections among South African women initiating injectable and long-acting contraceptives"</p>
              <p>PONE-D-23-13490</p>
              <p>Reviewer: Tim Lucas, University of Leicester, UK</p>
              <p>Date: 2023-07-03</p>
              <p>Overview</p>
              <p>-----------</p>
              <p>This paper presents data and analyses of incidence and prevalence of a number of STIs (not including HIV) in South Africa.</p>
              <p>I have no expertise in STIs, but have been asked to review this paper as a statistician, so I will keep my comments within that area.</p>
              <p>Overall the analyses seem sensible and the paper is well written.</p>
              <p>I have a number of fairly minor points that I think could be clarified in the paper.</p>
              <p>Minor Comments</p>
              <p>---------------</p>
              <p>My most pressing concern is the way in which the multiple-testing adjusted p values have been presented (though I would like to thank the authors for taking this issue seriously throughout the analysis).</p>
              <p>Given that the procedure asks for all p values to be sorted, and then adjusted according to their rank, can I confirm how this has been conducted.</p>
              <p>Has every single p value in the entire paper been put into one long list and ranked?</p>
              <p>Or is each table of p values ranked and adjusted separately?</p>
              <p>I think either is fine, I would just like it to be clear in the paper.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, I think it might help interpretation if both the adjusted and unadjusted p values were presented (though I realise this might not always be easy without making the tables quite complex).</p>
              <p>Given that the smallest raw p values are adjusted more than the bigger p values, it could well be case that the variables with the smallest adjusted p values are not the variables with the smallest unadjusted p values.</p>
              <p>I think triangulating these two pieces of information would be useful.</p>
              <p>The reference given for this procedure (Columb and Sagadai 2006) has a typo in the FDR step-down procedure. In step 2 they say P' = P(m / (m - (m - 1))). However, m - (m - 1) in the denominator is just equal to 1 so there's clearly a mistake. I'm not sure what the correct expression is though. But if you have directly coded up this procedure based on the equations in this paper, you will need to find the right equation and recalculate.</p>
              <p>I would appreciate some more information in the paper about what effect the treatment/acquired immunity for these STIs has on subsequent infection and the exact ordering of treatments. Do these diseases confer immunity? You state that the baseline time is immediately before contraceptive method initiation. Were participants treated for existing STIs, and then contraception was initiated afterwards? Or was treatment initiated at the same time as contraception? If treatment was initiated at the same time as contraception this would cause some issues as presumably a course of antibiotics would be protective against reinfection.</p>
              <p>Is there any expectation that the implementation of contraception would directly prevent sexual activity due to discomfort or due to directions from the health workers? And importantly, is this effect different across the contraception methods?</p>
              <p>A note clarifying the role of herpes in the study would be useful. It is measured at baseline, and then not treated (as there is no treatment) and not measured in follow up. This all makes sense given the very different epidemiology of herpes compared to some of the other diseases, but I found it a bit confusing while reading the paper working out exactly what was happening.</p>
              <p>You have tested whether the different methods of contraception yield different incidences. I might have missed it, but some statements about why you are testing this would be useful. As above, I have no expertise in this area, but I wouldn't expect these methods of contraception to alter STI infection rates. So is this just to confirm this fact? Or is there a hypothesis that the contraception methods might alter behaviour in different ways? Or something else.</p>
              <p>Figure 2 is quite low resolution and hard to read.</p>

              <p>2. We note that you have included the phrase “data not shown” in your manuscript. Unfortunately, this does not meet our data sharing requirements. PLOS does not permit references to inaccessible data. We require that authors provide all relevant data within the paper, Supporting Information files, or in an acceptable, public repository. Please add a citation to support this phrase or upload the data that corresponds with these findings to a stable repository (such as Figshare or Dryad) and provide and URLs, DOIs, or accession numbers that may be used to access these data. Or, if the data are not a core part of the research being presented in your study, we ask that you remove the phrase that refers to these data.</p>
              <p>Response: We apologise for this and have now provided the data as Figures S3, S4 and S5.</p>
              <p>3. Please include a complete copy of PLOS’ questionnaire on inclusivity in global research in your revised manuscript. Our policy for research in this area aims to improve transparency in the reporting of research performed outside of researchers’ own country or community. The policy applies to researchers who have travelled to a different country to conduct research, research with Indigenous populations or their lands, and research on cultural artefacts. The questionnaire can also be requested at the journal’s discretion for any other submissions, even if these conditions are not met.

              <p>You can, however, still have the data available upon request if you provide a non-author contact (e.g., a Research Ethics Committee or Institutional Review Board contact).

              <p>Dear Dr. Masson,</p>
              <p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE’s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.</p>

              <p>We sincerely appreciate the valuable comments from the Reviewers, which have helped us to improve the quality of this manuscript. The detailed responses to the Reviewers' comments are provided below.</p>
              <p>Reviewer reports: </p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: This is an interesting study finding an alarmingly high prevalence and incidence of STIs among a population highly vulnerable to HIV. I think changes need to be made to the structure and the methodology before it is published. I will gladly review it again more thoroughly once my main concerns have been addressed. </p>
              <p>Response: We thank the Reviewer for their helpful comments. We have made the suggested changes below.</p>
              <p>These are: </p>
              <p>1. I find it unclear what the aim of the analysis is. Is it to estimate STI prevalence and incidence in this population, or is it to explore the possible relationship between type of contraceptive and STI incidence? Please make the aim clear, explicitly with an aim statement at the end of the Introduction and implicitly throughout the narrative of the paper.</p>
              <p>Response: We have added in an aim statement sentence to clarify the aim of the study (page 4, lines 17-8). </p>
              <p>2. I would request that a statistician also review the paper. I have a number of concerns:</p>
              <p>a. Incidence should be defined </p>
              <p>b. The reason for using keplan meier and the benefit of that approach is unclear to me</p>
              <p>c. The reason for plotting the age groups separately is also unclear. Is it to test a hypothesis that incidence would differ by age? The age categories seem somewhat arbitrary. How were they decided upon?</p>
              <p>Response: </p>
              <p>a) A sentence defining incidence and prevalence was added (Page 8, lines 11-13).</p>
              <p>b) The Kaplan-Meier method is frequently used to measure the incidence of STIs and other infections and to evaluate differences between groups. This method was chosen as follow-up time varied between participants - the Kaplan-Meier method makes appropriate allowances for censoring of observations and also makes use of the information from these subjects up to the time when they are censored. </p>
              <p>c) We have described the findings of previous studies in the Introduction, including the results of a meta-analysis showing that STI prevalence was higher amongst younger (18-24 years) compared to older women (25-49 years) in South Africa (9). Furthermore, differences within the younger age group have been noted, including the findings that women aged 20-24 years were twice as likely to be infected with a curable STI compared to women aged 15-19 years old (4). Therefore, we aimed to investigate these findings in our cohort and as such defined younger, middle and older age groups in a way that would approximately balance the number of participants in each group. We have clarified the grouping in the Methods section as follows: “Women were grouped by age to include approximately equal numbers within each group (18-21; 22-25; 26-33 years).”</p>
              <p>The authors appreciate the recommendation to have our manuscript evaluated by a statistician. Reviewer 3 of this manuscript is a statistician and the critique submitted by this reviewer focused mainly on statistical issues, which we have thoroughly addressed in our revisions (see below). </p>
              <p>General language suggestions: </p>
              <p>There are too many accronyms. As a minimum, I suggest referring to the MRU site as the eThekwini site instead, and the SRC as the Tschwane site. </p>
              <p>Define wy when first used. </p>
              <p>Response: We have removed unnecessary acronyms, including MRU, SRC, TP, SA, BARC and BV as suggested and defined wy (page 2, line 17 and page 10, line 11). </p>
              <p>I’m not sure this makes sense: ‘seeking effective contraception with no medical contraindications to trial contraceptive methods’.</p>
              <p>Response: We have modified this statement as follows: </p>
              <p>“Women enrolled were nonpregnant, HIV-seronegative, aged 16-35 years, sexually active, seeking effective contraception, had no medical contraindications to the contraceptive methods included in the trial, and with no reported use of injectable, intrauterine or implantable contraception in the past 6 months.”</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Very good piece of research. I have a few minor comments. </p>
              <p>In the introduction I would reccomend changing the statements to "can cause shedding" and "can affect fertility" as it is not true in 100 percent of cases. I also reccomend splitting up the long list of reasons why women may be more susceptible to acquiring an sti. The list is long and the references need to match the risk factors presented. Also categories such as "gender inequality" is too broad. It is important to be more specific as to how these risks arise and why they are specific to young women.</p>
              <p>Response: We have made the changes as suggested (pages 3-4, lines 20-24 and 1-3). We have split up the long sentences, adding in the references to the risks provided and changed “gender inequality” to “relationship power inequity” (page 3, line 23). </p>
              <p>There are some formatting issues in the table where the rows are not vertically aligned. And I think each table needs a description of the p-value definition. Particularly table 3 which has a "P-value" column alongside three columns under the heading "p-value". Descriptions in the text or table caption would improve clarity for the reader.</p>
              <p>Response: We have formatted the tables (Tables 1, 2 and 3) and added the p-value definition below each table (pages 12, 13 and 14). </p>
              <p>I also think the discussion should mention that the individuals in the cohort are also hiv seronegative and discuss the bias that may arise from this restriction.</p>
              <p>Response: We have added in a paragraph to discuss the above (page 17, lines 13-17).</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: This paper presents data and analyses of incidence and prevalence of a number of STIs (not including HIV) in South Africa. </p>
              <p>I have no expertise in STIs, but have been asked to review this paper as a statistician, so I will keep my comments within that area. </p>
              <p>Overall the analyses seem sensible and the paper is well written. </p>
              <p>I have a number of fairly minor points that I think could be clarified in the paper. </p>
              <p>Minor Comments </p>
              <p>---------------</p>
              <p>My most pressing concern is the way in which the multiple-testing adjusted p values have been presented (though I would like to thank the authors for taking this issue seriously throughout the analysis). </p>
              <p>Given that the procedure asks for all p values to be sorted, and then adjusted according to their rank, can I confirm how this has been conducted. </p>
              <p>Has every single p value in the entire paper been put into one long list and ranked? </p>
              <p>Or is each table of p values ranked and adjusted separately? </p>
              <p>I think either is fine, I would just like it to be clear in the paper. </p>
              <p>Furthermore, I think it might help interpretation if both the adjusted and unadjusted p values were presented (though I realise this might not always be easy without making the tables quite complex). </p>
              <p>Given that the smallest raw p values are adjusted more than the bigger p values, it could well be case that the variables with the smallest adjusted p values are not the variables with the smallest unadjusted p values. </p>
              <p>I think triangulating these two pieces of information would be useful. </p>
              <p>The reference given for this procedure (Columb and Sagadai 2006) has a typo in the FDR step-down procedure. In step 2 they say P' = P(m / (m - (m - 1))). However, m - (m - 1) in the denominator is just equal to 1 so there's clearly a mistake. I'm not sure what the correct expression is though. But if you have directly coded up this procedure based on the equations in this paper, you will need to find the right equation and recalculate.</p>
              <p>Response: We followed reviewer three’s advice and used Bonferroni correction instead of FDR step-down procedure for our analysis. This has been detailed in the Methods section and an appropriate reference provided. The p-values presented in the Tables are unadjusted p-values and, due to space limitations and the complexity of the tables, we have indicated the p-values that remained significant after adjusting for multiple comparisons with asterisks and have defined this in the subscripts. We have done the same for the Figures.</p>
              <p>I would appreciate some more information in the paper about what effect the treatment/acquired immunity for these STIs has on subsequent infection and the exact ordering of treatments. Do these diseases confer immunity? You state that the baseline time is immediately before contraceptive method initiation. Were participants treated for existing STIs, and then contraception was initiated afterwards? Or was treatment initiated at the same time as contraception? If treatment was initiated at the same time as contraception this would cause some issues as presumably a course of antibiotics would be protective against reinfection. </p>
              <p>Response: Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Trichomonas vaginalis and Mycoplasma genitalium are all treatable with antibiotics. N. gonorrhoeae has developed resistance to antibiotics and is able to evade the immune response thereby resulting in repeated infections. C. trachomatis treatment is effective in reducing persistent and recurrent infections and is more effective if sexual partners are treated as well. Chlamydia has also been spontaneously cleared in some cases, believed to be immune induced, but re-infection is still possible. M. genitalium has also developed resistance to certain antibiotics, but re-infection is still possible. The Herpes simplex viruses 1 &amp; 2 establish latent infection and reactivate frequently, it is therefore considered a lifelong infection. Current treatment regimens are highly effective but are unable to eliminate latent infection. T. vaginalis treatment has been effective, but previous exposure has not proven to be 100% effective and re-infection may occur (Waugh M, Gross G, Tyring SK. Sexually Transmitted Infections and Sexually Transmitted Diseases. 2011). </p>
              <p>We have included the following in the Discussion section (page 15, lines 20-24):</p>
              <p>“Previous studies have hypothesized that long-lasting partial immunity to CT may develop (27) and this may explain the difference in prevalence and incidence observed between age groups. On the other hand, more frequent sexual activity reported by older women could account for the greater incidence of TV.”</p>
              <p>Participants were screened and treated for existing STIs before contraceptive initiation as detailed in the Methods as follows: </p>
              <p>“Syndromic management was provided at screening; participants with positive CT/NG results not treated at screening were recalled for treatment when results became available. </p>
              <p>Is there any expectation that the implementation of contraception would directly prevent sexual activity due to discomfort or due to directions from the health workers? And importantly, is this effect different across the contraception methods? </p>
              <p>Response: We have included the following in the Discussion: </p>
              <p>“We did not find any association between PSA positivity across all visits and STI incidence, and we did not observe significant differences in PSA detection between age groups, study sites or contraceptive arms. However, a study by Deese et al. (28), investigating PSA detection frequency in another sub-study of the ECHO trial showed that PSA was detected less frequently in women randomised to DMPA-IM compared to copper-IUD and LNG implant. The data suggested that women using copper-IUD and LNG implant may have had condomless vaginal sex more frequently than women using DMPA-IM.”</p>
              <p>A note clarifying the role of herpes in the study would be useful. It is measured at baseline, and then not treated (as there is no treatment) and not measured in follow up. This all makes sense given the very different epidemiology of herpes compared to some of the other diseases, but I found it a bit confusing while reading the paper working out exactly what was happening.</p>
              <p>Response: HSV-2 serologic testing was conducted at screening and final visits as part of the parent trial, while our sub-study only evaluated active STIs, including HSV-1 and HSV-2 shedding. </p>
              <p>We have clarified this in the Methods section as follows: </p>
              <p>“Additionally, HSV-2 serologic testing was conducted at screening and final visits as part of the parent trial at Bio Analytical Research Corporation South Africa (22).” “Additional testing for active STIs was conducted as part of the present sub-study as follows.”</p>
              <p>You have tested whether the different methods of contraception yield different incidences. I might have missed it, but some statements about why you are testing this would be useful. As above, I have no expertise in this area, but I wouldn't expect these methods of contraception to alter STI infection rates. So is this just to confirm this fact? Or is there a hypothesis that the contraception methods might alter behaviour in different ways? Or something else. </p>
              <p>Response: We have included the following in the Introduction: “However, contraceptive use alters the vaginal microbiome (18-20) and a non-optimal vaginal microbiome has been associated with increased risk of STIs (21).”</p>
              <p>Figure 2 is quite low resolution and hard to read.</p>
              <p>Response: We have made edits to ensure Figure 2 is high res and legible.</p>
