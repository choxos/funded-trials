                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">The ACS QUIK trial showed that a multicomponent quality improvement toolkit intervention resulted in improvements in processes of care for patients with acute myocardial infarction in Kerala but did not improve clinical outcomes in the context of background improvements in care. We describe the development of the ACS QUIK intervention and evaluate its implementation, acceptability, and sustainability.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">We performed a mixed methods process evaluation alongside a cluster randomized, stepped-wedge trial in Kerala, India. The ACS QUIK intervention aimed to reduce the rate of major adverse cardiovascular events at 30 days compared with usual care across 63 hospitals (<italic>n</italic> = 21,374 patients). The ACS QUIK toolkit intervention, consisting of audit and feedback report, admission and discharge checklists, patient education materials, and guidelines for the development of code and rapid response teams, was developed based on formative qualitative research in Kerala and from systematic reviews. After four or more months of the center’s participation in the toolkit intervention phase of the trial, an online survey and physician interviews were administered. Physician interviews focused on evaluating the implementation and acceptability of the toolkit intervention. A framework analysis of transcripts incorporated context and intervening mechanisms.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">Among 63 participating hospitals, 22 physicians (35%) completed online surveys. Of these, 17 (77%) respondents reported that their hospital had a cardiovascular quality improvement team, 18 (82%) respondents reported having read an audit report, admission checklist, or discharge checklist, and 19 (86%) respondents reported using patient education materials. Among the 28 interviewees (44%), facilitators of toolkit intervention implementation were physicians’ support and leadership, hospital administrators’ support, ease-of-use of checklists and patient education materials, and availability of training opportunities for staff. Barriers that influenced the implementation or acceptability of the toolkit intervention for physicians included time and staff constraints, Internet access, patient volume, and inadequate understanding of the quality improvement toolkit intervention.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p id="Par4">Implementation and acceptability of the ACS QUIK toolkit intervention were enhanced by hospital-level management support, physician and team support, and usefulness of checklists and patient education materials. Wider and longer-term use of the toolkit intervention and its expansion to potentially other cardiovascular conditions or other locations where the quality of care is not as high as in the ACS QUIK trial may be useful for improving acute cardiovascular care in Kerala and beyond.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par6">India is estimated to have the largest number of fatal acute myocardial infarctions in the world because of its combination of relatively high incidence and case fatality rates and its large population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In high-income country settings, implementation of guideline-based treatment has been associated with improvements in clinical outcomes. For example, the CRUSADE (Can Rapid Risk Stratification of Unstable Angina Patients Suppress Adverse Outcomes With Early Implementation of the American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) Guidelines) National Quality Improvement Initiative demonstrated that a 10% higher adherence to clinical performance measures across 350 hospitals studied between 2001 and 2003 (<italic>n</italic> = 64,775 patients) was associated with a 10% lower adjusted odds of in-hospital mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In countries like Brazil and China, randomized trials have demonstrated improvements in process measures using quality improvement toolkit interventions that include clinician education, reminders, and case manager training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, these trials were not powered to demonstrate improvements in clinical outcomes.</p>
              <p id="Par7">In the Indian context, data collected from 2007 to 2009 for the Kerala ACS Registry (<italic>n</italic> = 25,748 patients) demonstrated gaps in optimal medical care as well as inappropriate care, such as delayed thrombolysis for patients presenting with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Although pilot studies have demonstrated potential benefits of implementing quality improvement strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], large-scale studies have not been carried out in India until recently. To address this gap in knowledge, the Acute Coronary Syndrome Quality Improvement in Kerala (ACS QUIK) cluster randomized, stepped-wedge trial was designed to develop, implement, and evaluate a quality improvement toolkit intervention to improve processes of care and clinical outcomes for patients with acute myocardial infarction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The ACS QUIK trial demonstrated improvements in process of care measures but did not demonstrate a reduction in the 30-day rate of major adverse cardiovascular events, defined by all-cause mortality, reinfarction, stroke, or major bleeding, in the context of improving background care during the trial. There was expected heterogeneity in the primary outcome across the participating hospitals.</p>
              <p id="Par8">We performed a mixed methods process evaluation of the ACS QUIK trial to improve the understanding of the contextual factors that affected implementation, the relative usefulness of the toolkit intervention, and how the interaction of these influenced study outcomes. Mixed methods research employs rigorous quantitative and qualitative research involving multiple types of data (survey questionnaire, in-depth oral interviews, text-messages) to maximize the strengths and counterbalance the weaknesses of each data type and aids in real-life contextual understanding of a research problem from multi-level perspectives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Process evaluations using mixed methods are useful in multicenter trials involving complex interventions to explore physicians’ views of the intervention, understand which components of the intervention worked, and evaluate variation of the intervention effects among sub-groups. Exploring the context and potential mechanisms of action and relating these data with trial outcomes provide further evidence on the potential utility of the toolkit intervention. This has relevance for potential adaptation of the ACS QUIK toolkit intervention in other low-resource settings given the contextual differences and challenges in implementing the guideline-based treatments, which have been shown to be effective in high-income country settings.</p>
              <p id="Par9">This paper presents the development, implementation, acceptability, sustainability, facilitators, barriers, and context of the ACS QUIK toolkit intervention using the United Kingdom’s Medical Research Council framework for evaluating complex interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].

                <p id="Par14">This mixed methods study included pre-trial toolkit intervention development (March 2011) using semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions and within-trial online survey data and semi-structured interviews with physicians (November 2015–December 2016) involved in the ACS QUIK trial. The analysis used both survey and interview responses to identify key factors influencing the success of the toolkit intervention components and to understand the interactions (underlying mechanisms) among the toolkit intervention components, local context, and trial outcomes.</p>

                <p id="Par15">The ACS QUIK study methods have been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In brief, the trial evaluated the effect of a quality improvement toolkit intervention based on American Heart Association’s Get With the Guidelines program across 63 participating hospitals in Kerala, India, using a cluster randomized, stepped-wedge trial design. Participating hospitals included private (<italic>n</italic> = 42, 67%), government (<italic>n</italic> = 9, 14%), and nonprofit (<italic>n</italic> = 12, 19%) hospitals. Each hospital identified at least two members of the quality improvement team to participate in this trial. Between November 2014 and November 2016, 21,374 eligible patients presenting with acute myocardial infarction were enrolled in the study. The primary outcome was the rate of major adverse cardiovascular events, defined as all-cause mortality, recurrent myocardial infarction, stroke, or major bleeding, at 30 days between the intervention and control groups, adjusted for clustering and temporal trends.</p>

                  <p id="Par16">To develop the ACS QUIK toolkit intervention, we conducted semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions with cardiologists and physicians who participated in the Kerala ACS Registry in English between May 2012 and November 2012. We purposely sampled and recruited 44 physicians or care providers (73% male; 43% cardiologist) using telephone and email invitations seeking a range of clinical experience and practice setting. Interviews and focus group discussions explored facilitators and barriers in the context of optimal ACS care in Kerala and were led by a cardiologist (MDH) and qualitative researchers (SG, DV). The audio recordings were transcribed, iteratively coded by two authors (MDH, KNK) until kappa &gt; 0.8 to ensure agreement, and analyzed using Dedoose software v4.12 (Manhattan Beach, USA). The framework method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] was used to create a contextualized critical pathway for patients with acute myocardial infarction with opportunities for intervention highlighted (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Critical care pathway used to develop the ACS QUIK trial quality improvement toolkit intervention. The barriers and facilitators were identified through in-depth interviews and focus group discussions with physicians/cardiologists to inform the development of the ACS QUIK trial quality improvement toolkit intervention. Phrases in red were potential targets of the toolkit intervention</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13012_2019_857_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>
                  <p id="Par17">We used high-quality systematic reviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] to inform adaption and implementation of previously reported strategies along with the results of the semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions to design the ACS QUIK toolkit intervention with the goal of improving processes of care and outcome measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The toolkit intervention included (1) a monthly audit and feedback reporting system based on key data elements used by the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], (2) standardized admission and discharge order checklists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], (3) translated and culturally adapted patient education materials related to tobacco cessation, dietary advice, and physical activity, and (4) access to free online quality improvement training through the Institute for Healthcare Improvement and linkage to emergency cardiovascular care training because of the low prevalence of code teams among the participating hospitals. These teams included code blue teams to respond to patients with cardiac arrest or respiratory failure and rapid response teams to treat patients who are acutely decompensated but have not developed cardiac arrest or respiratory failure. We also created telephone messaging groups via WhatsApp Messenger (WhatsApp, Inc., Mountain View, USA) within each cohort to facilitate communication among hospitals randomized to the same intervention step. We sent quarterly newsletters to all site investigators to provide general trial updates.</p>
                  <p id="Par18">We generated monthly audit and feedback reports through the trial’s customized electronic data capture system (Data Template, Bangalore, India) with input from the research team for specifications and iterative testing. These reports were sent monthly via email to site investigators and included site-specific measures on performance, as well as hospital-level performance ratings compared to other hospitals in each cohort and all hospitals in the trial. A template of audit and feedback report is provided as online appendix.</p>

                  <title>ACS QUIK training at site initiation visits</title>
                  <p id="Par19">In-person trainings were scheduled and conducted with all hospitals within 2 weeks prior to the scheduled crossover from the control period to the intervention period. Quality improvement teams were comprised of at least two hospital physicians, nurses, cardiac catheterization laboratory technicians, or staff who participated in acute myocardial infarction care, including cardiologists, emergency department physicians, and house officers. The 120- to 180-min training sessions were delivered in-person by a team of cardiologists and project coordinators from Northwestern University, USA, Centre for Chronic Disease Control (CCDC), India, and Westfort Hi-Tech Hospital Ltd., India. Training focused on strategies to decrease inappropriate thrombolysis, increase use of inexpensive essential cardiovascular medications, and minimize delays in selection of reperfusion strategy among patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction based on formative research (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1). Each hospital’s audit and feedback report was reviewed in detail by the trial and site teams with training related to organizing and leading monthly quality improvement team meetings. The goal of the training was to increase the use of evidence-based treatment and to provide sites with the training and flexibility to adapt and implement the toolkit intervention to maximize local utility. Additional training to new staff or refresher training to existing staff was provided by one of three zonal project coordinators during the study period who provided local training, monitoring, and support for the trial. Onsite monitoring visits and central statistical monitoring were performed during the trial to ensure data quality and completeness.</p>

                  <p id="Par22">From November 2015 to December 2016, one of three interviewers (KS, RD MDH) conducted 28 semi-structured in-depth interviews of physicians from 27 hospitals in English, either in-person or by telephone. The interviews were also performed at least 4 months after the site had crossed over into the intervention period. We used purposive sampling to ensure that we had a diversity of physicians based on the hospital size, cohort, and number of patients enrolled in the trial. The interviews aimed to collect information on what parts of the toolkit intervention were considered useful, the context in which the toolkit intervention was most easily used, perceived benefits, barriers to toolkit intervention implementation, and sustainability and scalability of the toolkit intervention (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref><bold>:</bold> Sample interview guide). The interview duration ranged from 10 to 30 min. The audio recordings were transcribed verbatim.</p>

                  <p id="Par24">Using a thematic framework analysis approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], a codebook was developed through line-by-line reading of every interview transcript and categorization of transcript sections into emergent themes. Coding was completed by two authors (KS, RD) using qualitative data analysis software (MAXQDA, VERBI GmbH, Berlin, Germany). The descriptive codes were revised as grouped into prevailing themes, and data segments within each of the codes composing a given theme were thematically analyzed. Emerging categories were compared within and between respondents in an iterative process. The patterns identified in the analysis formed an analytical framework; thematic saturation of the emerging framework was reached as we found fewer differences arising in patterns.</p>
                  <p id="Par25">Results of the thematic framework evaluation were set alongside results from the ACS QUIK trial to draw further inference about trial results. Physicians’ interview data, representing acceptability of toolkit intervention components (hospitals implementing all four toolkit intervention components were assigned a toolkit implementation score of 4, and those implementing any three, two, or one toolkit intervention components were assigned a score of 3, 2, and 1, respectively), were compared with changes in processes of care measures and clinical outcomes which occurred during the trial period. We performed an exploratory analysis of the trial’s primary outcome by restricting the sample to the 27 sites who participated in the process evaluation interviews. Mixed effect logistic regression was used to estimate the effect of the toolkit intervention on process measures and outcomes adjusted for cluster, temporal trends and high (three or four out of four toolkit intervention components) versus low or no (two or fewer toolkit intervention components) usage of the implementation toolkit intervention. For statistical analyses, Stata (version 15.0, Stata Corp), SAS (version 9.4, SAS Institute Inc.), and R (version 3.3.0, R Foundation) were used.</p>

                <p id="Par31">Most physicians (among 84% cardiologists) reported the toolkit intervention was useful, but few could implement all four components. Although the educational materials related to diet, activity, and tobacco cessation were generally reported to be the most useful, physicians felt that their scope for impact was reduced due to high patient volume and patients’ concomitant family needs. Checklists were perceived as the next most useful component by respondents. Hospitals that could not coordinate or deploy a cardiac arrest or rapid response team reported that this was due to lack of coordination or support from different departments. Some physicians reported that the toolkit intervention made them more alert and efficient during transitions of care.</p>

                <p id="Par32">Audit and feedback reports were sent via email to the hospitals’ site investigator every month but were reviewed by a minority of physicians (example report in the Appendix). Physicians expressed that, if the final study results demonstrated that a large proportion of patients were not prescribed optimal medical care, then an audit report might be helpful for physicians to investigate why these drugs were not prescribed. Physicians accepted that these reports added potential value in reviewing how their hospital performed compared with others in the study. When reviewing the audit report, physicians generally reviewed what proportion of patients received medical treatments and delays in treatment.</p>

                <p id="Par37">The most common reasons mentioned by the physicians for not reviewing the audit report were time constraints, delegating responsibility to junior physicians, no patients enrolled in the study over the past 3 months, and slow Internet connectivity leading to a lag in data entry to make reporting contemporary. Physicians also expressed concern that their prescription rates for angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers were generally low compared to global reports due to a perceived high prevalence of contraindications. Few physicians requested re-training of their hospital site staff to enable them to read, understand, and take corrective or proactive action by review of the audit reports.</p>

Our findings suggest that the presence of cardiovascular quality improvement teams, regular review of audit and feedback reports, checklists, regular quality improvement meetings and wider dissemination of patient education materials resulted in improved processes of care. However, a relatively high level of care at baseline in the control group hospitals (e.g., &gt; 95% rate of discharge aspirin use), incomplete toolkit intervention implementation with a corresponding modest effect on process of care measures, and favorable temporal trends (i.e., background improvements in clinical care over the study period) limited the effect of the toolkit intervention on clinical outcomes.</p>

                <p id="Par57">This mixed methods implementation evaluation of the ACS QUIK trial provides insights into the interaction between the toolkit intervention and its external context. We identified themes related to the quality improvement toolkit intervention’s integration of new activities into existing activities that changed behavior and performance through regular review. These findings may help explain both how the toolkit intervention operated and the mixed results of the trial. Mixed methods evaluation based on Medical Research Council’s framework provided a useful theoretical framework for this process evaluation by allowing a specific focus on context. Although complex interventions might appear “out of control” due to their varied manifestation in different situations, context-sensitive process evaluations can help identify interventions’ key functions.</p>
                <p id="Par58">Our findings also indicate the need for concurrent investment in improving the structural capacity of hospitals to achieve optimal outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The responsiveness of the pre-hospital environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and capacity of hospitals' emergency cardiovascular care services, essential structural prerequisites to deliver optimal acute myocardial infarction care, varied considerably among ACS QUIK trial hospitals. Lack of standardization of emergency cardiovascular care, limited funding, and insufficient numbers of qualified emergency staff have been identified as contributing to such variation. Similarly, systems and resources to support quality improvement varied across participating hospitals, including existing data capture systems, dedicated quality officers, effective management, and buy-in among hospital leadership. Future quality improvement initiatives will need to address these structural limitations without which substantial improvement in care is unlikely to be achieved.</p>

                <p id="Par59">Our study provides unique data on the implementation factors, acceptability, adaptation, and sustainability of an acute myocardial infarction quality improvement toolkit intervention within a low- and middle-income country context. The mixed methods evaluation explored the context and the extent of adherence to the delivery of the ACS QUIK toolkit intervention and trial outcomes, the results of which suggest that higher implementers (three or four toolkit intervention components) had higher rates of process of care measure improvements but similar rates of the study’s primary outcome. These variations could be driven by differences in what was implemented (type of toolkit intervention component) and to what degree that led to meaningful change in outcomes, as well as differences in the sites (hospital size, resources), their teams, patients, baseline process of care and major adverse cardiovascular event rates, the way in which sites implemented the toolkit intervention (or not), or chance.</p>
                <p id="Par60">One study from Brazil reported improvements in medication use and reperfusion among patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction with increased use of evidence-based treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, this study did not evaluate the acceptability of the toolkit intervention from various stakeholders (providers, patients, or hospital administrators) perspective including physicians, patients, or hospital administrators. Another quality improvement trial among ACS patients in China (CPACS-2) performed qualitative evaluation and found that system-level barriers affected the ability of clinical pathways to change practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].

                <title>Strengths and limitations</title>
                <p id="Par61">Our study has several strengths. First, our mixed methods evaluation was built upon our previous observational study from Kerala ACS Registry and was executed in partnership with the Cardiological Society of India-Kerala Chapter. Second, we captured views and experiences of a range of settings (government, private, and nonprofit hospitals) prior to unblinding of the results and have created a model that is likely generalizable and could be tested in future studies. We used exploratory interviews with physicians to assess the context of implementing the ACS QUIK toolkit intervention prior to unblinding the ACS QUIK trial results. Therefore, our process evaluation collected information about trial context and mechanisms within those contexts at the time of the trial with neither the researcher nor the physicians being influenced by the trial results. Third, this mixed methods approach facilitated systematic examination of the empirical trial data along with interview data to build and adapt a middle-range conceptual model. The emergent theory helped us to develop an understanding about how and why the toolkit intervention was developed, incorporating the interaction between context and mechanisms, explaining the key functions of the toolkit intervention and how this translated to the study outcomes.</p>
                <p id="Par62">Our study also has important limitations. Low participation rates in the online survey to assess acceptability of toolkit intervention provide a limited view on the overall acceptance rates and strategies to further improve toolkit intervention implementation. The process evaluation may also have been subject to social desirability bias among trial physicians. Measures were taken to reduce this likelihood, including (1) assuring confidentially and anonymity, (2) assuring respondents that their candid views would help towards improving the intervention in the future, and (3) their candor was critical for the larger cause of improving cardiovascular quality and safety in Kerala. Another limitation of our process evaluation was restricted to physicians, which is relevant since other healthcare workers may influence acute cardiovascular care quality and safety. Also, we did not have the trial results when undertaking the interviews, which may have limited the ability to probe for specific results and even response rates. Follow-up interviews with physicians after knowing the trial outcomes might have led to investigating specific drivers for neutral results and to exploring the factors that have influenced the study results. On the other hand, results may have biased physicians’ perceptions. Lastly, in our post hoc quantitative analyses, there could be potential unmeasured confounding between sites, site investigators, toolkit intervention implementation, and clinical outcomes, which are difficult to quantify or control.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p id="Par63">Implementation and acceptability of ACS QUIK toolkit intervention was enhanced by the hospital-level management support, clinical team enthusiasm, and ease of using checklists and patient education materials but was limited by time and staff constraints and understanding of quality improvement programs. Wider use of a similar toolkit intervention to other acute or chronic cardiovascular conditions (e.g., heart failure and stroke) or other locations where the quality of care is not as high as in the ACS QUIK trial may be useful for improving acute cardiovascular care in India and other low- and middle-income country settings.</p>
