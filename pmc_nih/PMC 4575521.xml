                <p><bold><italic>Background:</italic></bold> A variant (rs1495741) in the gene for the <italic>N</italic>-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) protein is associated with skin intrinsic fluorescence (SIF), a noninvasive measure of advanced glycation end products and other fluorophores in the skin. Because NAT2 is involved in caffeine metabolism, we aimed to determine whether caffeine consumption is associated with SIF and whether rs1495741 is associated with SIF independently of caffeine.</p>
                <p><bold><italic>Materials and Methods:</italic></bold> SIF was measured in 1,181 participants with type 1 diabetes from the Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications study. Two measures of SIF were used: SIF1, using a 375-nm excitation light-emitting diode (LED), and SIF14 (456-nm LED). Food frequency questionnaires were used to estimate mean caffeine intake. To establish replication, we examined a second type 1 diabetes cohort.</p>
                <p><bold><italic>Results:</italic></bold> Higher caffeine intake was significantly associated with higher SIF1<sub>LED 375 nm[0.6, 0.2]</sub> (<italic>P</italic>=2×10<sup>−32</sup>) and SIF14<sub>LED 456 nm[0.4, 0.8]</sub> (<italic>P</italic>=7×10<sup>−31</sup>) and accounted for 4% of the variance in each after adjusting for covariates. When analyzed together, caffeine intake and rs1495741 both remained highly significantly associated with SIF1<sub>LED 375 nm[0.6, 0.2]</sub> and SIF14<sub>LED 456 nm[0.4, 0.8]</sub>. Mean caffeinated coffee intake was also positively associated with SIF1<sub>LED 375 nm[0.6, 0.2]</sub> (<italic>P</italic>=9×10<sup>−12</sup>) and SIF14<sub>LED 456 nm[0.4, 0.8]</sub> (<italic>P</italic>=4×10<sup>−12</sup>), but no association was observed for decaffeinated coffee intake. Finally, caffeine was also positively associated with SIF1<sub>LED 375 nm[0.6, 0.2]</sub> and SIF14<sub>LED 456 nm[0.4, 0.8]</sub> (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001) in the replication cohort.</p>
                <p><bold><italic>Conclusions:</italic></bold> Caffeine contributes to SIF. The effect of rs1495741 on SIF appears to be partially independent of caffeine consumption. Because SIF and coffee intake are each associated with cardiovascular disease, our findings suggest that accounting for coffee and/or caffeine intake may improve risk prediction models for SIF and cardiovascular disease in individuals with diabetes.</p>

              <p>M<sc>easurement of skin intrinsic</sc> fluorescence (SIF) represents a novel noninvasive biomarker of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and other fluorophores in the skin.<sup><xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Skin fluorescence has been shown to be positively associated with subclinical atherosclerosis and/or cardiovascular disease mortality in the general population,<sup><xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> in type 1 and type 2 diabetes,<sup><xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4–6</xref></sup> and in people with renal failure.<sup><xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Several factors contribute to interindividual variability in skin fluorescence, including age, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), smoking and nephropathy.<sup><xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Recently, rs1495741 in the gene for the <italic>N</italic>-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) protein, which tags arylamine <italic>N</italic>-acetyltransferase enzyme activity status,<sup><xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> was identified as a major locus influencing skin fluorescence across four cohorts consisting of subjects with and without diabetes, explaining up to 15% of the variance.<sup><xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> NAT2 is a phase II drug-metabolizing enzyme that metabolizes aromatic amine and hydrazine drugs, heterocyclic amines,<sup><xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> and caffeine following initial detoxification by CYP1A2.<sup><xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>
<italic>NAT2</italic> has been previously associated with serum 1-methylxanthine:4-acetamidobutanoate (<italic>P</italic>=1.7×10<sup>−40</sup>) in a genome-wide association study (GWAS).<sup><xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> This metabolite ratio likely reflects the role of NAT2 in the metabolism of caffeine because caffeine is metabolized to 1-methylxanthine, which is used to determine the NAT2 acetylator status.<sup><xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Because caffeine exhibits fluorescent properties<sup><xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> and NAT2 metabolizes caffeine metabolites, it is plausible that the <italic>NAT2</italic> association with SIF is due to fluorescence of caffeine in the skin. We therefore tested whether caffeine consumption is associated with SIF and whether the association of rs1495741 with SIF is independent of caffeine intake. We separately used two cohorts of subjects with type 1 diabetes to determine the reproducibility of our observations.</p>

                <p>The SCOUT DS<sup>®</sup> SF spectrometer (VeraLight, Inc., Albuquerque, NM) was used to measure skin tone (pigmentation) and SIF from the underside of the left forearm.

Furthermore, SIF1<sub>LED 375 nm[0.6, 0.2]</sub> as measured by the SCOUT DS SF spectrometer is similar to the excitation level (approximately 350–370 nm) commonly used by the AGE Reader (DiagnOptics, Groningen, The Netherlands), another device that measures skin fluorescence.<sup><xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> This level of excitation captures fluorescence of AGEs and has been previously shown to have the strongest association with type 1 diabetes complications in the Pittsburgh Epidemiology of Diabetes Complications (EDC) study.<sup><xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup></p>

                <title>Measurement of caffeine intake</title>
                <p>During the DCCT (1983–1993), diet was assessed using a modified Burke-type diet history<sup><xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> at the baseline, 2-year, 5-year, and study end points. Participants were asked by dietitians to describe the meals and snacks they usually had to eat or drink on weekdays and on weekends. Seasonal variations in food intake and foods eaten away from home were also recorded. A staff of trained coders at the Central Nutrition Coding Unit (University of Minnesota, St. Paul, MN) coded the diet histories in a standardized manner, and nutrient intakes were calculated using version 13 (1986) of the Nutrition Coordinating Center nutrient database. The intercoder reliability and the reproducibility of the diet history were assessed at Year 2 of the DCCT.<sup><xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup></p>
                <p>During EDIC years 1–12 (1994–2006), a 126-item self-administered Harvard food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was used to assess diet intake biennially.<sup><xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Participants were asked how often they consumed a specified serving size of each food item over the past year. The nine response categories ranged from never or less than once per month to six or more times daily. Nutrient intakes from the FFQ were then calculated to reflect daily intake using the corresponding food item and respective portion size primarily from the U.S. Department of Agriculture nutrient database. Frequency response items were available for caffeinated beverages (coffee, tea, cola, and low-calorie cola) and decaffeinated coffee during EDIC Years 13–15. The validity of the Harvard FFQ was assessed previously in a subset of participants from the Nurses' Health Study by comparing the FFQ with 1-week diet records measured approximately every 3 months during the preceding year. Correlation coefficients for coffee and tea consumption were 0.75 and 0.90, respectively.<sup><xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup></p>

                <p>Caffeine intake measured using the FFQ during the EDIC study was used as our primary measure of caffeine exposure. Over 60% of subjects had four or five measures of caffeine intake from FFQs completed during the EDIC study (range, one to seven), and approximately 50% had three measures of caffeine intake from diet histories completed during the DCCT (range, one to six). Mean caffeine intake was calculated separately for each subject during the DCCT and the EDIC study. To approximate a normal distribution, mean caffeine intake was square root transformed when used as the outcome variable (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figs S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2</xref>; Supplementary Data are available online at <uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.liebertonline.com/dia">www.liebertonline.com/dia</uri>), whereas SIF1<sub>LED 375 nm[0.6, 0.2]</sub> and SIF14<sub>LED 456 nm[0.4, 0.8]</sub> were log<sub><italic>e</italic></sub> transformed.<sup><xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup></p>
                <p>rs1495741 was modeled assuming an additive model.

The same models were also used to examine the association of mean caffeine intake during the EDIC study and/or the DCCT alone or in combination with SIF. To exclude the possibility of confounding due to total reported daily caloric intake, it was included as a covariate in secondary models after excluding under- and over-reporters, defined as consuming &lt;800 kcal/day and &gt;6,000 kcal/day, respectively. We also additionally adjusted M2 for DCCT treatment group and separately for DCCT prevention cohorts in secondary analyses. To examine whether a nonlinear relationship exists between caffeine intake and SIF, caffeine<sup><xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> was added to M1 and M2. Linear regression was used to test whether rs1495741 was associated with caffeine intake. To determine whether the association of rs1495741 with SIF differed by smoking status, we tested for interaction between rs1495741 and smoking status (never smokers vs. ever and current smokers).</p>
                <p>Unadjusted Spearman correlation, and multiple linear regression, adjusting for M2 covariates, were used to determine the association of mean consumption of each of the caffeinated beverages and decaffeinated coffee frequency with SIF.

              <p>After adjusting for covariates, caffeine was still significantly associated with SIF1<sub>LED 375 nm[0.6, 0.2]</sub> and SIF14<sub>LED 456 nm[0.4, 0.8]</sub>, but the effect was attenuated, and the variance accounted for by caffeine intake during the EDIC study was 3.8% for SIF1<sub>LED 375 nm[0.6, 0.2]</sub> and 4.2% for SIF14<sub>LED 456 nm[0.4, 0.8]</sub> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>).</p>
              <p>Because age, smoking status, and mean EDIC HbA1c were all positively associated with both SIF1<sub>LED 375 nm[0.6, 0.2]</sub> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>) and mean EDIC caffeine intake (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>), we examined whether the attenuation of the caffeine effect on SIF in M2 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>) was explained by adjusting for these variables. Adjusting for age and smoking status largely accounted for the attenuation of the caffeine effect on SIF1<sub>LED 375 nm[0.6, 0.2]</sub> (β±SE, 0.00031±0.000025; <italic>P</italic>=1.9×10<sup>−33</sup>, without adjustments for age and smoking status). Similarly, the attenuation of the caffeine effect on SIF14<sub>LED 456 nm[0.4, 0.8]</sub> was due to adjustments for age and smoking status as well as EDIC HbA1c (β±SE, 0.00035±0.00003; <italic>P</italic>=1.6×10<sup>−30</sup>, without adjustments for age, smoking status, and HbA1c).</p>
              <p>Additionally adjusting M2 for mean total caloric intake did not materially alter the association of mean EDIC caffeine intake with either SIF1<sub>LED 375 nm[0.6, 0.2]</sub> (<italic>P</italic>=4.1×10<sup>−17</sup>) or SIF14<sub>LED 456 nm[0.4, 0.8]</sub> (<italic>P</italic>=3.9×10<sup>−16</sup>). Similarly, adjusting for DCCT treatment group or DCCT primary versus secondary prevention cohort did not materially alter the results (data not shown).</p>
              <p>We also tested whether the association of caffeine intake with SIF is nonlinear and observed some evidence supporting a quadratic relationship for SIF1<sub>LED 375 nm[0.6, 0.2]</sub> (β<sub>linear</sub>±SE, 0.0002±0.00003 [<italic>P</italic>=5.8×10<sup>−16</sup>]; β<sub>quadratic</sub>±SE, −1.8×10<sup>−7</sup>±8×10<sup>−8</sup> [<italic>P</italic>=0.03]) and SIF14<sub>LED 456 nm[0.4, 0.8]</sub> (β<sub>linear</sub>±SE, 0.0003±0.00003 [<italic>P</italic>=1.0×10<sup>−16</sup>]; β<sub>quadratic</sub>±SE, −1.9×10<sup>−7</sup>±1×10<sup>−7</sup> [<italic>P</italic>=0.05]).</p>
              <p>Caffeine intake during DCCT was consistently positively associated with SIF1<sub>LED 375 nm[0.6, 0.2]</sub> and SIF14<sub>LED 456 nm[0.4, 0.8]</sub>, independently accounting for 2.7% and 2.3% of the variance, respectively, after adjusting for covariates in M2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). Mean caffeine intakes from both the DCCT and the EDIC study were independently associated with SIF1<sub>LED 375 nm[0.6, 0.2]</sub> and SIF14<sub>LED 456 nm[0.4, 0.8]</sub> when included in the model together, with the exception for the association of mean caffeine intake during DCCT with SIF14<sub>LED 456 nm[0.4, 0.8]</sub> in M2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S4</xref>).</p>

The results were even stronger after adjusting for M2 covariates for SIF1<sub>LED 375 nm[0.6, 0.2]</sub> (β±SE, −0.060±0.008; <italic>P</italic>=1.7×10<sup>−12</sup>) and SIF14<sub>LED 456 nm[0.4, 0.8]</sub> (β±SE, −0.123±0.0096; <italic>P</italic>=1.4×10<sup>−34</sup>). Each copy of the G allele was associated with lower SIF, explaining 3.5% and 10.1% of the variance in SIF1<sub>LED 375 nm[0.6, 0.2]</sub> and SIF14<sub>LED 456 nm[0.4, 0.8]</sub>, respectively.<sup><xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Because NAT2 metabolizes aromatic amines found in tobacco smoke<sup><xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> and because smoking status is an important confounder, we tested whether the <italic>NAT2</italic> (rs1495741) effect was modified by smoking status.

              <p>To determine whether the associations for caffeine intake on SIF are due to caffeine or other constituents found in coffee, which may correlate with caffeine intake, we tested whether frequency of coffee, decaffeinated coffee, tea, and caffeinated cola (regular and low-calorie) consumption was associated with SIF. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S5</xref> shows the number of subjects reporting a mean consumption of at least once per month for each beverage during EDIC years 13–15. In both Spearman correlation (<italic>r</italic><sub>SIF1</sub>=0.27; <italic>r</italic><sub>SIF14</sub>=0.28; <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001) and in adjusted regression analysis, mean coffee intake was positively associated with SIF1<sub>LED 375 nm[0.6, 0.2]</sub> (<italic>P</italic>=8.9×10<sup>−12</sup>) and SIF14<sub>LED 456 nm[0.4, 0.8]</sub> (<italic>P</italic>=4.4×10<sup>−12</sup>). Decaffeinated coffee consumption, however, was not associated with SIF1<sub>LED 375 nm[0.6, 0.2]</sub> (<italic>r</italic>=0.02; <italic>P</italic>=0.53) or SIF14<sub>LED 456 nm[0.4, 0.8]</sub> (<italic>r</italic>=0.01; <italic>P</italic>=0.73) in either type of analysis, even after restricting the analysis to subjects reporting a mean consumption of &gt;1 cup of caffeinated coffee once weekly (Spearman <italic>r</italic><sub>SIF1</sub>=−0.03, <italic>P</italic>=0.39; <italic>r</italic><sub>SIF14</sub>=−0.02, <italic>P</italic>=0.57).</p>
              <p>Tea consumption was associated with SIF1<sub>LED 375 nm[0.6, 0.2]</sub> in Spearman correlations (<italic>r</italic>=0.06, <italic>P</italic>=0.04) but not in adjusted regression analyses (<italic>P</italic>=0.13).</p>
              <p>Because 84% of subjects reported consuming regular, caffeinated cola never or less than once per month, we did not use this variable in analyses. However, low-calorie caffeinated cola in Spearman analyses was associated with SIF14<sub>LED 456 nm[0.4, 0.8]</sub> (<italic>r</italic>=0.08, <italic>P</italic>=0.006) and in covariate adjusted analyses was associated with both SIF1<sub>LED 375 nm[0.6, 0.2]</sub> (<italic>P</italic>=0.04) and SIF14<sub>LED 456 nm[0.4, 0.8]</sub> (<italic>P</italic>=0.02).</p>
              <p>Finally, when including both mean coffee intake and mean caffeine consumption in the model, the effect for mean coffee intake disappears (<italic>P</italic>=0.19 for SIF1<sub>LED 375 nm[0.6, 0.2]</sub> and <italic>P</italic>=0.09 for SIF14<sub>LED 456 nm[0.4, 0.8]</sub>), and the positive association for caffeine consumption persists (<italic>P</italic>=1.9×10<sup>−5</sup> for SIF1<sub>LED 375 nm[0.6, 0.2]</sub>; <italic>P</italic>=1.3×10<sup>−4</sup> for SIF14<sub>LED 456 nm[0.4, 0.8]</sub>; M2 analyses).</p>

              <p>We recently identified rs1495741, near <italic>NAT2,</italic> as a major locus for skin fluorescence in subjects with and without diabetes.<sup><xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Given the role of NAT2 in caffeine metabolism, we examined whether caffeine is associated with SIF, as well as whether the effect of <italic>NAT2</italic> (rs1495741) on SIF is independent of caffeine consumption. Here we show that caffeine contributes a proportion of the interindividual variability in SIF measures. Our findings were consistent within the DCCT/EDIC cohort using caffeine data from the DCCT and the EDIC study periods separately and replicated in an independent type 1 diabetes study. Finally, the effect of rs1495741 on SIF appears to be in part independent of caffeine consumption.</p>
              <p>To our knowledge, this is the first study to test for an association between caffeine intake and SIF. A previous study of 147 elderly Dutch subjects examining the relationship of dietary AGEs with skin autofluorescence found no significant association between coffee consumption and skin autofluorescence.<sup><xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Although the excitation level of SIF1<sub>LED 375 nm[0.6, 0.2]</sub> is similar to that used by the AGE Reader in the Dutch study (peak excitation, 360 nm) there are several reasons that may explain the discrepancy in results between the current study and the former study. First, skin collagen production is altered in the elderly<sup><xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> and therefore may result in no association observed in older subjects. Second, it is not clear how coffee intake was measured by the food habits questionnaire used, as well as whether there was any distinction between caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee consumption.<sup><xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> In the EDIC study, participants reported consumption of both decaffeinated and caffeinated coffee, and we observed a stronger association with SIF when using total caffeine intake versus caffeinated coffee consumption. Finally, The Netherlands has one of the highest consumptions of caffeine in the world,<sup><xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> and coffee intakes were higher in the Dutch study with a mean consumption of 3.4 cups/day, compared with a median of 1 cup of caffeinated coffee daily in the EDIC study. If a nonlinear caffeine–SIF effect exists, whereby there is little association at the upper end of intakes on SIF, then null associations may be observed among high caffeine consumers; however, the range of coffee intake was not stated.<sup><xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup></p>
              <p>We showed that mean caffeine intake was associated with SIF, independent of age and smoking. Caffeine is positively correlated with age among American adults up to 64 years of age and higher in smokers.<sup><xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> Adjusting for both age and smoking attenuated the caffeine–SIF association as they were also positively associated with caffeine intake and SIF in the EDIC study. HbA1c was also shown to contribute to the attenuation in the relationship for mean caffeine intake during EDIC and SIF14<sub>LED 456 nm[0.4, 0.8]</sub>. This was likely due to the positive association of caffeine intake with HbA1c, which may result from caffeine inhibiting glucose uptake by skeletal muscle and adipocytes, decreasing postprandial glycemic control.<sup><xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> In the DCCT/EDIC study, caffeine consumption independently accounted for 4% of the variability in SIF (in M2) and, together with rs1495741 and explanatory covariates adjusted for in M2, cumulatively accounted for more than 40% of the variance in SIF.</p>
              <p>Consistent with our study, <italic>NAT2</italic> has not been previously associated with coffee or caffeine intake. GWAS of coffee<sup><xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> and caffeine<sup><xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> intake have identified associations for <italic>CYP1A2</italic> and <italic>AHR</italic>, both of which are directly and indirectly involved in caffeine metabolism, respectively. Recently, six additional loci have been implicated in a GWAS of coffee consumption.<sup><xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> Furthermore, a candidate gene approach reported no nominal association of 32 single nucleotdie polymorphisms in <italic>NAT2</italic> with caffeine intake using gene-based tests.<sup><xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> On the other hand, <italic>NAT2</italic> has been associated with 1-methylxanthine:4-acetamidobutanoate, reflecting metabolites of caffeine metabolism in a GWAS of serum metabolites.<sup><xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Similarly, a GWAS of urinary metabolite ratios identified a polymorphism in perfect linkage disequilibrium with rs1495741 to be associated with formate:succinate levels (<italic>P</italic>=5.1×10<sup>−16</sup>).<sup><xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> Formate may reflect degradation of caffeine because NAT2 metabolizes an intermediate caffeine metabolite and produces 5-acetylamino-6-formylamino-3-methyluracil,<sup><xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> which undergoes deformylation in the urine.<sup><xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Given that caffeine metabolites are commonly used as a probe for NAT2 acetylation status<sup><xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> and that caffeine is associated with SIF, we examined whether the effects of rs1495741 and caffeine are independent. We showed that each was associated with SIF1<sub>LED 375 nm[0.6, 0.2]</sub> and SIF14<sub>LED 456 nm[0.4, 0.8]</sub> when included in the model together, thus suggesting that the relationship is likely independent. However, because <italic>NAT2</italic> was not associated with caffeine intake in the DCCT/EDIC study or in previous studies<sup><xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29–31</xref></sup> but instead has been shown to be associated with caffeine metabolite ratios,<sup><xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> future studies measuring caffeine metabolites are needed to more concretely examine their independent effects,<sup><xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> as well as establishing whether caffeine metabolites are associated with SIF.</p>
              <p>Caffeine readily crosses all biological membranes,<sup><xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> and ingested caffeine has been implicated in protecting against ultraviolet B–induced skin carcinoma in epidemiological and animal studies, partly by protecting the skin as a sunscreen.<sup><xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> Caffeine was associated with both SIF1<sub>LED 375 nm[0.6, 0.2]</sub> and SIF14<sub>LED 456 nm[0.4, 0.8]</sub>, which capture common fluorophores such as AGEs, but also distinct chemicals at each end of the spectrum.<sup><xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Indeed, caffeine was shown to exhibit fluorescent properties with excitation/emission wavelengths in the ultraviolet range 311/363 nm,<sup><xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> but this level was not captured by SIF1<sub>LED 375 nm[0.6, 0.2]</sub>, the lowest excitation LED examined in the DCCT/EDIC and the EDC study. Alternatively, the caffeine–SIF association we observed may reflect the effect of caffeine on photolysis of riboflavin,<sup><xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> which has excitation/emission maxima of 450/520 nm, corresponding with SIF14<sub>LED 456 nm[0.4, 0.8]</sub>.<sup><xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> Because caffeine can bind to riboflavin and inhibit photolysis,<sup><xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> individuals with high caffeine intake may have higher levels of riboflavin in the skin, resulting in higher skin fluorescence. Finally, we cannot rule out the possibility of the caffeine–SIF association reflecting fluorescence levels of AGEs. We addressed this by adjusting for HbA1c, and although the effect of caffeine on SIF14<sub>LED 456 nm[0.4, 0.8]</sub> was attenuated, it was still significant. Further studies are needed to determine which fluorophore is responsible for the caffeine–SIF association.</p>
              <p>Because SIF is positively associated with subclinical atherosclerosis and/or cardiovascular disease mortality,<sup><xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3–7</xref></sup> our results suggest that adjusting for caffeine and/or coffee intake may improve prediction estimates for SIF with cardiovascular disease because in moderate amounts coffee consumption may be protective against cardiovascular disease.<sup><xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> Similarly, because SIF has been proposed as an alternative noninvasive screening tool in comparison with fasting glucose levels in identifying individuals with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes mellitus,<sup><xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> adjusting for caffeine and/or coffee intake may alter prediction estimates. Components other than caffeine in coffee, such as chlorogenic acid, may be protective against type 2 diabetes mellitus<sup><xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> and AGE formation,<sup><xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> and therefore adjustment for coffee or caffeine as a marker of coffee intake may be useful.</p>
              <p>The last measure of caffeine consumption was assessed 4 years prior to SIF in the EDIC study and 8 years prior to SIF in the Pittsburgh EDC study, but despite this, the caffeine–SIF association was robust both within the DCCT/EDIC study and replicated in the EDC study. Food sources contributing to caffeine intake were only available during EDIC years 13–15, and mean intakes of decaffeinated coffee and regular soda consumption were low, somewhat limiting the power of these analyses. Future studies in populations where interindividual intakes for these beverages vary more widely are needed to confirm our observations suggesting that the caffeine–SIF association is due to caffeine and not other components highly correlated with caffeine in coffee or other caffeine food sources. Finally, studies are needed in subjects without diabetes to determine whether the association is diabetes-specific.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, our study clearly demonstrates that caffeine is an important contributor to the interindividual variability of SIF measures in people with type 1 diabetes. The association for caffeine intake with SIF appears to be due to caffeine and/or its metabolites rather than other constituents in coffee. Finally, the effect of rs1495741 on SIF is shown to be at least in part independent of caffeine consumption. Accounting for rs1495741 and caffeine intake may alter SIF prediction estimates for risk of cardiovascular disease, prediabetes, and type 2 diabetes mellitus.</p>
