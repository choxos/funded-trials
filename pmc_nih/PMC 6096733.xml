                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Alterations involving the <italic>RET</italic> kinase are implicated in the pathogenesis of lung, thyroid and other cancers.

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>The receptor tyrosine kinase RET can be oncogenically activated by gene fusions or point mutations. <italic>RET</italic> fusions occur in a variety of malignancies, including 1%–2% of lung cancers, up to 10%–20% of papillary thyroid cancers, and rarely in many other solid tumors [<xref rid="mdy137-B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. <italic>RET</italic> mutations affect most medullary thyroid cancers (MTCs) [<xref rid="mdy137-B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], and next generation sequencing (NGS) analysis of large numbers of patient tumors has uncovered <italic>RET</italic> alterations at low frequency in other tumor types [<xref rid="mdy137-B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Such alterations possess the hallmarks of cancer drivers: constitutive kinase and signaling activity, transformation of primary cells, and mutual exclusivity from other drivers [<xref rid="mdy137-B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="mdy137-B4" ref-type="bibr">4–6</xref>]. </p>
              <p>Until recently, only multikinase inhibitors (MKIs) with nonselective RET inhibitory activity have been available for patients with <italic>RET</italic>-altered cancers. Clinical experience with these nonselective RET inhibitors has been disappointing, with only modest activity in <italic>RET</italic>-mutant MTCs [<xref rid="mdy137-B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="mdy137-B7" ref-type="bibr">7–9</xref>] and <italic>RET</italic> fusion-positive lung cancers [<xref rid="mdy137-B10" ref-type="bibr">10–11</xref>]. Other MKIs approved for other indications (e.g. sorafenib) possess similar, nonselective anti-RET activity preclinically [<xref rid="mdy137-B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In part, this may be due to substantial ‘off-target’ side-effects that limit the degree of RET-specific inhibition and lead to frequent dose reductions. Together with weak anti-RET potency and poor pharmacokinetic (PK) properties, these limitations prevent potent RET pathway inhibition in patients.</p>
              <p>LOXO-292 is a novel, highly selective, ATP-competitive small molecule RET inhibitor. In contrast to MKIs, LOXO-292 possesses nanomolar potency against diverse RET alterations (including anticipated acquired resistance mutations), high selectivity for RET, and favorable PK properties, including high bioavailability, predictable exposure, significant central nervous system (CNS) penetration, and a low potential for drug interactions [<xref rid="mdy137-B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Here, we describe the preclinical antitumor activity of LOXO-292 and provide clinical proof-of-concept for selective RET inhibition with LOXO-292 in two patients with <italic>RET</italic>-altered tumors.</p>

                <title>Case 1: RET M918T-mutant MTC with an acquired RET V804M gatekeeper resistance mutation</title>
                <p>A healthy 49-year-old man presented with neck swelling. A diagnostic work-up led to total thyroidectomy and bilateral neck dissection, and a diagnosis of MTC with lymph node spread. NGS (FoundationOne<sup>®</sup>) analysis of the resected tumor identified a RET M918T mutation. Additional imaging identified liver metastases. He was sequentially treated with six MKI regimens: sorafenib [best response of progressive disease (PD)], vandetanib [stable disease (SD)], cabozantinib (SD), MGCD-516 (PD), RXDX-105 [partial response (PR)], and vandetanib plus everolimus (PD). Each treatment was discontinued for disease progression in the liver, most recently with hepatomegaly, large-volume ascites, severe fatigue and markedly decreased performance status. Molecular analysis of cell-free DNA (Guardant360<sup>®</sup>) isolated from blood taken before vandetanib plus everolimus treatment identified the founder RET M918T mutation together with a RET V804M gatekeeper mutation; the latter mutation was not detectable in the initial surgical tumor specimen.</p>

                <title>Case 2: <italic>KIF5B-RET</italic> fusion-positive non-small-cell lung cancer metastatic to the brain</title>
                <p>A 44-year-old woman with multiple comorbidities presented with cough and worsening dyspnea [<xref rid="mdy137-B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Imaging revealed bilateral lung nodules and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. A bronchoscopic biopsy of a right lung mass revealed lung adenocarcinoma. Molecular testing for <italic>EGFR, ALK</italic> and <italic>ROS1</italic> gene alterations was negative. She received five lines of systemic therapy, including chemotherapy and immunotherapy (best response of PR to first line chemotherapy and no response to immunotherapy), and she required whole-brain radiotherapy to control new brain metastases. Analysis of the initial biopsy by NGS (FoundationOne<sup>®</sup>) identified a <italic>KIF5B-RET</italic> fusion. Compassionate use treatment with alectinib, an MKI with modest anti-RET activity but significant CNS penetration [<xref rid="mdy137-B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], achieved an extracranial PR. However, her cancer progressed in the brain. An increased dose of alectinib led to an intracranial response that was consolidated with stereotactic radiosurgery. However, despite continuing the increased dose of alectinib, she developed further intracranial progression, difficulty walking, and short-term memory loss.</p>

                <p>Rapid, intrapatient, PKs-guided dose-escalation was carried out. LOXO-292 was administered orally as a powder-in-capsule. Drug plasma levels were measured pre-dose and at defined post-dose intervals on days 1 and 8 of the starting dose and each dose escalation. Escalation was allowed only after ≥7 days, in the absence of grade 3 and 4 toxicity, and in defined increments (1.5–3× the previous dose depending on the predicted AUC<sub>0</sub><sub>–</sub><sub>24</sub> at the new dose). Dose modifications and interruptions followed a prescribed algorithm. Adverse events were graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03 [<xref rid="mdy137-B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Response was evaluated using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 and Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology Brain Metastases (RANO-BM) [<xref rid="mdy137-B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="mdy137-B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p>

                <title>Characterization of RET inhibitor selectivity</title>
                <p>Consistent with high selectivity for RET compared with other kinases [<xref rid="mdy137-B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], LOXO-292 potently inhibited cell proliferation in four <italic>RET</italic> fusion-positive or <italic>RET</italic>-mutant cell lines, but caused 20- to 1700-fold less growth inhibition in 83 cell lines that did not contain a <italic>RET</italic> alteration (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="mdy137-F1">1</xref>A and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">supplementary Figure S1</xref>, available at <italic>Annals of Oncology</italic> online). In contrast, the inhibitory activity of cabozantinib and vandetanib in cell lines without <italic>RET</italic> alterations significantly overlapped with the <italic>RET</italic>-altered cell lines, indicative of broad inhibition of proliferation due to inhibition of multiple cellular targets (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="mdy137-F1">1</xref>A, left). In engineered cells, LOXO-292 was 60- to 1300-fold more effective in inhibiting KIF5B-RET (−/+V804L/M) than other kinase and nonkinase targets commonly inhibited by MKIs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="mdy137-F1">1</xref>A, right). In contrast, the MKIs cabozantinib and vandetanib were more potent against cellular KDR/VEGFR2 (both agents) or FGFR1 and hERG (vandetanib) than against KIF5B-RET, and possessed less inhibitory activity against KIF5B-RET-V804L/M gatekeeper mutant cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="mdy137-F1">1</xref>A).

                    <p>Pre-clinical characterization of RET inhibitor selectivity and antitumor activity. As shown in the left portion of (A), four <italic>RET-</italic>altered (filled black symbols) and 83 <italic>RET</italic>-wild-type (open red symbols) human cancer cell lines were treated with LOXO-292, cabozantinib or vandetanib for 72 h. Cell survival was determined by DAPI staining and cell counting. Half-maximal effective concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>) values were normalized to the EC<sub>50</sub> value for LOXO-292-treated LC-2/ad (<italic>CCDC6-RET</italic>) non-small-cell lung cancer cells. For each cell line, ratios equal to 1 correspond to the same cytotoxicity as for LC-2/ad, ratios &lt;1 correspond to greater cytotoxicity than for LC-2/ad and ratios &gt;1 correspond to lower cytotoxicity than for LC-2/ad. As shown in the right portion of Panel A, HEK-293 cells harboring different mutant versions of <italic>RET</italic> (filled blue symbols) or other targets (open red symbols) were treated with each inhibitor, followed by determination of RET kinase or target activity in cell lysates as described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">supplementary Appendix</xref>, available at <italic>Annals of Oncology</italic> online. Half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) values were normalized to the IC<sub>50</sub> value for LOXO-292-treated <italic>KIF5B-RET</italic> cells. For each target, ratios equal to 1 correspond to the same cellular potency as for <italic>KIF5B-RET</italic> cells, ratios less than 1 correspond to greater potency than for <italic>KIF5B-RET</italic> cells, and ratios greater than 1 correspond to lower potency than for <italic>KIF5B-RET</italic> cells. As shown in (B), immunodeficient mice xenografted with the indicated <italic>RET</italic>-altered tumor models were treated orally with vehicle, cabozantinib (40-60 mg/kg daily) or LOXO-292 (30 mg/kg twice daily) for 14 (NIH-3T3 allografts), 22 (cell line xenografts) or 28 (patient-derived xenografts/PDX) days. For each model, tumor volume from 8 to 10 animals at the end of the treatment period was normalized to tumor volume before the first treatment; 0% corresponds to no net effect of treatment on tumor size, &lt;0% corresponds to net tumor regression with treatment, and &gt;0% corresponds to net tumor growth despite treatment. As shown in (C), immunodeficient mice (10 per treatment) were injected intracranially with <italic>CCDC6-RET</italic> fusion-positive PDX tumor suspensions and treated orally with vehicle, ponatinib (40 mg/kg daily) or LOXO-292 (30 mg/kg twice daily). Animals were sacrificed if they displayed significant morbidity, and survival was compared with Kaplan–Meier analysis before and after dose reduction by 10-fold on day 52 (indicated with a black arrow).

                <p>The antitumor activity of LOXO-292 was compared with the MKI cabozantinib in engineered and patient-derived <italic>RET</italic> fusion-positive and <italic>RET</italic>-mutant mouse tumor models, including two <italic>RET</italic> fusion-positive models harboring the V804M acquired resistance gatekeeper mutation [<xref rid="mdy137-B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. At the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), cabozantinib caused only mild regression or tumor growth inhibition and was inactive against models harboring RET V804M (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="mdy137-F1">1</xref>B). In contrast, LOXO-292 caused significant regression in all models, including those harboring RET V804M, and was well-tolerated (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="mdy137-F1">1</xref>B and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">supplementary Figure S2</xref>, available at <italic>Annals of Oncology</italic> online).</p>
                <p>As brain metastases are present in a substantial proportion of <italic>RET</italic> fusion-positive lung cancer patients (∼45% lifetime incidence) [<xref rid="mdy137-B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], the intracranial antitumor activity of LOXO-292 was investigated in an orthotopic <italic>RET</italic> fusion-positive mouse tumor model. Animals injected intracranially with <italic>CCDC6-RET</italic> fusion-positive PDX cell suspensions were treated orally with LOXO-292, the MKI ponatinib (at the MTD), or vehicle. Both LOXO-292 and ponatinib significantly prolonged survival (median not reached) compared with vehicle-treated animals (median 21 days) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="mdy137-F1">1</xref>C). At proportionately reduced doses, LOXO-292 significantly prolonged survival (median not reached) compared with ponatinib (median 18.5 days) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="mdy137-F1">1</xref>C).</p>

                <title>Clinical experience with LOXO-292</title>
                <p>Although a LOXO-292 phase I study had been initiated (NCT03157128), because of the clinical urgency and desire to achieve meaningful clinical exposures in a time frame that could help each patient, a real-time, PKs-guided intrapatient dose escalation approach was undertaken using IRB-approved single-patient protocols (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">supplementary Figure S3</xref>, available at <italic>Annals of Oncology</italic> online) [<xref rid="mdy137-B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p>
                <p>Case 1 was highly symptomatic before therapy (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="mdy137-F2">2</xref>A), with right upper quadrant pain from tumor infiltration of the liver, ascites and severe tumor-related diarrhea (30 bowel movements/day). LOXO-292 was initiated at a dose of 20 mg twice daily. Real-time PK analysis revealed that the estimated RET-M918T and RET-V804M target coverage might be insufficient at this dose. Therefore, the patient was dose-escalated stepwise (if no grade 3 and 4 adverse events were experienced after a minimum of 14 days on the prior dose) to a final dose of 160 mg twice daily, resulting in dose-proportional systemic drug exposure consistent with continuous and significant RET-M918T and RET-V804M target inhibition (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="mdy137-F2">2</xref>B and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">supplementary Figure S4</xref>, available at <italic>Annals of Oncology</italic> online). Consistent with this pharmacodynamic RET inhibition, serum carcinoembryonic antigen and calcitonin levels decreased dramatically, together with resolution of diarrhea, abdominal pain and fatigue, and a deepening radiographic tumor response, reaching 54% (by RECIST) after 6.9 months of treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="mdy137-F2">2</xref>C and D; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">supplementary Figure S5</xref>, available at <italic>Annals of Oncology</italic> online). Plasma allele fractions encoding RET-M918T and RET-V804M in cell-free DNA decreased over the first 8 weeks of treatment and remained suppressed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="mdy137-F2">2</xref>C). Additional gatekeeper mutations (RET V804L and RET Y806C) detected just above the lower limit of assay detection also decreased to undetectable levels (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="mdy137-F2">2</xref>C). LOXO-292 was well-tolerated. The only treatment-emergent adverse events observed (fatigue, dyspnea, joint pain, insomnia and aspartate aminotransferase elevation) were grade 1, and none were attributed to therapy. The patient remains on LOXO-292 for more than 7 months.

                <p>Case 2 was also highly symptomatic, with confusion and unsteady gait due to progressive brain metastases. She initiated treatment with LOXO-292 at a starting dose of 20 mg twice daily (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="mdy137-F3">3</xref>A). Although real-time PK analysis revealed adequate KIF5B-RET target coverage in plasma, steady-state levels were thought to be sub-optimal for inhibition of brain metastases. Therefore, the dose of LOXO-292 was escalated stepwise (after a minimum of 14 days on the prior dose, in the absence of grade 3 and 4 adverse events) to 100 mg twice daily, resulting in LOXO-292 exposure consistent with continuous and significant KIF5B-RET fusion target coverage in the brain (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="mdy137-F3">3</xref>B and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">supplementary Figure S4</xref>, available at <italic>Annals of Oncology</italic> online). LOXO-292 treatment resulted in a rapid clinical response to therapy, with resolution of confusion and gait imbalance, together with rapid tumor regression (−57% by RECIST) and substantial shrinkage or resolution of multiple brain metastases (−89% by RANO-BM) after 2 months of treatment. These responses deepened and were confirmed with continued treatment (best objective responses at 5 months, −67% extracranially, with residual foci of nonspecific enhancement and no measurable target lesions in the brain) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="mdy137-F3">3</xref>C and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">supplementary Figure S6</xref>, available at <italic>Annals of Oncology</italic> online). However, the patient’s complex comorbidities contributed to unrelated hospitalizations and treatment-emergent adverse events that were not attributed to LOXO-292. Initially, treatment with LOXO-292 was continued with evidence of continued tumor response and clinical benefit, but after 5 months, the patient chose to discontinue LOXO-292 during a recurrent depressive episode, against medical advice.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>The limited clinical activity of MKIs with activity against RET in patients with <italic>RET-</italic>altered cancers has led to preliminary conclusions that <italic>RET</italic> fusions are not highly actionable [<xref rid="mdy137-B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]; and the clinical activity of such MKIs results from concurrent inhibition of other targets, such as VEGFR2/KDR [<xref rid="mdy137-B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p>
              <p>Here we report two patients with advanced, highly symptomatic <italic>RET</italic>-altered cancers who progressed on such MKIs. In both patients, significant RET target coverage was achieved with LOXO-292, following real-time, PKs-guided intrapatient dose escalation. Consistent with its high selectivity for RET, LOXO-292 was well-tolerated, including at escalated doses. This contrasts with MKIs, and further suggests that on-target toxicities from potent RET inhibition are unlikely to limit the development of selective RET inhibitors [<xref rid="mdy137-B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p>
              <p>To our knowledge, this is the first clinical report of the predicted RET V804M gatekeeper mutation arising in a patient previously treated with MKIs. Germline <italic>RET</italic> gatekeeper mutations, which occur in patients with hereditary MTC [<xref rid="mdy137-B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], cause markedly diminished anti-RET potency for most MKIs [<xref rid="mdy137-B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="mdy137-B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. LOXO-292 was optimized to retain activity in this setting. This case also illustrates the potential value of plasma cell-free DNA in detecting <italic>RET</italic> mutations at the time of clinical progression, and the opportunity, through potent RET inhibition, to control symptomatic diarrhea caused by cancer in patients with MTC.</p>
              <p>To our knowledge, this is also the first report of the reestablishment of extracranial and intracranial disease control after progression on alectinib, often considered the most brain-penetrant of the currently available MKIs. A previous case series described a <italic>RET</italic> fusion-positive lung cancer patient who experienced improvement of brain metastases with alectinib at a dose escalated above the recommended phase II dose [<xref rid="mdy137-B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], although intracranial disease control was short-lived. Given the excellent brain penetration of alectinib, this case further highlights the lack of clinically sufficient RET target coverage of repurposed MKIs currently used off-label.</p>
              <p>These results provide preliminary evidence that diverse <italic>RET</italic> alterations are actionable therapeutic targets, and indicate that selective RET inhibition by LOXO-292 is a promising treatment approach in patients with <italic>RET</italic>-altered cancers. A phase I trial of LOXO-292 for patients with advanced, <italic>RET</italic>-altered cancers, treated with any prior MKIs, is currently accruing (NCT03157128).</p>
