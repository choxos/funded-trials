Patients aged 18–70 years, weighing 45–90 kg, who had clinical malaria (<italic>P falciparum</italic> or <italic>P vivax</italic> monoinfection) and fever within the previous 24 h were eligible. Exclusion criteria were clinical or laboratory signs of severe malaria, inability to take oral medicine, and use of other antimalarial treatment in the preceding 14 days. Patients were divided into cohorts of those with <italic>P falciparum</italic> (cohort a) or <italic>P vivax</italic> (cohort b) infection. Two initial cohorts received single oral doses of 400 mg DSM265. Patients were followed up for efficacy for 28 days and safety for 35 days. Further cohorts received escalated or de-escalated doses of DSM265, after safety and efficacy assessment of the initial dose. The primary endpoints were the proportion of patients achieving PCR-adjusted adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR) by day 14 for patients infected with <italic>P falciparum</italic> and the proportion of patients achieving a crude cure by day 14 for those infected with <italic>P vivax</italic>. Cohort success, the criteria for dose escalation, was defined as ACPR (<italic>P falciparum</italic>) or crude cure (<italic>P vivax</italic>) in at least 80% of patients in the cohort. The primary analysis was done in the intention-to-treat population (ITT) and the per-protocol population, and safety analyses were done in all patients who received the study drug.

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>Between Jan 12, 2015, and Dec 2, 2015, 45 Peruvian patients (24 with <italic>P falciparum</italic> [cohort a] and 21 with <italic>P vivax</italic> [cohort b] infection) were sequentially enrolled. For patients with <italic>P falciparum</italic> malaria in the per-protocol population, all 11 (100%) in the 400 mg group and eight (80%) of ten in the 250 mg group achieved ACPR on day 14. In the ITT analysis, 11 (85%) of 13 in the 400 mg group and eight (73%) of 11 in the 250 mg group achieved ACPR at day 14. For the patients with <italic>P vivax</italic> malaria, the primary endpoint was not met. In the per-protocol analysis, none of four patients who had 400 mg, three (50%) of six who had 600 mg, and one (25%) of four who had 800 mg DSM265 achieved crude cure at day 14. In the ITT analysis, none of five in the 400 mg group, three (33%) of nine in the 600 mg group, and one (14%) of seven in the 800 mg group achieved crude cure at day 14. During the 28-day extended observation of <italic>P falciparum</italic> patients, a resistance-associated mutation in the gene encoding the DSM265 target DHODH was observed in two of four recurring patients. DSM265 was well tolerated. The most common adverse events were pyrexia (20 [44%] of 45) and headache (18 [40%] of 45), which are both common symptoms of malaria, and no patients had any treatment-related serious adverse events or adverse events leading to study discontinuation.</p>

                  <title>Interpretation</title>
                  <p>After a single dose of DSM265, <italic>P falciparum</italic> parasitaemia was rapidly cleared, whereas against <italic>P vivax</italic>, DSM265 showed less effective clearance kinetics. Its long duration of action provides the potential to prevent recurrence of <italic>P falciparum</italic> after treatment with a single dose, which should be further assessed in future combination studies.</p>

                </p>
                <p id="para30">Despite an almost 50% decrease in deaths since 2000, WHO reports that malaria still kills nearly 430 000 individuals annually. Additionally, parasite resistance against the latest antimalarial class, the artemisinins, is spreading. New antimalarials are needed to drive the malaria elimination campaign. We searched MEDLINE, the Medicines for Malaria Venture website, the US National Institutes of Health and New Zealand/Australian trial registries, and the Cortellis (Clarivate Analytics) database using DSM265 as a keyword to search for publications, and trial registrations up to June 3, 2018. DSM265, a selective inhibitor of plasmodium dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) has excellent in-vitro potency against <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>, including strains resistant to multiple first-line antimalarial drugs. Two phase 1 healthy volunteer studies showed that oral doses of DSM265 (as a single dose of 25–1200 mg) are generally well tolerated with a long half-life.</p>

                  <bold>Added value of this study</bold>
                </p>
                <p id="para50">To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study showing single-dose antimalarial activity of DSM265 in patients with <italic>P falciparum</italic> and <italic>Plasmodium vivax</italic> malaria. Our study showed that DSM265 has good pharmacokinetic and safety profiles in patients. Single doses of DSM265 rapidly cleared most <italic>P falciparum</italic> infections, with some instances of recurrent parasitaemias, but clearance of <italic>P vivax</italic> was significantly slower.</p>

                  <bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold>
                </p>
                <p id="para70">Our data confirm the long-lasting pharmacokinetic profile of DSM265, show excellent safety, and document antimalarial efficacy against <italic>P falciparum</italic> in most patients, although evidence of resistance (via DHODH mutations) was found in a subset of recurrent parasites within the context of these single-dose regimens. These data support further efforts for clinical development of DSM265 in combination with other antimalarial drugs.</p>

To be efficacious, and to prolong their useful lifetime, new antimalarials should be introduced as combinations only.</p>
              <p id="para90">DSM265 was discovered among a series of novel triazolopyrimidine-based inhibitors of plasmodium dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), an enzyme required by <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species for pyrimidine biosynthesis and DNA polymerisation and thus, survival. DSM265 has a very high in-vitro selectivity for <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> DHODH over its human ortholog.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> The compound kills both sensitive and drug-resistant <italic>P falciparum</italic> parasites in vitro, and eliminates infection in the humanised severe combined immuno-deficiency mouse model.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> It has pharmacokinetic properties compatible with single-dose treatment, and a simple synthetic route.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Furthermore, preclinical studies showed equal activity on blood-stage and liver-stage parasites, a property seen with very few molecules in the antimalarial pipeline.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> In studies of healthy human participants,<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> DSM265 (single doses of ≤1200 mg) was generally well tolerated, with a good pharmacokinetic profile of effectiveness for more than 8 days after a single oral dose in the range of 200–400 mg. In the induced blood stage malaria challenge component of the study by McCarthy and colleagues,<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> a single dose of 150 mg DSM265 showed antimalarial activity against <italic>P falciparum</italic>, and predicted an efficacious single curative dose of 340 mg for a 60 kg patient. In a sporozoite challenge study in healthy individuals, a single dose of 400 mg administered 1 day before parasite challenge provided complete protection from infection, showing that the compound has causal prophylactic activity.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para100">Any new drug developed for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria will be deployed in combination with other antimalarials, as per standard-of-care artemisinin-based combination therapies, to preclude resistance spread.

In this region, both <italic>P falciparum</italic> and <italic>P vivax</italic> are endemic.</p>
                <p id="para120">The study protocol included prespecified dose escalation and de-escalation criteria, in which results of the first <italic>P falciparum</italic> and <italic>P vivax</italic> cohorts (400 mg DSM265), pharmacokinetic results, pharmacodynamic results, and tolerability information from previous cohorts guided dose selection of subsequent cohorts. If results of the first cohort met the predefined success criteria, then the dose was reduced in the next cohort to define the minimum parasiticidal concentration and minimum inhibitory concentration in vivo,<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> and to fully characterise the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of the compound. If criteria were not met, the dose was increased to 600 mg, then 800 mg.</p>
                <p id="para130">The main patient inclusion criteria were clinical malaria, defined as microscopically confirmed monoinfection with <italic>P falciparum</italic> or <italic>P vivax</italic>, (with 1000–35 000 asexual parasites per μL blood) and fever, or a history of fever in the previous 24 h.

                <p id="para150">On admission, patients were fully examined, <italic>Plasmodium</italic> spp infection was confirmed microscopically, and blood samples were taken for parasite quantification, routine haematology, and biochemistry. Enrolled patients, ideally fasted, were admitted to the study clinic and treated with a single oral dose of DSM265 in suspension and monitored every 4 h over days 0–3. If parasite clearance, defined as two consecutive negative microscopy readings, was not apparent, then the clinic stay was extended to 7 days and monitoring was continued every 6 h until parasite clearance occurred. If parasites were not cleared by day 7 for patients with <italic>P vivax</italic> infection and day 5 for patients with <italic>P falciparum</italic> infection or, if symptoms of parasitaemia worsened, standard-of-care rescue treatment in accordance with the National Peruvian Treatment guidelines was given (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>).</p>
                <p id="para160">Drug efficacy was monitored up to day 28 and tolerability for at least 35 days, based on the long plasma half-life of the (mostly inactive) metabolite DSM450 (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>).<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> Patients were monitored for 28 days to assess parasitaemia by quantitative PCR and thick blood smears. The PCR adjustment aims to differentiate between new infection and recrudescence. Gametocytaemia was assessed by microscopy throughout the study.

                <p id="para170">Tests for <italic>P falciparum</italic> DHODH (<italic>Pf</italic>DHODH) mutations were done with parasite populations from samples taken on the day of drug administration and either the day of recurrence or day 28, whichever occurred first.

                <p id="para180">For pharmacokinetic assessments, blood samples for DSM265 or DSM450 analysis were obtained before treatment and at 0·5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 48, and 72 h after treatment; and then either at day 5 or 7, depending on the extent of parasitaemia measured on day 3; followed by days 10–11, 14, 17–18, 21, 24–25, 28, and 35.</p>

                <title>Outcomes</title>
                <p id="para190">The primary efficacy endpoints were the proportion of patients achieving PCR-adjusted adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR) by day 14 for patients infected with <italic>P falciparum</italic> and the proportion of patients achieving a crude cure by day 14 for those infected with <italic>P vivax</italic>. The ACPR is defined as a cure from malaria as assessed by the absence of parasitaemia in thick blood smear microscopy, irrespective of axillary temperature, in patients who did not previously meet any of the criteria of early treatment failure, late clinical failure, or late parasitological failure. Crude cure is defined as the clearance of asexual parasites within 7 days of treatment without later recurrence, measured by thick blood smear microscopy without PCR adjustment. Cohort success, the criteria for dose escalation, was defined as ACPR (<italic>P falciparum</italic>) or crude cure (<italic>P vivax</italic>) in at least 80% of patients in the cohort. The following pharmacokinetic parameters were also assessed as primary endpoints: area under the plasma concentration versus time curve until time t, 168 h, or infinity (AUC<sub>0-t</sub>, AUC<sub>0-168</sub>, and AUC<sub>0-inf</sub>), maximum plasma concentration (C<sub>max</sub>), time to maximum plasma concentration (t<sub>max</sub>), compound plasma half-life (t<sub>1/2</sub>), plasma concentration after 168 h (C<sub>168h</sub>), and terminal elimination rate constant (λ<sub>inf</sub>). Secondary endpoints were DSM265 safety and tolerability, clinical efficacy as assessed by the improvement of signs and symptoms of malaria, including the proportions of patients achieving ACPR and cure at day 28, gametocyte carriage, and parasite clearance kinetics. Mutations in DSM265 target <italic>Pfdhodh</italic> were examined in an exploratory assessment of baseline and recurrent parasites. The pharmacokinetic parameters of the major metabolite DSM450 were also studied as an exploratory endpoint.</p>

The per-protocol population differed between the day 14 and day 28 analyses, because some patients did not report back to the clinic.

              <p id="para230">All patients in cohorts 1a and 1b received a single dose of 400 mg DSM265, were monitored until day 28 for efficacy, and until day 35 for safety. Initially, treatment failure in the first cohort was defined by quantitative PCR rather than microscopy. However, this method detected not only asexual blood-stage parasites, but also asymptomatic sexual-stage gametocytes, thus potentially confounding the interpretation of clearance. Therefore, the protocol was amended, such that in subsequent cohorts, treatment failure was assessed by thick blood smear microscopy. In cohort 1a, three patients were discontinued in April, 2015, according to quantitative PCR values, but remained negative when measured by thick blood smear, and were free of malaria signs and symptoms. The protocol was amended in September, 2015, removing the reason for termination based solely on positive quantitative PCR when the blood smear was negative. Therefore, the three patients were replaced by three newly enrolled patients, who were included in the per-protocol analysis.

In patient F2005 (cohort 2a; 250 mg DSM265), a minor (about 30%) population of Cys276Phe mutant parasites was identified in blood samples taken after recurrence.

The high read coverage and mixed allele status at the <italic>dhodh</italic> locus in the F2005 day 28 sample suggests an amplification event, estimated at four or five copies. Thus, we suspect that the parasites in patient F2005 underwent a copy number variation and acquired two separate mutations, namely Gly181Ser and Cys276Phe.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="para370">To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to assess a novel antimalarial drug that is in clinical development for efficacy against both uncomplicated <italic>P falciparum</italic> and <italic>P vivax</italic> malaria with a long observation period of up to 28 days. DSM265 rapidly cured most patients infected with the deadliest malaria parasite, <italic>P falciparum</italic>, confirming the potential of DSM265 as a component in a future SERCaP medicine. Efficacy of DSM265 against <italic>P vivax</italic> was markedly lower, with none of the tested doses capable of clearing infection. Overall, safety and tolerability findings were similar to those reported in previous studies of DSM265 in humans,<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> in line with the absence of significant ECG events in healthy volunteers up to doses of 1200 mg.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para380">We did not detect any apparent difference between pharmacokinetic profiles of DSM265 and DSM450 in patients with malaria in our study and those previously reported for healthy individuals,<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> nor between those infected with <italic>P falciparum</italic> and those with <italic>P vivax</italic>. Based on C<sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>0-∞</sub>, the pharmacokinetic results of DSM265 in our study appeared to be dose proportional in patients with <italic>P falciparum</italic> infection (250 mg or 400 mg). By contrast, when we increased the dose in patients with <italic>P vivax</italic> infection from 400 mg to 800 mg DSM265, exposure was slightly subproportional—ie, lower than expected for the higher dosing based on previous results in healthy individuals.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para390">For late-stage clinical trials with antimalarials that include drugs with long half-lives, ACPR assessments for longer than 14 days after treatment are considered best to predict treatment failure. 28 days is preferred, or even 42 days for drugs with half-lives longer than 7 days like mefloquine, pyronaridine, and piperaquine.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> For our experimental monotherapy study, days 14 and 28 were chosen for ACPR assessments, mostly for practical and ethical reasons.</p>
              <p id="para400">In our studies, DSM265 showed single-dose efficacy for the treatment of <italic>P falciparum</italic> malaria. The <italic>P falciparum</italic> clearance half-life of 5 h that we recorded is shorter than the 9·4 h previously reported in experimentally infected volunteers,<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> possibly because of the naive immune status of these individuals. DSM265 is believed to cause a depletion of available pyrimidine nucleotides and subsequently block DNA and RNA synthesis. DSM265 might not kill parasites that are not replicating, which might explain the observed clearance lag time. No clear relationship between recrudescence and DSM265 exposure could be established in our study. For example, the plasma concentrations of DSM265 in patients with <italic>P vivax</italic> infection who had received 800 mg doses was not lower in those with recurrence than in those who responded better. Patients with <italic>P falciparum</italic> infection in both the 250 mg and 400 mg dose groups achieved complete parasite clearance within 72 h (parasitaemia below the limit of detection) and remained parasite free through the primary day 14 endpoint. Post-treatment efficacy up to day 28 was observed in eight of nine patients at 400 mg DSM265 and in six of ten patients at 250 mg. Given the long plasma half-life of DSM265 and estimated duration of exposure greater than the minimum parasiticidal concentration at around 10 days (for 400 mg), this study was designed to confirm the initial antimalarial activity of DSM265 and to assess its potential to prevent recurrence.</p>
              <p id="para410">In our study, efficacy against <italic>P vivax</italic> was lower than for <italic>P falciparum</italic>, a characteristic that DSM265 appears to share with sulphonamide drugs. This result also shows the need to assess efficacy against both <italic>P vivax</italic> and <italic>P falciparum</italic> at the earliest clinical stages to guide further development. <italic>P vivax</italic> clearance of 99–100% was still achieved within the first 100 h at doses of 600 mg and 800 mg, but the study objective (80% of patients parasite free after day 14) was not reached. The response in patients with <italic>P vivax</italic> infection did not exhibit a strong dose–response relationship, suggesting that a maximally achievable result was attained for single-dose therapy, and that multiple doses or combination therapy would probably be required for full efficacy. This observation is consistent with earlier results from ex-vivo experiments in plasmodium-infected field isolates in which DSM265 showed five-times better efficacy for <italic>P falciparum</italic> than <italic>P vivax.</italic><xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> The reason for this difference in potency between <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species is not yet clear. In biochemical studies with truncated recombinant enzymes, the IC<sub>50</sub> of DSM265 for the <italic>Pv</italic>DHODH enzyme (ie, the DSM265 concentration which reduced the enzyme activity by half) was only two times higher than for <italic>Pf</italic>DHODH, suggesting that enzyme differences do not fully account for the finding.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> The possibility that DSM265 could demonstrate cell-specific membrane penetration has not been investigated. <italic>P falciparum</italic> and <italic>P vivax</italic> differ in asexual reproduction in erythrocytes and reticulocytes. However, replication in both host cell types requires parasitic DHODH activity, since another DHODH inhibitor, DSM421, has equal efficacy against both <italic>P falciparum</italic> and <italic>P vivax</italic> in the same assay.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para420">From the four patients with <italic>P falciparum</italic> recurrence, two parasites clones were identified with a single-point mutation in the <italic>dhodh</italic> gene that was absent at baseline. Separate in-vitro assays in earlier studies confirmed that the acquired mutations protected against DSM265. This finding highlights the need to use DSM265 in combination therapy to minimise the risk of resistance. The potential spread of resistance should also be monitored, along with any evidence for a fitness cost for such mutations.</p>
              <p id="para430"><italic>P falciparum</italic> represents a significantly more important and urgent challenge than <italic>P vivax</italic>, both with respect to mortality and the propensity to develop drug resistance. No antimalarial drug is recommended by WHO for a single-dose cure of malaria, making the promising efficacy of DSM265 against <italic>P falciparum</italic> particularly important.</p>
              <p id="para440">A limitation of this study was the low genetic diversity of the local <italic>P falciparum</italic> parasites in Peru, which might lead to underestimating the day-14 ACPR, because reinfecting parasites cannot be distinguished from the initial infection when patients return home a few days after their treatment. However, we believe this confounding factor did not affect our conclusions. Another limitation is the low parasitaemia at baseline in our cohort of patients (1000–35 000 parasites per μL). Also, the sequential study approach prevents true randomisation.</p>
              <p id="para450">Overall, these preliminary observations suggest that DSM265 has the potential to become an important new antimalarial compound for SERCaP therapy, and our findings outline how it might be combined (since all new SERCaPs are expected to be combinations). Because of the lag time of DSM265, a partner drug should be fast acting, and because of its lower activity against <italic>P vivax</italic> than <italic>P falciparum</italic>, the partner should have good potency (or potentiate DSM265) against that species, a profile that fits several existing antimalarials and molecules in the pipeline.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p>
