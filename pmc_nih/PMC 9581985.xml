                <p id="Par1">Alcohol use disorder is a major cause of morbidity, which requires newer treatment approaches. We previously showed in a randomized clinical trial that alcohol craving and consumption reduces after fecal transplantation. Here, to determine if this could be transmitted through microbial transfer, germ-free male C57BL/6 mice received stool or sterile supernatants collected from the trial participants pre-/post-fecal transplant. We found that mice colonized with post-fecal transplant stool but not supernatants reduced ethanol acceptance, intake and preference versus pre-fecal transplant colonized mice. Microbial taxa that were higher in post-fecal transplant humans were also associated with lower murine alcohol intake and preference. A majority of the differentially expressed genes (immune response, inflammation, oxidative stress response, and epithelial cell proliferation) occurred in the intestine rather than the liver and prefrontal cortex. These findings suggest a potential for therapeutically targeting gut microbiota and the microbial-intestinal interface to alter gut-liver-brain axis and reduce alcohol consumption in humans.</p>

              <p id="Par3">Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a major cause of reduced life expectancy worldwide, and this misuse has increased exponentially during the pandemic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Excessive alcohol consumption can lead to end-organ damage across several organs, but the liver and resultant cirrhosis is a significant complication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Cirrhosis alone, regardless of AUD, is associated with microbial dysbiosis and defects in the intestinal mucosal barrier, which can worsen in the presence of alcohol misuse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. This situation is complicated by the lack of adequate study of AUD-related pharmacotherapy in this advanced population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Therefore, in these patients, it becomes even more important to reduce alcohol misuse to prevent further liver injury.</p>
              <p id="Par4">Recent preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated that fecal transplant of microbiota from patients with AUD can change the intestinal barrier and affect brain function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Specific changes related to blood metabolome were noted to modulate these behaviors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Moreover, in patients with AUD, there are specific changes in the gut microbiome and intestinal barrier that are unique to cirrhosis versus alcohol and selected taxa change after alcohol abstinence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. The next step is to determine if changing the microbiota could beneficially reduce the craving and alcohol intake in patients with AUD and the potential mechanisms behind these changes. We performed a placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial in men with cirrhosis and AUD in which fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) from a donor enriched in Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae led to short-term reduction in alcohol craving and consumption with a concomitant increase in short-chain fatty acids in the FMT group but not placebo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. This also led to an overall reduction in AUD-related adverse events over 6 months in the FMT group compared to placebo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. However, the role of microbial alterations on the gut-liver-brain axis needs to be investigated further. Our aim was to determine if alcohol craving improvement in humans after FMT could be transmitted to mice through microbial transplantation.</p>
              <p id="Par5">We had previously shown that fecal microbiota transplant reduced alcohol craving in humans with cirrhosis. Here we show that the reduction in craving and alcohol preference was transmissible to germ-free mice only when live bacteria and not germ-free supernatants were used for colonization. This differential colonization was associated with alterations in the gut immune-inflammatory response through short-chain fatty acids.</p>

                <title>Alcohol intake and preference reflected the clinical trial results and was not recapitulated with sterile supernatants</title>
                <p id="Par7">We included 28 male 10–15 week-old C57BL/6J GF mice obtained from the UNC National Gnotobiotic Rodent Resource Center, half of whom received the pooled pre-FMT stools by gavage on 3 consecutive days and the rest received pooled post-FMT stools (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>) in the initial experiment. No obvious sickness behavior was noted, nor were body weights different between the groups.</p>
                <p id="Par8">In the subsequent experiment, we included 18 male 10–15 week-old GF C57BL/6J, six of whom remained GF without colonization, and six each were administered the pre-FMT and post-FMT supernatants by gavage respectively. Two of the post-FMT supernatant gavage mice were found to be sickly and on dissection were found to have gavage-related injury; they were excluded from the analysis.</p>
                <p id="Par9">Since the two experiments (Pre vs Post-FMT intact stool colonization) and supernatants (Pre vs Post-FMT vs GF controls) were done at separate times, we analyzed these separately.</p>
                <p id="Par10">On day 16 post-colonization, mice underwent two days of two-bottle choice drinking for 20% (v/v) ethanol vs. water. Ethanol intake and preference during the two days of access were significantly reduced in post-FMT mice(Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>). The main effect of treatment (intake: <italic>F</italic><sub>1,26</sub> = 8.814, <italic>p</italic> = 0.006 and preference: <italic>F</italic><sub>1,26</sub> = 7.876, <italic>p</italic> = 0.009) was found by two-way repeated-measures ANOVA, which showed a significantly lower intake and preference for alcohol in those colonized with post-FMT compared to pre-FMT. Initial ethanol acceptance was measured as ethanol intake at two hours and was also significantly lower in post-FMT mice as compared to pre-FMT mice (<italic>p</italic> = <italic>t</italic>-test <italic>p</italic> = 0.009, Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2E</xref>). There was also a lower preference for alcohol in post-FMT vs pre-FMT mice that were colonized with stool over days 1 and 2, and there was a trend towards significance during the binge (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2E, F</xref>). Total liquid consumed by the mice (i.e. 20% ethanol and tap water) or body weight was not different between the groups for any measure (Tables <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>Alcohol Intake and preference is reduced in post-FMT male mice.</title><p><bold>A</bold>, <bold>B</bold> 24-hour two-bottle choice alcohol intake for 20% ethanol or water on days 1 and 2. <bold>A</bold> Pre and post-FMT stool colonized mice (D1 comparison <italic>p</italic> = 0.0058, D2 comparison <italic>p</italic> = 0.035) using one-sided Mann–Whitney tests, <bold>B</bold> Germ-free mice and those colonized using sterile supernatants from pre and post-FMT mice were not significantly different using using one-sided Kruskal–Wallis tests. <bold>C</bold> Pre and post-FMT stool colonized mice, <bold>D</bold> Germ-free mice and those colonized using sterile supernatants from pre and post-FMT mice. <bold>E</bold>–<bold>H</bold> Initial alcohol intake and preference measured during the 2-h initial binge on day 1. <bold>E</bold> Pre-FMT stool colonized mice had lower intake in the binge than post-FMT stool colonized mice (<italic>p</italic> = 0.03, Mann–Whitney test one-sided), <bold>F</bold> Germ-free mice and those colonized using sterile supernatants from pre and post-FMT mice were not significantly different on the binge, <bold>G</bold> Initial alcohol acceptance measured as a 2-h initial binge on day 1 was statistically similar across pre/post-FMT stool or H: between germ-free mice and those administered the supernatants.Pre Pre-FMT entire stool, Post Post-FMT entire stool, GF germ-free, PreSup GF supernatant Pre-FMT, PostSup GF supernatant Post-FMT, D1 day 1, D2 day 2. ***<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001,*<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, NS not significant.

                <p id="Par21">To understand the signaling changes following colonization and brief ethanol drinking sessions, we performed RNA-Seq analysis on the PFC, liver, and small intestine of 6 pre-FMT and 6 post-FMT mice (GSE205303). As expected, the intestine showed the majority of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs). DESeq2 analysis revealed that 843 genes were differentially expressed at FDR &lt; 0.2 in the intestinal mucosa of pre-FMT versus post-FMT mice (Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9A</xref> and Supplemental Data File <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">1</xref>). To further characterize the molecular functions and biological processes of these DEGs, we performed and Gene Ontology and KEGG pathway analysis using DAVID and Revigo to reduce the complexity and redundancy of each of the GO categories using semantic language processing (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. QIAGEN Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA; QIAGEN Inc., <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://digitalinsights.qiagen.com/IPA">https://digitalinsights.qiagen.com/IPA</ext-link>) was used to identify upstream regulators of these DEGs and canonical pathways overrepresented in this dataset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. A number of cellular processes were altered in the small intestine, including immune response, stress response, bile acid signaling, sphingolipid metabolism, epithelial cell renewal, and fibrotic response.

Genes related to fibroblast activation and intestine fibrosis, such as collagens, <italic>Pdgfra, Pdgfrb, Cdk6</italic>, and <italic>Cdc6</italic>, were significantly downregulated in the post-FMT group compared to the pre-PMT group.

              <p id="Par23">We found that FMT-related decrease in alcohol preference and intake that were found in patients with cirrhosis were transmissible to germ-free mice through intact stool but not using sterile supernatants. Microbial taxa that were higher in post-FMT donors were also associated with lower alcohol intake and preference in the mice.</p>
              <p id="Par24">There is increasing evidence that altered gut-liver-brain axis in AUD can modulate the development of liver dysfunction, cognitive impairment, and immune dysfunction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. In addition to affecting the liver and brain, AUD has multi-systemic impacts on gut microbiota composition and function in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. These effects synergize to worsen the quality of life of these patients and could potentially be modified using gut microbial manipulation.</p>
              <p id="Par25">In our randomized clinical trial, we found improvement in alcohol craving and consumption at day 15, which then translated into longer-term beneficial AUD-related outcomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. While the focused SCFA improvement was linked to craving, we needed to explore whether alcohol preference and intake changes could also be transmitted to rodent models, get a more expansive view of the effects of FMT and begin to understand the molecular changes occurring in the affected organ systems to alter ethanol intake and preference following FMT.</p>
              <p id="Par26">One of the major findings in this study is that colonization of mice with microbiota from post-FMT AUD patients consumed less than half the amount of ethanol than mice colonized with untreated (baseline) microbiota (Pre-FMT) from the same patients. Initial ethanol acceptance was also reduced in these mice as was ethanol preference. This finding replicates the human impact of the FMT in these patients with cirrhosis, where the craving and consumption of alcohol were reduced from baseline within the FMT group at 15 days<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. While prior studies have shown changes in neuro-inflammation, socialization, and behavior in mice colonized with stools from patients with differing amounts of alcohol use<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, we extend these by using human samples from a successful trial of alcohol use reduction. Moreover, these effects were not found when sterile supernatants from these same human donors were used. This experience isolates the role of live microbiota without the accompanying cirrhosis or pre-existing cognitive impairments that co-exist in patients with cirrhosis who continue to drink<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. In addition, these extended studies by prior groups to show that alcohol intake can affect the microbial composition and vice-versa and contribute to the growing field of microbial changes in substance abuse disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par27">We only used pooled samples from patients in the FMT group to reduce inter-subject variability since it would be a within-subject comparison. In addition, due to sex differences in susceptibility to alcohol-related injury, only men were included in the human trial and male mice were used in this translational study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Future studies will incorporate females to determine potential sex differences in these effects. Changes in microbiota after FMT in these patients showed higher Ruminococcaceae constituents from the healthy donor. These were then translated into the recipient mice with greater Shannon diversity as well as the relative abundance of taxa belonging to Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae and lower Enterobacteriaceae constituents such as <italic>Escherichia</italic>_<italic>Shigella</italic>, <italic>Citrobacter</italic>, <italic>Raoultella</italic> and <italic>Pluralibacter</italic>. This was striking because the contrast between microbial composition was maintained across two sets of FMT procedures (healthy donor to human AUD recipient and then from human AUD donors to germ-free mice) with taxa that were enriched the original healthy human donor. Moreover, these same taxa were also differentially associated with alcohol preference and intake at day 1 and day 2 of the experiment. Specifically, <italic>Faecalibacterium, Allobaculum, Sutterella</italic> and selected <italic>Ruminococcus</italic> genera changed relationships with alcohol preference pre versus post-FMT colonization. Partly this could be explained by the higher alcohol intake in the pre-FMT mice but we obtained stool 18 h after the last exposure to alcohol. In patients with alcohol-related liver disease, there is a lower abundance of <italic>Faecalibacterium, Coprococcus</italic>, and higher Enterobacteriaceae, which in the setting of cirrhosis includes lower <italic>Phascolarctobacterium</italic> and other commensals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. The interplay between Enterobacteriaceae members and <italic>Faecalibacterium</italic> is well known in patients with AUD without cirrhosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. We found the same relationship in the pre-FMT mice that was changed to higher <italic>Faecalibacterium</italic> in post-FMT recipients and was also linked with changes towards lower alcohol intake and preference. These patterns existed even before they were exposed to alcohol, and are consistent with those observed in mice fed alcohol for over 8 weeks, i.e., higher Proteobacteria and lower Firmicutes and obligate anaerobes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Moreover, functional changes, including increased intestinal butyrate that would result from higher Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae members, also showed an increase in mice colonized with post-FMT vs pre-FMT stools. This was accompanied by a lower circulating LBP, which could be indicative of a healthier intestinal barrier after colonization with stools from post-FMT donors compared to pre-FMT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. This suggests that microbiota from the AUD cirrhosis donors after several decades of alcohol exposure was successfully transmitted into the mice. Acute alcohol exposure in this background further changed microbial taxa correlations, including <italic>Allobaculum</italic> spp changes, as seen in prior studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. In our post-FMT mice that received stools from alcohol-related cirrhosis patients who had received a healthy donor FMT, the baseline is further skewed, which makes these consistent microbial alterations even more striking. Therefore, the phenotypical changes in microbiota were largely replicated from prior human and animal studies and are relatively conserved across two FMT procedures (healthy human donor to AUD human recipient, then to mouse recipient). Moreover, we also found higher butyrate in the post-FMT mice that reflected the human experience, indicating a beneficial functional change as well.</p>
              <p id="Par28">Considering that mice were colonized with different pools of FMT material and all mice underwent 2-bottle choice alcohol drinking, we cannot disentangle the effects of drinking or FMT alone in our gene expression analysis. Few but interesting gene expression and pathway changes occurred in the PFC that suggest FMT treatment and brief ethanol drinking differentially altered synaptic signaling. PFC DEGs were over-represented in categories for long-term synaptic potentiation, actin filament network formation and dendritic spines along with estrogen signaling. Estrogenic metabolites are associated with feminization due to alcohol use and cirrhosis in men<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. However, these changes were likely dampened by the fact that the mice only had 48 h of alcohol access as compared to those seen in mouse fed alcohol chronically<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. The few genes altered in the liver were involved in cytokine receptor activation, TGF-β, and IL-6 signaling, suggesting an inflammatory response, which is involved in alcohol-related liver injury and was attenuated after FMT in our study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par29">A majority of our DEGs were found in the small intestine rather than the liver or PFC, which is striking since alcohol intake and preference changed significantly in the post-FMT mice. Our bioinformatics analysis revealed that the 843 DEGs were primarily involved in regulating the barrier function, immune response, oxidative stress response, inflammation, bile acid, and sphingolipid signaling, and intestinal cell proliferation and fibrosis. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis identified many immune regulators such as <italic>Tgfb1</italic>, <italic>Il10ra</italic>, <italic>Il1b</italic>, <italic>Infg</italic>, and <italic>Tnf</italic> were major upstream regulators of these genes. Sphingolipid signaling was also a major pathway overrepresented in the Gene Ontology and IPA analyses. On KEGG analysis, several key genes pointing towards antigen processing, antibody production and innate immune response were upregulated in the post-FMT group. The higher expression levels of <italic>Cdx2</italic> and <italic>Muc2</italic> in the post-FMT group indicated that the gut microbiome plays a critical role in regulating intestinal mucosal homeostasis. Very strikingly, several fibrotic genes were markedly suppressed in the post-FMT group along with NOTCH1. It has been reported that NOTCH1 contributes to intestinal inflammation by co-operation with TNFα<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. In addition to the upregulated anti-oxidative stress genes (<italic>Mt1</italic> and <italic>Mt2</italic>) and ER stress modulator (<italic>Canx</italic>), colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (<italic>Csf1R</italic>) was significantly downregulated in the post-FMT group. Alterations in gene expression in the intestinal mucosa, and to a lesser extent in the liver or PFC, on RNA-Seq were centered on processes that mediate the altered gut-liver axis in alcohol-related liver diseases, including barrier function that was also corroborated by lower serum LBP and higher intestinal SCFAs in post vs pre-FMT mice. S1P-mediated signaling is associated with immune cell infiltration and activation of inflammation in alcohol-related liver injury<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. It has been reported that gut bacteria-derived sphingolipids impact host metabolic pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. These results suggest that strengthening the intestinal barrier as a result of the more favorable post-FMT microbiome could mediate gut-modulating alcohol intake that is transmissible from humans.</p>
              <p id="Par30">Interpretation of some results of this study is limited by all mice consuming measurable amounts of alcohol, so some of the RNA-Seq changes could represent differences in alcohol intake. However, mouse tissues were harvested 18 h after the last alcohol intake when ethanol is likely no longer present. Mice used here did not have pre-existing liver disease or cirrhosis and therefore did not completely conform to the human donors, which is a limitation. However, despite the absence of cirrhosis or pre-existing liver injury before colonization, the mouse drinking preference recapitulated the findings of the human trial. We also did not perform RNA-Seq in the GF and supernatant-receiving mice. However, the results suggest that neither alcohol-drinking preference or intake, nor change in SCFA, or LBP were noted between the three groups. We also found that several genera of Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae were found in higher relative abundance post-FMT in the recipient mice in patterns that followed the human donors. These findings indicate that live bacterial communities that produce SCFA and potentially enhance the intestinal barrier could improve alcohol intake and preference in mice. We pooled all human stools pre- and then post-FMT rather than using individual stools for transplantation. Since 80% of patients showed a lowering in craving and consumption 15-days post-FMT, separately inoculating donor materials from individual subjects would have added complexity without the addition of meaningful results beyond the pooled material. In addition, we only performed RNA-Seq on a subset of the mice, but the selection of those with the widest range of drinking intake could have biased our results. Also, this short-term model did not allow us to study liver injury that often accompanies long-term alcohol feeding.</p>
              <p id="Par31">We conclude that fecal transplant-related reduction in alcohol craving and intake can be transmitted to germ-free mice through multiple impacts on microbiota and the intestinal gene transcriptional interface that focus on the intestinal barrier. These changes are associated with microbiota belonging to Ruminococcaceae enriched in the original healthy human donor linked differentially with alcohol use that beneficially changed after human FMT. Differentially expressed genes in the small intestine related to inflammation, barrier function, S1P signaling, estrogen metabolism, and immune presentation were associated with the changes in alcohol drinking intake and preference. Moreover, germ-free supernatants did not replicate these findings. The majority of altered gene expression in mice that exhibited greatest changes in alcohol intake were in the intestinal mucosa rather than the prefrontal cortex or liver, reflecting the importance of the gut and live microbiota as the interface of the altered gut-liver-brain axis in alcohol use disorder.</p>

Patients were enrolled from Richmond VA Medical Center and VCU Medical Center Liver Disease clinics after written informed consent. Alcohol craving questionnaire, alcohol consumption (urinary ethylglucuronide/creatinine, Etg), quality of life (QOL), cognition and stool microbiota were tested at baseline and day 15. Patients were seen at 30 days and a 6-month follow-up when serious adverse events (SAE) analysis was performed. The use of the samples in the current study was covered by the original informed consent and IRB approval at the Richmond Veterans Hospital. Patients were compensated for their time and effort which was approved by the IRB as well. The primary outcome was safety at six months. A 6-month follow-up with serious adverse event (SAE) analysis was performed. We included twenty men with AUD-related cirrhosis (65 ± 6.4 yearsModel for End-Stage Liver Disease 8.9 ± 2.7) with similar demographics, cirrhosis, and AUD severity between those assigned to placebo or FMT. The overall results showed the safety and tolerability of the FMT without any infections or SAEs related to it. There was a significant reduction in proportion of FMT-assigned patients who reduced their craving (90% of FMT versus 30% in placebo at day 15, <italic>P</italic> = 0.02). This was accompanied by a lower urinary Etg/creatinine (<italic>P</italic> = 0.03) and improved cognition and psychosocial quality of life in the FMT group. We also found a significant reduction in serum IL-6 and lipopolysaccharide-binding protein with an increased butyrate and isobutyrate in FMT-assigned patients compared to baseline but not in those assigned to placebo. FMT-assigned patients also showed a higher microbial alpha diversity with higher Ruminococcaceae and other microbiota associated with SCFA production. This was correlated with SCFA levels. On longer-term follow-up at 6 months, we found that placebo group had a higher proportion of patients with any SAEs (80% vs. 20%, <italic>P</italic> = 0.02), AUD-related SAEs (70% vs. 10%, <italic>P</italic> = 0.02), and median SAEs/patient (median [interquartile range], 1.5 [1.25] vs. 0 [0.25] in FMT, <italic>P</italic> = 0.02) compared to those assigned to FMT.</p>

The gradient was optimized at 5% to 50% B in 16 min, maintained 50% B for 2 min, and then hold 80% B for 1 min. The column was equilibrated with 5% B for 2 min.</p>
                <p id="Par41">The LBP levels in the serum were measured by ELISA using the Mouse LBP SimpleStep ELISA Kit from Abcam (Cat# ab269542). Total RNA was isolated from small intestinal tissues using Trizol reagent (QIAGEN) and reverse-transcribed into first-strand cDNA using a High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems).</p>

                <p id="Par42">FastQC (version 0.11.9) was used to measure QC metrics for all RNA-Seq fastq.gz samples. RNA-Seq data were then aligned to the mouse genome (GRCm39) using STAR (version 2.7.9a) and counts were generated with HTSeq (version 0.13.5). The MultiQC (version 1.11) suite was then used to generate and collate QC metrics for fastq.gz, alignment, and raw count samples. Genes with very low counts across the study (defined as fewer than 10 counts in more than 2 samples) were eliminated before differential expression analysis. Low count genes were determined separately for each tissue type. The DESeq2 package (release 3.13) for R was then used to measure differential expression between pre-FMT and post-FMT mice in the intestine, liver, and PFC. Benjamini and Hochberg False Discovery Rate (FDR) was used to correct for multiple testing with FDR ≤ 0.2 considered significant.</p>
