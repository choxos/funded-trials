                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disproportionately affect young gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM) and transgender women of colour. We explored the experiences of community‐based peer navigators (‘Community Navigators’) who participated in <italic toggle="yes">Impact Triad</italic>, a bilingual multilevel intervention developed by our community‐based participatory research partnership to reduce STIs and HIV and address social determinants of health (e.g., employment, education, social support and discrimination) among young GBMSM and transgender women of colour.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Individual in‐depth interviews were conducted with 15 Community Navigators who participated in <italic toggle="yes">Impact Triad</italic>. Themes were identified through constant comparison.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Community Navigators' mean age was 31.4 years. Seven were self‐identified as African American/Black, 5 as Latine, 2 as multiracial/multiethnic, 1 as Asian American, 10 as cisgender men, 4 as transgender women and 1 as gender nonbinary. Thirteen themes emerged in three domains: (1) key aspects of the Community Navigator role (e.g., desire to serve as a community resource, the importance of being part of the communities in which one was working, the value of having an official role, being connected to other Community Navigators to problem‐solving and sustaining intervention aspects long‐term); (2) experiences implementing <italic toggle="yes">Impact Triad</italic> (e.g., engaging community members, meeting prioritized needs, building trust, using social media, increasing awareness and knowledge and challenges related to COVID‐19) and (3) lessons learned for future interventions (e.g., facilitating access to broader resources, building additional skills and increasing interactions among Community Navigators).</p>

                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p>Interviews identified important learnings about serving as Community Navigators and implementing <italic toggle="yes">Impact Triad</italic> that can guide future efforts to address STI/HIV disparities and social determinants of health through community‐based peer navigation.</p>

                  <p>Throughout this intervention trial, our partnership worked collaboratively with a study‐specific community advisory board (CAB) comprised primarily of young GBMSM and transgender women of colour. Members of this CAB participated in all aspects of the trial including trial design, intervention development, recruitment and retention strategies, data collection and analysis, interpretation of findings and dissemination.</p>

                <p>There is an urgent need to address disparities related to STIs and HIV in the United States. STI and HIV rates are highest among young persons,<xref rid="hex13698-bib-0001" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref>, <xref rid="hex13698-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> and gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM) and transgender women, and particularly those who are persons of colour, also carry a disproportionate burden of STIs and HIV. For example, GBMSM comprise approximately 4% of the US adult male population but 43% of all syphilis cases in the country and 86% of all HIV diagnoses among men,<xref rid="hex13698-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref>, <xref rid="hex13698-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref>, <xref rid="hex13698-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> and if current rates persist, one in two African American/Black and one in four Latine GBMSM may be diagnosed with HIV during his lifetime.<xref rid="hex13698-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> (The term ‘Latine’ uses a gender‐neutral ‘e’, which replaces the gendered endings ‘a’ and ‘o’ as in ‘Latina’ and ‘Latino’, and is similar to ‘Latinx’; this term is increasingly used within Latine LGBTQ communities). It is estimated that 14% of transgender women in the country are living with HIV, with prevalence rates as high as 44% among African American/Black and 26% among Latine transgender women.<xref rid="hex13698-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> Furthermore, the US South has high STI rates compared to other regions of the country<xref rid="hex13698-bib-0001" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref>, <xref rid="hex13698-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> and has been referred to as the ‘new’ and ‘latest’ US HIV epicentre.<xref rid="hex13698-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref>

                <title>Social determinants of health</title>
                <p>The issues contributing to STI and HIV disparities experienced by young GBMSM and transgender women of colour are complex. Social determinants that influence the health of these communities include individual, sociocultural, environmental, system and policy factors. For example, GBMSM and transgender women, particularly those who are persons of colour, are more likely than heterosexual and cisgender counterparts to experience limited access to employment and education and face high rates of discrimination in a range of settings including health care, workplaces and schools.<xref rid="hex13698-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref>, <xref rid="hex13698-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref>, <xref rid="hex13698-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref>, <xref rid="hex13698-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> In addition, employment status, education level and related factors such as poverty, income and health insurance coverage have been associated with STI and HIV incidence and outcomes.<xref rid="hex13698-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref>, <xref rid="hex13698-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> There has been a call to broaden the focus of STI and HIV prevention efforts to address these ‘upstream’ factors that profoundly impact sexual health, in addition to individual‐level factors such as increasing correct and consistent condom use and STI and HIV screening.<xref rid="hex13698-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref>, <xref rid="hex13698-bib-0016" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref>

                <p>CARS is a unique initiative of the US CDC that promotes the use of community engagement to increase STI and HIV prevention, screening and treatment and address related social determinants of health within communities disproportionately affected by STIs and HIV. The initiative focuses on identifying and implementing innovative community‐driven strategies that leverage community assets.<xref rid="hex13698-bib-0025" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> As part of the CARS initiative, our CBPR partnership developed and tested <italic toggle="yes">Impact Triad</italic>, a bilingual (English and Spanish), multilevel intervention designed to reduce STIs and HIV and improve social determinants of health among young GBMSM and transgender women of colour in a high‐incidence community within the US South.</p>

                <title>Development of <italic toggle="yes">Impact Triad</italic>
</title>
                <p>The <italic toggle="yes">Impact Triad</italic> intervention trial was conducted by the North Carolina Community Research Partnership. This partnership is a long‐standing CBPR partnership comprised of community members, community organization and clinic representatives and academic researchers.<xref rid="hex13698-bib-0018" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> Throughout this trial, our partnership worked collaboratively with a 15‐member community advisory board (CAB) comprised primarily of young GBMSM and transgender women of colour.</p>
                <p>We first conducted a community‐driven needs assessment to identify and better understand needs and priorities related to STI and HIV prevention, screening and treatment and social determinants of health among young GBMSM and transgender women of colour locally, as well as existing community assets. Through this process, the CAB and CBPR partnership prioritized four social determinants of health as particularly salient for young GBMSM and transgender women of colour and their risk for STIs and HIV: employment, education, social support and discrimination. Based on needs assessment findings, the CAB and CBPR partnership developed intervention strategies to reduce STIs and HIV and improve these social determinants of health and integrated these strategies into the <italic toggle="yes">Impact Triad</italic> intervention, the details of which are described elsewhere.<xref rid="hex13698-bib-0026" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref>
</p>
                <p>Briefly, <italic toggle="yes">Impact Triad</italic> includes three primary multilevel strategies: community‐based peer navigation, use of social media and antidiscrimination trainings for community organization staff. The intervention involved training young GBMSM and transgender women of colour as community‐based peer navigators, known as ‘Community Navigators’ in English and ‘Navegantes Comunitarios’ in Spanish, to carry out helping activities with members of their social networks in the community within the context of their daily lives. In addition to one‐on‐one and group‐level in‐person helping to share information and resources related to STI and HIV prevention, screening and treatment and prioritized social determinants of health, Community Navigators created and updated intervention‐related social media accounts (e.g., Facebook and Instagram) and used their own social media accounts for messaging with social network members. Community Navigators were also involved in the development of brief online video testimonials designed to raise consciousness among community organizations about the challenges and barriers young GBMSM and transgender women of colour face when accessing services related to STIs and HIV and social determinants of health and ways to facilitate access (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCd7gOGhBerT0w1CTq5BwMcQ" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCd7gOGhBerT0w1CTq5BwMcQ</ext-link>).</p>

                <title>Community Navigator recruitment and training</title>
                <p>Fifteen young GBMSM and transgender women of colour identified as informal leaders among their communities were recruited and trained to serve as <italic toggle="yes">Impact Triad</italic> Community Navigators. To be eligible to serve as a Community Navigator, a participant was 18 years of age or older; self‐identified as a person of colour; self‐identified as a man or as a transgender woman; reported sex with men and provided informed consent.</p>
                <p>Community Navigators completed four 4‐h training sessions, in two cohorts of seven to eight Community Navigators each. They were trained to serve as (1) health advisors to provide information to social network members to meet needs and priorities related to STI and HIV prevention (e.g., condom and pre‐exposure prophylaxis [PrEP] access and use), screening and treatment, as well as social determinants of health (e.g., employment and education), offering guidance on where and how to access available services; (2) opinion leaders to bolster healthy and reframe unhealthy norms and expectations related to STIs and HIV or social determinants of health (e.g., social support) and (3) community advocates to bring the voices of young GBMSM and transgender women of colour to local community organizations by sharing feedback for improvement based on the perspectives of social network members. Community Navigators were trained to use an adapted version of the ‘ask‐advise‐assist’ model,<xref rid="hex13698-bib-0027" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> represented by the acronym ‘IMPACT’ in English or ‘IMPACTO’ in Spanish with each letter representing a step in the natural helping process. A low‐literacy wallet‐sized reminder card was developed to serve as a ‘cheat sheet’ for Community Navigators outlining these steps to support others.<xref rid="hex13698-bib-0026" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> Upon graduation, Community Navigators received a framed certificate of training completion, an identification badge, a t‐shirt and bag with the <italic toggle="yes">Impact Triad</italic> intervention logo and intervention materials (e.g., condoms, penis models and informational brochures) to carry out their work within their social networks and communities of young GBMSM and transgender women of colour. Community Navigators worked informally and formally with members of their social networks for 12 months and met monthly as a group with one another and with members of the CBPR partnership in convenient locations within trusted community organizations to plan, coordinate and evaluate their activities.</p>
                <p>Community Navigators were provided a $50 stipend for each training session and each month of the 12‐month intervention implementation. They also were provided $50 per month to compensate for transportation costs.</p>

                <p>Because of the COVID‐19 pandemic, interviews were conducted via telephone. Two trained bilingual members of our CBPR partnership conducted the interviews in English (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 12) and Spanish (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 3). Interviews averaged 45 min in length. All Community Navigators provided written consent and were compensated $50 for participating in an interview. Human subject protection and oversight were provided by the Wake Forest University School of Medicine Institutional Review Board.</p>

                <p>All interviews were digitally recorded and transcribed. Constant comparison, an approach to grounded theory, was used to analyse interview data. Constant comparison combines qualitative coding with simultaneous comparison; initial observations are continually refined throughout data collection and analysis.<xref rid="hex13698-bib-0028" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> Three analysts read and reread interview transcripts, compared and contrasted content categories based on each analyst's interpretation of the data and identified emerging themes. After preliminary themes were developed, analysts came together with other CBPR partnership members via WebEx (a videoconferencing platform) in multiple meetings to discuss and reconcile final themes using an iterative process. Themes were also presented to the CAB in a meeting via WebEx for refinement and validation; CAB members were invited to respond to the themes and offered insights regarding themes that resonated with their own experiences and themes that they considered priorities for informing future efforts to improve the health of young GBMSM and transgender women of colour. At each stage in the analysis and interpretation process, a consensus approach was used, resolving discrepancies through discussion.</p>

                    <p>Community Navigators expressed that they valued serving as leaders and as resources to address social determinants of health within their communities. Among the Community Navigators, there was a common sense of intrinsic motivation to engage, be involved with and help their communities of identity—LGBTQ communities and communities of colour. Community Navigators reported that they were drawn to the <italic toggle="yes">Impact Triad</italic> intervention because of the opportunity to gain knowledge to share within their social networks and because they recognized the importance of both promoting sexual health and addressing social determinants that can make it difficult for community members to take care of their health. Community Navigators also appreciated that they made a genuine impact, which furthered their desire to continue being leaders within their social networks and communities. They felt pride in their roles as Community Navigators, saw themselves as fulfilling a need for social support within their communities, enjoyed building leadership skills that could potentially create opportunities for future careers (e.g., public speaking skills) and demonstrated a desire to continue utilizing the knowledge and training they received postintervention.</p>

                    <p>Community Navigators emphasized that being members of the communities in which they worked was fundamental to trust building and successful intervention implementation. Community Navigators had shared experiences and identities and felt a sense of belonging with others in their communities and were known and seen as leaders in their communities before becoming involved with <italic toggle="yes">Impact Triad</italic>. These connections led to increased initial levels of rapport with community members within Community Navigators' social networks, facilitated the process of recruiting social network members to participate in the intervention and were helpful for further building trust to have conversations about a wide array of health‐related topics.</p>

                    <p>Community Navigators reported that having official titles and roles that were linked to well‐known and well‐respected institutions (i.e., Wake Forest University School of Medicine and Triad Health Project, an established AIDS service organization in Greensboro, North Carolina), and having received formal training through these institutions, provided a sense of reassurance that helped to facilitate relationship building with members of their communities. As a consequence, Navigators felt more confident in their knowledge about sexual health and social determinants and perceived that they were more trusted to talk with others within the community about sensitive health topics. In addition, Community Navigators highlighted the importance of having a badge indicating their role in the intervention and emphasized that receiving a stipend for their time furthered their sense of legitimacy and validated the work they performed to assist their communities.</p>

                    <p>Community Navigators shared that being connected to the other Community Navigators across gender identities, sexual orientations and racial/ethnic identities increased a sense of belonging, resource sharing, creativity and problem solving. Community Navigators expressed that monthly meetings with the other Community Navigators and intervention coordinators were a time and place for growth because they brought together diverse experiences and perspectives and provided an opportunity to exchange ideas with one another, as well as discuss challenges and ways to overcome them. Navigators noted that it was valuable to know that other Community Navigators, including those with different gender identities, sexual orientations and/or racial/ethnic identities than their own, had found themselves in similar situations and to learn from one another. Thus, these conversations fostered an environment where Community Navigators felt welcome to express themselves and their ideas about promoting health within their communities through engagement and education. While each Community Navigator carried out helping activities independently with their social network members, the Community Navigators also worked as a team by providing social support to one another. These connections took place both in meetings and more informally in one‐on‐one interactions outside of meetings (including via social media) and continued after implementation ended.</p>

Many expressed a conviction to share the knowledge they had gained through the intervention, stressing that their social network members and other community members continued to come to them for information.

                    <p>Community Navigators shared that they had identified effective and innovative strategies to engage community members. Community Navigators utilized various strategies to reach the individuals within their social networks. At the beginning of intervention implementation, Community Navigators focused their recruitment efforts on social network members who they perceived as being more vulnerable or at risk and as needing social support and emphasized to these social network members the benefits of their participation. Through this process, Community Navigators were able to reach a broad range of individuals, including engaging nongay identifying MSM by building trust to overcome concerns about having their sexual behaviours exposed. In addition, Community Navigators used creative ways to share information about health and local resources through social media posts and by making in‐person events and gatherings as welcoming and comfortable environments as possible for social network members.</p>

                    <p>Community Navigators reported meeting social network members' prioritized needs by educating and supporting them to access and use local resources. Community Navigators noted that their role provided them with insight that allowed them to pinpoint needs and priorities within the community. Community Navigators were able to effectively link social network members with the resources they needed, which helped social network members stay engaged in the intervention. Through communication and interaction with social network members, Community Navigators identified and filled knowledge gaps and guided social network members to resources that would meet their needs related to social determinants (e.g., employment and education) and sexual health (e.g., how to access condoms and PrEP and how to make an appointment for STI or HIV screening).</p>

                    <p>Community Navigators emphasized that communicating about sexual health and addressing stigma and misinformation were difficult but overcome by building and nurturing trust. Many of the Community Navigators reported initial challenges in communication with social network members related to sensitive topics due to stigma and discomfort. Though Community Navigators had their social network members' trust more generally, they had to work on building further trust specifically around sexual health. To surpass this barrier, Community Navigators fostered an open and safe environment and worked to normalize talking about sexual health. To make social network members feel more comfortable, Community Navigators eased into conversations about sexual health, first starting with a topic that was less sensitive or emphasizing common experiences that the Community Navigators and social network members shared, including feelings of stigma. Social network members opened up to the Community Navigators and to one another over time, and conversations about sexual health happened more naturally over the course of intervention implementation as Community Navigators continued to promote a sense of community within their social networks.</p>

                    <p>Community Navigators described using social media to complement personal interaction to further facilitate dissemination of information and support. Community Navigators reported that personal interactions were an important part of the intervention because they provided a more personable approach, particularly during the early stages of implementation and when recruiting individuals within their social networks to participate. Social media was also an essential tool utilized by Community Navigators throughout the course of the intervention in addition to these personal interactions, and after the COVID‐19 pandemic began many Community Navigators adapted their interactions to rely solely on social media. Community Navigators posted on their social media accounts about resources or community events, and these posts benefited not only their immediate social network but also extended their reach to their social network members' larger networks and individuals whom they would not have interacted with otherwise. Expanding reach in these ways had a dual impact on Community Navigators' work by strengthening both their confidence as Community Navigators and their rapport within the community. In addition, Community Navigators noted other advantages of social media, including that it was a direct and instant form of communication between Community Navigators and social network members and, in some cases, made conversations about sensitive topics easier and more comfortable than in face‐to‐face communication.</p>

                    <p>Community Navigators considered important intervention successes to include increased awareness of prevalent health disparities and increased knowledge about sexual health and about resources to address disparities. Community Navigators expressed that, among their social networks, there was a general lack of awareness of how young GBMSM and transgender women of colour, and particularly those in the US South, were disproportionately affected by STIs and HIV and by social determinants such as unemployment. When educating social network members about these disparities many Community Navigators reported witnessing a ‘light bulb’ moment where social network members internalized information about sexual health and local employment and education resources.</p>
                    <p>Community Navigators also successfully promoted broader definitions of sexual health, noting that within their communities sexual health had typically been equated with condom use or abstinence only. Through participating in <italic toggle="yes">Impact Triad</italic>, Community Navigators and members of their social networks came to understand sexual health as also involving screening for STIs and HIV, access to treatment and other prevention strategies such as PrEP.</p>

                    <p>Community Navigators reported that the COVID‐19 pandemic hindered implementation and impacted Community Navigators in various ways. Because of the need for physical distancing, social media became the primary way the Community Navigators communicated with their social network members. Through social media Community Navigators maintained contact with their social networks, but Community Navigators expressed that members of their social networks felt isolated from one another. The connectedness Community Navigators fostered within their social network groups was reduced by the pandemic. In‐person interactions were postponed, and the closeness and ‘spirit’ or morale of the groups were negatively affected. Furthermore, Community Navigators faced additional challenges teaching social network members about certain sexual health topics such as how to correctly use condoms when they could not carry out these activities in person. However, Community Navigators were resilient and adapted quickly to utilizing social media to continue to maintain relationships with participants and engage and teach them.</p>

              <p>Analysis of in‐depth interviews with the <italic toggle="yes">Impact Triad</italic> Community Navigators both highlighted the ways that intersecting factors magnify health risks among GBMSM and transgender women of colour and illustrated the strengths of the intervention in raising awareness and disseminating information pertaining to sexual health and social determinants of health. One of the greatest contributing factors to the success of the <italic toggle="yes">Impact Triad</italic> intervention was the Community Navigators' ability to forge and nurture connections and relationships with members of their social networks and then build on this foundation to discuss sensitive topics with confidence and increase awareness, knowledge and use of local resources among these social network members. This finding aligns with existing literature that points to the potential of community‐based peer navigators to reach marginalized communities affected by health disparities and to connect community members to services because community‐based peer navigators understand community needs and strengths on a personal level and reflect the ways that members of their communities communicate and interact.<xref rid="hex13698-bib-0029" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref>, <xref rid="hex13698-bib-0030" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref>, <xref rid="hex13698-bib-0031" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> The desire expressed by Community Navigators to sustain their work to continue to improve the overall health of their communities further illustrates the potential impact of the intervention.</p>
              <p>Another factor playing a role in the success of <italic toggle="yes">Impact Triad</italic> was the Community Navigators' flexibility and ability to pivot and adapt to the unprecedented circumstances brought by the onset of the COVID‐19 pandemic. Initially, Community Navigators' interactions with members of their social networks included in‐person communication, which suddenly became no longer possible during the early phases of the pandemic. Adapting to the pandemic led to increased integration and utilization of social media platforms to cultivate and strengthen relationships. Shifting to an entirely virtual implementation of <italic toggle="yes">Impact Triad</italic> modified previous perceptions of how to connect with individuals and was consistent with documented changes in the ways in which networks provide social support in the context of COVID‐19 with shifts away from physical interaction and toward the use of technology.<xref rid="hex13698-bib-0032" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> In some ways, these changes increased accessibility, allowing Community Navigators to overcome logistical barriers to engagement based on locations, schedules and work demands; these learnings could also greatly benefit research efforts in rural and other more isolated communities. However, restrictions due to COVID‐19 did affect camaraderie among Community Navigators and members of their social networks. Community Navigators noted that there was a personal aspect of face‐to‐face contact that social media could not replicate. Nonetheless, our findings demonstrate that the versatility of social media is a major asset in conducting intervention research. Other intervention studies in recent years have reported making similar adaptations due to COVID‐19,<xref rid="hex13698-bib-0033" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref>, <xref rid="hex13698-bib-0034" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref>, <xref rid="hex13698-bib-0035" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref> and future studies should continue to explore ways to achieve the connection typically built and reinforced through in‐person interaction in a virtual setting.</p>
              <p>Interviews also identified implications for future iterations of the <italic toggle="yes">Impact Triad</italic> intervention to seek to further address and improve the quality of life among young GBMSM and transgender women of colour. A common thread across Community Navigators' experiences involved the intricate ways that interconnected social determinants impact health. To have a more profound impact, future efforts can expand the domains of resources and education provided by Community Navigators by incorporating into Community Navigator training information on how to address needs such as housing, food insecurity, transportation and others, in addition to employment, education, social support and discrimination. Furthermore, leveraging the experiences of existing Community Navigators to provide mentorship and support to future Community Navigators can lead to an increasingly cohesive group dynamic and greater community capacity. For example, future Community Navigator trainings and monthly meetings could include components in which Community Navigators from previous cohorts are present to share their experiences, offer ‘tips’, and answer questions from new Community Navigators.</p>

                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p>It is possible that social desirability bias could have influenced Community Navigators' responses to interview items. Given that interview data were collected and analysed by members of our CBPR partnership that had developed and implemented the <italic toggle="yes">Impact Triad</italic> intervention, Community Navigators may have felt inclined to describe <italic toggle="yes">Impact Triad</italic> and their experiences with the intervention in ways that were positive and less comfortable sharing constructive criticism or difficulties they had faced as part of <italic toggle="yes">Impact Triad</italic>. We tried to mitigate this possibility and encourage open and honest responses by ensuring confidentiality and emphasizing that there were no right or wrong answers and that Community Navigators were experts in their own experiences. Furthermore, interviews were conducted by CBPR partnership members who were not directly responsible for training and supporting the Community Navigators.</p>

              <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
              <p>These interviews identified important learnings about serving as Community Navigators and implementing <italic toggle="yes">Impact Triad</italic> and provided information to guide future efforts to address STI and HIV disparities and critical social determinants of health through community‐based peer navigation. Further research is warranted given that community‐based peer navigation remains an understudied yet promising approach to health promotion and disease prevention among communities and populations experiencing health disparities.</p>
