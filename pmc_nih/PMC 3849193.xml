              <abstract>
                <p>The translation of <italic>in vitro</italic> findings to clinical outcomes is often elusive. Trauma/hemorrhagic shock (T/HS) results in hepatic hypoxia that drives inflammation. We hypothesize that <italic>in silico</italic> methods would help bridge <italic>in vitro</italic> hepatocyte data and clinical T/HS, in which the liver is a primary site of inflammation. Primary mouse hepatocytes were cultured under hypoxia (1% O<sub>2</sub>) or normoxia (21% O<sub>2</sub>) for 1–72 h, and both the cell supernatants and protein lysates were assayed for 18 inflammatory mediators by Luminex™ technology. Statistical analysis and data-driven modeling were employed to characterize the main components of the cellular response. Statistical analyses, hierarchical and k-means clustering, Principal Component Analysis, and Dynamic Network Analysis suggested MCP-1/CCL2 and IL-1α as central coordinators of hepatocyte-mediated inflammation in C57BL/6 mouse hepatocytes. Hepatocytes from MCP-1-null mice had altered dynamic inflammatory networks. Circulating MCP-1 levels segregated human T/HS survivors from non-survivors. Furthermore, T/HS survivors with elevated early levels of plasma MCP-1 post-injury had longer total lengths of stay, longer intensive care unit lengths of stay, and prolonged requirement for mechanical ventilation vs. those with low plasma MCP-1. This study identifies MCP-1 as a main driver of the response of hepatocytes <italic>in vitro</italic> and as a biomarker for clinical outcomes in T/HS, and suggests an experimental and computational framework for discovery of novel clinical biomarkers in inflammatory diseases.</p>

              <p>Among many other functions, the liver plays a critical role in inflammation and innate immunity, processes that are controlled by multiple cell types including hepatocytes, Kupffer cells, and other non-parenchymal cells. Although at least 15 different cell types can be found in normal liver <xref rid="pone.0079804-Malarkey1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, hepatocytes constitute the largest pool of parenchymal cells, comprising approximately 60–80% of the total liver cells <xref rid="pone.0079804-Malarkey1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079804-Baratta1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Inflammatory conditions such as ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) and post-trauma hemorrhagic shock (T/HS) are associated with liver hypoxia <xref rid="pone.0079804-McCloskey1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079804-Kan1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. It is now accepted that hypoxia is not merely an outcome of the inflammatory response, but rather is a key driver of the development of inflammation through the regulation of O<sub>2</sub>-dependent signal transduction and gene expression <xref rid="pone.0079804-Johnson1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079804-Safronova1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p>
              <p>Mathematical and computational (<italic>in silico</italic>) methods have emerged as adjuncts to <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> studies of acute inflammation <xref rid="pone.0079804-Vodovotz1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. For example, we have recently applied both mechanistic and data-driven computational modeling to help define the dynamic, multi-dimensional inflammatory response to T/HS <italic>in vivo</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0079804-Chow1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0079804-Mi1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. The goal of the present study was to determine if combined <italic>in vitro</italic>/<italic>in silico</italic> studies could help elucidate key hepatic inflammatory mediators relevant to human T/HS. This study identifies the chemokine Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1 (MCP-1/CCL2) as a main driver of the response of hepatocytes <italic>in vitro</italic> and as a biomarker for organ damage in clinical settings of T/HS, and, more generally, suggests a pathway for combined experimental and computational studies to facilitate the discovery of novel clinical biomarkers of inflammation.</p>

                <title>MCP-1 is a central component of the dynamic, multi-dimensional response of hepatocytes to cell stress</title>
                <p>To assess the response of hepatocytes to hypoxia, primary wild-type mouse hepatocytes were subjected to 1% O<sub>2</sub> for 1–72 h, and 18 mouse cytokines were measured in both the supernatant and whole-cell lysate. Hepatocytes cultured under normoxic (21% O<sub>2</sub>) conditions served as controls. One-way ANOVA showed that, in normoxic hepatocytes, MCP-1, KC, and IP-10 (in lysates) and MCP-1, KC, and MIG (in supernatants) were altered significantly (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0079804-t001"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>). In hypoxic hepatocytes, the significantly altered mediators were MCP-1, MIG, IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-10, and IL-13 (in lysates) and MCP-1, IP-10, IL-1α, and VEGF (in supernatants). Thus, <bold>MCP-1</bold> was the only mediator that exhibited significant changes in all four conditions examined, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079804-g001"><bold>Fig. 1A</bold></xref>.</p>

                    <p>Freshly isolated hepatocytes from C57BL/6 (wild-type) mice were cultured under normoxic (control, 21% O<sub>2</sub>, open symbols) or hypoxic (1% O<sub>2</sub>, closed symbols) conditions for 1–72 h as described in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4"><italic>Materials and Methods</italic></xref>. Both lysates and supernatants were assayed for 18 mouse inflammatory mediators using the Luminex xMAP technology and the measurements were normalized for protein content as indicated.

The insets show the levels of MCP-1 in hypoxia samples. (<bold>B</bold>) Hierarchical clustering over fold changes in wild-type hepatocytes (normoxia vs. hypoxia): Fold change values for each inflammatory mediator are represented in heat maps, ranging from large negative (green) to large positive values (red). No changes (zero values) changes are represented in black (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4"><italic>Materials and Methods</italic></xref>). (<bold>C</bold>) Comparison between meta-clustering analysis outcomes in normoxia and hypoxia (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4"><italic>Materials and Methods</italic></xref>). The shading of the boxes indicates the grouping of mediators that exhibited the same segregation pattern across all methods. For each experimental condition (NL, HL, NS and HS), only the mediators appearing in each consensus are shown. For comparison between experimental conditions only mediators common to both consensuses are shown. The consensus clusters characterize the cellular response and were derived from hierarchical clustering (mediators with similar dynamic trajectories) and from PCA (mediators with the strongest covariance with other mediators).</p>

                <title>Hierarchical Clustering and Principal Component Analysis reveal key differences in inflammatory mediator production/release in the hepatocyte response to cell stress</title>
                <p>In order to address the question of which groups of mediators exhibit similar dynamics in normoxic and hypoxic hepatocytes, we performed hierarchical clustering on fold changes for each mediator at each pair of consecutive time points. We examined both raw values and fold change values for all mediators over each time interval. Each inflammatory mediator's values over time made up its dynamic pattern of expression and release. To identify those inflammatory mediators that showed similar production or secretion behavior, these patterns were then compared and grouped using hierarchical clustering, with inflammatory mediators in the resulting dendrogram ordered according to their membership in the clusters that emerged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079804-g001"><bold>Fig. 1B</bold></xref>).</p>
                <p>We also sought to determine the subset of mediators that evolve dynamically in a manner that is most characteristic of the response to normoxia or hypoxia, respectively. Inflammatory mediators that have similar patterns of covariance have similar loadings onto principal components, and so would be expected to project in a similar direction in principal component space. We therefore used the angle of an inflammatory mediator's projection into principal component space as the basis of a distance metric in k-means clustering (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0079804.s001">Figures S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0079804.s002">S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0079804.s003">S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0079804.s004">S4</xref>)</bold>. This analysis suggested that, despite an overlap in common mediators, k-means clustering could differentiate normoxia from hypoxia and lysates from supernatants. Furthermore, MCP-1 and KC were generally grouped together and were the predominant mediators along the first principal component.</p>

                <title>A predominant role for MCP-1, KC, and IL-1α in the hepatocyte response to stress inferred from Dynamic Network Analysis</title>
                <p>We sought to determine the consensus of the three aforementioned, independent clustering experiments. If the cluster memberships were similar, then those mediators that did not segregate consistently across different clusterings could be treated as noise. In contrast, those inflammatory mediators that consistently segregated together were considered as mediators exhibiting similar or correlated dynamic trajectories. We first calculated an Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) <xref rid="pone.0079804-Hubert1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0079804-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> to quantify the degree to which any two clustering results were in agreement. This comparison (see <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0079804.s009">Figures S9</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0079804.s010">S10</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0079804.s011">S11</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0079804.s012">S12</xref></bold>) resulted in a “consensus clustering” showing the inflammatory mediators that exhibited the same segregation pattern across all analysis methods, suggesting that MCP-1 and KC segregate together across all experimental conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079804-g001"><bold>Fig. 1C</bold></xref>).</p>
                <p>This meta-clustering analysis suggested groups of inflammatory mediators with similar dynamic patterns. We next performed Dynamic Network Analysis (DyNA) <xref rid="pone.0079804-Mi1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> to suggest mediators that appear to be “hubs” (or most connected to other mediators). (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079804-g002"><bold>Figs. 2A–B</bold></xref>

The total number of dynamic network connections is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079804-g002"><bold>Fig. 2C</bold></xref>. Based on DyNA, MCP-1 and KC were the most connected mediators across all time points in normoxia supernatants, and at 24–72 h in normoxia lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079804-g002"><bold>Fig. 2A</bold></xref>). In hypoxia, the most connected inflammatory mediators were IL-1α and VEGF in supernatants and IL-1α and MIP-1α in lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079804-g002"><bold>Fig. 2B</bold></xref>). Overall, the most connected inflammatory mediators were MCP-1 and IL-1α, with MCP-1 being the only highly-connected node present in all experimental conditions examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079804-g002"><bold>Fig. 2C</bold></xref>).</p>

                <p>We next carried out DyNA of lysates and supernatants from normoxic and hypoxic MCP-1<sup>−/−</sup> hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079804-g004"><bold>Figs. 4A–C</bold></xref>
<bold>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0079804.s018">Figure S18</xref></bold>). This analysis suggested a significant decrease in the number of connections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079804-g004"><bold>Figs. 4A–B</bold></xref>) in both lysates and supernatants of normoxic cells, and in hypoxia supernatants, as compared to wild-type hepatocytes (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079804-g002"><bold>Figs. 2A–B</bold></xref>). In supernatants of normoxic MCP-1<sup>−/−</sup> hepatocytes, KC was the most significantly changed mediator (though with nearly zero connections across all time points; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079804-g004"><bold>Fig. 4A</bold></xref>), whereas in supernatants of hypoxic MCP-1<sup>−/−</sup> hepatocytes this chemokine was a central node with one connection only at 24–72 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079804-g004"><bold>Fig. 4B</bold></xref>). In lysates from normoxic MCP-1<sup>−/−</sup> hepatocytes, IL-6 was the most significantly changed mediator, but with zero connections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079804-g004"><bold>Fig. 4A</bold></xref>). However, this cytokine was the most connected mediator (along with IFN-γ) in hypoxia lysates at all-time intervals after 6 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079804-g004"><bold>Fig. 4B</bold></xref>). DyNA suggested a clear reduction in the total number of dynamic connections among inflammatory mediators in MCP-1<sup>−/−</sup> cells, with IL-6 being the most connected mediator (but only in hypoxia lysates; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079804-g004"><bold>Fig. 4C</bold></xref>).</p>

                <title>IL-6 expression and release is reduced in MCP-1<sup>−/−</sup> hepatocytes</title>
                <p>Because one-way ANOVA and DyNA revealed that the most significant changes in inflammatory mediator production and release were observed for MCP-1 and IL-6, we hypothesized that MCP-1 would affect IL-6 expression and release in stressed hepatocytes. IL-6 levels were significantly lower in both normoxia lysates and supernatants of MCP-1<sup>−/−</sup> hepatocytes as compared to normoxic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079804-g005"><bold>Fig. 5A–B</bold></xref>) and hypoxic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079804-g005"><bold>Fig. 5C–D</bold></xref>) wild-type controls.

                <p>MCP-1 also appeared to coordinate stress-induced production of mediators including IL-6 (see above), and IL-6 has been identified consistently as a marker of negative outcomes in T/HS <xref rid="pone.0079804-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079804-Maier1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Accordingly, we next evaluated the potential of plasma MCP-1 levels as a biomarker for morbidity in a separate cohort of survivors of blunt trauma. A cohort of 31 hypotensive patients was matched with 31 normotensive patients (all survivors). Plotting IL-6 vs. MCP-1 plasma concentrations for the trauma patient cohort as a whole (n = 62) suggested that circulating IL-6 levels in these patients could be segregated into two groups based on circulating MCP-1 levels: low MCP-1 (&lt;1000 pg/ml) and high MCP-1 (&gt;1500 pg/ml, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079804-g007"><bold>Figs. 7B–C</bold></xref>). Furthermore, analysis of the data showed a positive correlation between MCP-1 and IL-6 in both normotensive (Pearson Product Moment correlation coefficient = 0.59, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079804-g007"><bold>Fig. 7B</bold></xref>) and hypotensive (0.41, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079804-g007"><bold>Fig. 7C</bold></xref>) blunt trauma patients. The <italic>P</italic> values associated with these correlation coefficients were highly significant (5.16×10<sup>−17</sup> and 0.000047 for normotensive and hypotensive blunt trauma patients, respectively).</p>
                <p>We then performed a different grouping irrespective of blood pressure status, based solely on MCP-1 concentrations (&lt;1000 pg/ml vs. &gt;1500 pg/ml). This grouping reduced the study cohort to 46 T/HS patients. T/HS patients with lower circulating MCP-1 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079804-g007"><bold>Fig. 7D</bold></xref>; 400.54±15.75 pg/ml; range: 12.13–991.67 pg/ml [n = 38;]) have lower circulating IL-6 levels (106.14±8.07 pg/ml; range: 3.42–682.11 pg/ml [n = 38]) as compared to patients with higher circulating MCP-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079804-g007"><bold>Fig. 7E</bold></xref>; 4098.71±772.85 pg/ml; range: 1486.46–26112.26 pg/ml [n = 8]) who exhibited higher, though more variable circulating IL-6 levels (1457.67±391.23 pg/ml; range: 26.12–10582.37 pg/ml [n = 8]).</p>
                <p>Patients with higher circulating MCP-1 levels had worse outcomes, as indicated by a longer total length of stay (LOS), longer intensive care unit (ICU) LOS, and greater requirement for mechanical ventilation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079804-g007"><bold>Fig. 7F</bold></xref>).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Liver ischemia and subsequent reperfusion, which can occur in T/HS and resuscitation, lead to inflammatory liver injury as well as to the systemic elaboration of inflammatory mediators and subsequent multiple organ dysfunction <xref rid="pone.0079804-Peitzman1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079804-Frangogiannis1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079804-Saiman1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Liver hypoxia is a primary feature of HS in experimental models <xref rid="pone.0079804-McCloskey1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079804-Kan1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Hypoxic stress, however, is but one of a variety of stresses (e.g. endoplasmic reticulum stress and autophagy) encountered by hepatocytes in settings such as T/HS <xref rid="pone.0079804-Duvigneau1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> and I/R <xref rid="pone.0079804-Evankovich1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. We therefore reasoned that the analysis of synthesis and secretion of inflammatory mediators by stressed hepatocytes would help in our understanding of the pathophysiology of T/HS and other conditions characterized, at least in part, by hepatic stress.</p>
              <p>Our key finding is that a combined <italic>in vitro</italic>/<italic>in silico</italic> analysis of the dynamics of synthesis and secretion of multiple inflammatory mediators points to the chemokine MCP-1 as a central coordinator of the inflammatory response of stressed hepatocytes. Pursuing this <italic>in vitro</italic>/<italic>in silico</italic>-derived hypothesis allowed us to segregate blunt trauma patients based on circulating levels of MCP-1. Importantly, this segregation of patients would have proven ineffective if performed based solely on the patients' normotensive/hypotensive status post-injury.</p>
              <p>Chemokines are small cytokine-like, heparin-binding molecules help orchestrate immune and stem cell infiltration into the liver in response to both acute and chronic injuries <xref rid="pone.0079804-Frangogiannis1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079804-Sahin1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Hepatic chemokines are released during inflammatory injury (infection, drug intoxication), and play a key role in the activation and proliferation of liver-resident cells (including hepatocytes, stellate cells, and endothelial cells). In our studies, multiple chemokines were synthesized with diverse time courses by stressed hepatocytes. Though chemokines are often thought to be highly redundant in their actions, MCP-1 was the only mediator that exhibited significant changes in both normoxia and hypoxia, and in both cell lysates (denoting cellular expression) and supernatants (denoting secretion by cells). Our findings of perturbed dynamic inflammatory networks in MCP-1<sup>−/−</sup> mice supports the hypothesis that this chemokine plays a central, driving role in the hepatocyte response to stress. The apparently incomplete elimination of MCP-1 (or presence of a protein highly-homologous to MCP-1) in MCP-1<sup>−/−</sup> cells raises the possibility that the actual effects of MCP-1 on coordinating inflammation might be even more pronounced than those we observed in these studies.</p>
              <p>MCP-1 (CCL2) was first identified as a monocyte-specific chemoattractant, and was later shown to attract memory T lymphocytes and NK cells. Binding to its seven-transmembrane G-protein-coupled receptor CCR2 (CC chemokine receptor 2) results in signaling events that lead to the recruitment of monocytes in a variety of <italic>in vivo</italic> experimental models of infection and injury <xref rid="pone.0079804-Charo1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079804-Hildebrand1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. In addition to recruiting monocytes, MCP-1 can also activate macrophages and endothelial cells and has been implicated in the attraction of neutrophils and the generation of neutrophil-dependent tissue damage <xref rid="pone.0079804-Hildebrand1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Lu <italic>et al.</italic> showed that despite normal numbers of circulating leukocytes and resident macrophages, MCP-1<sup>−/−</sup> mice were specifically unable to recruit monocytes 72 h after intraperitoneal thioglycollate administration, indicating that MCP-1 is essential for monocyte recruitment and the expression of cytokines related to T helper responses <italic>in vivo</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0079804-Lu1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>.</p>
              <p>MCP-1 can be upregulated in the liver <italic>in vivo</italic> by I/R <xref rid="pone.0079804-Yamaguchi1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> as well as by bacterial endotoxin <xref rid="pone.0079804-Barclay1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, and in isolated mouse hepatocytes by hypoxia <xref rid="pone.0079804-Laurens1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> and the present study). The expression of MCP-1 in normoxic, primary cultured hepatocytes was thought to be due to the stress of cell isolation <xref rid="pone.0079804-Wang2" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, and we likewise found elevated MCP-1 in normoxic hepatocytes. The effects of MCP-1 in the liver range from protective (e.g. in experimental acetaminophen-induced injury) to detrimental (e.g. during experimental I/R injury) <xref rid="pone.0079804-Laurens1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.</p>
              <p>In addition to MCP-1, our studies suggest that IL-1α, IL-6, KC, and MIG exhibit the most significant dynamic changes in stressed hepatocytes. Our results suggest that MCP-1 regulates the production of these other inflammatory mediators. This hypothesis is supported by prior studies, in which the expression of hepatic pro-inflammatory cytokines (including IL-6 and KC) was induced in alcohol-fed wild-type, but inhibited in MCP-1<sup>−/−</sup> animals <xref rid="pone.0079804-Mandrekar1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. In support of this central role for KC, Frink <italic>et al</italic> showed that neutralization of this chemokine ameliorated liver damage after T/HS in mice. These authors also showed that MCP-1 causes organ damage via upregulation of KC, supporting our findings of a network of hepatic inflammation that involves these two chemokines. However, the exact source of KC remained unknown <xref rid="pone.0079804-Frink1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>; our present study suggests that hepatocytes are a key source of this chemokine.</p>
              <p>Multiple studies have shown that IL-6 is a biomarker for adverse outcomes in settings such as trauma/hemorrhage and sepsis and specifically of poor outcome in trauma <xref rid="pone.0079804-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079804-Maier1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. This was reflected in our own clinical cohort, since we could segregate survivors from non-survivors based on plasma IL-6 levels. Importantly, our studies suggest that IL-6 is highly correlated with MCP-1 in T/HS patients, and that the production of IL-6 by hypoxic hepatocytes was essentially abolished in the absence of endogenous MCP-1. Taken together, our studies suggest that MCP-1 drives IL-6 production by hepatocytes. Interestingly, a recent study suggests the presence of a positive feedback loop involving IL-6 and MCP-1 in a setting of vascular inflammation <xref rid="pone.0079804-Tieu1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>.</p>
              <p>The use of applied mathematical models and algorithms constitute a novel tool for interpreting complex biological data. In 2005, a pioneering study in this field reported on a systems model comprising a large number of intracellular signaling events directly linked to outputs associated with apoptosis, created in order to study how molecular information is processed as a network <xref rid="pone.0079804-Janes1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Prior studies have also utilized advanced computational analyses to discern key features of the inflammatory biology of hepatocytes. For example, Alexopoulos <italic>et al</italic> studied 26,000 protein state measurements from isolated primary human hepatocytes and HepG2 liver cancer cells exposed to growth factors or inflammatory mediators, yielding interaction graphs using multilinear regression <xref rid="pone.0079804-Alexopoulos1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. The authors suggested major differences between primary and transformed hepatocytes with respect to Toll-like receptor-4 signaling and NF-κB-dependent secretion of chemokines and cytokines, and suggested, as we do here, that combined <italic>in vitro</italic>/<italic>in silico</italic> analyses can yield novel insights into hepatocyte biology <xref rid="pone.0079804-Alexopoulos1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. More recently, Boolean logic models of immediate-early signaling in liver cells were created by training a literature-based prior knowledge network against biochemical data obtained from primary human hepatocytes as well as four hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines exposed to combinations of cytokines and small-molecule kinase inhibitors <xref rid="pone.0079804-SaezRodriguez1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Our present study extends this paradigm to define key nodes in the stress-induced inflammatory networks induced in hepatocytes, as well as suggesting higher-order, clinically-applicable insights. Indeed, this study points to various similarities between hepatocytes <italic>in vitro</italic> and T/HS <italic>in vivo</italic>. For example, as in the present study, we found that, together with MIG, IL-6 was highly elevated but disconnected from other inflammatory mediators comprising a dynamic network of inflammation induced by experimental T/HS in mice <xref rid="pone.0079804-Mi1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Our present study raises the possibility that MCP-1 is the stimulus for post-HS MIG and IL-6.</p>
              <p>In the present study, we developed a novel algorithm for consensus clustering of multiple data-driven analyses of dynamic responses. We hypothesized that those inflammatory mediators exhibiting the most coordination across experimental conditions could be important drivers or indicators of that process. The strategy we employed was to extract patterns from dynamic data, and to assess the measure of similarity across multiple dynamic patterns. To distill the most important information from three independent clustering results over 18 mediators for each of 4 experimental conditions, we filtered the results by discarding inflammatory mediators that showed inconsistent segregation patterns across the three analyses. A consensus clustering containing only the mediators whose coordination patterns in which we could be most confident was the basis of comparison across experimental conditions. This method identified MCP-1 as the most relevant mediator in our studies.</p>
              <p>This novel approach to data-driven modeling helped formulate a key hypothesis of our study, namely that circulating levels of MCP-1 could serve as a biomarker for mortality in human trauma/hemorrhage, and that the outcomes of trauma survivors would differ in high- vs. low-producers of MCP-1. Importantly, our results suggest that circulating levels of MCP-1 are better discriminators of outcome in our moderately-injured blunt trauma survivors than hypotension. This, despite the fact that even a brief period of hypotension was suggested to elevate post-trauma morbidity and mortality in injured patients <xref rid="pone.0079804-Zenati1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Collectively, our results provide a systems view of the hepatocyte inflammatory response to cell stress, with implications for ischemia and hemorrhage, and point to hepatocytes as a likely cellular source of cytokines/chemokines in the inflammatory response. Furthermore, these results highlight the capacity of data-driven analyses for suggesting novel, clinically-relevant targets.</p>

                <p>Before the statistical analyses and in order to account for experimental variability in cell number and protein concentration between individual experiments, the final mediator concentrations adjusted for protein content (C<sc>f</sc>) were obtained from the Luminex analysis for each individual mediator measurement (C) and its respective lysate protein concentration (as determined by BCA, see above) using the following formulas:<disp-formula id="pone.0079804.e001"><graphic xlink:href="pone.0079804.e001.jpg" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></disp-formula>The final mediator concentrations (C<sc>f</sc>) are thus expressed in pg/mg total protein, where the supernatant volume (V<sc>sn</sc>) and lysis buffer volume (V<sc>l</sc>) values used were as follows: 60 mm Petri dish (3×10<sup>6</sup> cells, V<sc>sn</sc> = 3 ml, V<sc>l</sc> = 200 µl) and 100 mm Petri dish (5×10<sup>6</sup> cells, V<sc>sn</sc> = 5 ml, V<sc>l</sc> = 400 µl).</p>
                <p>Experimental data are presented as mean ± SEM. Analysis was performed by <italic>t</italic>- test, One-way or Two-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) followed by the Holm-Sidak <italic>post-hoc</italic> test as indicated. Significance of differences in clinical outcomes was determined by Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test using SigmaPlot (Systat Software, San Jose, CA).</p>
                <p>Before any dynamic analysis, the final mediator concentrations (C<sc>f</sc>) were first normalized for each inflammatory mediator, so that all mediator levels were converted into the same scale (from 0 to 1). All measurements of a given inflammatory mediator from a single animal were normalized as a group, by dividing each value by the Euclidean norm of the group. In this way, any artifactual effects on variance due to the different ranges of concentration observed for different mediators were eliminated.</p>

                <p>Fold change values were calculated by dividing the difference between the later (x<sub>2</sub>) and earlier (x<sub>1</sub>) mediator values by the earlier value: (x<sub>2</sub>-x<sub>1</sub>)/x<sub>1</sub>; we avoided division by 0 by replacing x<sub>1</sub> with a very small number (10<sup>−5</sup>) when necessary. The columns of the dendrogram contained the mean of fold changes across all animals. We employed several MatLab® functions to carry out this analysis: <italic>linkage</italic>, with average link and Pearson correlation distance, and <italic>cluster</italic> was used to find 2–4 clusters in both fold change and raw data (mediator concentrations adjusted for protein content vs. time, unaveraged, all animals included).</p>

                <title>Meta-clustering</title>
                <p>The Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) was first calculated pairwise between clustering results including 2, 3, or 4 principal components, choosing the result that captured the most information with the fewest principal components. We then used ARI to compare hierarchical clustering results with k = 2, 3, and 4 to k-means clustering results with k = 2, 3 and 4 in a pairwise manner. The maximum Rand Index dictated the k of the hierarchical and k-means clustering results that were moved forward into further analysis. We compared PCA k-means clustering to each of fold change hierarchical clustering and raw data hierarchical clustering individually. The k was chosen for k-means clustering that maximized both ARI values. We then filtered the results by discarding inflammatory mediators that showed inconsistent segregation patterns across the three analyses. The basis of comparison across different experiments was a consensus clustering containing only the mediators for whose coordination patterns we had confidence, as shown in detail in <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0079804.s009">Figures S9</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0079804.s010">S10</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0079804.s011">S11</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0079804.s012">S12</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0079804.s013">S13</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0079804.s014">S14</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0079804.s015">S15</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0079804.s016">S16</xref></bold>. Briefly, a block of data was constructed with one mediator in each row and its corresponding cluster label for each of the three results in the columns using Microsoft Excel®. Sorting this block of data by each of the cluster label columns successively allowed us to compare the memberships of clusters across the three results and to identify corresponding clusters between results. These were clusters that contained a common set of mediators across all three results. We used the following heuristic to determine consensus: once a cluster from one result was associated with clusters from the other results, (e.g. Cluster A from Raw Data was associated with Cluster 2 from Fold Change and Cluster IV from PCA clustering) it could not be associated with any other clusters. For example Cluster 1 could not associate with both Cluster A and Cluster B. Mediators that did not segregate into corresponding clusters across all results were deemed inconsistent and omitted from the consensus clustering result. This consensus outcome became the basis of comparison among experimental conditions (see <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0079804.s009">Figures S9</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0079804.s010">S10</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0079804.s011">S11</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0079804.s012">S12</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0079804.s013">S13</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0079804.s014">S14</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0079804.s015">S15</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0079804.s016">S16</xref></bold>).</p>

                <p>All human sampling was done following approval by the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Review Board and written informed consent was obtained from each patient or next of kin as per Institutional Review Board regulations. From a cohort of 493 blunt trauma patients admitted to Presbyterian University Hospital (part of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center), we selected two cohorts of blunt trauma patients (all ≥18 years old). Exclusion criteria included: life expectancy &lt;24 h, penetrating trauma only, and traumatic brain injury. The first cohort included 30 trauma patients separated into two groups: 15 survivors (mean age: 60.5±3.7 years, range: 43–86 years, mean ISS: 24.5±2.8, range: 9–50), and 15 non-survivors (mean age: 59.5±4.9 years, range: 25–86 years, mean ISS: 24.8±2.3, range: 10–38). The second cohort included 62 patients (all survivors) separated into two groups matched on age, gender, and Injury Severity Score (ISS): 31 normotensive patients (19 males and 12 females; systolic blood pressure &gt;90 mmHg, mean age: 44.4±2.2 years, range: 24–75 years, mean ISS: 23.5±1.3, range: 10–38), matched with 31 hypotensive patients (19 males and 12 females; systolic blood pressure &lt;90 mmHg, duration of hypotension post-injury: 8±1 h, range: 2–21 h, mean age: 45.1±3.4 years, range: 20–89 years, mean ISS: 23.5±2.2, range: 4–54). One to four blood plasma samples per patient were collected within the first 24 h post-injury, followed by additional sampling at 48, 72, and 96 h. All blood samples were stored at −80°C until analysis. MCP-1 and IL-6 were measured using the Luminex™ 100 IS system and the Human 25-plex® Luminex™ beadset (BioSource, now Invitrogen) or the Milliplex™ MAP kit (Millipore, Billerica, MA).</p>
