                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Synovial sarcoma (SS) and myxoid/round cell liposarcoma (MRCL) are ideal solid tumors for the development of adoptive cellular therapy (ACT) targeting NY-ESO-1, as a high frequency of tumors homogeneously express this cancer-testes antigen. Data from early phase clinical trials have shown antitumor activity after the adoptive transfer of NY-ESO-1–specific T cells. In these studies, persistence of NY-ESO-1 specific T cells is highly correlated with response to ACT, but patients often continue to have detectable transferred cells in their peripheral blood following progression.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Method</title>
                  <p>We performed a phase I clinical trial evaluating the safety of NY-ESO-1–specific endogenous T cells (ETC) following cyclophosphamide conditioning. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from treated patients were evaluated by flow cytometry and gene expression analysis as well as through ex vivo culture assays with and without IL-15.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Four patients were treated in a cohort using ETC targeting NY-ESO-1 following cyclophosphamide conditioning. Treatment was well tolerated without significant toxicity, but all patients ultimately had disease progression. In two of four patients, we obtained post-treatment tumor tissue and in both, NY-ESO-1 antigen was retained despite clear detectable persisting NY-ESO-1–specific T cells in the peripheral blood. Despite a memory phenotype, these persisting cells lacked markers of proliferation or activation. However, in ex vivo culture assays, they could be induced to proliferate and kill tumor using IL-15. These results were also seen in PBMCs from two patients who received gene-engineered T-cell receptor–based products at other centers.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>ETC targeting NY-ESO-1 with single-agent cyclophosphamide alone conditioning was well tolerated in patients with SS and those with MRCL. IL-15 can induce proliferation and activity in persisting NY-ESO-1–specific T cells even in patients with disease progression following ACT. These results support future work evaluating whether IL-15 could be incorporated into ACT trials post-infusion or at the time of progression.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Synovial sarcoma (SS) and myxoid/round cell liposarcoma (MRCL) have poor clinical outcomes in the advanced setting, but may be ideal solid tumors for the development of adoptive cellular therapy (ACT) as they express the NY-ESO-1 target antigen with uniquely high frequency and homogeneity.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1–3</xref> Multiple trials have demonstrated response rates up to 50% using NY-ESO-1–specific T cells targeting the HLA A*0201 restricted NY-ESO-1<sub>157–165</sub> epitope in these malignancies; however, few responses have been complete or durable.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4–7</xref> In addition to engineering autologous T cells with an NY-ESO-1–specific TCR gene, we and others have used activated endogenous NY-ESO-1–specific T-cell response through novel vaccination strategies,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> as well as by culturing endogenous T cells (ETC) with NY-ESO-1 specificity from the peripheral blood ex vivo for infusion.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 10</xref>
</p>
              <p>Although persistence of adoptively transferred cells is a key prognostic factor following NY-ESO-1–targeted ATC,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> some patients develop progression despite continued presence of transferred T cells in the peripheral blood.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Furthermore, even patients without robust persistence do have rare persistent cells detectable by TCR sequencing.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4–6 11 12</xref> A cytokine therapy that could induce expansion of rare persistent NY-ESO-1–specific T cells post-infusion could make ACT more effective.</p>
              <p>Here, we present the results of a phase I, pilot cohort of patients with SS and those with MRCL treated with NY-ESO-1–specific ETC. These were non-engineered cells cultured from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), sorted using MHC tetramers and expanded ex vivo prior to infusion following high-dose cyclophosphamide (Cy). Although all patients ultimately had disease progression, rare persisting NY-ESO-1–specific T cells remained detectable in peripheral blood in each case. In two of the four patients, post-treatment tumor was obtained and, as we and other groups have previously observed,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 10</xref> NY-ESO-1 antigen was retained in both cases, suggesting that persisting T cells failed to recognise or respond to tumor antigen, or to persist at tumor sites. However, these cells could be induced to proliferate and kill tumor targets following ex vivo culture with IL-15. We confirmed that IL-15 also increased ex vivo activity of PBMCs from T-cell receptor (TCR)–engineered ACT trials performed at other centers.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 5</xref> These data suggest that systemic, post-infusion IL-15 warrants further exploration as a strategy to improve ACT.</p>

                <p>All patients provided informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The ETC trial (NCT04177021) was approved by the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC) Institutional Review Board (IRB). The primary objective was to assess the feasibility, safety and toxicity of treating of NY-ESO-1–specific ETC. Tolerability based on CTCAE V.4.0 was the primary endpoint. Response based on RECIST V.1.1 at 8–10 weeks and T-cell persistence based on tetramer (tet+) staining were secondary endpoints. Eligibility included advanced or metastatic SS or MRCL with at least one prior line of therapy, expression of HLA A*0201, ECOG performance status ≤1 and NY-ESO-1 expression in &gt;25% of tumor cells by immunohistochemistry (for complete eligibility criteria, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">online supplemental figure 1</xref>). Patients were labeled Cy1–Cy4 based on order of enrollment. Details regarding cell generation have been previously reported.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Baseline imaging was performed approximately 2 weeks prior to infusion and an additional scan was performed 4 weeks afterwards. After their 8–10 week scan, patients were followed per standard of care with additional research blood collections. The patient who received ACT at the NCI (labeled “NIH”) consented for a blood/tissue collection protocol registered with the FHCRC IRB. The patient treated at UCLA (labeled “UCLA”) provided informed consent at UCLA and de-identified PBMC was analyzed at FHCRC under an IRB-approved minimal risk study.</p>

                <p>Patient demographics are included in <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>. Four patients were treated with NY-ESO-1–specific ETC at target cell doses of 10<sup>10</sup>/m<sup>2</sup> on day 0 after receiving Cy (2 g/m<sup>2</sup>/day ×2 days) on days −3 and −2 as lymphodepleting conditioning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1A</xref>). No unexpected, attributable toxicity was seen and all significant toxicity (grade ≥3) was attributed to Cy (complete toxicity data are included in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">online supplemental table 3</xref>). Patient Cy1 had small volume lung disease with only one RECIST-evaluable lesion with stable disease (SD), and slight regression from 11.5 mm to 10.9 mm following ACT. This lesion was resected 3 months after infusion allowing the patient to be free of detectable disease, but recurred after 1 year. Cy2 started with rapidly progressive disease (PD), but had a 20% reduction in a liver lesion at his 4-week scan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1B</xref>) with SD overall. Cy3 had rapidly progressing pulmonary metastases pre-treatment, with baseline imaging demonstrating 62% increase versus prior scan 2 months earlier. The 4-week post-ACT scan showed SD with some smaller tumors. A subsequent scan showed PD and the patient went on to receive chemotherapy and eventually metastatectomy. Cy4 had rapidly progressing bulky disease but had SD with some tumors regressing post-ACT and improvement in his pain allowing him to discontinue opioids (clinical summaries are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">online supplemental figure 2</xref>).</p>

                <p>For each patient, the frequency and number of CD8+NY-ESO-1 tet+ cells in PBMC peaked at week 2 and then decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1E and F</xref>) to low yet still detectable levels. In Cy1, whose tumor was resected 3 months after ACT, 2.9% of TIL were CD8+/tet+, 5× higher than in the PBMC at that time suggesting trafficking to the tumor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1G</xref>). The early peak of dominant transferred clones was confirmed in TCRβ sequencing of PBMC at 1 day, ~2 weeks, ~1 month and ~2 months post-ACT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1H</xref>). TCRβ sequencing was performed on tet+ cells sorted from similar time points. In Cy2 and Cy4 (Cy2 shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1I</xref>), the dominant clone in this tet+ sorted population remained dominant for at least 8–10 weeks. In Cy1 and Cy3, the dominant clone waned, and minority clones increased in frequency in the tet+ population (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">online supplemental figure 4</xref>).<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>

While few cells expressed PD-1, we also tested for Tim-3, an exhaustion marker that also suggests antigen experience (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">online supplemental figure 5</xref>), and there was a non-statistically significant trend toward higher expression on tet+ cells compared with tet− controls (most pronounced in Cy1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2C and D</xref>). Given that at least two patients retained NY-ESO-1 expression post-ACT, we expected to observe proliferation and expansion of persisting cells. However, Ki67 expression was much lower on tet+ cells compared with tet− controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2D</xref>) suggesting a lack of proliferation. We performed gene expression analysis on flow sorted tet+ cells from 1 day, ~2 weeks and ~2 months after infusion (phenotype of infusion products has been previously described).<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Gene sets related to TCR signaling, T-cell activation, cytotoxic capacity and IL-2 pathway were more highly expressed at week 2 compared with weeks 8–10 post-infusion suggesting that transferred T cells lacked TCR stimulation post-ACT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2E</xref>).</p>

                <p>Given that rare persisting cells failed to proliferate despite the presence of confirmed antigen-expressing tumor, we hypothesized that these cells might be stimulated with IL-15, which has been observed to stimulate inhibited memory T-cell populations.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> To test this, we cultured PBMCs from post-infusion samples with NY-ESO-1<sub>157–165</sub> peptide and low-dose IL-2 alone, or with IL-15. The addition of low-dose IL-15 led to a significant increase in expansion of tet+ cells compared with control group by day 9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3A</xref>). Although IL-15 also induced expansion of CD8+ cells, the expansion of tet+ cells was significantly higher (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3B</xref>).</p>
                <p>We also confirmed this effect in PBMCs from patients with SS treated with NY-ESO-1 TCR-engineered products at UCLA and the NIH who also had a low number of persisting tet+ cells.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 12</xref> We found that IL-15 expanded tet+ cells from tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) isolated from post-treatment biopsy from Cy1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3A</xref>). Neither anti-PD-1 nor higher doses of IL-15 further enhanced this effect (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">online supplemental figure 6</xref>). In patients Cy2 and Cy4, the effect of IL-15 in inducing T-cell expansion was higher in samples from intermediate time points compared with early or late time points suggesting that the effect of IL-15 may be time dependent for some patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3C</xref>).</p>

                <p>To test if IL-15 increased the effector function of T cells, we stimulated cells with NY-ESO-1<sub>157–165</sub> peptide following 9-day culture with IL-2 or with IL-2 and IL-15 and performed intracellular cytokine staining for IFNγ and TNFα. The number of cells positive for both IFNγ and TNFα was significantly higher in IL-15 supplemented cultures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">online supplemental figure 7</xref>), and we confirmed these results in samples from patients treated with TCR-engineered products at UCLA, and the NIH, as well as TIL from Cy1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3D</xref>).</p>
                <p>To more closely approximate in vivo biology, we performed T-cell tumor killing assays using a 3D culture system in which tumor cells and T cells are embedded in a collagen matrix lined by endothelial cells. Tet+ cells cultured with IL-15 had greater than twofold increase in their killing efficiency as compared with the control group. By 48 hours, the number of IL-15-treated tet+ cells were significantly higher than the control group, despite starting with the same number of cells suggesting that T cells continued to expand into the chips post-transfer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">online supplemental figure 8</xref>).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Here, we present a cohort of four patients with SS and MRCL who progressed following ETC targeting NY-ESO-1, despite detectable persistence of transferred T cells. Limitations to this study included the use of ex vivo cryopreserved samples, including TIL, which may have different phenotypic and functional properties compared with cells in vivo or freshly procured specimens. Although it is difficult to judge a cell therapy regimen based on only four patients, clinical responses were disappointing, possibly in part due to the absence of fludarabine conditioning which has been associated with improved responses following ACT in patients with SS treated with NY-ESO-1–specific T cells.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Both active national ACT trials testing TCR-modified cells in patients with SS (NCT03967223 and NCT04044768) are currently incorporating fludarabine into lymphodepletion as these prior studies suggest it may play a critical role.</p>
              <p>Increased lymphodepletion intensity and the addition of post-infusion IL-2 are established ways of modifying conditioning protocols to improve patient outcome, in part by increasing endogenously produced IL-7 and IL-15.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> However, it is important to recognize that nearly all patients with SS and MRCL who initially respond to ACT do not have complete responses and ultimately progress. There are also unique challenges for achieving sustainable T-cell trafficking and tumor recognition in SS and MRC, including the low levels of MHC class I expression and few infiltrating T cells in these tumors. Unfortunately, we could not address these issues here given this study’s small size.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> MHC expression and T-cell infiltration into these tumors can be increased by systemic IFNγ<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>; however, incorporation of cytokines into ACT regimens must be done with great care.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
</p>
              <p>Our data suggest that more could be done to support transferred T cells after the time of infusion, possibly using post-infusion IL-15, a cytokine known to support memory T cells.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> High IL-7 and IL-15 following lymphodepletion may aid responses for some patients, but as levels fall, transferred T cells may fall as well. Cellular products are being prepared in ways incorporating IL-15 during product expansion<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> and T-cell products releasing IL-15 or with membrane-tethered IL-15 for trans-presentation have been designed to augment in vivo proliferation and persistence.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Systemic IL-15 can be given safely, and could be incorporated into future ACT regimens either following cell transfer or planned prospectively for the time of progression.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24 25</xref>
