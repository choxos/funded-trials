              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Lung cancer is the leading cause of death from cancer in the United States, and smoking is the most important risk factor for developing and dying of lung cancer.<sup><xref rid="zoi190762r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190762r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> The National Lung Screening Trial<sup><xref rid="zoi190762r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> found 20% fewer lung cancer deaths among current and former heavy smokers screened using low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) compared with those screened with standard chest radiography.<sup><xref rid="zoi190762r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> However, screening rates nationally remain low.<sup><xref rid="zoi190762r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> In addition, lung cancer screening with LDCT is not without risks, including radiation exposure from screening and diagnostic imaging and a high false-positive rate leading to subsequent testing, which also is associated with harms.<sup><xref rid="zoi190762r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190762r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Guidelines about lung cancer screening are consistent in emphasizing the importance of patients making an informed decision within the context of receiving smoking cessation services for people who continue to smoke.<sup><xref rid="zoi190762r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190762r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190762r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190762r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190762r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190762r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190762r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190762r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) has financially covered lung cancer screening using LDCT since 2015, but the CMS guidelines require a patient counseling and shared decision-making visit using patient decision aids (PDAs) before screening referral.<sup><xref rid="zoi190762r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> The requirement to use PDAs for CMS reimbursement of lung cancer screening is unprecedented. There is a need for PDAs to support informed decision-making about lung cancer screening using LDCT, yet few tools have been developed and none have been evaluated in comparative trials.<sup><xref rid="zoi190762r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup></p>
              <p>We undertook a randomized clinical trial (see trial protocol in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-ZOI190762-1-s">Supplement 1</xref>) of a previously developed PDA video for lung cancer screening<sup><xref rid="zoi190762r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190762r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> to examine its effect on (1) smokers’ preparation for having a conversation with a health care clinician about lung cancer screening, (2) assuredness about a screening decision, (3) knowledge of lung cancer screening, (4) intentions to be screened, and (5) completion of screening. Our target population included persons seeking smoking cessation services through tobacco quit lines who met screening eligibility criteria based on age and smoking history. Tobacco quit lines were selected as the study setting because smoking cessation is an essential component of lung cancer screening programs,<sup><xref rid="zoi190762r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> and tobacco quit lines provide services to many individuals at high risk of lung cancer.</p>

                <title>Study Design</title>
                <p>This randomized clinical trial tested the outcomes of a participant using a PDA about lung cancer screening on the decision to be screened for lung cancer. Participants (clients) were recruited through tobacco quit lines. Baseline, 1-week, 3-month, and 6-month follow-up assessments were conducted. Participants who could not be reached by telephone received the study questionnaires by mail. Recruitment lasted from March 30, 2015, to September 12, 2016, and follow-up assessments were completed by May 5, 2017. Participants were compensated $50 after the 1-week assessment and $25 at the 3- and 6-month follow-ups. The protocol for this study has been published elsewhere.<sup><xref rid="zoi190762r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> The institutional review board of The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, approved the study before data collection (eTable 1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-ZOI190762-1-s">Supplement 2</xref>). Participants provided oral informed consent following a presentation of the study by a research coordinator.

                <title>Setting and Participants</title>
                <p>Tobacco quit lines from 13 states participated in the study. Eligible participants were defined as quit line clients (ages 55-77 years) who reported a 30-plus pack-year smoking history and who spoke English. We excluded clients who reported a history of lung cancer. Tobacco quit line staff at the call centers asked new clients who met the age requirements of their interest in learning about lung cancer screening. Interested clients were then given a toll-free telephone number and an email address to contact the research team. Staff at the call centers also mailed recruitment materials to clients who met age requirements and who had contacted the tobacco quit line for smoking cessation services during the previous year. Mode of recruitment was tracked and included as a covariate in the outcome analyses. Research coordinators completed the eligibility assessment via telephone. Demographic data, contact information, and the baseline assessment were collected during the same telephone call.</p>

                <title>Randomization and Interventions</title>
                <p>After completing the baseline assessment, clients within each state quit line were randomized to receive the PDA or standard educational material (EDU) using S-plus, version 8.04 (TIBCO Software Inc) statistical software to generate a randomization schedule with various block sizes. Participants were not blinded to intervention allocation. Study interviewers were blinded to participant allocation at the 3- and 6-month assessments, but not the 1-week follow-up because questions about the PDA were asked of participants in this group. Participants received the PDA intervention materials via mail in DVD format 1 week before the first follow-up assessment; they were also offered a weblink to the video (2 participants requested a weblink). Participants randomized to EDU were mailed a 2-page brochure about lung cancer screening. When needed, research coordinators assisted participants in finding a location where they could view the PDA such as a public library. Participants in both groups were encouraged to discuss screening with a health care clinician, but they were not given specific guidance on locating a screening facility.</p>

                  <title>Patient Decision Aid</title>
                  <p>The PDA was a 9.5-minute narrated video, <italic>Lung Cancer Screening: Is It Right for Me?</italic> (details of the development process have been previously described).<sup><xref rid="zoi190762r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190762r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> In brief, the PDA was developed and refined iteratively with input from multiple stakeholders (eg, patient advocates, tobacco users, primary care clinicians, and tobacco cessation experts). The development process followed the standards of the International Patient Decision Aid Standards Collaboration,<sup><xref rid="zoi190762r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> and the PDA met National Quality Forum certification criteria for PDAs.<sup><xref rid="zoi190762r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> We updated our PDA to reflect the US Preventive Services Task Force 2014 recommendation<sup><xref rid="zoi190762r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> and eligibility criteria for lung cancer screening from the CMS.<sup><xref rid="zoi190762r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> The narrated PDA included information about (1) eligibility for lung cancer screening and a calculation of tobacco pack-year smoking history, (2) lung cancer epidemiology and risk factors, (3) a video of a patient in a CT scanner, (4) icon arrays to graphically depict the magnitude of mortality reduction, false-positive results, and harms from invasive diagnostic procedures, and (5) radiation exposure depicted within the context of other sources of radiation (eg, a screening mammogram). Smoking cessation was emphasized throughout the PDA.</p>

                  <p>The EDU material was a 2-page brochure from a lung cancer advocacy group and included structured questions a patient can ask a physician about lung cancer screening. The questions addressed (1) eligibility for screening, (2) the harms and benefits of screening, (3) what to expect from undergoing an LDCT scan, (4) the costs of screening, (5) how to interpret the LDCT results, (6) the importance of smoking cessation, and (7) where to find more information about lung cancer and screening.

                <p>The primary outcomes were collected at the 1-week follow-up assessment and included preparation for decision-making and decisional conflict adapted for a decision about lung cancer screening. The Preparation for Decision Making Scale<sup><xref rid="zoi190762r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> is a 10-item measure of the utility of the interventions in preparing the patient to communicate with a health care clinician about a screening decision. Two subscales from the Decisional Conflict Scale<sup><xref rid="zoi190762r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> were also used: Informed Subscale, assessing perceived awareness of the advantages and disadvantages of lung cancer screening, and Values Clarity Subscale, an indicator of the perceived importance of the advantages and disadvantages of lung cancer screening in making a screening decision.</p>
                <p>Secondary outcomes included knowledge of lung cancer screening<sup><xref rid="zoi190762r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> at 1-week, 3-month, and 6-month follow-ups, intentions to be screened at the 1-week follow-up, and screening behaviors by the 6-month follow-up. Participants were asked if they scheduled or had a visit with their health care clinician to discuss lung cancer screening, and if they scheduled or had an LDCT scan since enrolling in the study. Acceptability of the PDA was assessed at the 1-week follow-up using questions adapted from the Ottawa Acceptability Measure.<sup><xref rid="zoi190762r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup></p>

We controlled overall type I error rate by adjusting for multiple comparisons using a Bonferroni correction and setting the threshold <italic>P</italic> = .017 (0.05/3).</p>
                <p>Our accrual target was 500 participants, assuming 20% would be lost to follow-up by the 6-month follow-up. We estimated that the PDA group would have a mean Informed Subscale or Values Clarity Subscale score of 25 (lower decisional conflict) whereas the EDU group would have a mean Informed Subscale or Values Subscale of 30.<sup><xref rid="zoi190762r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190762r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190762r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190762r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> A sample size of 190 in each arm provided 80% power to detect a difference in means of 5 using a 2-group <italic>t</italic> test with a 2-sided significance level of <italic>P</italic> = .017 assuming a common SD of 15 on the Informed Subscale or Values Subscale.<sup><xref rid="zoi190762r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> For the Preparation for Decision Making Scale, a sample size of 190 in each arm provided 80% power for the study to detect an effect size of 0.332 using a 2-group <italic>t</italic> test with a 2-sided significance level of .017. We further used thresholds for determining the clinical significance of the primary outcome measures. For Preparation for Decision Making, we used a cut point of 75 or greater based on findings from the most recent Cochrane review<sup><xref rid="zoi190762r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> to indicate participants being well prepared to make decisions after reviewing a PDA.

                <p>Data analysis was conducted between May 5, 2017, and September 30, 2018. All analyses were conducted using SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc) and S-plus, version 8.04 (TIBCO Software Inc) statistical software. Participant demographic and clinical characteristics at baseline were summarized descriptively.<sup><xref rid="zoi190762r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> The 2-sided 2-group <italic>t</italic> tests were used to compare the differences of the 3 primary end points between the 2 study groups using intent-to-treat analysis.

              <p>A total of 746 tobacco quit line clients were assessed for lung cancer screening eligibility (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="zoi190762f1">Figure</xref>), of whom 230 were excluded and 516 randomized (259 to PDA and 257 to EDU). Of the 516 clients enrolled, 370 (71.7%) were younger than 65 years, 320 (62.0%) were female, 138 (26.7%) identified as black, 47 (9.1%) did not have health insurance, and 226 (43.8%) had a high school educational level or less. Follow-up rates were high: 235 of 259 PDA participants (90.7%) and 233 of 257 EDU participants (90.7%) completed the 1-week assessment, and 218 of 259 PDA participants (84.2%) and 225 of 257 EDU participants (87.5%) completed the 6-month assessment (eFigure in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-ZOI190762-1-s">Supplement 2</xref>). Participants younger than 65 years were slightly more likely to complete the 1-week follow-up compared with participants 65 years and older (342 of 370 [92.4%] vs 126 of 146 [86.3%]; <italic>P</italic> = .03). No other differences were observed between participants who did and did not complete the follow-up assessments (eTable 3 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-ZOI190762-1-s">Supplement 2</xref>). Participant characteristics were similar between the 2 groups (<xref rid="zoi190762t1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>In this randomized clinical trial of a PDA for lung cancer screening, smokers who received the PDA were better prepared to make a screening decision, reported lower decisional conflict, and had greater knowledge of the harms and benefits of screening compared with smokers who received EDU. The number of participants who intended to be screened within the next year was high and did not differ between the groups. Similarly, screening behaviors did not differ between the 2 groups, with nearly 2 in 3 participants having scheduled a visit with a health care clinician to discuss screening by the 6-month follow-up. These findings suggest that participants who received EDU were making decisions about lung cancer screening while feeling less prepared, being less clear about their values related to the harms and benefits, and having poorer knowledge of the harms and benefits than participants who received the PDA. Of note, the participants in this study were similar to clients served by tobacco quit lines nationally based on statistics reported by the North American Quitline Consortium<sup><xref rid="zoi190762r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> and to participants in the National Lung Screening Trial based on age and pack-year smoking history.<sup><xref rid="zoi190762r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Approximately two-thirds (67.4%) of the participants in this study who received the PDA were well prepared to make screening decisions as a result of viewing the PDA compared with approximately one-half (48.2%) of the participants who received the EDU, a finding that is similar to or exceeds data from other studies of PDAs.<sup><xref rid="zoi190762r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190762r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190762r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190762r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> Similarly, 50.0% to 68.0% of the PDA participants had low decisional conflict about their screening choice, which was approximately 20 percentage points better than that for participants who received the EDU. The magnitude of the differences between the 2 groups on the Decisional Conflict Scale Informed and Values Clarity subscales also exceeded the difference reported in the most recent Cochrane Systematic Review<sup><xref rid="zoi190762r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> for PDAs delivered in preparation for a consultation with a health care clinician.</p>
              <p>Participants who received the PDA had greater knowledge of lung cancer screening than did those who received the EDU, and these differences were maintained at each follow-up assessment. Of interest, approximately 1 in 4 participants wanted more information from the PDA; this highlights the importance of a conversation with a health care clinician to probe patients’ information needs and misconceptions related to lung cancer screening. Knowledge scores decreased by the 6-month follow-up assessment, suggesting that a refresher might be needed when the screening decision is reconsidered the following year for patients who have normal screening findings. Currently, CMS makes additional patient counseling and shared decision-making visits optional for subsequent annual screenings for lung cancer.<sup><xref rid="zoi190762r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Few studies have examined the effect of PDAs on lung cancer screening decision-making,<sup><xref rid="zoi190762r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190762r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190762r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190762r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> and only 1 study, to our knowledge, used a comparison group.<sup><xref rid="zoi190762r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> All studies<sup><xref rid="zoi190762r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190762r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190762r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190762r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> were conducted in the United States and confirm our findings about increased knowledge and reduced decisional conflict<sup><xref rid="zoi190762r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190762r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> as a result of receiving the PDA. The number of participants who intended to be screened for lung cancer was high in our study compared with other studies of primary care patients.<sup><xref rid="zoi190762r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190762r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190762r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190762r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> Screening rates in this study were higher than national estimates<sup><xref rid="zoi190762r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> but were lower than screening rates among referred patients in the pulmonary care setting,<sup><xref rid="zoi190762r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> although few studies have examined this issue. Although we observed some differences in screening intentions and behaviors between PDA and EDU participants, future research with larger samples are needed to clarify the effect of PDAs on lung cancer screening behaviors. We would not necessarily expect a PDA to affect screening rates because enthusiasm for cancer screening in general is high.<sup><xref rid="zoi190762r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> Our findings suggest that targeting smokers who are already motivated to quit smoking is an effective approach to increasing screening rates.</p>

                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p>This study has limitations. Participants had to express an interest in lung cancer screening when asked by quit line call staff, and they had to contact the research team about participation. We were unable to explore the reasons why other smokers were not interested. For participants who had an appointment with a health care clinician to discuss lung cancer screening, we do not have information about the quality of the decision-making process or completion of screening after the 6-month follow-up. Screening behaviors were based on self-report.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>A PDA delivered to persons seeking services from tobacco quit lines improved the quality of lung cancer screening decisions compared with EDU. These improvements were consistent with recommendations of professional societies regarding smokers making informed decisions about lung cancer screening. The PDA had no differential effect on intentions to be screened or completion of screening. The PDA was meant to support but not replace a conversation with a health care clinician because there is a crucial need to improve the quality of these conversations.<sup><xref rid="zoi190762r44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> Disseminating the PDA through tobacco quit lines could reach a large number of potentially eligible smokers in the United States. Carefully addressing the role of tobacco quit lines in distributing PDA support for lung cancer screening, given variable quit line funding, is necessary for broader dissemination and greater effect of the intervention.</p>
