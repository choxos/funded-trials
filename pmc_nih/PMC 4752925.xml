              <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
              <p id="P6">Medical foods are specially-formulated products intended to provide safe alternatives to a regular diet in patients with inborn errors of metabolism<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. These products are designed to abrogate the accumulation of toxic metabolites by limiting the amounts of precursors metabolized through a disease-specific enzymatic block. However, when the underlying defect involves the metabolism of essential nutrients, such as branched chain amino acids (BCAA), harmful deficiencies can arise if medical foods are used as a primary dietary source. Despite the inherent risk of inducing iatrogenic side effects such products are currently classified as “foods for special dietary use” and therefore excluded from the regulatory requirements that apply to drugs (37 FR 18229-30, 1972 and 21 U.S.C.360ee (b) (3)). It is recognized that except for phenylketonuria, where medical foods have proven critical in improving disease outcomes, studies on composition and efficacy of other special formulas remain sparse<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>, yet, their implementation has emerged as a cornerstone of therapy for many inborn errors of metabolism detected through newborn screening, including the hereditary isolated methylmalonic acidemias (MMA)<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="P7">This group of IEMs results from deficiency of the methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MUT) enzyme (<italic>mut <sup>0</sup></italic> and <italic>mut</italic>
<sup>−</sup><italic>,</italic> caused by complete or partial MUT deficiency) or related disorders (<italic>cblA, cblB, cblD</italic> variant 2) that affect the synthesis and transport of the cofactor of the MUT enzyme, 5′-deoxyadenosyl-cobalamin<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. MUT deficiency leads to impaired metabolism of BCAA valine and isoleucine, as well as methionine and threonine, odd-chain fatty acids and cholesterol, all of which depend on MUT activity to isomerize succinyl-CoA at the terminal step of propionyl-CoA metabolism into the Krebs cycle<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. The management of this group of disorders remains particularly challenging and controversial because, despite early diagnosis by newborn screening and strict adherence to a protein restricted diet, the patients still experience high mortality and morbidity, including recurrent metabolic ketoacidosis and hyperammonemia, growth failure, chronic kidney disease, pancreatitis, and neurologic complications<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>–<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="P8">The management of MMA includes restriction of dietary protein, which is challenging because sufficient essential amino acid (including valine and isoleucine) intake is needed for optimal growth and must be balanced against the production of “toxic” metabolites derived mainly from propiogenic amino acid oxidation<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. The use of specialized amino acid formulations containing minimal to no valine, isoleucine, methionine and threonine in the treatment for MMA has become widely implemented<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>, despite conflicting results about their efficacy over the past thirty years<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. The early studies by Nyhan et al. conducted with a carefully characterized patient, convincingly demonstrated that protein restriction significantly improved somatic development, head growth and intellectual outcome, but the supplementation with non-offending amino acids offered no additional benefit<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. A subsequent study showed slightly improved nitrogen retention and plasma protein indices when patients were administered medical foods, but no improvement in growth<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. The multicenter trial that provided the basis for the current practice guidelines<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> employed a 6-month non-randomized, non placebo-controlled study of an amino acid-modified medical food (Propimex-1, Ross Products Division, Abbott Laboratories, Columbus, OH) that enrolled 16 infants (3 with MMA) and recorded a non-significant improvement in growth parameters, primarily body weight, in 7/16, 43% of the patients<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. No genotypes or enzyme activity data were provided and the wide range of amino acid intakes and plasma values were not correlated with the growth outcomes.</p>
              <p id="P9">The lack of strong supporting evidence for a specific medical nutrition therapy and the continued poor growth outcomes for MMA patients reported in multiple studies<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> prompted a critical reappraisal of medical food use in the management of MMA. In this single center natural history study, the dietary parameters along with detailed phenotyping data were directly assessed in a large cohort of isolated MMA patients. We demonstrate that a skewed BCAA intake resulting from generous medical foods consumption was associated with disturbed plasma amino acid ratios and suboptimal growth and body habitus, likely because of dynamic BCAA metabolic rechanneling induced by the high leucine content in the medical foods<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. Although a cause and effect relationship between medical foods and growth outcomes cannot be established without a randomized-controlled or cross-over study, our study raises concerns about the liberal use of medical foods in MMA and related disorders of propionate oxidation, which has implications not only for the current management of MMA, but a large number of IEMs.</p>

Rosenblatt, Division of Medical Genetics, McGill University, Canada) and/or molecular genetic analysis (GeneDx; Gaithersburg, MD)<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. Ten patients were evaluated following isolated or combined organ transplantation: 2 with isolated liver, 3 with kidney and 5 with combined liver and kidney transplantation. Data from transplanted patients were used for the analysis of the dietary effects on plasma amino acid concentrations, but were excluded from long-term outcome analyses, due to the liberalization of protein intake in several transplanted patients<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. Five <italic>mut<sup>0</sup></italic> patients were not able to provide detailed diet data and were not included in the individual amino acid intake calculations, but contributed to the dietary data with their daily natural and deficient protein and caloric intake prescription information. Thirty-four of 61isolated MMA (55%) and 30 of 39 <italic>mut<sup>0</sup></italic> (76%) patients had a gastrostomy tube receiving part or all their daily nutrition through bolus or continuous feeds. This allowed for accurate calculations of food intake in the majority of our patient population.</p>

                <p id="P22">In order to better understand the individual amino acid requirements of MMA patients and analyze the effects of their daily intakes on various biochemical parameters, we estimated daily intakes for each of the BCAA, leucine, valine and isoleucine (Leu, Val, Ile) from dietary records. In <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, we show the range of recommended individual amino acid intakes by age from reference nutrition books that are used to guide dietary management in MMA<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> and the ranges we observed in our MMA cohort.

                <p id="P23">Leu content is higher than Val and Ile in all food sources<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. In human breast milk relative ratios of leucine:valine:isoleucine are about 2.0:1.2:1(<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S2</xref>). Hence, normal BCAA intake ratio was observed in our patients who did not consume medical foods (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). These patients were mostly international with limited access to medical foods or from US centers that did not prescribe medical foods. Medical foods for MMA and PA contain minimal to no Val or Ile, but have an increased content of Leu (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S2</xref>). Therefore, patients consuming medical foods had a significantly higher intake ratio for Leu/Val or Leu/Ile (<italic>P</italic>&lt; 0.001 for both, compared to patients using no medical foods, <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). As expected, this difference was also translated to their measured plasma amino acid ratios, obtained 2–4 hours after last meal/feed (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Moreover, these abnormal plasma BCAA ratios were more pronounced the closer to the feeds a blood sample was taken, as illustrated with a case example (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S2A</xref>), while they returned to the normal ratios immediately following the discontinuation of medical foods (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S2B and C</xref>).</p>
                <p id="P24">The temporal association of depressed plasma isoleucine and valine concentrations in the setting of medical food ingestion suggested that the high leucine content of medical foods was distorting the BCAA ratios.

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p id="P28">This study presents a critical reappraisal of medical food use in MMA, derived from inpatient measurements performed as part of a dedicated, single center natural history protocol (NCT00078078). Because we enrolled patients from national and international metabolic clinics with varied management approaches to dietary therapy, our study has revealed unique insights into the current management of MMA as well as iatrogenic effects of medical food use. Over ten years we encountered a number of patients with MMA, who, despite an apparently adequate natural protein intake, had persistently low plasma BCAA levels, prompting their clinics to increase the complete protein or supplement with individual amino acids, i.e. valine and/or isoleucine, to avoid essential amino acid deficiencies (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>; stars)<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. The supplementation with valine and/or isoleucine was paradoxical because these are the propiogenic amino acids targeted for dietary minimization because they are the main contributors to the “toxic” metabolite pool<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="P29">Growth outcomes in our MMA cohort were poor (Ht, Wt and OFC-for-age <italic>Z</italic>-scores), and body composition showed significantly increased percent fat mass (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). We have previously shown that <italic>mut</italic> MMA patients receive nearly two times more calories than their measured resting energy expenditure<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>, which predisposes them to obesity. In this study, we sought to explore whether severe protein restriction could contribute to the short stature and decreased lean body mass in MMA patients, as well as the paradoxical requirement for BCAA supplementation observed in a subset of patients.</p>
              <p id="P30">Surprisingly, the complete protein intake and individual essential BCAA intake consumed by patients in our study were higher than the recommended amounts for other inborn errors, like phenylketonuria (PKU) or maple syrup urine disease (MSUD)<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>, where protein restriction is an essential part of their management, and higher than the FAO/WHO/UNU (2007) safe protein intake levels<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> proposed in the European guidelines or metabolic textbooks for MMA (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). It has been argued that RDA is inadequate in organic acidemias because 1) most of the dietary protein is plant-derived, which may not contain complementary AA’s or can be less digestible; 2) complete protein when given as free AA formula (Splash, Neocate, Elecare, etc) should be increased by about 20% to account for altered absorption and oxidation rates; 3) patients have frequent catabolic episodes resulting in need for catch up growth<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. However, the argument for increased natural/complete protein is often translated to a higher deficient protein prescription, resulting in a higher than recommended ratio of deficient/natural protein. Many patients in this study indeed consumed significant quantities of medical foods in addition to an apparently sufficient amount of complete protein. Of note, total protein intake reached 2–3 g/kg/day in patients up to 11y of age, a significant amount of total nitrogen load, especially for a patient cohort with chronic kidney disease and at risk to develop hyperammonemia. It was therefore even more perplexing that some patients required valine and isoleucine supplementation, which prompted us to search for alternative explanations for possible deficiencies and re-evaluate the amino-acid composition of dietary and medical food-derived protein equivalents.</p>
              <p id="P31">Compared to formulas composed for the treatment of MSUD, which are devoid of all BCAAs, those prepared for disorders of propionate oxidation contain little to no valine, isoleucine, methionine and threonine because these amino acids are oxidized to propionyl-CoA and methylmalonic acid. However, upon analysis it became evident that MMA formulas contain a normal to increased amount of leucine (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S2</xref>). Hence, they represent the only formulas with an imbalanced BCAA composition, and their administration results in a significantly increased and non-physiologic leucine vs. valine and isoleucine intake, especially when prescribed in significant quantities. As proof of this unbalanced amino acid composition, we found that leucine intake in our MMA patient cohort was indeed four to five times higher than the daily recommended intake (DRI) based on the 2007 FAO/WHO guidelines (mean 195.1mg/kg/day, range 30–510, compared to the DRI of 44–50mg/kg/d, <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). In some of the MMA patients, leucine intake reached levels shown to cause hyperammonemia and other side effects, when administered to healthy volunteers<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Of note, target amounts for leucine consumption are not considered in the proposed guidelines for the dietary management of MMA<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="P32">Hence, the present study raises the following intriguing question: Can we assume that, just because leucine is not oxidized into MMA, any amount of leucine is completely safe for MMA patients? From the work of Nyhan et al. on the originally reported case of ketotic hyperglycinemia, it was noted that leucine administration resulted in a decrease of valine and isoleucine plasma concentrations in the patient, as well as in healthy controls<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. These observations have been further extended in animal models (rats <sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>, chicks<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>, pigs<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> among others) that demonstrate when leucine is ingested, especially to animals receiving a low-protein diet, it causes depletion of valine/KIV (<italic>α</italic>-ketoisovaleric acid) and isoleucine/KMV (<italic>α</italic>-keto-<italic>β</italic>-methylvaleric) concentrations in the plasma and tissue pools, and is associated with marked growth depression that can be overcome with Val or Ile supplementation. Furthermore, in numerous studies performed with human subjects, administration of a leucine load (but not of valine or isoleucine) by mouth or intravenously results in dramatic drops in plasma concentrations of valine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, threonine and methionine within 1–3 hours from administration<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>–<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>. While the mechanism(s) behind the lowering effect of leucine on plasma amino acids concentrations are not fully understood, it has been proposed that the inhibitory role of leucine-derived <italic>α</italic>-ketoisocaproate (KIC) on the BCKDH-kinase (branched chain ketoacid dehydrogenase kinase) results in activation of BCKDH and increased BCAA oxidation<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="P33">Additionally, leucine displays a multitude of effects that have not been carefully considered in the management of patients with MMA. Leucine enhances protein synthesis <sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>, inhibits muscle protein breakdown<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>, stimulates insulin secretion<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> and plays a role in central nervous system food intake regulatory circuits and feeding behavior<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup>. Because leucine is primarily transported via the large neutral amino acid transporter, LAT1, at the blood brain barrier (BBB)<sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>, it can compete with other large neutral amino acids for uptake/transport and subsequently neurotransmitter biosynthesis, as detailed in studies on MSUD<sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup>, PKU<sup><xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> and GA-1<sup><xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup>. The high leucine:valine, isoleucine and methionine plasma ratios observed in the current study would be predicted to impair the uptake of Val, Ile and Met through the BBB and result in depletion of these amino acids in the brain with potentially detrimental consequences, especially during periods of brain growth.</p>
              <p id="P34">The main caveat of the study is the cross sectional representation of dietary composition and growth outcomes, which precludes causal claims, especially because dietary prescriptions can change significantly over time. Furthermore, growth failure is a well-recognized complication of MMA and a result of multiple factors, including frequent catabolic events, protein restriction, chronic renal disease, growth or thyroid hormone deficiency, and possibly factors intrinsic to the disease pathophysiology, such as mitochondrial dysfunction. However, our observations highlight a previously unrecognized iatrogenic amino acid deficiency with use of medical foods, a concept reinforced by the fact that removing medical foods from the diet restored BCAA homeostasis in two patients in our cohort (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S2</xref>), and raise questions about the current lack of consideration of the effects of leucine supplementation in the dietary management of MMA.</p>
              <p id="P35">In conclusion, the excessive use of medical foods, especially in the setting of reduced natural protein intake, resulted in iatrogenic amino acid deficiencies and was associated with poor growth outcomes in a large cohort of isolated MMA patients. The unbalanced intake of leucine carries theoretical risks, especially with respect to brain amino acid uptake and whole body metabolism, and unexplored long-term sequelae. Medical foods and dietary guidelines for MMA should be revised based on well-controlled and sufficiently powered clinical studies to support their efficacy and safety. The questions raised with this work are relevant to a collectively large number of inborn errors of metabolism detected by newborn screening.</p>

A number of <italic>mut</italic> patients (N=7) required additional valine and/or isoleucine supplementation because of persistently low plasma amino acid levels during their follow-up monitoring by their home metabolic clinics (labeled with a star). Four of these patients had a complete protein intake at or above the RDA (recommended dietary allowance) for age (solid stars), while three were on a low complete protein diet (clear stars). Age-adjusted RDA is depicted as a dotted line. <bold>B.</bold> The mean daily complete protein intake is depicted as %RDA for protein for healthy children in a box plot. The box represents the middle 50% of all cases per variable, while the remaining 50% is contained between the box and whiskers on each side. The single line inside the box represents the median of the entire data set. Patients with the <italic>mut<sup>0</sup></italic> subtype consumed 99.45 ± 32.05% RDA complete protein (mean ± SD), <italic>mut</italic><sup>−</sup> 119.0 ± 10.00%, <italic>cblA</italic> 139.6 ± 66.37 and <italic>cblB</italic> 68.83 ± 18.19% (<italic>N</italic>=31, 6, 8, and 6, respectively). Transplant recipients were excluded. Although adjusting for the high versus low biological value of dietary protein source might decrease slightly the aforementioned percentage, this analysis was not feasible based on existing dietary records. On the other hand, calculations are provided for the actual and not ideal weight of the patients, suggesting that protein intake would be more generous if expressed per gram of their decreased lean mass. <bold>C.</bold> The ratios of incomplete/complete protein intakes in the subset of patients consuming medical foods are provided per MMA subtype in a box-plot. Patients with <italic>mut<sup>0</sup></italic> MMA had a ratio of 1.16 ± 0.13 (mean ± SD), <italic>mut</italic><sup>−</sup> 0.68 ± 0.20, <italic>cblA</italic> 0.63 ± 0.13 and <italic>cblB</italic> 1.53 ± 0.24 (<italic>N</italic>=24, 4, 3, and 4, respectively). 13/37 or 35.0% of <italic>mut</italic> patients on medical foods exceeded the current treatment guidelines of 1:1 ratio of complete to deficient protein intake. <bold>D and E.</bold> Daily intake of leucine, valine and isoleucine (mg/kg/day by age group) is provided for patients with the <italic>mut</italic> subtype of MMA in a box plot. Leucine intake was 222.0 ± 24.9 in the 2–9y olds, 173.33 ± 55.6 in the 10–18y olds, and 60.0 ± 20.8 in the &gt;18y olds. The younger patients consumed amounts four to five times higher than the recommended DRI based on the 2007 FAO/WHO guidelines (DRI of 44–50 mg/kg/day, dotted line). High daily consumption was recorded even for the two propiogenic amino acids, valine and isoleucine, in the younger age groups.</p>

                <p><bold>A.</bold> Ratios of leucine over valine or isoleucine dietary intake are compared between patients on and off medical foods. Normal BCAA ratios with very narrow distribution were observed in patients who consumed no medical foods, (Leu/Val mean intake ratio was 1.54 ± 0.07, while Leu/Ile intake ratio was 1.73 ± 0.10, <italic>N</italic>=16, bars represent mean with 95%CI), in contrast to significantly higher ratios recorded in patients taking medical foods (Leu/Val of 3.82 ± 1.82 and Leu/Ile of 3.99 ± 1.65, N=34, independent <italic>t</italic>-test <sup>****</sup><italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001 for both Leu/Val and Leu/Ile) as a result of the high leucine content in these formulations. <bold>B.</bold> Higher leucine over valine and isoleucine dietary intake ratios translated in reversed or higher ratios, respectively, in their relative plasma amino acids concentrations. Patients on medical foods had a reversed plasma Leu/Val ratio of 1.25 ± 0.74 and a close to two-fold increased ratio of Leu/Ile 3.58 ± 2.4, compared to patients on no medical foods (<sup>***</sup><italic>P</italic>=0.003 and <sup>****</sup><italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001 for Leu/Val and Leu/Ile). <bold>C.</bold> Amount of deficient protein intake (g/kg/day) was inversely related to the plasma valine (solid circles) and isoleucine (clear circles) concentrations. Although a range of plasma concentrations were observed in patients without medical food intake – depicted on the left aspect of the graph, the lowest plasma Val and Ile values were observed in patients consuming the highest amounts of medical food. <bold>D.</bold> Dietary leucine/valine intake showed a negative correlation to height-for-age (solid squares) and weight-for-age <italic>Z</italic>-scores (clear squares) in the subgroup of <italic>mut<sup>0</sup></italic> MMA patients, supporting that increased consumption of deficient protein administered at the expense of complete protein may adversely affect the growth parameters.
