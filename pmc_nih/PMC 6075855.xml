                  <title>Purpose</title>
                  <p>Genetic alterations causing overexpression of programmed death-1 ligands are near universal in classic Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL). Nivolumab, a programmed death-1 checkpoint inhibitor, demonstrated efficacy in relapsed/refractory cHL after autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (auto-HCT) in initial analyses of one of three cohorts from the CheckMate 205 study of nivolumab for cHL. Here, we assess safety and efficacy after extended follow-up of all three cohorts.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>This multicenter, single-arm, phase II study enrolled patients with relapsed/refractory cHL after auto-HCT treatment failure into cohorts by treatment history: brentuximab vedotin (BV)–naïve (cohort A), BV received after auto-HCT (cohort B), and BV received before and/or after auto-HCT (cohort C). All patients received nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks until disease progression/unacceptable toxicity. The primary end point was objective response rate per independent radiology review committee.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Overall, 243 patients were treated; 63 in cohort A, 80 in cohort B, and 100 in cohort C. After a median follow-up of 18 months, 40% continued to receive treatment. The objective response rate was 69% (95% CI, 63% to 75%) overall and 65% to 73% in each cohort. Overall, the median duration of response was 16.6 months (95% CI, 13.2 to 20.3 months), and median progression-free survival was 14.7 months (95% CI, 11.3 to 18.5 months). Of 70 patients treated past conventional disease progression, 61% of those evaluable had stable or further reduced target tumor burdens. The most common grade 3 to 4 drug-related adverse events were lipase increases (5%), neutropenia (3%), and ALT increases (3%). Twenty-nine deaths occurred; none were considered treatment related.</p>

                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p>With extended follow-up, responses to nivolumab were frequent and durable. Nivolumab seems to be associated with a favorable safety profile and long-term benefits across a broad spectrum of patients with relapsed/refractory cHL.</p>

              <p>The prognosis of patients with relapsed/refractory classic Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) after failure of autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (auto-HCT) has historically been extremely poor, with a median overall survival (OS) of just over 2 years.<sup><xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Achieving durable responses in this population is a critical goal rarely achieved with conventional chemotherapy.<sup><xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Brentuximab vedotin (BV) has demonstrated efficacy after auto-HCT treatment failure, with an objective response rate (ORR) of 75% and median progression-free survival (PFS) of 5.6 months.<sup><xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> A subset of patients who achieve complete remission (CR) with BV maintain durable responses after 5 years<sup><xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>; however, most patients require additional treatment within 1 year. An unmet need therefore exists for therapies that provide durable disease control for patients with relapsed/refractory cHL after failure of auto-HCT.</p>
              <p>Genetic alterations at 9p24.1 are almost universal in cHL,<sup><xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> leading to overexpression of the programmed death 1 (PD-1) ligands 1 (PD-L1) and 2 (PD-L2) on the surface of tumor cells. PD-L1 and PD-L2 downregulate T-cell immune responses on binding to PD-1.<sup><xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Nivolumab, a fully human immunoglobulin G4 anti–PD-1 monoclonal antibody, blocks signaling through the PD-1 pathway, releasing inhibition of T cells and augmenting antitumor immune responses.<sup><xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Nivolumab was tested in a phase I study (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> identifier: NCT01592370) that demonstrated objective responses in 20 of 23 heavily pretreated patients (87%) with relapsed/refractory cHL.<sup><xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Given these promising results, we conducted an international, multicohort, phase II clinical trial in patients with relapsed/refractory cHL after failure of auto-HCT (CheckMate 205; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> identifier: NCT02181738).<sup><xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Here, we present primary efficacy and safety data after extended follow-up of three relapsed/refractory cHL cohorts. In addition, we report exploratory analyses, including results according to prior treatment sequence or refractory status, outcomes of treatment beyond progressive disease, and outcomes of allogeneic HCT (allo-HCT) after nivolumab treatment.</p>

                <title>Study Design and Participants</title>
                <p>This multicenter, single-arm trial enrolled patients aged ≥ 18 years with biopsy-confirmed relapsed/refractory cHL after treatment failure with auto-HCT into three independent cohorts. Complete methods for cohort B of this trial have been described,<sup><xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> and brief methods and cohort-specific protocol differences are described here and in the Data Supplement. Patients were enrolled at 34 sites across Europe and North America; patients with no prior BV treatment were enrolled in cohort A, patients who experienced failure of post–auto-HCT BV treatment were enrolled in cohort B, and patients who were treated with BV before and/or after auto-HCT treatment failure were enrolled in cohort C. Important exclusion criteria included autoimmune disease, radiotherapy within 21 days (≤ 24 weeks for chest radiation) of first nivolumab dose, auto-HCT within 90 days of first nivolumab dose, and allo-HCT or checkpoint blockade at any time before nivolumab treatment.</p>
                <p>This study was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Approval from the appropriate institutional review board and independent ethics committee was received for the protocol, amendments, and consent forms before initiating the study at each site. All patients provided written informed consent before trial enrollment.</p>

                <title>Procedures</title>
                <p>Patients received nivolumab 3 mg/kg intravenously every 2 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients in cohort C were to discontinue nivolumab after 1 year in persistent CR and could resume treatment if they relapsed within 2 years of the last dose. A protocol amendment (July 2014) allowed patients to continue treatment beyond investigator-assessed progression (2007 International Working Group [IWG] criteria for malignant lymphoma<sup><xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>) if protocol-predefined criteria were met, including stable performance status and deriving perceived clinical benefit. Patients treated beyond initial progression (TBP) were required to discontinue in the event of further progression (≥ 10% further increase in tumor burden).</p>
                <p>Computed tomography scanning or magnetic resonance imaging was performed at screening; then at weeks 9, 17, 25, 37, and 49 during the first year of treatment; every 16 weeks during the second year of treatment; and every 26 weeks thereafter. [<sup>18</sup>F]fluorodeoxyglucose–positron emission tomography (PET) scans were mandated at screening and weeks 17 and 25, and were also required at week 49 for patients without two consecutive negative [<sup>18</sup>F]fluorodeoxyglucose–PET scans before week 49 or for confirmation of radiographic CR at other time points. Safety assessments were performed continuously.</p>
                <p>For patients who discontinued nivolumab to proceed to transplantation, disease assessments (CR or non-CR) were performed at 100 days, 6 months, 1 year, and every year thereafter from the date of transplantation until the date of first non-CR. Transplantation date and occurrence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) were collected prospectively; further outcomes after allo-HCT were collected retrospectively. Myeloablative conditioning was defined according to standard criteria.<sup><xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup></p>

                <title>Outcomes</title>
                <p>The primary end point was independent radiology review committee (IRC)–assessed ORR (2007 IWG criteria<sup><xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>) in each cohort. Secondary end points were IRC-assessed duration of response (DOR), frequency and duration of partial remission (PR) and CR as assessed by IRC, and investigator-assessed ORR and DOR. Prespecified exploratory analyses included PFS by IRC, OS, tumor burden change with TBP, and safety. Time to next treatment (TTNT), efficacy according to BV treatment sequence or prior refractory status and efficacy in the combined three cohorts were post hoc exploratory analyses.</p>

                <title>Statistical Analysis</title>
                <p>The planned sample size in cohorts A (n = 60) and B (n = 60) was selected to provide 93% power to reject the null hypothesis that the true proportion of patients achieving an objective response was ≤ 20% (assuming 40% of patients achieve an objective response and a two-sided α of 5%). Cohort C (n = 100) was designed to provide an 87% probability of observing at least one occurrence of any adverse event (AE) that would occur with 2% incidence. All patients who received at least one dose of nivolumab were included in the primary safety and efficacy analyses. Primary efficacy analyses were performed independently for each cohort; safety assessments were performed for the combined population. For exploratory analyses by treatment sequence, patients from cohort C were recategorized according to the order in which they had received BV relative to auto-HCT; those receiving BV only after auto-HCT were grouped with cohort B (Appendix, online only). ORRs were summarized using binomial response rates; corresponding two-sided 95% exact CIs were calculated using the Clopper-Pearson method. For post hoc analyses, prior refractoriness was defined as the absence of objective response to a given therapy (absence of CR for first-line therapy).</p>
                <p>TTNT was defined as the time from first nivolumab dose (or from initial disease progression in patients TBP) to next systemic therapy or death, whichever occurred first, and was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cumulative incidences of acute GVHD (aGVHD), chronic GVHD (cGVHD), disease progression, and transplant-related mortality (TRM; defined as death without disease progression) after allo-HCT were calculated using competing risks models. GVHD of unknown grade (G) was imputed to G4; unknown dates of GVHD onset were imputed to date of transplantation. Associations between nivolumab exposure and the occurrence of G3 to G4 aGVHD or TRM were explored graphically. A previously developed population pharmacokinetic model<sup><xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> was used to determine nivolumab serum concentrations at the time of allo-HCT on the basis of individual records of time lapse between last nivolumab treatment and allo-HCT.</p>

Baseline characteristics were generally similar across cohorts (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>); however, BV-naïve patients (cohort A) had the fewest prior lines of therapy, and patients in cohort B (BV after auto-HCT) had the longest interval between diagnosis and first nivolumab dose, and between most recent auto-HCT and first nivolumab dose. At database lock (December 2016), median follow-up was 18 months overall (interquartile range [IQR], 15 to 22 months) and 19, 23, and 16 months in cohorts A, B, and C, respectively. Overall, 40% of patients continued to receive treatment. Patients received a median of 32, 32, and 27 doses of nivolumab in cohorts A, B, and C, respectively. In cohort C, seven patients discontinued treatment because of persistent CR; none had been retreated at the time of database lock.</p>

              <p>On the basis of encouraging initial data, nivolumab was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of adults with cHL that has relapsed/progressed after auto-HCT and BV treatment or three or more prior lines of systemic therapy including auto-HCT,<sup><xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> and by the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of adults with relapsed/refractory cHL after auto-HCT and BV.<sup><xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> The efficacy of PD-1 blockade in relapsed/refractory cHL was further supported by positive results in a recent phase II study of pembrolizumab.<sup><xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> This extended analysis of three CheckMate 205 cohorts confirms the favorable safety profile of nivolumab in relapsed/refractory cHL. After the 18-month follow-up, safety outcomes remained consistent with previous reports, and most events were G1 or G2. In addition, nivolumab led to frequent and durable responses, including in patients naïve to BV, patients who received BV at differing times relative to auto-HCT, and patients refractory to prior lines of therapy.</p>
              <p>Previous studies in cHL suggest that DOR and PFS with chemotherapeutic agents may be strongly associated with depth of response.<sup><xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> However, durable responses with nivolumab were observed in patients with both CR and PR. Furthermore, median PFS exceeded 11 months for patients with SD, and 1-year OS rates in patients with a best response of SD (98%) were similar to those in patients with CR (100%) and PR (96%). This suggests that long-lasting clinical benefits from anti–PD-1 checkpoint inhibition are not restricted to patients with CR, and even patients who do not attain objective responses may derive clinical benefit. Median OS was not reached in any cohort, nor in patients with SD or progressive disease in the overall population, even though patients were heavily pretreated and most had received both prior auto-HCT and prior BV, further supporting the possibility of long-lasting benefits of nivolumab.</p>
              <p>Notably, median TTNT exceeded PFS, and patients TBP often maintained disease control during the follow-up reported: 1-year OS after initial progression was higher in patients who continued to receive treatment beyond progression (84% <italic>v</italic> 61%) and approached that from the first nivolumab dose in the overall population (92%). Time from initial progression to next systemic therapy was also high in patients TBP compared with those not TBP (8.8 <italic>v</italic> 1.5 months). Although this may reflect a selection bias in this nonrandomized comparison, atypical patterns of response with immune checkpoint inhibitors and potential benefits of treatment past conventional progression are well described in solid tumors.<sup><xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>-<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> According to conventional response criteria, atypical response patterns may result in patients being assessed as having progressive disease despite the potential for subsequent tumor control. Proposed updates to conventional response criteria (Lymphoma Response to Immunomodulatory Therapy Criteria [LyRIC]<sup><xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> and Response Evaluation Criteria in Lymphoma [RECIL]<sup><xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>) that take this phenomenon into account may allow more accurate assessment of checkpoint inhibitor efficacy in future studies.</p>
              <p>One limitation of this study was the discordance between IRC- and investigator-assessed CR rates. Concordance may have been improved with quantitative scoring of PET scans; however, this study was designed before the 2014 Lugano criteria<sup><xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> and therefore used the 2007 IWG criteria.</p>
              <p>The incidence of aGVHD and TRM after postnivolumab allo-HCT in CheckMate 205 seemed comparable to historical relapsed/refractory cHL cohorts who had received allografts without prior PD-1 blockade.<sup><xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>-<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> Patients in this study who received allografts after nivolumab experienced low relapse rates after 6 months of follow-up, and overall outcomes (PFS and OS) seemed favorable with short follow-up. In the present cohort, we saw no clear effect of estimated nivolumab concentration or length of interval before allo-HCT on aGVHD or TRM. These results are similar to others recently published,<sup><xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> but larger studies will be needed to confirm this finding. Together, these results suggest that prior nivolumab treatment should not preclude allo-HCT. However, the possibility remains that prior PD-1 blockade may increase early post–allo-HCT toxicity, and a warning and precaution label for complications of allo-HCT is included in the prescribing information for nivolumab.<sup><xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Additional follow-up is required to ascertain long-term outcomes post–allo-HCT after PD-1 blockade.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, to our knowledge, this is the longest phase II or III follow-up reported to date of anti–PD-1 checkpoint blockade in patients with a hematologic malignancy. Nivolumab demonstrated high response rates and led to durable responses in the majority of patients. Sustained benefits were seen across different patient populations, including patients refractory to prior therapies and patients with and without prior BV exposure, and were not dependent on achieving CR. The exploratory analyses presented here lend further support to the hypothesis that PD-1 blockade may provide durable benefit even in patients who do not achieve objective responses, including a subset of patients who experience conventional progressive disease. Altogether, the results of this study suggest that nivolumab treatment may provide long-term benefits to a broad spectrum of patients with relapsed/refractory cHL after auto-HCT.</p>
