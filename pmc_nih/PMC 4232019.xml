                <p><bold>Background:</bold> Biofortification is a strategy to relieve vitamin A (VA) deficiency. Biofortified maize contains enhanced provitamin A concentrations and has been bioefficacious in animal and small human studies.</p>
                <p><bold>Objective: </bold>The study sought to determine changes in total body reserves (TBRs) of vitamin A with consumption of biofortified maize.</p>
                <p><bold>Design:</bold> A randomized, placebo-controlled biofortified maize efficacy trial was conducted in 140 rural Zambian children. The paired <sup>13</sup>C-retinol isotope dilution test, a sensitive biomarker for VA status, was used to measure TBRs before and after a 90-d intervention. Treatments were white maize with placebo oil (VA−), orange maize with placebo (orange), and white maize with VA in oil [400 <italic>μ</italic>g retinol activity equivalents (RAEs) in 214 <italic>μ</italic>L daily] (VA+).</p>
                <p><bold>Results:</bold> In total, 133 children completed the trial and were analyzed for TBRs (<italic>n</italic> = 44 or 45/group). Change in TBR residuals were not normally distributed (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001); median changes (95% CI) were as follows: VA−, 13 (−19, 44) <italic>μ</italic>mol; orange, 84 (21, 146) <italic>μ</italic>mol; and VA+, 98 (24, 171) <italic>μ</italic>mol. Nonparametric analysis showed no statistical difference between VA+ and orange (<italic>P</italic> = 0.34); both were higher than VA− (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0034). Median (95% CI) calculated liver reserves at baseline were 1.04 (0.97, 1.12) <italic>μ</italic>mol/g liver, with 59% &gt;1 <italic>μ</italic>mol/g, the subtoxicity cutoff; none were &lt;0.1 <italic>μ</italic>mol/g, the deficiency cutoff. The calculated bioconversion factor was 10.4 <italic>μ</italic>g <italic>β</italic>-carotene equivalents/1 <italic>μ</italic>g retinol by using the middle 3 quintiles of change in TBRs from each group. Serum retinol did not change in response to intervention (<italic>P</italic> = 0.16) but was reduced with elevated C-reactive protein (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0029) and α-1-acid glycoprotein (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0023) at baseline.</p>
                <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold><italic>β</italic>-Carotene from maize was efficacious when consumed as a staple food in this population and could avoid the potential for hypervitaminosis A that was observed with the use of preformed VA from supplementation and fortification. Use of more sensitive methods other than serum retinol alone, such as isotope dilution, is required to accurately assess VA status, evaluate interventions, and investigate the interaction of VA status and infection. This trial was registered at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="clinicaltrials.gov">clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> as NCT01814891.</p>

              <p>Ensuring optimal vitamin A (VA)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5"><sup>7</sup></xref> status is an issue of global health concern. Latest WHO reports estimate that 190 million preschool-aged children and 19.1 million pregnant women are VA deficient based on serum retinol (SR) concentrations &lt;0.7 μmol/L (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Vitamin A deficiency (VAD) can lead to blindness, anemia, weakened resistance to infection, and increased risk of death (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Current strategies to alleviate VAD are high-dose supplementation and low-dose fortification with preformed VA (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Zambia has adopted these strategies with high levels of coverage for supplements (89%, 2007–2011) (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) and fortified sugar (59–99%) (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>–<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Sugar in Zambia had a median VA concentration of 8.8 μg/g (range: 0.5–54.9) (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), and daily intake in children was estimated as 9–15 g/d (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), yielding intakes of 77–132 μg preformed retinol/d. Absorption of preformed VA is very efficient; therefore, the potential for hypervitaminosis exists at consistent intakes above requirements (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p>
              <p>Biofortification of staple crops with provitamin A carotenoids is an alternate method to promote optimal VA status. This approach is sustainable, cost-effective, and potentially wide-reaching (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Furthermore, negative feedback mechanisms of β-carotene absorption and bioconversion to VA mitigate hypervitaminosis issues associated with preformed VA (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Provitamin A carotenoid sources are efficacious in humans (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>–<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Biofortified orange maize has shown bioefficacy in maintaining VA liver reserves in Mongolian gerbils (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) and in providing VA in single meals to humans (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p>
              <p>Determining the VA status of an individual or the response to an intervention is difficult (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Liver VA concentrations are the gold standard because the liver is the primary storage site for VA (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), but these measures are difficult in the field or unethical to directly obtain from humans. SR concentrations are homeostatically controlled over a wide range of physiologic conditions, responding only to severe deficiency or toxicity (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Isotope dilution is the most sensitive, indirect measure of VA status across a broad range of VA status (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). The deuterated retinol dilution (DRD) technique requires a high dose of isotope (∼17.5 μmol), gives an accurate measure of liver stores (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), and has been used before and after provitamin A, food-based interventions to determine efficacy (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).</p>
              <p><sup>13</sup>C-Retinol isotope dilution (<sup>13</sup>C-RID), which has been validated against liver reserves in rats (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) and monkeys (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), as well as correlated with long-term dietary intakes of U.S. women (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), has demonstrated a response to a preformed VA intervention in Thai schoolchildren (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Because the carbon (not hydrogen) is isotopically labeled, retinol may be analyzed by using gas chromatography–combustion isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC-CIRMS), which is more sensitive than the gas chromatography–mass spectrometry used for the DRD test (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). This allows much smaller isotope doses to be used, allowing the isotope to act like a true tracer (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>).</p>
              <p>The focus of this community-based, randomized controlled trial in Zambian preschool children was to evaluate the VA efficacy of orange maize. The <sup>13</sup>C-RID test was used to quantitatively determine VA total body reserves (TBRs) and liver concentrations at baseline and after orange maize consumption in comparison with negative and positive control groups.</p>

                <p>All procedures involving human subjects were approved by the Tropical Diseases Research Centre's Ethics Review Committee in Zambia and University of Wisconsin (UW)–Madison's Health Sciences Human Subjects Institutional Review Board. This trial was registered with <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="clinicaltrials.gov">clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> as NCT01814891. Written informed consent was obtained from parents or caregivers. The trial was conducted in 2012 in Nyimba District of the Eastern Province of Zambia in preschool children (<italic>n</italic> = 143 initial enrollment, aged 71.5 ± 6.9 mo) because of the high prevalence of low SR concentrations in a prior survey (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Nyimba District was also selected because local communities expressed interest in participating following community sensitization programs related to orange maize performed by the National Food and Nutrition Commission (Lusaka, Zambia) and a prior efficacy study orchestrated by UW-Madison (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) in previous years. Four feeding sites were chosen: 2 sites adjacent to the main roadway and 2 sites about 8 km off the paved road.</p>
                <p>Inclusion criteria were relatively healthy children aged 5–7 y living in the study area with weight-for-age and weight-for-height <italic>z</italic> scores &gt;−3, hemoglobin &gt;70 g/L, no clinical infection at recruitment causing fever, antihelminthic treatment the week before recruitment, and not having received a 200,000 IU VA supplement in the past 6 mo.</p>
                <p>Assuming a 16-kg child with a 480-g liver (3% body weight), sample size was calculated by using a theoretical midpoint change of 1125 μg in the orange group's liver stores based on an estimated 15 μg β-carotene/g maize, 75% retention of β-carotene through preparation, 200-g daily maize intake, and a midpoint between the 6 and 12 μg β-carotene/1 μg retinol bioconversion factors (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). In this calculation, daily μg retinol activity equivalent (RAE) intake from the maize was corrected for the estimated average requirement of 275 μg RAEs, which was assumed to be used. Using this difference from a similar child consuming white maize (assuming no change in liver stores), a sample size of 45 would allow an SD of 1.5 times the difference; α was set at 0.05, and power was 0.90. This was increased to a target of 50/group to allow for loss to follow-up.</p>

                <p>The biofortified orange maize for the test group was developed at the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center as part of its HarvestPlus biofortified maize research project (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). The orange maize variety was created specifically to enable efficacy studies and was formed by making all possible crosses and mixing the resultant seed by using 5 maize lines bred for high provitamin A concentration (17–24 μg/g, predominately β-carotene). Grain of this orange maize variety was produced on a commercial farm in Zambia during November to April immediately preceding the trial. After harvest, the grain was analyzed and had ∼18 μg β-carotene equivalents (βCEs)/g at the time it was placed into a large freezer container in Lusaka. Every 2 weeks, maize (250 kg) was delivered to the study site.</p>

                <p>The paired <sup>13</sup>C-RID test was used, meaning each child gave 4 blood samples (i.e., 2 blood draws for each assessment) and served as his or her own control for response to the intervention (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>, the study began with a baseline assessment for VA TBRs and other variables of interest, followed by the intervention, a washout period, and a similar endline assessment. The <sup>13</sup>C-RID test was administered as follows: after an overnight fast and venous blood draw, 1 μmol <sup>13</sup>C<sub>2</sub>-retinyl acetate in soybean oil (180 μL) was delivered directly into the child's mouth with a positive displacement pipette. The dose was followed with 1.0 mL oil and a high-fat snack (bread with ∼16 g peanut butter) to maximize absorption. After an isotope mixing period of 14 d, another overnight fasting venous blood sample was obtained. During mixing and washout (7-d) periods, all subjects ate white maize and were not supplemented. Treatment groups consisted of a negative control group (VA−, <italic>n</italic> = 47), who ate white maize and received daily placebo oil; the test group (orange, <italic>n</italic> = 46), who ate orange maize and received daily placebo oil; and a positive control group (VA+, <italic>n</italic> = 47), who ate white maize and received daily VA [retinyl palmitate, 400 μg RAEs (the current U.S. Recommended Dietary Allowance for children this age)] in oil. Maize dishes consisted of porridge for breakfast (prepared with maize, water, sugar, salt, and milk or groundnuts; ∼17% maize by weight) and <italic>nshima</italic> for lunch and dinner (stiff porridge, prepared with maize and water; ∼30% maize by weight). White or orange maize was used for all dishes according to treatment group and was the only difference in the menu among the groups. Unfortified industrial-grade sugar was purchased from a processing company to use in porridge preparation.</p>

                <p>Serum analysis was a modified published procedure (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Briefly, serum was thawed at room temperature. To 1.5 mL (or all available) serum, ethanol (1 × vol) was added to precipitate proteins, C23 β-<italic>apo</italic>-carotenol was added as an internal standard, and 3 × 1–mL hexane extractions were performed. Hexane layers were pooled, dried under nitrogen, resuspended in 100 μL methanol, frozen at −80°C for ∼5 min, centrifuged briefly, and injected onto HPLC system 1 for quantification and purification. System 1 contained a Gracesmart C<sub>18</sub> (5-μm, 4.6 × 250–mm) column with 92:8 acetonitrile/water at 1.0 mL/min. The retinol fraction was collected, dried under nitrogen, and resuspended in 100 μL methanol for injection onto system 2. System 2 contained an identical column with 100% methanol at 0.7 mL/min. The retinol fraction was collected, dried under vacuum with a SPD1010 SpeedVac (Thermo Scientific), and resuspended in 4–6 μL hexane, and 1–3 μL was injected (to inject approximately 75 ng) on the gas chromatograph. The GC-CIRMS system was published (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>).

                <p>Absorption of a 5-mg dose was 81.2% in 3 children without illness (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>), but a 1-mg dose had a higher absorption of 99.2% in 5 children (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). We assumed absorption to be 90% for most children to account for underlying repeated infections, potential micronutrient codeficiencies, and the smaller dose size (0.288 mg), which appears to be absorbed more completely. For children with elevated CRP (&gt;10 mg/L) (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>–<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>) at the time of dosing, absorption was reduced further to 80% (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>).</p>

Data were analyzed by using the General Linear Model procedure in the Statistical Analysis System (SAS Institute, version 9.2). Normality of residuals was assessed by the Shapiro-Wilk test. For data with normally distributed residuals, outcomes of interest were evaluated by using 1- or 2-way ANOVA, and differences among treatment groups were determined by using least significant difference tests. For data with nonnormally distributed residuals, nonparametric analysis was carried out on ranked data. Proportions were compared by using χ<sup>2</sup> analysis. For calculation of the bioconversion factor, the middle 3 quintiles of change in TBRs from each treatment group were used. The mean change of the VA− group was subtracted from orange and VA+ groups, and μg β-carotene/1 μg retinol from the orange maize was calculated in reference to the VA+ group by the following formula (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>):<disp-formula id="fd3"><inline-graphic xlink:href="ajcn10061541equ3.jpg"/></disp-formula></p>

Retention of provitamin A carotenoids from ground maize to cooked <italic>nshima</italic> was ∼78%.

                <p>Dietary intakes for the trial are published (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Briefly, total food intake among groups did not differ, but the orange maize group ate less <italic>nshima</italic> (276 ± 36 compared with 288 ± 26 g/serving, <italic>P</italic> = 0.008) because this maize takes up less water and is more nutrient dense [0.28 ± 0.02 (orange) compared with 0.26 ± 0.02 (white) g dry weight/g <italic>nshima</italic>, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0085] than the white maize after cooking. Meal compliance was 98.4% and similar among groups. The orange maize group consumed 49,000 g <italic>nshima</italic> per child (4.09 μg βCEs/g) and 22,000 g porridge per child (2.60 μg βCEs/g) during the trial. This equates to 257.6 mg βCEs or 2.86 mg βCEs/d per child. VA dosing compliance was 98.7% in the VA+ group, for a mean VA dose intake of 35.53 mg or 394.8 μg RAEs/d per child.</p>

                <p>The calculated half-life of retinol for a subset of the children in the VA− group (<italic>n</italic> = 19) was 136 ± 33 d.

Median (95% CI) calculated liver reserves for all subjects at baseline were 1.04 (0.97, 1.12) μmol/g liver, with 59% &gt;1 μmol/g, the current subtoxicity cutoff.

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>Orange maize was efficacious in Zambian children, as determined by the <sup>13</sup>C-RID test in the presence of high liver stores, with 59% having concentrations &gt;1.0 μmol/g liver at baseline. While the orange maize was expected to be efficacious, the absence of VAD and high liver stores were unexpected findings given 2009 VAD estimates of 56.4% with SR &lt;0.7 μmol/L (unadjusted for infection) or 22% with modified relative dose-response tests &gt;0.06 in younger Zambian children aged 2–5 y (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). However, children aged 6–59 mo are given high-dose supplements semiannually, sugar has been fortified since 1998 with more complete coverage in recent years, and dietary intake of VA was adequate for 99.6% of children aged 2–5 y in the prior survey (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>); all 3 sources allow TBR to build over time. VA status is reported as TBR (μmol or mmol), which relies on fewer assumptions, and liver concentration (μmol/g) to compare with published values. Validation against liver reserves is on a concentration basis and accounts for body weight. Baseline TBRs in mmol (0.73) were much higher than those in Filipino children (0.08–0.09) (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), Chinese children (0.09–0.13 and 0.27) (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>), Mexican children (0.17) (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>), and Nicaraguan children before sugar fortification (0.39) (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p>
              <p>Although the isotope dilution test is the most sensitive biomarker of VA status, it relies on assumptions that must be carefully considered for the population and the specific test used. It is important to note the distinction between isotope dilution methods. Methods using <sup>13</sup>C combined with GC-CIRMS are more sensitive than deuterium or <sup>13</sup>C on gas chromatography–mass spectrometry, allowing for smaller isotope doses to give an adequate analytic signal (1 compared with 17.5 μmol) (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). This is important for considering the fraction of dose absorbed and the specific activity ratio of serum/liver.</p>
              <p>Similar absorption (∼80%) was noted for 5- and 60-mg VA doses in Zambian children (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>), a 1-mg dose was almost completely absorbed (99.2%) in the absence of acute infection in Indian children (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>), and a 1-mg dose was completely absorbed in monkeys (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Although there was relatively high AGP, children in this study were absorbing the daily VA doses well (∼70% retention), as indicated by the increase in TBR in the VA+ group. Together, these data justify 90% absorption of the dose or 80% absorption in the children with elevated CRP and no fever on the day of dosing. Furthermore, we administered antihelminthic treatment before beginning the study to optimize the validity of the <sup>13</sup>C-RID test and the intervention. If a population has a high intestinal parasitic load, assumptions used in the isotope dilution equation and efficacy of orange maize may differ.</p>
              <p>A factor of 0.65 is used to correct for differences in isotope enrichment between serum and liver with larger deuterated doses (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), based on radioactivity studies in rats (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). This ratio in humans was 0.80 with large deuterated doses (∼30 mg), but the DRD equation has not been updated (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). This ratio was omitted in our equation because it was ∼1 in rats (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) and monkeys (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) when smaller doses of <sup>13</sup>C and GC-CIRMS were used and blood samples were taken fasting. The ratio of 1 is likely because of the physiologic nature of small doses along with a low VA diet during the mixing period. The correction for catabolism of VA during the mixing period assumes first-order elimination of VA (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). The dose decay, after mixing with the body pool, was measured from 14 to 130 d. The calculated half-life (136 d) is close to that in adults (154 d) (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>) but longer than that in younger children aged 1–2 y (32 d) (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Our children are older, are free of severe infection, and have large stores of VA, and the dose was followed for a longer time.</p>
              <p>This study was powered based on change in TBR, and SR did not respond even though TBR showed a treatment effect. Change in TBR by using isotope dilution coupled with no response in SR has been observed frequently (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Nonsignificant differences in SR with and without VA supplementation have also been observed (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). This is because SR is homeostatically controlled over a broad range of liver reserves (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Our baseline assessment of TBR showed no correlation to SR (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.018, <italic>P</italic> = 0.090), and SR predicted a 17% VAD prevalence: a moderate public health concern. SR from blood draw 4 misclassified 22% as VA deficient, indicating a severe public health concern. Conversely, in a recent study using <sup>13</sup>C-RID in Thai children with SR &gt;0.7 μmol/L, 64% were deficient based on liver concentrations &lt;0.1 μmol/g (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). A high prevalence of elevated AGP in our study was positively and significantly correlated with CRP (indicating chronic infection) (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>), which is correlated with a reduction in SR (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Misclassification by SR may be a result of this chronic infection. Together, these data demand further use of stable isotope methods to more accurately assess VA status, evaluate VA interventions, and investigate the interaction of VA status, infection, and SR.</p>
              <p>The unexpected finding of high liver stores in these Zambian children raises concern for implementing multiple interventions to improve VA status in the same groups. Supplementation and fortification both use preformed VA, which can lead to hypervitaminosis A because it is efficiently absorbed and stored (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). When multiple interventions are in place, as in our study population, VA intakes can easily exceed requirements, and stores can build over time, especially in the background of adequate VA in the diet. This could just be limited to this age group in Zambia (due to just finishing a 4.5-y VA supplementation, having fortified sugar available their entire lives, and their mothers consuming fortified sugar during pregnancy and lactation). However, when supplemented at just the amount of the U.S. Recommended Dietary Allowance (400 μg RAEs/d) for 90 d, the VA+ group stored ∼70% of these doses, reaching concentrations further above the subtoxicity cutoff (increasing from 1.18 to 1.44 μmol/g); we should note, however, that daily VA supplementation may overestimate response in liver store values as seen with the DRD test (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>).</p>
              <p>Recently, a fortified rice intervention using preformed VA increased liver reserves from 0.10 to 0.17 μmol/g in just 50 d (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). In that study, 75–80% of the additional VA intake from the fortified rice grains (890 μg RAEs/d) was stored in the liver. Similarly, evaluation of Nicaraguan sugar fortification demonstrated that liver reserves rose drastically, with mean liver concentrations increasing from 0.57 to 1.20 μmol/g after only 1 y of implementation (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). TBRs of these Nicaraguan children after fortification (0.93 mmol) were identical to our VA+ dosed group (0.95 mmol). These data, along with the current study, suggest that consumption of VA above required levels can lead to an increase in TBR in a short period.</p>
              <p>Although provitamin A carotenoids are an ideal choice for meeting optimal VA status because of their efficacy and regulation of absorption and bioconversion, the orange maize group continued to absorb and convert β-carotene to VA, increasing liver stores, even though their liver reserves were also &gt;1.0 μmol/g. This may be explained by the “last in–first out” hypothesis of VA metabolism—that is, recently ingested VA will be preferentially secreted into circulation for use by tissues, whereas stores are maintained in the liver for a future period of low VA intake (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). Further elucidation of VA stores with long-term consumption of provitamin A carotenoids should be investigated. β-Carotene is regarded as safe, even at doses of 180 mg/d. Carotenodermia is a adverse effect with high consumption (&gt;30 mg/d), but βC is not carcinogenic, mutagenic, embryotoxic, or teratogenic and does not appear to cause hypervitaminosis A (when assessed for clinical symptoms or by SR) (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). It is unclear whether β-carotene could lead to high VA stores over time, as our children were also consuming preformed VA from study foods (e.g., small dried fish) and off-site intake. Regulation presumably occurred because the bioconversion factor obtained (10.4 μg βCEs/1 μg retinol) is higher than other estimates from maize in humans from single test meals [i.e., 3.2 (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) and 6.5 (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>)].</p>
              <p>Our findings using the <sup>13</sup>C-RID test demonstrate that orange maize is an efficacious VA source in humans. Contrary to previous thinking, baseline estimates showed no VAD and high liver stores in rural Zambian children. We hypothesize that multiple years of high-dose supplements and sugar fortification on top of an already adequate diet (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) has led to excessive stores in these children. More sensitive measures of VA status other than SR, notably stable isotope methods, should be used for population and intervention evaluation.</p>
