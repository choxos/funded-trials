                  <title>Purpose:</title>
                  <p>The purpose of this study is to evaluate ponatinib for advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST).</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Patients and Methods:</title>
                  <p>This single-arm phase II trial enrolled patients with metastatic and/or unresectable GIST with failure of prior tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment into two cohorts based on presence or absence of <italic toggle="yes">KIT</italic> exon 11 (ex11) primary mutations. Patients initially received ponatinib 45 mg once daily. Following a temporary clinical hold in October 2013, dose reductions were implemented to reduce risk of arterial occlusive events (AOE). Primary endpoint was 16-week clinical benefit rate (CBR) in <italic toggle="yes">KIT</italic> ex11–positive cohort. <italic toggle="yes">KIT</italic> mutations in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) were assessed.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results:</title>
                  <p>Forty-five patients enrolled (30 <italic toggle="yes">KIT</italic> ex11–positive and 15 <italic toggle="yes">KIT</italic> ex11–negative); median follow-up was 14.7 and 13.6 months, respectively, as of August 1, 2016. Sixteen-week CBR was 36% (<italic toggle="yes">KIT</italic> ex11–positive; primary endpoint) and 20% (<italic toggle="yes">KIT</italic> ex11–negative). ctDNA analyses (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 37) demonstrated strong concordance of primary <italic toggle="yes">KIT</italic> mutations between plasma and tumor. At least two secondary mutations were detected in 35% of patients overall and 54% of <italic toggle="yes">KIT</italic> ex11–positive patients. Changes from baseline in mutated ctDNA levels were consistent with clinical activity. Ponatinib was ineffective in patients with <italic toggle="yes">KIT</italic> exon 9 primary mutations. Resistance was associated with emergence of V654A. AOEs and venous thromboembolic events occurred in three and two patients, respectively. Six patients died; two deaths (pneumonia and pulmonary embolism) were considered possibly ponatinib-related.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions:</title>
                  <p>Ponatinib demonstrated activity in advanced GIST, particularly in <italic toggle="yes">KIT</italic> ex11–positive disease. ctDNA analysis confirmed heterogeneous resistance mutations in TKI-pretreated advanced GIST. Safety was consistent with previous studies.</p>

              <p>Ponatinib demonstrated antitumor activity in patients with advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), particularly in those with <italic toggle="yes">KIT</italic> exon 11 mutations. Analysis of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) confirmed heterogeneous resistance mutations in patients with advanced GIST previously treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a clinical trial in advanced GIST in which patient enrollment was prospectively guided by mutational status. Our results demonstrate that trials evaluating TKI efficacy based on primary GIST mutations are feasible and informative. There was concordance between primary mutations detected in plasma ctDNA using beads, emulsions, amplification, and magnetics (BEAMing) and in tumor biopsies. The majority of patients had primary and/or secondary <italic toggle="yes">KIT</italic> mutations detected in plasma. The incomplete spectrum of <italic toggle="yes">KIT</italic> mutations detectable by BEAMing may be overcome by use of next-generation sequencing. Future GIST trials should continue to evaluate ctDNA using sequencing-based approaches.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) are the most common mesenchymal malignancy of the gastrointestinal tract, with an estimated annual incidence of 5,000 to 6,000 new cases in the United States (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1, 2</xref>). Oncogenic, gain of function mutations in <italic toggle="yes">KIT</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">PDGFRA</italic> are found in approximately 85% and 5% of GIST, respectively (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3, 4</xref>). Although the currently approved tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) for <italic toggle="yes">KIT</italic>-mutant GIST (first-line: imatinib; second-line: sunitinib; third-line: regorafenib, fourth-line: ripretinib; refs. <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5–7</xref>) are typically initially effective in the treatment of unresectable disease, the emergence of secondary mutations and subsequent disease progression is a major challenge in the treatment of GIST (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8–10</xref>). Patients with GIST refractory to approved TKIs typically experience rapid disease progression; median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) generally decrease with each additional line of treatment (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11–15</xref>).</p>
              <p>Ponatinib, a potent BCR::ABL1 inhibitor, is a third-generation TKI designed to potently inhibit BCR::ABL1 with or without any single resistance mutation, including T315I. In the United States, ponatinib is approved for the treatment of adults with chronic phase (CP) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) with resistance or intolerance to at least two prior kinase inhibitors; accelerated phase (AP) or blast phase (BP) CML or Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL) for whom no other kinase inhibitor is indicated; and for T315I-positive CML or Ph+ ALL (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Ponatinib has potent preclinical activity against mutated KIT and platelet-derived growth factor-α (PDGFRA), including clinically relevant mutations found in GIST that confer resistance to available TKIs (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17, 18</xref>). Detailed <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> analysis has shown that ponatinib has a broad, but imperfect, inhibitory profile against various KIT mutations (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Ponatinib demonstrated strong potency against KIT with primary mutations in exon 11 (ex11) and most secondary mutations, including mutations in the activation loop (exon 17/18) and at the T670 gatekeeper residue (exon 14). However, ponatinib had reduced activity against KIT with an exon 13 (V654A) secondary mutation or with an exon 9 (ex9) primary activating mutation (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).</p>
              <p>The strong preclinical activity of ponatinib against KIT and PDGFRA supported its clinical investigation in patients with GIST. The objective of the current phase II study (NCT01874665) was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ponatinib in patients with advanced GIST after failure of prior TKI therapy; biomarker assessments were also performed. Given the known preclinical profile of ponatinib, patients were prospectively enrolled into two cohorts based on the presence or absence of primary <italic toggle="yes">KIT</italic> ex11 mutations; ctDNA analysis was performed to explore the relationship between tumor mutation status and ponatinib activity in this heavily pretreated population.</p>

                <title>Study design</title>
                <p>In this phase II, single-arm, open-label, multicenter study, patients were enrolled in one of two cohorts, the <italic toggle="yes">KIT</italic> ex11–positive (<italic toggle="yes">KIT</italic> ex11–pos) or the <italic toggle="yes">KIT</italic> ex11–negative (<italic toggle="yes">KIT</italic> ex11-neg) as reported by investigators based on historical tumor analysis. Tumor <italic toggle="yes">KIT/PDGFRA</italic> mutations were recorded for all patients enrolled in the study. If the patient did not have a genetic analysis of a tumor sample performed at a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments–certified laboratory, mutational analysis of <italic toggle="yes">KIT/PDGFRA</italic> genes in at least 1 archival tumor specimen was performed. Patients who did not have an archival specimen were required to undergo a tumor biopsy for genetic analysis. Blood samples were obtained at baseline and at times of tumor assessment for detection of mutations in <italic toggle="yes">KIT</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">PDGFRA</italic> in circulating DNA.</p>
                <p>All patients started on 45 mg/day ponatinib; treatment continued until the occurrence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Between October 8, 2013, and May 21, 2014, a temporary clinical hold was imposed by the FDA on all ponatinib trials in order to assess the risk of vascular occlusive events and to provide dose reduction instructions for management of these events. A total of 45 patients were enrolled prior to the hold; of those, 13 patients were censored. After the October 2013 temporary clinical hold, eligibility was amended to include only those patients who had received all three TKIs approved for GIST at that time (imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib); enrolled patients who had not received at least 3 prior therapies were discontinued if they had not achieved at least stable disease (SD) lasting ≥16 weeks during ponatinib treatment. Accordingly, patients with SD or better at the end of Cycle 6 (1 cycle = 4 weeks) had ponatinib reduced to 30 mg/day if the dose was not already reduced for other reasons; doses could be escalated to 45 mg/day upon disease progression. Reduction of ponatinib dose to as low as 15 mg/day was permitted to manage drug-related adverse events (AE) or drug–drug interactions, and the dose could be re-escalated up to 45 mg/day once events resolved. Ponatinib was supplied as oral tablets in either the 45-mg or 15-mg strengths.</p>
                <p>This study was conducted in accordance with the ethical standards consistent with the Declaration of Helsinki and with Good Clinical Practice guidelines and all applicable regulatory requirements. The protocol and the informed consent received institutional review board/ethics committee approval. All patients signed the informed consent.</p>

                <p>Patients ≥18 years of age with histologically confirmed metastatic and/or unresectable GIST who experienced progression on prior TKIs were eligible. At study initiation, patients with failure of at least one prior TKI treatment were eligible. After the October 2013 temporary clinical hold, eligibility was amended to include only those patients who had received all three approved TKIs for GIST at that time (imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib); enrolled patients who had not received at least three prior therapies were discontinued if they had not achieved at least SD lasting ≥16 weeks during ponatinib treatment. Eligible patients had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status ≤2, measurable disease per modified RECIST version 1.1 (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), and adequate hepatic, renal, and pancreatic function. Patients with clinically significant, uncontrolled, or active cardiovascular disease, uncontrolled hypertension, uncontrolled hypertriglyceridemia, a bleeding disorder, ongoing or active infection, or those taking medications with risk of serious cardiac ventricular arrhythmias (e.g., torsades de pointes) were excluded, as were patients with history of chronic pancreatitis or acute pancreatitis within 1 year prior to study commencement. Women who were pregnant or lactating were not eligible. The use of approved TKIs or investigational agents within 2 weeks or six half-lives of the agent prior to start of treatment (whichever was longer) was prohibited.</p>

                <p>Tumor response was assessed by CT or magnetic resonance imaging every two cycles for the first six cycles and every three cycles thereafter. PFS was defined as the time from start of ponatinib administration to objective disease progression or death due to any cause. OS data were collected every 6 months following discontinuation for up to 24 months after enrollment of the last patient.</p>

                <p>A total of 45 patients were enrolled and initiated ponatinib treatment at three centers in the United States between June 5, 2013, and October 1, 2014.

                <title>Association of <italic toggle="yes">KIT</italic> mutations detected in ctDNA with antitumor activity of ponatinib</title>
                <p>At the time of ctDNA analyses (March 2, 2015), a total of 105 plasma samples from 37 patients were analyzed (Supplementary Table S3); 28 patients had baseline and postbaseline samples. In 100% (17/17) of cases in which the primary <italic toggle="yes">KIT</italic> mutation detected in the tumor was included in the BEAMing panel, the same mutation was also detected in the plasma (Supplementary Fig. S2). In the 12 cases in which the primary <italic toggle="yes">KIT</italic> mutation detected in the tumor was not included in the BEAMing panel, no primary mutations were detected in the plasma.</p>
                <p>Analysis of ctDNA revealed a high degree of tumor heterogeneity, with at least two (and up to eight) unique secondary <italic toggle="yes">KIT</italic> mutations detected in 35% (13/37) of all patients and 54% (13/24) of patients in the <italic toggle="yes">KIT</italic> ex11–pos cohort (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). In order to understand the heterogeneity and dynamics of resistance mutations post-ponatinib treatment, mutation dynamics in individual patients and the dynamics of the most common secondary mutations [V654A (exon 13), N822K, Y823D, D820A/G (all in exon 17/18)] were assessed (Supplementary Figs. S3 and S4). Although V654A was only detectable at baseline in one patient, it frequently emerged during treatment with ponatinib, becoming detectable in eight additional patients (range, 60–480 days of ponatinib treatment). Sustained or transient decreases in ctDNA levels were seen in the majority of patients with N822K, Y823D, or D820A/G.</p>

                <p>A summary of CBR and mutational status at baseline is included in Supplementary Table S4. The CBR was 43% (95% CI, 18%–71%) and median PFS was 6.54 months (range, 0.03 months–10.58 months) in patients with <italic toggle="yes">KIT</italic> ex11–pos tumors with secondary exon 17/18 mutations detected at baseline (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 24). Following ponatinib treatment, a correlation between the change in tumor burden and change in plasma mutation load was observed (Spearman correlation = 0.6298; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.0039; <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 19; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Changes in target lesion size were generally associated with changes in ctDNA levels. Decreases in target lesion size and ctDNA levels were observed in patients with primary ex11, but not exon 9 mutations. Exon 9 primary and V654A (exon 13) secondary mutation ctDNA levels generally increased during ponatinib treatment. ctDNA levels of the most common exon 17/18 mutations decreased in a majority of patients during ponatinib treatment.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>In this phase II study in patients with advanced GIST who progressed on prior TKIs, ponatinib showed evidence of clinical activity in patients with activating mutations in <italic toggle="yes">KIT</italic> ex11. Clinical benefit (43% CBR) was observed in patients with primary <italic toggle="yes">KIT</italic> ex11 mutations and secondary exon 17/18 mutations detected at baseline. Ponatinib had no clinical activity in patients with primary mutations in <italic toggle="yes">KIT</italic> ex9. Consistent with the observed clinical activity, ctDNA levels of the most common exon 17 and exon 18 mutations typically decreased during ponatinib treatment, whereas ctDNA levels of <italic toggle="yes">KIT</italic> ex9 primary and V654A (exon 13) secondary mutations generally increased during treatment, the latter of which may represent a key acquired resistance mechanism. Associations between <italic toggle="yes">KIT</italic> mutation status assessed using ctDNA and ponatinib antitumor activity correlated with data from preclinical models that demonstrated that ponatinib has potent activity against secondary mutations such as N822K, Y823D, and D820A/G but not against V654A (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). ctDNA analysis indicated the presence of at least two secondary mutations in 54% of patients with <italic toggle="yes">KIT</italic> ex11 mutations. The reduced activity of ponatinib in <italic toggle="yes">KIT</italic> ex11–negative patients could be attributed to the presence of other mutations such as <italic toggle="yes">KIT</italic> ex9. Previous preclinical studies demonstrated limited activity of ponatinib in ex9 mutant models (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). In addition, the lack of activity in patients with <italic toggle="yes">KIT</italic> ex9 mutations is not unique and was previously reported in the phase III trial of nilotinib versus imatinib, in which nilotinib demonstrated reduced efficacy compared with imatinib (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). These findings suggest that the presence of a <italic toggle="yes">KIT</italic> ex11 mutation may serve as a response biomarker for ponatinib. Furthermore, the presence of <italic toggle="yes">KIT</italic> ex9 mutation may serve as a marker of resistance to ponatinib. However, additional studies are needed because the observed resistance to ponatinib could be due to the presence of other mutations, such as <italic toggle="yes">KIT</italic> exon 17 or exon 13 mutations.</p>
              <p>The safety profile of ponatinib in this study is consistent with that reported in leukemia studies (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26, 27</xref>), with the exception that myelosuppression occurred less frequently in patients with GIST. Based on experience in phase I and phase II clinical studies, the starting dose of ponatinib used was 45 mg/day in order to maximize potential efficacy in this heavily pretreated patient population. To reduce the potential risk of AOEs due to long-term exposure, the ponatinib dose was reduced after six cycles of treatment to 30 mg/day in patients with SD or better, if it had not already been reduced for other reasons. In this heavily pretreated population, ponatinib showed modest response and clinical benefit rates with limited durability of response. Based on the dose-dependent toxicities observed in this study, lower dosing (30 mg) was used in the POETIG phase II trial in pretreated patients with GIST (NCT03171389; ref. <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>).</p>
              <p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a clinical trial in advanced GIST in which patient enrollment was prospectively guided by mutational status and ctDNA analysis was incorporated to better understand acquired resistance to ponatinib. Our results support the utility of this approach and demonstrate that clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of TKIs based on primary tumor mutation in GIST are feasible and informative. ctDNA analysis by BEAMing further defined the primary and secondary resistance landscape in this trial. There was concordance between primary mutations detected in ctDNA using BEAMing and in tumor biopsies. BEAMing detected primary and/or secondary <italic toggle="yes">KIT</italic> mutations in plasma from the majority of patients enrolled; the incomplete spectrum of <italic toggle="yes">KIT</italic> mutations detectable by BEAMing may be overcome by use of next-generation sequencing approaches (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29–31</xref>). Future GIST trials should continue to evaluate ctDNA using sequencing-based approaches. The utility of ctDNA analysis in the management of patients with GIST was demonstrated in a study that included 243 patients with GIST. In comparison with analysis of tumor mutations, plasma ctDNA analysis had a positive predictive value of 100%. ctDNA analysis provides a rapid, noninvasive approach to characterize current mutations, thereby allowing tailored, personalized therapeutic strategies based on resistance mutations (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>).</p>
              <p>The trial had several limitations. Although patient enrollment was guided by <italic toggle="yes">KIT</italic> ex11 mutation status, grouping all <italic toggle="yes">KIT</italic> ex11–negative patients in one cohort posed challenges in interpreting the lack of activity due to the heterogeneity of the clinical impact of various mutations on response to treatment. In addition, most patients included in the study were white (98%), which may impact the broad applicability of the findings. Further mutational analysis is needed to mechanistically define the limited activity of ponatinib in <italic toggle="yes">KIT</italic> ex11–negative patients and to determine whether this was solely due to the presence of <italic toggle="yes">KIT</italic> ex9 mutation or combinations of other relevant mutations. Another key limitation of the trial is the limited number of patients with <italic toggle="yes">KIT</italic> exon 13 and exon 17 mutations.</p>
              <p>The emergence of two or more secondary mutations in a large proportion of patients suggests a high degree of underlying tumor heterogeneity and indicates that effective treatment approaches for GIST may require earlier use of pan-<italic toggle="yes">KIT</italic> inhibitors or combination therapies that can suppress development of resistance mutations. Although ponatinib will not be developed further in GIST due to the risk/benefit profile, future studies in GIST should focus on informative study designs, based on strong preclinical data with robust correlatives together with broad coverage of known resistance mutations.</p>
