                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">HIV incidence among pregnant and postpartum women remains high in South Africa. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) use remains suboptimal in this population, particularly during the postpartum period when womenâs engagement with routine clinic visits outside PrEP decreases. Key barriers to sustained PrEP use include the need for ongoing contact with the health facility and suboptimal counseling around effective PrEP use.</p>

                  <p id="Par2">Stepped Care to Optimize PrEP Effectiveness in Pregnant and Postpartum women (SCOPE-PP), is a two-stepped unblinded, individually randomized controlled trial (RCT) that aims to optimize peripartum and postpartum PrEP use by providing a stepped package of evidence-based interventions. We will enroll 650 pregnant women (<underline>&gt;</underline>â25âweeks pregnant) who access PrEP at a busy antenatal clinic in Cape Town at the time of recruitment and follow them for 15âmonths. We will enroll and individually randomize pregnant women <underline>&gt;</underline>â16âyears who are not living with HIV who are either on PrEP or interested in starting PrEP during pregnancy. In step 1, we will evaluate the impact of enhanced adherence counselling and biofeedback (using urine tenofovir tests for biofeedback) and rapid PrEP collection (to reduce time required) on PrEP use in early peripartum compared to standard of care (SOC) (<italic>n</italic>Â =â325 per arm). The primary outcome is PrEP persistence per urine tenofovir levels and dried blood spots of tenofovir diphosphate (TFV-DP) after 6-months. The second step will enroll and individually randomize participants from Step 1 who discontinue taking PrEP or have poor persistence in Step 1 but want to continue PrEP. Step 2 will test the impact of enhanced counseling and biofeedback plus rapid PrEP collection compared to community PrEP delivery with HIV self-testing on PrEP use (nâ=âup to 325 postpartum women). The primary outcome is PrEP continuation and persistence 6-months following second randomization (~â9-months postpartum). Finally, we will estimate the cost effectiveness of SCOPE-PP vs. SOC per primary outcomes and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) averted in both Step 1 and 2 using micro-costing with trial- and model-based economic evaluation.</p>

              <p id="Par24">Women in sub-Saharan Africa face high HIV acquisition risk during pregnancy and breastfeeding with HIV incidence doubling during pregnancy and the postpartum period compared with non-pregnant/breastfeeding women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Seroconversion during pregnancy or breastfeeding substantially increases the risk of vertical transmission, and accounts for nearly one-third of all infant HIV infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. As fertility rates in the region remain high [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], high HIV risk during pregnancy and postpartum translates to a substantial cumulative period of risk for women spanning over decades of womenâs lives, underscoring the urgent need for prevention interventions tailored to at-risk pregnant and postpartum women. While the elimination of mother-to-child transmission (eMTCT) services have expanded rapidly in the region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], few prevention interventions exist for most pregnant women who initially test HIV-negative. This is a major missed opportunity that has implications for women, their partners, and infants.</p>
              <p id="Par25">The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends offering pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to pregnant and postpartum women at risk for HIV acquisition as a female-controlled prevention strategy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The South African National PrEP guidelines were updated in 2020 to include offering PrEP to PBFW not living with HIV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, current oral PrEP (TDF-FDC) must be taken daily for it to be effective. PrEP persistence in women has been low in South Africa and surrounding countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Our PrEP in pregnant and postpartum (PrEP-PP) study was one of the first studies to integrate PrEP into government maternal and child health care services in South Africa. Preliminary findings from the study show high levels of PrEP initiation (&gt;â85% of eligible women), but low levels of continuation on PrEP (&lt;â60% of women at 6âmonths postpartum) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Innovative PrEP optimization strategies are needed to reach PBFW at risk of HIV acquisition, particularly postpartum.</p>
              <p id="Par26">Barriers to optimal PrEP use among PBFW span across health facility-, intrapersonal-, and interpersonal-levels. In surveys and in-depth interviews with women on PrEP, our team found that many women underestimated their partnerâs risk of living with HIV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Women often reported needing permission from their partners to use PrEP and feared disclosing to their partners that they are taking PrEP. Noticeable drop-offs in clinic visits for PrEP collection and PrEP persistence among postpartum women were largely contributed to decreased clinic attendance postpartum (as women no longer attended antenatal care (ANC) services) and periods of postpartum abstinence where they had low risk of HIV acquisition and therefore stopped taking PrEP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. For postpartum women, PrEP consultations may be the only reason to visit the facility, adding substantial time and travel burden. Finally, standard PrEP counseling is based on self-reported persistence, which may over report drug persistence and therefore miss opportunities for in-depth, tailored persistence counseling that meet individual clientsâ needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par27">Stepped care to optimize PrEP effectiveness in pregnant and postpartum women (SCOPE-PP) is a two stepd, unblinded, individually randomized controlled trial (RCT) that aims to optimize postpartum PrEP use by providing a stepped package of evidence-based interventions. The intervention includes two steps implimented across two steps of the RCT: Step 1 intervention arm includes the offer of enhanced adherence counselling through biofeedback of tenofovir levels following a rapid urine tests and rapid PrEP collection (following HIV self-testing, [HIVST]); Step 2 women with poor PrEP continuation or persistence in Step 1 to either, (a) rapid PrEP (following HIVST) and the choice of commuinty PrEP pick-up points, or (b) biofeedback adherence counseling in the clinic. Intervention arms will be compared to the standard of care PrEP delivery per the South African National Department of Health guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. As part of the study we will estimate the cost effectiveness of SCOPE-PP vs. SOC per primary outcomes and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) averted in both Step 1 and 2 using micro-costing with trial- and model-based economic evaluation. By identifying optimal strategies for delivering PrEP to PBFW, this study can improve upon exisiting PrEP strategies to decrease HIV acquisition and vertical transmission in the region.</p>

In a subsidiary analysis, we will use joint modelling framework<sup>75</sup> to combine PrEP continuation and persistence measures into a single outcome variable.

The CFIR is a conceptual framework that provides systematic assessment of multilevel implementation contexts to identify factors that may influence implementation and effectiveness. The CFIR comprises of five major domains: (1) the characteristics of intervention, (2) inner setting, (3) outer setting, (4) the characteristics of individuals involved, and (5) the process by which implementation is accomplished and 39 constructs that influence the implementation of evidenced-based interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. We selected 4 CFIR domains and 9 constructs per domain that were most relevant to male partner HIV testing and maternal PrEP in Table <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref><bold>.</bold></p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par117">PrEP is scaling up among PBFW in sub-Saharan Africa with notable implementation successes in Kenya and ongoing demonstration projects in South Africa, Lesotho, Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] However, persistence to daily oral PrEP is challenging and data suggest that the transitional periods from pregnancy to postpartum present unique PrEP persistence barriers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. The SCOPE-PP trial will test innovative PrEP service deliver strategies specifically for postpartum women, and will step up interventions for women who are not adherent or have difficulty returning for clinical visits. To our knowledge, PrEP services have yet to distribute PrEP outside of the clinic setting (i.e., community distribution) in SA. Evidence is needed to motivate policy change for this opportunity.</p>
              <p id="Par118">In addition to behavioral and structural interventions in this study, there is a need for novel, longer-acting tools that prevent HIV acquisition in all populations, including PBFW [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Novel PrEP agents in the pipeline are promising and will increase HIV prevention options with anticipated improved persistence and protective coverage, including dapivirine vaginal rings (DPV-VR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], long acting injectables [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], and newer oral ARVs developed for treatment now utilized as PrEP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. When longer-acting methods become available in South Africa among PBFW, we will seek to include the choice of oral-TDF PrEP and other methods in the study to align with national and international norms. We will also evaluate the cost-effectiveness in terms of cases of HIV and DALYs averted through micro-costing to inform policy and maternal PrEP scale up.</p>

                <title>Dissemination policy</title>
                <p id="Par119">We will work closely with the South African Department of Health and implementing partners including those in the Western Cape Province, the National DOH, and District Medical Teams (see letters of support from the National and Cape Town DOH), to develop a sustainability and dissemination plan so that, if effective and cost effective, SCOPE-PP interventions and maternal PrEP services can be more effectively and sustainably integrated into regular clinic activities. Study procedures will be developed with an eye toward sustainability (e.g., training of trainerâs strategies, development of SC fidelity tools compatible with existing tools). The dissemination plan will include stakeholder meetings and presentations to facilities, District Management Teams, and the Provincial and National DOH. Our study will help the DOH update guidelines and targets for PrEP in pregnant and breastfeeding women. Our research will be rapidly disseminated to inform policy changes, future interventions, and NIH awards, in a timely and effective manner. We will publish five or more manuscripts on the outcomes of our research in high impact journals.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p id="Par120">The SCOPE-PP trial will evaluate the impact of interventions to improve daily oral PrEP use in peripartum and postpartum women at high risk of HIV acquisition. By identifying the optimal strategy for delivering PrEP to pregnant women, this study has the potential to lead to improved HIV prevention interventions to protect against HIV acquisition and vertical transmission in women not living with HIV and their infants. This study will estimate the incremental cost effectiveness and equity impact of the intervention to inform the scale up in South Africa and throughout the region.</p>
