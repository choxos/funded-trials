                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Interstitial lung disease is a frequent complication in sickle cell disease and is characterized by vascular remodeling and interstitial fibrosis. Bone marrow-derived fibrocytes have been shown to contribute to the pathogenesis of other interstitial lung diseases. The goal of this study was to define the contribution of fibrocytes to the pathogenesis of sickle cell lung disease.</p>

                  <title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title>
                  <p>Fibrocytes were quantified and characterized in subjects with sickle cell disease or healthy controls, and in a model of sickle cell disease, the NY1DD mouse. The role of the chemokine ligand CXCL12 in trafficking of fibrocytes and phenotype of lung disease was examined in the animal model. We found elevated concentration of activated fibrocytes in the peripheral blood of subjects with sickle cell disease, which increased further during vaso-occlusive crises. There was a similar elevations in the numbers and activation phenotype of fibrocytes in the bone marrow, blood, and lungs of the NY1DD mouse, both at baseline and under conditions of hypoxia/re-oxygenation. In both subjects with sickle cell disease and the mouse model, fibrocytes expressed a hierarchy of chemokine receptors, with CXCR4 expressed on most fibrocytes, and CCR2 and CCR7 expressed on a smaller subset of cells. Depletion of the CXCR4 ligand, CXCL12, in the mouse model resulted in a marked reduction of fibrocyte trafficking into the lungs, reduced lung collagen content and improved lung compliance and histology.</p>

              <p>Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common monogenic inherited disorder in African-Americans <xref rid="pone.0033702-AshleyKoch1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The two most common complications of SCD, vaso-occlusive pain crises (VOC) and acute chest syndrome (ACS), are the major risk factors for the development of interstitial lung disease (ILD) <xref rid="pone.0033702-Powars1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, a risk for morbidity and mortality in patients with SCD <xref rid="pone.0033702-Powars1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0033702-Powars2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. ILD is characterized by parenchymal and vascular remodeling among patients with SCD and has been associated with the development of pulmonary hypertension and, potentially through this mechanism, with increased mortality <xref rid="pone.0033702-Powars1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0033702-Gladwin1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Although most studies of SCLD have focused on vascular remodeling and pulmonary hypertension <xref rid="pone.0033702-Gladwin2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, patients with SCD have long been recognized to develop a progressive restrictive ventilatory defect and interstitial markings on chest radiographs <xref rid="pone.0033702-Powars1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0033702-Klings1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0033702-McMillan1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. While many adults with SCD do not exhibit all features of SCLD, a restrictive pattern on pulmonary function tests is the most consistent clinical feature; for example, 74% of adults in a large prospective cohort study SCD had restrictive lung disease <xref rid="pone.0033702-Klings1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. These studies underscore the need to better understand the pathogenesis of ILD in patients with SCD.</p>
              <p>Fibrotic lung diseases are associated with dysregulated repair in response to persistent or recurrent injury, leading to loss of alveolar-capillary basement membrane integrity and remodelling of the lung airpace, interstitial and vascular compartments <xref rid="pone.0033702-Strieter1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0033702-Strieter2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0033702-Strieter3" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0033702-Fukuda1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0033702-Marshall1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. The fibroblasts involved in this process are known to be derived, in part, from proliferation of resident lung fibroblasts. More recent evidence has implicated a bone marrow-derived circulating mesenchymal progenitor cell, the fibrocyte, in lung fibrosis and has changed the perspective of lung repair <xref rid="pone.0033702-Phillips1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0033702-Metz1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0033702-Bucala1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Fibrocytes express the hematopoietic stem cell antigen CD34, the common leukocyte marker CD45, the myeloid markers CD11b and CD13, and fibroblast markers vimentin, collagen I, collagen III and fibronectin, as well as several chemokine receptors <xref rid="pone.0033702-Keeley1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0033702-Strieter4" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0033702-Keeley2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Only a subset of circulating fibrocytes expresses CD34, and the expression of both CD34 and CD45 on fibrocytes decreases when the cells are cultured or after they enter tissue. Since there is no single marker unique for the identification of fibrocytes, the co-expression of collagen production and CD34 or CD45 has been commonly used to identify these cells <xref rid="pone.0033702-Keeley1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0033702-Strieter4" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0033702-Keeley2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.

Moreover, the number of circulating fibrocytes is a predictor of prognosis in patients with IPF <xref rid="pone.0033702-Moeller1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Given the role of fibrocytes in the pathogenesis of lung remodelling in other diseases, we postulated that these cells are important in the development of ILD in patients with SCD.</p>

              <p>Peripheral blood samples from adult patients with SCD or race-matched controls and bone marrow, blood and lungs of NY1DD mice or congenic C57BL/6 mice were processed for quantification and characterization of fibrocytes, as previously described <xref rid="pone.0033702-Gomperts1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0033702-Mehrad1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> (See the online supplement for additional details of methods used). In some experiments, animals were exposed to hypoxia-reoxygenation (3 h at 8% oxygen/92% nitrogen followed by 4 h at 21% oxygen/79% nitrogen) before tissue harvest. CXCL12 was neutralized in vivo as previously described <xref rid="pone.0033702-Phillips1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0033702-Phillips2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Lung mechanics of animals were assessed by FlexiVent using Quasi-static pressure-volume (PV) curve to calculate total lung compliance and elastance, and forced oscillatory measurements to measure frequency dependence of parenchymal tissue impedance and parenchymal tissue elastance according to manufacturer's instructions. Plasma samples were analyzed for cytokines by Luminex multiplex protein analysis as previously described <xref rid="pone.0033702-Phillips1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Lung collagen content was quantified using the Sircol assays (Biocolor Ltd., Belfast, United Kingdom) according to the manufacturer's instructions <xref rid="pone.0033702-Blease1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> and using morphometric analysis of histological samples after picrosirius red staining <xref rid="pone.0033702-Keane1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. To quantify picrosirius red stains, lungs were inflated, fixed and sectioned; photomicrographs were then obtained from 10 randomly selected medium power fields from the lung periphery in each slide. By obtaining images from the lung periphery only, we excluded fields that included large blood vessels or airways. In human subjects, fibrocyte concentrations were not distributed normally and were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test;. Subject demographics and SCD characteristics were analyzed with Chi-Square tests for categorical variables and either Student's t or Mann-Whitney U tests for continuous variables that were normally or non-normally distributed, respectively. Mouse fibrocyte data were normally distributed and were compared using Student's t test. Paired measurements were compared using Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-ranks test. Probability values were considered statistically significant if they were less than 0.05. Data analysis was performed in SAS version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).</p>

                <title>Fibrocytes are markedly elevated and activated in the circulation of patients with SCD at baseline</title>
                <p>Since previous studies had demonstrated that elevated fibrocytes can be found in the circulation of patients with ILD <xref rid="pone.0033702-Mehrad1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0033702-Moeller1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, we wanted to determine whether fibrocytes were present in patients with SCD under similar conditions (i.e., routine clinic visit with no clinical evidence of VOC). From a cohort of patients with SCD at Washington University in St. Louis, samples from 114 unique SCD patients along with 19 African American controls were collected and shipped overnight to the laboratory at UVA (RMS). Mean age was 34±12 years for the SCD cases and 41±4 years for the controls. Fifty-four percent of the SCD subjects were female, whereas 88% of the control participants were female. Among the SCD cases, 73% percent had HbSS or HbSbeta-thalassemia<sup>0</sup>; the remainder had HbSC and HbSbeta-thalassemia<sup>+</sup>. Nineteen percent of SCD subjects required home oxygen either continuously or at night. When subjects with more and less severe SCD phenotypes were compared (HbSS/HbSβ-thalassemia<sup>0</sup> vs. HbSC/HbSβ-thalassemia<sup>+</sup>), there were no differences in circulating fibrocyte levels (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0033702-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>

We chose to first gate on CD45+ rather than CD34+ cells, because we have historically found that the number of CD34+Col1+ fibrocytes in the circulation is an order of magnitude lower than CD45+Col1+ fibrocytes (data not shown). Fibrocyte levels were significantly higher in SCD cases compared to controls (median: 3.47×10<sup>5</sup> cells/ml vs. 1.49×10<sup>5</sup> cells/ml; p = 0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033702-g001">Figure 1A</xref>).

While tissue myofibroblasts can arise from cells other than fibroytes, prior literature indicated that in both in vitro studies and animal models, fibrocytes represent a progenitor cell that can differentiate into αSMA-expressing myofibroblast-like cells <xref rid="pone.0033702-Phillips1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0033702-Hong1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0033702-Mehrad2" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> and human lungs contain fibrocytes expressing the myofibrobast marker αSMA <xref rid="pone.0033702-AnderssonSjoland1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. We therefore also determined whether the elevation in circulating fibrocytes in the SCD patients was associated with increased numbers of αSMA+ fibrocytes in circulation by quantitative FACS analysis as previously described <xref rid="pone.0033702-Mehrad1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0033702-Moeller1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0033702-Mehrad2" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.

On this basis, we developed a strategy in our laboratory to detect activated receptor Smads (pSmad2/3) by quantitative FACS analysis, which we confirmed by using Western Blot analysis of cells stimulated with TGF-b. Fibrocytes in circulation of SCD patients were subsequently analyzed for activated receptor Smads (pSmad2/3) and were found to be significantly higher than controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033702-g001">Figure 1F</xref>).</p>

NY1DD mice under baseline conditions were treated with neutralizing anti-CXCL12 or control antibodies (i.p.

              <p>This study provides the first evidence that circulating CD45+Col I+CXCR4+ fibrocytes, recruited through the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis, contribute to the expansion of the fibroblast/myofibroblast-like cell population in people and mice with SCD. At baseline, NY1DD mice have increased fibrocytes in the bone marrow, circulation and lungs compared to controls and, similar to studies of subjects with IPF, the fibrocytes express the hierarchy of chemokine expression CXCR4≫CCR2&gt;CCR7. The CXCR4 ligand, CXCL12, is critical to CXCR4+ fibrocyte trafficking and neutralizing CXCL12 prevents fibrocyte extravasation into the lungs. These findings in NY1DD mice complement our initial findings in adult patients with SCD providing preliminary evidence for a role for fibrocytes in the development of human ILD.</p>
              <p>The pathogenesis of ILD in patients with SCD is poorly understood. Previously, ILD in this patient population was thought to be solely the result of repetitive infarcts occurring during ACS episodes <xref rid="pone.0033702-Powars1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Recently, a new paradigm has emerged for the understanding of vascular occlusion and end-organ damage in SCD, suggesting that SCD should be viewed as a disease characterized by subclinical, ongoing microvascular occlusion and punctuated by clinically apparent exacerbations <xref rid="pone.0033702-Wallace1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0033702-Kaul1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0033702-Osarogiagbon1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. In this model of SCD pathogenesis, end organ damage in SCD results from the total injury that occurs from clinical exacerbations plus ongoing, subclinical events. The findings of this study demonstrating organ damage and elevated levels of circulating fibrocytes at baseline in NY1DD mice support this notion of chronic microvascular occlusion, systemic inflammation and ongoing injury and repetitive repair, and provide a novel mechanism for the understanding of lung fibroproliferation in chronic ILD in patients with SCD.</p>
              <p>Since the initial observations of ILD in patients with SCD were published <xref rid="pone.0033702-Powars1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, newer data describing the role of nitric oxide depletion, hemolysis and pulmonary hypertension in pathogenesis of SCD has emerged <xref rid="pone.0033702-Gladwin1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0033702-Gladwin2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. In a prior study, Powars et al describe chronic sickle cell lung disease as a disorder characterized by pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary hypertension and a mean survival of 5 years <xref rid="pone.0033702-Powars1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. More recently, several large studies have demonstrated an increased risk of death associated with pulmonary hypertension in adults with SCD <xref rid="pone.0033702-Gladwin2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0033702-DeCastro1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0033702-Ataga1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Potentially, the mortality risk associated with chronic sickle cell lung disease in the prior study was due to pulmonary hypertension and not pulmonary fibrosis. However, examining the etiology of ILD in patients with SCD is important, because ILD has been shown to contribute to the development of pulmonary hypertension in SCD <xref rid="pone.0033702-Anthi1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Although the findings in current study implicate fibrocytes in the pathogenesis of ILD, future studies should focus on the potential role of fibrocytes in the vascular remodeling of pulmonary hypertension in SCD.</p>
              <p>Circulating fibrocytes contribute to the fibroproliferation in the lung seen in NY1DD mice. At baseline, there is increased collagen deposition in the lung of NY1DD mice compared to control mice demonstrating the active fibroproliferation in the lungs of NY1DD mice. In the bone marrow, circulation and lungs of NY1DD mice, fibrocytes are increased compared to controls and there is a subpopulation of αSMA+ cells, consistent with a fibroblast/myofibroblast-like cell. Although we cannot define the lineage of αSMA+ cells based on our data, the presence of elevated αSMA+ fibrocytes in the bone marrow of NY1DD mice suggests that these cells are beginning to undergo differentiation to a fibroblast/myofibroblast-like cells in the bone marrow. Consistent with our findings of CXCR4 predominance on circulating fibrocytes in other mouse models of pulmonary fibrosis <xref rid="pone.0033702-Mehrad1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0033702-AnderssonSjoland1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, the majority of fibrocytes in NY1DD mice express CXCR4. The only known ligand for CXCR4, CXCL12, was markedly elevated in the lungs of NY1DD mice compared to controls, and neutralizing CXCL12 attenuated extravasation of fibrocytes into the lungs of NY1DD mice and reduced lung collagen deposition. Taken together, these findings support the notion that, at baseline, fibrocytes are expanded in the bone marrow, mobilized to the circulation, home and extravasate in the lung of SCD mice dependent upon the CXCR4/CXCL12 chemokine axis.</p>
              <p>In NY1DD mice, fibrocytes increase during hypoxia/reoxygenation compared to levels during normoxic conditions. Although no animal model fully recapitulates human disease, inducing hypoxia in NY1DD mice is thought to be analogous to a VOC in patients with SCD <xref rid="pone.0033702-Wallace1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0033702-Kaul1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Given that the natural history of SCD is characterized by disease exacerbations or VOC <xref rid="pone.0033702-Platt1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, hypoxia/reoxygenation in the mouse model approximates human disease. The current data suggest that VOC causes increased fibrocyte mobilization into circulation in both human SCD and the mouse model, and potentially promotes increased lung fibrosis.</p>
              <p>Similar to findings in the NY1DD mouse, fibrocytes are elevated at baseline in patients with SCD compared to healthy control subjects. The chemokine hierarchy of CXCR4≫CCR2&gt;CCR7 was also present in patients with SCD, suggesting that the CXCR4/CXCL12 chemokine axis is used for fibrocyte trafficking. Although circulating CXCL12 was higher in patients with SCD compared to controls, this did not reach statistical significance. CXCL12 was only measured in a subset of our patients and this may have limited our ability to detect a difference between cases and controls. Moreover, the lung should be the site for elevated levels of CXCL12 in order to promote a “chemotactic gradient” for CXCR4+ fibrocytes; and we found elevated levels of CXCL12 in the lungs of NY1DD mice. However, since plasma levels of CXCL12 were not significantly different between SCD subjects and controls, we can only postulate that in human SCD the CXCR4/CXCL12 chemokine axis and the gradient of CXCL12 in the lung is responsible for fibrocyte homing. During a VOC, fibrocyte levels within SCD subjects increased significantly over baseline and demonstrated an activated phenotype. Repeat measurements within an individual using a longitudinal study design provides assurance that the findings are not due to inter-individual variation. Our study was not designed to determine cause and effect between VOC and fibrocyte levels in patients with SCD. We can only report an association. Regardless of whether vaso-occlusion causes increased fibrocyte levels or vice versa, higher levels of fibrocytes in association with VOC may promote fibroproliferation and end organ damage. These data are consistent with NY1DD mice and support the notion that disease exacerbations (i.e., VOC) significantly contribute to the development of end organ disease. Furthermore, these data provide preliminary evidence that the pathophysiology and pathology we found in the NY1DD mouse can be translated to patients with SCD.</p>
              <p>Taken together, our data in NY1DD mice and supported by evidence in patients with SCD suggests a novel model of ILD pathogenesis in SCD. This new paradigm for understanding the mechanism of pulmonary fibrosis in SCD implicating bone-marrow-derived fibrocytes is consistent with findings in IPF. Based on the data from this study, we postulate that inflammatory “signals” (i.e., CXCL12) generated in the lung communicate with the bone marrow leading to expansion of fibrocytes. The condition of vaso-occlusion (i.e., either subclinical or VOC) in the bone marrow creates an environment that is hypoxic in nature, which favors the induction of CXCR4 expression on fibrocytes that ultimately enhances their homing and extravasation at the target organ site (i.e., lung) in response to CXCL12. These circulating fibrocytes, largely CXCR4+, will only home and extravasate into an end-organ (i.e., lung) if there is the appropriate “address” signal, such as lung-specific expression of a chemokine ligand (i.e., CXCL12) to CXCR4. Once fibrocytes home and extravasate into the lung dependent on the CXCL12/CXCR4 biological axis, the data from our NY1DD mice suggests that they play a major role in functioning as mesenchymal progenitor cells for the production of extra-cellular matrix and contribution to fibrosis in the lungs of patients with SCD.</p>
              <p>In summary, our results provide a new basis for understanding the pathogenesis of ILD in patients with SCD, a common and serious complication in this patient population <xref rid="pone.0033702-Powars1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0033702-Powars2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0033702-Klings1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The findings of our study offer the opportunity to therapeutically target fibrocytes by attenuating their recruitment into the lung in order to prevent pulmonary fibrosis.. Future studies are needed to examine strategies to attenuate fibrocytes and determine the impact on the longitudinal development of ILD in patients with SCD.</p>
