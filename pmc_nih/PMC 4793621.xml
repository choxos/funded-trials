                  <p>Fibromyalgia is a condition characterized by chronic widespread muscle pain and fatigue and associated with significant impairment in perceived function and reduced physical performance. The purpose of this study was to determine the degree to which pain and fatigue are associated with perceived function and physical performance in women with fibromyalgia.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Hierarchical linear regression determined the contribution of pain and fatigue (Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) for resting, movement and combined) to perceived function (Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire Revised - Function Subscale, FIQR-Function), Multidimensional Assessment of Fatigue - Activities of Daily Living (MAF-ADL) and SF-36 Physical Function Subscale (SF-36-PF) and physical performance (6-Minute Walk Test, 6MWT and Five Time Sit To Stand, 5TSTS) while controlling for age, body mass index, pain catastrophizing, fear of movement, anxiety, and depression in women with fibromyalgia (N = 94).</p>

                  <p>For perceived function, movement pain and movement fatigue together better predicted FIQR-function (adjusted R<sup>2</sup> = 0.42, <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.001); MAF-ADL (adjusted R<sup>2</sup> = 0.41, <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.001); and SF-36-PF function (adjusted R<sup>2</sup> = 0.34, <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.001). For physical performance measures, movement pain and fatigue together predicted 6MWT distance (adjusted R<sup>2</sup> = 0.42, <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.001) and movement fatigue alone predicted performance time on the 5TSTS (adjusted R<sup>2</sup> = 0.20, <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.001).</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p>Fibromyalgia is a condition characterized by chronic widespread muscle pain, affecting 4–10 % of the US population, the majority of which are women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. While pain is the defining characteristic for diagnosing fibromyalgia, fatigue is also a common complaint for individuals with fibromyalgia. For example, Bennett et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] found pain and fatigue emerged as the top two of six distinct clinical features of fibromyalgia in a sample of 788 people with fibromyalgia; 54 % perceived pain as their primary symptom and 28 % perceived fatigue as their main complaint.</p>
              <p>That study indicated while pain and fatigue commonly co-occur, they are clearly differentiated in people with fibromyalgia. One of the most challenging aspects of fibromyalgia is the variable nature of pain among individuals with fibromyalgia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Pain for individuals with fibromyalgia may be associated with morning stiffness as well as pain increases throughout the day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Average daily pain ratings may vary in individuals with fibromyalgia with increased pain in the morning and evening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Henriksson found that many people with fibromyalgia describe activities that aggravate the symptoms of fibromyalgia include carrying and holding objects and these activities are perceived as strenuous [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Pain in individuals with fibromyalgia has been associated with greater disease severity, reduced function and symptoms of fibromyalgia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Thus, pain is a significant symptom that may contribute to participation in physical function.</p>
              <p>The perception of fatigue is a significant symptom that, in addition to pain, may contribute to reduced participation in daily physical activities. Although fatigue is not part of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) clinical definition published in 1990, it is taken into consideration as part of the newer criteria published in 2010 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Fatigue is a major symptom that impacts function and is reported in nearly 100 % of the population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] People with fibromyalgia typically describe their physical fatigue as an overall feeling of tiredness or exhaustion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], as a failure to initiate or sustain physical activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], or having to take things slower in order to accomplish tasks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Individuals with fibromyalgia frequently report difficulty with daily functional tasks (e.g., pouring a cup of coffee, folding laundry, drying hair or getting dressed), [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] strenuous physical activities, and cognitive tasks such as paying bills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p>
              <p>Function is significantly impaired in people with fibromyalgia with poor perceived function observed on several self-report measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Physical performance on clinical tests, such as the 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT) or Five Time Sit To Stand (5TSTS) test, is also significantly reduced in this population when compared to healthy controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] Perceived function does not directly assess physical performance, and self-report and physical performance are not strongly correlated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Clinically, people with fibromyalgia report that both pain and fatigue are major barriers to their ability to participate in regular activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Pain and fatigue during functional activities, particularly movement pain and movement fatigue, may be greater barriers to participation in these activities and are significantly increased in people with fibromyalgia during fatiguing exercise tasks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. However, the degree to which pain and fatigue diminish perceived function and physical performance has not been well investigated.</p>
              <p>Accordingly, the primary purpose of this study was to determine the degree to which self-reported pain and fatigue intensities are associated with perceived function and physical performance in women with fibromyalgia. We hypothesized that higher levels of pain and fatigue would be associated with reductions in perceived function and physical performance, with pain and fatigue intensity each contributing unique information to the model. A secondary purpose was to investigate whether pain and fatigue assessed during rest, movement or the change between rest and movement would best predict perceived function and physical performance.</p>

Subjects are asked to indicate the degree to which fibromyalgia has impacted multiple domains. The three domains of the FIQR include function (nine items), symptoms (ten items) and overall impact (two items). For this study, only the function domain was used as a measure of disease-specific perceived function. The nine-function questions ask the subject to score the level of difficulty (0–10 scale from “no difficulty” to “very difficult”) with the following tasks: brush or comb your hair; walk continuously for 20 minutes; prepare a homemade meal; vacuum, scrub or sweep floors; lift and carry a bag full of groceries; climb one flight of stairs; change bed sheets; sit in a chair for 45 minutes; and go shopping for groceries. Each of the nine items is scored 0–10, summed, and then divided by three for a possible score of 0–30, where a higher score indicates greater perceived functional difficulty.

The relationships between individual variables were assessed using Pearson’s correlation coefficients and correlations r &lt; 0.70 was utilized for inclusion in the analysis.

                <p>The relationships between pain and fatigue with our primary outcome variables of perceived function (FIQR-Function, MAF-ADL and SF-36-PF) and secondary outcome variables of physical performance (6MWT, 5TSTS) were explored using hierarchical linear regression analyses (30 calculations were completed). We first included demographic (age and BMI) and psychological variables (pain catastrophizing, fear of movement, anxiety, depression) in our base regression models to understand the contributions of these control variables in predicting our outcome variables (step 1). Then separately, either pain (resting pain, movement pain, or pain change, step 2A) or fatigue (resting fatigue, movement fatigue, or fatigue change, step 2B) variables were added to the base models to examine how either pain or fatigue alone would improve the fit of the regression models in predicting perceived function or physical performance over the control variables. These are referred to as the single-predictor models, serving as intermediate steps in our hierarchical regression. Lastly, both pain and fatigue (resting, movement, or change) variables were included in the final step (step 3) for each of the five outcome variables. This allowed us to determine the degree to which accounting for both pain and fatigue improved the regression model fits beyond the single-predictor models which only included either pain or fatigue in isolation. For each step, adjusted R<sup>2</sup> values were calculated, reflecting the proportion of variance in the outcome variable explained by the model, adjusted for the number of predictors included in the model. The significance of the change in R<sup>2</sup> (ΔR<sup>2</sup>) between successive steps was assessed to determine whether the addition of pain or fatigue variables resulted in a significant improvement in predicting each outcome variable. To determine if the combination of pain and fatigue proved to be significantly better at predicting the outcomes than either pain or fatigue alone, the step 3 models were compared to the better of the two single-predictor (step 2A or 2B) models. To address our secondary aim, comparing resting, movement, and change scores for pain and fatigue, the models’ R<sup>2</sup> values using each form of assessment at each step in the hierarchical regression were compared. Because of the potential outlier BMIs in the study we repeated the analysis with the removal of the single highest BMI (70.19), and removal of the highest three BMI values (52.61, 70.19, 54.24). The regression models with and without these potential outliers did not significantly change. Thus, we report the data for the complete set only for brevity.

The change in fatigue intensity from resting to during movement ranged from a decrease of 8 to an increase of 5, with an average decrease in fatigue intensity rating after performing the 6MWT (-0.9 ± 2.4). Thus, some people showed a reduction in pain and fatigue intensity with movement while others showed increases.</p>

                <p>Supporting our initial hypothesis, including both movement pain and fatigue variables in the regression models (step 3) consistently resulted in significantly better predictions of perceived function based on the FIQR and MAF-ADL, indicating both pain and fatigue uniquely contribute to these outcomes than either one alone. For the MAF-ADL, the addition of resting pain (step 3) was not better than the model relying on resting fatigue alone (step 2B). The perceived function assessed by the SF-36 was approximately equally well predicted by either pain or fatigue alone, but no significant improvement was seen by including both pain and fatigue in the model.</p>
                <p>Overall, self-reported movement pain and fatigue intensities explained a higher proportion of the variance observed in all three perceived function assessments (FIQR-Function, MAF-ADL, and SF-36-PF) than self-reported resting pain and fatigue intensities (Table <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>). This was most notable for the resting pain scores as resting fatigue typically explained a greater proportion of perceived function than resting pain. However, movement pain intensity was often superior to movement fatigue intensity when they were considered in isolation (see Table <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>). The change scores for pain or fatigue intensities were not strongly associated with perceived function. Only two of the nine possible models including a change score provided significantly more predictive value than the lower level corresponding model: change in pain provided significantly more information than the control variables alone for MAF-ADL and SF-36-PF. Overall, movement pain and movement fatigue intensities together explained from 34 % to 42 % of the variance in perceived function, after controlling for age, BMI, pain catastrophizing, fear of movement, anxiety and depression, an increase of 19 to 29 % of the variance explained compared to the control variables alone.</p>

              <p>The current study shows that both pain and fatigue intensities are significant contributors to perceived function and physical performance. Using different perceived function measures and physical performance measures we show different contributions of pain and fatigue supporting that they are unique constructs affecting perceived function and physical performance Interestingly, in the current study there was a wide variation in the pain and fatigue response to movement with some showing increases and others no change or a decrease, suggesting a heterogeneous response to movement. In our models, pain and fatigue, along with demographic and psychological variables, explain up to 43 % of the variance observed in perceived function and up to 41 % of the variance observed in physical performance.</p>

                <title>Perceived function</title>
                <p>Perceived function has previously been measured in women with fibromyalgia with a variety of self-report measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. In agreement with the current study, Wolfe et al. found that the primary determinants of global severity and disease impact were pain, fatigue and function in individuals with fibromyalgia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] In addition to the FIQR and SF-36, we also examined the MAF-ADL as an additional measure of perceived function. Each tool provides a slight variation on perceived fatigue. The FIQR is a disease-specific measure of perceived function. The SF-36 is used across a wide range of patient populations as well as healthy control populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] making it a general measure of perceived function. The MAF-ADL provides an alternate assessment of perceived function with a greater emphasis on the impact of fatigue. Our findings extend the results from prior studies by examining the unique and distinct influences of pain and fatigue on evaluating perceived function using multiple related, yet unique, measures.</p>
                <p>Both the FIQR-Function and MAF-ADL were better represented by the inclusion of both pain and fatigue intensities in the model. The inclusion of pain and fatigue did not better explain the SF-36-PF. However, when pain or fatigue were considered in isolation, the FIQR-Function and SF-36-PF were equally well represented by either pain or fatigue, suggesting similar degrees of influence on these measures of perceived function. Conversely, for the MAF-ADL, fatigue was a better predictor than pain alone, consistent with its development as a tool to assess the impact of fatigue. Despite this, pain provided additional information in predicting the MAF-ADL, beyond fatigue alone. Thus, pain and fatigue are related to all three assessments of perceived function, particularly movement pain and movement fatigue.</p>
                <p>Psychological and demographic variables also contributed to perceived function. We found 11–22 % of the variance in perceived function was explained by a combination of age, BMI, and psychological traits. Pain catastrophizing was associated with duration of fibromyalgia diagnosis (r = 0.27–0.73, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], and predicted perception of pain better than age or education [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Prior studies also show that anxiety and depression contribute to decreased perceived function and increased disease impact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. The relationship between fear of movement and perceived function in individuals with fibromyalgia had not been previously studied. The associations observed between these variables in our cohort support that anxiety, depression, catastrophizing and fear are significantly related, and collectively influence perceived function in women with fibromyalgia.</p>

                <title>Physical performance</title>
                <p>Few studies have examined physical performance in individuals with fibromyalgia, and fewer still have examined factors associated with physical performance. We examined, for the first time, the association of pain and fatigue with two performance measures, the 6MWT and 5TSTS and show movement pain is associated with performance on 6MWT while resting and movement fatigue is associated with performance on the 5TSTS. In agreement with our study, a small study (n = 18) showed higher self-reported pain on the FIQ correlated with reduced walking distance in the 6MWT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Previous studies suggest that the 6MWT is a measure of endurance and the 5TSTS is a measure of strength [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] and are therefore thought to be different measures of performance. Our data confirm these measures are distinct and suggest pain has more influence on endurance whereas fatigue is more closely associated with strength. However, fatigue and endurance are inherently related constructs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], thus this finding is somewhat unexpected. We cannot rule out that this difference may be a result of the relatively small variance explained in the 5TSTS overall (20 %) relative to the 6MWT (42 %). The control variables, including age, BMI, and psychological traits, explained only 5 % of the variance in the 5TSTS, whereas 31 % of the variance in the 6MWT was explained by the control variables. These data support our proposal that physical performance measures are uniquely different from perceived function and thus provide a useful additional outcome measure to examine function in people with fibromyalgia.</p>

Indeed we show that fatigue is a common problem in this sample, averaging 6.5 on a 10-point scale. Further fatigue played a significant role in perceived function and physical performance. Our results support the inclusion of movement fatigue measures, in addition to movement pain measures, in future studies involving individuals with fibromyalgia since fatigue also influences physical performance and perceived function.</p>

                <title>Fibromyalgia and pain</title>
                <p>A number of studies have examined predictors of pain in individuals with fibromyalgia. These studies in general show that psychological factors, quantitative sensory tests, and clinical characteristics (age, BMI) contribute to the severity of pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Specifically, in people with fibromyalgia (n = 74), anxiety was most closely associated with the sensory dimension of pain, helplessness was most closely associated with the affective dimension of pain, and fear of pain was closely associated with pain intensity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Further, chronic widespread pain was predicted by the number of body pain areas, negative affect, heat, temporal summation of pain and ratings of “after sensations” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Greater physical pain was reported by women with fibromyalgia who were older, less educated, more depressed, and had higher BMI and those with osteoarthritis (n = 238) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Interestingly, a combination of tender point counts, negative affect and wind-up accounted for pain after sensations contributing up to 27 % [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Thus, multiple factors impact pain intensity experienced with fibromyalgia including the number of body pain areas, psychological constructs, and response to peripherally applied stimuli. The current study, on the other hand, showed pain severity contributes to perceived function and physical performance.</p>

                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p>While our intent was to assess perceived function and physical performance, we recognize the physical performance measures assessed (6MWT, 5TSTS) may not fully represent an individual’s function at home, work or in social situations. These assessments are commonly used to identify function in research and clinical practice settings using a standardized protocol, but may differ from an individual’s daily function. Another limitation in our study is the association between pain and fatigue that may limit the ability of regression models to fully assess their relative importance in predicting function. However, the use of hierarchical models allowed us to examine the contribution of each, limiting the influence of colinearity on our conclusions. Another limitation is the fact that we had a number of exclusion criteria, including male sex, which may limit some generalizability. In our sample, subjects had an average of 1.78 of 15 comorbidities with a range of 0 to 7. Finally, our analysis did not include all possible relevant predictors to perceived function and physical performance; the amount of variance explained suggests other factors also contribute to these outcomes. Future studies would benefit from the inclusion of sleep, physical activity levels and self-efficacy as these factors have been shown to contribute to fatigue and pain in fibromyalgia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>], and thus could contribute to physical performance and perceived function.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>The impact of pain and fatigue intensities is an important consideration in the assessment and treatment of individuals with fibromyalgia in a clinical setting. While these two constructs are clearly related, our findings indicate that pain and fatigue each have independent contributions to perceived function and physical performance. Further, assessment of pain and fatigue with movement, when compared to rest, shows greater associations with function. Thus, these findings suggest it would be important to assess both pain and fatigue intensities during clinical and functional activities and the timing of these assessments (before and during activities) in the clinic and at home may be important. Clinically, pain and fatigue may adversely impact patient performance, participation and follow through at home, work or social situations. Future studies should examine if interventions that improve pain or fatigue can also improve perceived function and physical performance.</p>
