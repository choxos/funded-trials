                <p>Patients with hematologic malignancies relapsing after allogeneic blood or marrow transplantation (BMT) have limited response to conventional salvage therapies, with an expected 1-year overall survival (OS) of &lt;20%. We evaluated the safety and clinical outcomes following administration of a novel T-cell therapeutic targeting 3 tumor-associated antigens (TAA-T) in patients with acute leukemia who relapsed or were at high risk of relapse after allogeneic BMT. Lymphocytes obtained from the BMT donor were manufactured to target TAAs WT1, PRAME, and survivin, which are over-expressed and immunogenic in most hematologic malignancies. Patients received TAA-T infusions at doses of 0.5 to 4 × 10<sup>7</sup>/m<sup>2</sup>. Twenty-three BMT recipients with relapsed/refractory (n = 11) and/or high-risk (n = 12) acute myeloid leukemia (n = 20) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 3) were infused posttransplant. No patient developed cytokine-release syndrome or neurotoxicity, and only 1 patient developed grade 3 graft-versus-host disease. Of the patients who relapsed post-BMT and received bridging therapy, the majority (n = 9/11) achieved complete hematologic remission before receiving TAA-T. Relapsed patients exhibited a 1-year OS of 36% and 1-year leukemia-free survival of 27.3% post–TAA-T. The poorest prognosis patients (relapsed &lt;6 months after transplant) exhibited a 1-year OS of 42.8% postrelapse (n = 7). Median survival was not reached for high-risk patients who received preemptive TAA-T posttransplant (n = 12). Although as a phase 1 study, concomitant antileukemic therapy was allowed, TAA-T were safe and well tolerated, and sustained remissions in high-risk and relapsed patients were observed. Moreover, adoptively transferred TAA-T detected by T-cell receptor V-β sequencing persisted up to at least 1 year postinfusion. This trial was registered at <ext-link xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov" ext-link-type="uri">clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> as #NCT02203903.</p>

              <p>Relapse is the most frequent cause of death after allogeneic blood or marrow transplantation (BMT) for high-risk hematologic malignancies. The chance of relapse post-BMT for patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) ranges from 4% to 80%,<sup><xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> with a &lt;10% chance of remaining alive and disease-free at 1 year if relapse occurs within 6 months of BMT.<sup><xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2-5</xref></sup> Pediatric patients may fare better than adults, but 1-year overall survival (OS) following relapse within 6 months of BMT still remains limited at 20% to 25%.<sup><xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5,6</xref></sup> Current strategies to treat post-BMT relapse, such as chemotherapy and donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) to enhance the immunologic graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect, have low efficacy and are associated with graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).<sup><xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1,7,8</xref></sup> Although second allo-transplants to reinstate GVL effects are occasionally effective in some patients who enter a remission, they are not effective in patients who relapse early after BMT.<sup><xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3,6,9,10</xref></sup> New immunotherapeutic strategies, notably transgenic chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, have shown promise in patients with ALL<sup><xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11,12</xref></sup> but can have significant toxicities and have shown minimal efficacy in AML to date. Furthermore, the shared expression of CAR-targeted AML surface antigens on normal myeloid precursors can incur myelotoxicity.<sup><xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p>
              <p>An alternative strategy to boost the GVL effect is to infuse donor-derived T cells targeting tumor-associated antigen (TAA) peptides as circulating TAA-specific T cells (TAA-T) are associated with maintenance of remission post-BMT.<sup><xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> In this phase 1 clinical trial, a novel, multitargeted T-cell therapeutic was administered in an attempt to decrease the likelihood of tumor evasion while broadening treatment options for BMT recipients with relapsed or high-risk acute leukemia regardless of HLA type. The TAAs WT1, survivin, and PRAME were selected as targets because they are widely overexpressed in relapsed and refractory hematopoietic malignancies.<sup><xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15-17</xref></sup> Here, we report on the safety, tolerability, persistence, and clinical effects of this novel TAA-T treatment as an approach to prolong survival of patients with high-risk or relapsed leukemia after BMT.</p>

                <p>A prospective, open-label, pilot clinical trial (NCT02203903; IND16135) was conducted at Children’s National and Johns Hopkins Hospitals as a dose-escalation study with doses ranging from 0.5 × 10<sup>7</sup>/m<sup>2</sup> (dose level 1) to 4.0 × 10<sup>7</sup>/m<sup>2</sup> (dose level 4), with up to 7 infusions per patient depending on availability of the product. This study was approved by the institutional review board at each institution and was conducted in accordance with the principals of the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines. See supplemental Methods for full details including eligibility. Steroids exceeding 0.5 mg/kg per day prednisone equivalent at the time of TAA-T or investigational T-cell suppressive therapies in the prior 28 days were exclusion criteria. Patients with relapsed disease could receive cytotoxic therapies prior to and after TAA-T as deemed necessary.</p>

                <p>TAA-T products were manufactured under Good Manufacturing Practice conditions from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from corresponding BMT donors as previously described<sup><xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>; see supplemental Methods. Briefly, donor-derived dendritic cells were pulsed with TAA peptide libraries and cocultured with donor-derived T cells in the presence of cytokines (IL-7, IL-15, IL-12, IL-6) and restimulated in the presence of IL-2.<sup><xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19-21</xref></sup> TAA-T products were validated for identity, phenotype, sterility, lack of alloreactivity, and cryopreserved prior to administration.</p>

                <p>TAA-T products were analyzed with monoclonal antibodies against CD3, CD4, CD8, CD127, CD14, CD19, CD25, CD16, CD56, TCRγδ, CD95, CD45RO, CD28, CCR7, and CD62L.</p>
                <p>TAA-T product-specific activity against WT1, survivin, and PRAME pepmixes (JP Peptide Technology, Berlin, Germany) was evaluated as previously described using anti–interferon gamma (IFNγ) Enzyme-Linked Immunospot (ELISpot).<sup><xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Assays were read by Zellnet consulting (Fort Lee, NJ). TAA-T functionality was also assessed by flow cytometric detection of intracellular IFN-γ and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) in response to WT1, PRAME, or survivin peptides, as described in supplemental Methods and as published.<sup><xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Cells were acquired on a Cytoflex S (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA).

                <p>The cytolytic function of the TAA-T product was evaluated against the HLA-A*02 AML cell line (THP-1) as described in supplemental Methods. Briefly, Cell Trace Violet–labeled THP-1 tumor cells were cocultured with TAA-T or nonspecific T cells (PBMC). Cocultures were labeled with monoclonal antibodies against CD3, CD45RO, and CD33, and the cytotoxicity of TAA-T products vs nonspecific T cells was assessed by lysis of CD33<sup>+</sup>Violet<sup>+</sup> cells. The number of tumor cells remaining was reported as a proportion of the number of tumor cells plated. Tumor cells alone provided background viability. Cells were acquired on a Cytoflex S (Beckman Coulter). Data analysis was performed using FlowJo version 10.5.</p>

                <title>Patient characteristics</title>
                <p>Twenty-three patients with relapsed/refractory (n = 11) or high-risk (n = 12) AML (n = 20) and ALL (n = 3) were infused with a donor-derived TAA-T-cell product post-BMT. The median age at time of first TAA-T infusion was 33 years (range, 1-74), with 5 pediatric patients (&lt;18 years). Eleven patients were female, and 12 were male. The donor was HLA matched for 11 patients and haploidentical-related in 12. All TAA-T products were manufactured from the patient’s BMT donor.</p>
                <p>In the group with relapsed/refractory disease posttransplant (n = 11), the median time from first transplant to relapse was 5 months (range, 56-310 days) (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Notably, 9 of these patients were MRD<sup>+</sup> (n = 2) and had hematologic relapse (n = 5) or extramedullary relapse (n = 2) within 6 months after transplant, emphasizing the poor prognosis of the patients in this study. All relapsed patients with hematologic and extramedullary relapse received at least 1 other therapy prior to TAA-T infusion, including 1 or more courses of chemotherapy (n = 9), second transplant (n = 2), DLI (n = 2), IFNα (n = 1), and/or TKI (n = 2). Patient P8 had persistent MRD with BCR/ABL positivity in the marrow following transplant and treatment with dasatinib and was considered refractory. Two patients (P9, P10) received their first TAA-T infusion after a second BMT. Patient P9 received a second BMT for relapse 10 months following his first transplant and achieved second complete remission prior to the first TAA-T infusion. Patient P10 developed MRD 180 days after her first BMT. She became MRD<sup>+</sup> again 271 days after a second transplant. MRD was reduced to 0.01% with DLI and IFNα prior to receiving the first TAA-T infusion. Ultimately, most patients (9/11, 81.8%) achieved hematologic and extramedullary CR prior to TAA-T-cell infusion, whereas 3 additional patients remained MRD<sup>+</sup> (P1, P8, P10).</p>

CD8<sup>+</sup> TEFF (CD3<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup>CD45RO<sup>−</sup>CCR7<sup>−</sup>CD62L<sup>−</sup>) comprised a median of 2% (range, 0.2% to 8.6%), whereas minimal numbers (&lt;1%) of CD4<sup>+</sup> TEFF populations were detected in the infused products (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B-C</xref>). Finally, the TAA-T products showed broad TCR diversity, consistent with virus-specific T-cell products derived from naïve donors (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>).<sup><xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23-25</xref></sup></p>

All but 1 product demonstrated response to the SEB<sup>+</sup> control. There was insufficient sample to repeat the analysis to evaluate for failure of the assay. Median (and range) antigen-specific responses (IFNγ production per 1 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells) were evaluated for WT1 (16 spot-forming units [SFU]; 0-450 SFU), PRAME (39 SFU; 0-523), survivin (10 SFU; 0-114), and all 3 peptides combined (TAA; 44 SFU; 0-582). The median negative control (actin) was 12 SFU (range: 0-144) and the median positive control (SEB) was 732 SFU (range, 1 to too many to count). Mean antigen responses (IFNγ production per 1 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells) were statistically significantly different from actin (negative control) for WT1 (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = .0469), PRAME (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = .0001), and TAA (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; .0001) but not for survivin (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = .7028). A positive antigen response in each product was classified as an IFNγ production greater than the upper 95% confidence interval (CI) of the median IFNγ production to actin, the negative control. These results similarly identify PRAME as the target antigen with the most consistently positive response across products. This data is shown in supplemental Results.</p>

Systemic steroids, tacrolimus, and extracorporeal photopheresis in addition to antiviral treatment successfully controlled the liver toxicity, and he remains in remission &gt;1 year post–TAA-T. Three other patients developed grades 1 and 2 skin GVHD post–TAA-T (at dose levels 1, 3, and 4); all were steroid responsive.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>This study found that administration of donor-derived TAA-T targeting WT1, PRAME, and survivin was safe and feasible for patients with high-risk leukemia after allogeneic BMT. Eleven patients had relapsed prior to TAA-T infusion, 9 of whom relapsed within 6 months of transplant or had residual/refractory disease. The addition of TAA-T to treat or preempt posttransplant relapse in this subset of patients was accompanied by few treatment-related serious adverse events and a 1-year OS of 36% and LFS of 27.3% in the relapsed group. Moreover, in patients who relapsed &lt;6 months post-BMT and subsequently received TAA-T, their 1-year OS from time of relapse after first transplant was 42.8%. Treatment failure and death is due in part to an insufficient GVL effect, dysregulation of immune fuction,<sup><xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> and from toxicity of chemotherapy. McIver et al found that patients who relapse &lt;6 months after allogeneic BMT had a &lt;5% probability of survival irrespective of whether second BMT or less intensive management was chosen,<sup><xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> with a 0% OS at 1 year after relapse in the patients who underwent a second transplant. Patients who had late relapse (&gt;6 months post–first transplant) and subsequently underwent a second transplant, DLI with or without chemotherapy or chemotherapy alone had a 1-year OS of 33% after relapse,<sup><xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> similar to other studies also showing later relapse associated with improved outcomes.<sup><xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5,6,10,27</xref></sup> Our cohort of patients with “early” relapse (defined as relapsing within 6 months of transplant) who did not undergo a second transplant prior to TAA-T infusion fared better, with less relapse and appreciably longer survival: 1-year OS from time of relapse after first transplant was 42.8% (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>) compared with 0%. These outcomes were more comparable to those with late relapse in the McIver cohort, although in the time since that publication, development of other novel therapies used the in the management of this cohort likely also contributed to the improved outcomes observed. Hence, these results are comparable or superior to similar cohorts of AML and ALL patients treated with alternative therapies,<sup><xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup><xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr"/>-<sup><xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6,9</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10,28,29</xref></sup> suggesting that donor-derived TAA-T are at least as effective as chemotherapy and DLI, or second transplant, for the treatment of post-BMT relapsed leukemia but with appreciably less toxicity, particularly with respect to GVHD.<sup><xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5,6,10,27</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Donor-derived TAA-T infusions provide an opportunity to expand a subset of cytotoxic T cells specific to tumor antigen targets while greatly reducing the risk of GVHD as compared with DLI.<sup><xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1,7,30</xref></sup> Extensive clinical experience with T cells expanded ex vivo with peptide antigens specific for the treatment of viral infections post-BMT indicate that such T cells lack alloreactivity and seldom, if ever, cause GVHD. The safety profile of the TAA-T product described herein is in line with these observations and also contrasts with the frequent occurrence of cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity, which complicates CD19 CAR-T used for relapsed ALL.</p>
              <p>A recent study evaluated the effect of a different tumor-associated, antigen-specific T-cell product for patients with AML refractory to salvage chemotherapy with active disease at the time of infusion.<sup><xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> Two of 6 patients had PR or CR to cell therapy alone, with 3 patients treated with demethylating agents and T cells in the adjuvant setting.<sup><xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> In contrast, the majority of the relapsed patients in our study achieved CR with salvage chemotherapy prior to TAA-T. Several (n = 4) were treated with decitabine or azacitadine as bridging therapy, which has been shown to increase expression of some TAAs, including PRAME,<sup><xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32,33</xref></sup> and potentiate in vitro killing of AML blasts by PRAME-specific T cells.<sup><xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> Therefore, further studies comparing patients receiving TAA-T therapy in combination with hypomethylating agents to those receiving TAA-T infusions with alternative or no salvage therapy are warranted to assess any synergistic effect these agents may have.</p>
              <p>Key issues in designing and expanding effective antileukemic T cells is the selection of appropriate TAAs ubiquitously present on malignant cells and, ideally, not expressed on healthy human tissues. We chose to expand T cells against multiple TAAs (WT1, PRAME, and survivin) to target most malignancies through at least 1 expressed antigen. Of the available samples, the recipient’s malignancy expressed at least 1 of these TAAs by immunofluorescence (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). However, preliminary data from this phase 1 study is not sufficient to analyze a potential correlation between immunofluorescent antigen positivity and disease response to TAA-T. Antigen specificity of the TAA-T products as evaluated by ELISpot demonstrated robust positivity for PRAME and TAA but not consistently for WT1 and survivin across all products. Similarly, CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses evaluated by ICS were variable across all patient products, with WT1 and PRAME trending above that of the negative control, although not statistically significant. This represents an opportunity for increasing the potency of the product for future studies by ensuring equal targeting of all antigens in this single product. Targeting multiple TAAs reduces the risk of tumor escape through downregulation of one antigen, but restricting to a maximum of TAAs also reduces the risk of antigenic competition observed with increased antigen targeting.<sup><xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> Response to TAA-T infusions may also correlate directly with the number of target antigens expressed on the recipients’ tumor cells, with the poorest responses anticipated in patients not expressing any of the 3 TAA targets. This hypothesis remains to be definitively tested in larger, later-phase trials.</p>
              <p>Growing experience with T-cell infusions to treat malignancy indicates that antitumor efficacy is enhanced by lymphodepletion and by persistence of the infused cells.<sup><xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35,36</xref></sup> We did not deliberately use prescribed lymphodepletion before TAA-T infusion, but the therapeutic effect of our TAA-T product may have been enhanced by lymphopenia from “bridging” chemotherapy or prior transplantation. Moreover, characterization of TCR sequencing postinfusion may predict benefit of TAA-T. Patients with disease response following TAA-T infusion had evidence of both persistence and expansion of TCR clonotypes that were present in the product but not present prior to infusion. However, given the small sample size and correlative nature of the data, we are not able to make any conclusions of causality. In future studies, identification and tracking of target antigen-specific unique clonotypes from the T-cell product and demonstration of cytotoxicity of the product against individual patient samples could provide further support of this hypothesis.</p>
              <p>Finally, 2 patients were treated concomitantly with the TKI dasatinib for Philadelphia chromosome–positive ALL. This therapy was continued before and after TAA-T infusion and therefore may have suppressed antigen expression and activation of the T-cell product.<sup><xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37,38</xref></sup> One of these patients had refractory disease and died early in the follow-up time period. The second patient had prolonged survival and remains alive at the time of submission.</p>
              <p>Rapid progress has been made in the manufacturing of highly effective leukemia-specific T cells. Notably, CD19 CAR-T have achieved spectacular results in B-cell malignancies with apparent cures of ALL relapsing post-BMT.<sup><xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11,12</xref></sup> However, they have appreciable postinfusion toxicity, and tumor escape can occur from downregulation of CD19.<sup><xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39,40</xref></sup> In the absence of suitable myeloid surface antigens, CAR-T therapy for AML remains more challenging and still under early stages of investigation. Our non–genetically engineered TAA-T product is therefore of particular relevance for patients with high-risk AML.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, this phase 1 study demonstrates the safety and tolerability of donor-derived TAA-T-cell infusions following allogeneic BMT for the treatment of patients with high-risk/relapsed/refractory hematologic malignancies. Further studies are needed to determine long-term clinical disease outcomes and to optimize the dose and timing of TAA-T infusions posttransplant, particularly for preemptively treated patients. However, these data provide robust evidence that donor-derived TAA-T infusion is a well-tolerated therapy. Later-phase studies are warranted to further evaluate the effect of TAA-T on prolonging remission in patients with high-risk hematologic malignancies post-BMT.</p>

              <p>Contribution: This paper was primarily written by H.K., K.R.C., A.J.B., R.J.J., and C.M.B. The study was developed and designed by R.J.J., K.M.W., and C.M.B. The CNH principal investigators (PIs) on the clinical trial were J.S.D., D.J., and K.M.W., and the Johns Hopkins University site PI was K.R.C. The Investigational New Drug Application (IND) was held by C.M.B. Programmatic oversight and quality assurance was provided by F.H., M.F., K.F., D.K. D.J., J.S.D., K.R.C., K.M.W., A.J.B., R.J.J. cared for the transplantation patients enrolled on the trial and were responsible for data integrity and capture. Cells were generated and evaluated by P.J.H., A.S., A.D., J.T., and N.Z. Regulatory oversight was performed by F.H. Data analysis was accomplished by H.K., M.G., C.R.C., H. Lang, M.S., and K.M.W. Statistical studies were performed by H. Liang, A.Z., and H.K. All authors reviewed the manuscript and made the decision to submit for publication, vouching for the accuracy and completeness of the data reported and fidelity to the protocol.</p>
