                <p>The global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has drastically disrupted cancer care, potentially exacerbating patients’ distress levels. Patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) may be especially vulnerable to this pandemic stress. However, the associations of the COVID-19 pandemic with distress, fatigue, and quality of life (QoL) are not well understood in this population. In a cross-sectional analysis of data from 205 patients undergoing HSCT enrolled in a supportive care trial, we compared baseline pre-HSCT distress symptoms (depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD]), fatigue, and QoL between enrollees before (ie, March 2019-January 2020) and during (ie, March 2020-January 2021) the COVID-19 pandemic. We used linear regression models adjusting for sociodemographics and cancer diagnosis to examine the associations between enrollment period and patient-reported outcomes. We used semistructured qualitative interviews in 20 allogeneic HSCT recipients who were ≥3-months post-HSCT to understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their recovery post-HSCT. One hundred twenty-four participants enrolled before COVID-19, and 81 participants enrolled during the pandemic. The 2 cohorts had similar baseline demographics and disease risk factors. In multivariate regression models, enrollment during COVID-19 was not associated with pre-HSCT symptoms of depression, anxiety, PTSD, fatigue, or QoL impairment. COVID-19-era participants reported themes of negative (eg, increased isolation) and positive (eg, engagement with meaningful activities) implications of the pandemic on HSCT recovery. We found no differences in pre-HSCT distress, fatigue, or QoL in patients undergoing HSCT before or during the COVID-19 pandemic; however, patients in early recovery post-HSCT report both negative and positive implications of the COVID-19 pandemic in their lives.</p>

              <p id="para0005">The global coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has drastically disrupted many aspects of life and healthcare in unparalleled ways. For patients with cancer, it has impacted both treatment and recovery trajectories [<xref rid="bib0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bib0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Patients with hematologic malignancies undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) are especially vulnerable to care changes imposed by the pandemic owing to factors associated with HSCT, including the intensive treatment with a prolonged hospitalization, high burden of physical symptoms due to potential toxic side effects, and quality of life (QoL) challenges in recovery <xref rid="bib0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. Outside the hospital, HSCT recipients grapple with weeks of social isolation and quarantine requirements from a compromised immune system, contributing to distress and impaired QoL in this population. Although a few studies have described the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic for HSCT recipients, previous research has focused on the pandemic's impact on HSCT logistics and COVID-19 complications <xref rid="bib0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>. However, the associations of the COVID-19 pandemic with patient-reported distress, fatigue, and QoL are not well understood.</p>
              <p id="para0006">Compared with other cancer patient populations, many HSCT recipients travel longer distances for their care and require greater caregiver and social support network involvement to ensure successful acute follow-up care (eg, biweekly clinic visits, medication management) and recovery <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. In addition, HSCT recipients frequently depend on their caregivers for basic activities of daily living (eg, meal preparation, household cleaning) to reduce the risk of infections while their immune system recovers <xref rid="bib0011" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Thus, pandemic restrictions on lifestyle and travel might have negatively impacted the size and effectiveness of social support networks for HSCT recipients, intensifying their distress <xref rid="bib0012" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p>
              <p id="para0007">Despite the widespread idea that the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated distress symptoms in patients with cancer <xref rid="bib0013" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, data are limited for patients with hematologic malignancies undergoing HSCT, who have well-documented heightened psychological distress, fatigue, and impaired QoL irrespective of a pandemic <xref rid="bib0014" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Accordingly, we aimed to assess the association of the COVID-19 pandemic with distress, fatigue, and QoL in the HSCT population quantitatively and qualitatively. We hypothesized that the COVID-19 pandemic would be associated with increased distress and fatigue and decreased QoL.</p>

                <p id="para0008">We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of data from 205 patients with hematologic malignancies undergoing HSCT enrolled in an ongoing multisite, randomized supportive care trial at Massachusetts General Hospital, Duke University Medical Center, and Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT03641378). We compared baseline pre-HSCT symptoms of distress (ie, depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD]), fatigue, and QoL between participants enrolled prepandemic (ie, March 2019-January 2020) and participants enrolled during the COVID-19 pandemic (March 2020-January 2021).

                <p id="para0011">We assessed distress (ie, depression and anxiety symptoms) using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, a 14-item questionnaire containing two 7-item subscales assessing depression (HADS-D) and anxiety (HADS-A) symptoms during the past week (score range, 0-21) <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Higher scores on the HADS-D or HADS-A subscale is indicative of higher levels of depression or anxiety symptoms, respectively. PTSD symptoms were assessed using the 17-item PTSD Checklist–Civilian Version (PCL). The PTSD symptom severity score was obtained by summing the scores from each of the 17 items, with higher scores indicating worse PTSD symptoms (score range, 17 to 85) [<xref rid="bib0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="bib0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Fatigue was measured with the 13-item Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy–Fatigue (FACT-F) subscale (score range, 0 to 52) <xref rid="bib0018" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Higher scores on the FACT-F subscale indicate lower levels of fatigue <xref rid="bib0018" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. We assessed QoL using the 47-item Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy–Bone Marrow Transplant (FACT-BMT), which contains 5 subscales assessing physical, functional, emotional, and social well-being, as well as bone marrow transplantation–specific problems (score range, 0 to 196) <xref rid="bib0019" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.

We considered a 2-sided <italic>P</italic> value &lt; .05 to indicate statistical significance.

We used multivariate regression models to examine the associations between enrollment period and patient-reported distress, fatigue, and QoL, while adjusting for age, sex, race, relationship status, education, transplantation type, and underlying diagnosis. We did not adjust for randomization, because the outcome variables were collected at baseline before randomization.</p>

                <title>Qualitative Interviews</title>
                <p id="para0013">To further understand HSCT recipients’ experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic, we conducted individual semistructured qualitative interviews over the phone with 20 patients with hematologic malignancies who underwent HSCT during the COVID-19 pandemic, were ≥3 months post-HSCT, and were receiving longitudinal care from their transplant clinicians. We asked participants to reflect on their COVID-19 experience with an open-ended question: “<italic>Can you tell us about how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected you and your family through your HSCT and recovery?</italic>” Follow-up questions (eg, <italic>“Can you tell us about how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected your level of stress during your transplant and recovery?”; Can you elaborate on how the COVID-19 pandemic impacted you during your transplant hospitalization compared to since you have been home from that hospitalization?”</italic>) about their experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic were used to obtain more details. All interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim.</p>
                <p id="para0014">For analysis, we used directed content analysis, a widely used qualitative approach for examining the breadth and scope of patient experiences, and extracted themes from the data using an established framework from the literature [<xref rid="bib0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="bib0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Participant responses were independently coded verbatim without any interpretations by 2 study team members (HA and LH) to avoid bias. We used complete sentences as the coding unit. Codes were informed by both the interview questions and qualitative interview data. We modified the coding structure after reading a small number of transcripts several times to test the codes. We discussed emerging themes from the codes and adjudicated discrepancies while reviewing interview transcripts to ensure that the themes reflected the original data. In addition to deriving core interview themes, we resolved discrepancies using transcript review, discussion, and consensus. With a sample size of 20 participants and a narrow focus, thematic saturation was achieved.</p>

Themes of negative implications of the pandemic highlighted by participants include (1) increased isolation during HSCT hospitalization in the setting of restricted visitor policies, (2) increased isolation at home due to states’ restrictions of social gatherings and global restrictions on travel, and (3) increased perceived distress on caregivers as they worried about transmitting SARS-CoV-2 to patients. Participants expressed the following themes of positive implications of the pandemic: (1) increased availability of social support, as more family members were working or schooling from home; (2) easier enforcement of precautionary behaviors (eg, masking, handwashing) by family and caregivers during the pandemic, because the COVID-19 pandemic made precautionary behaviors commonplace; and (3) decreased stigma associated with precautionary behaviors (eg, masking) as everyone was required to adhere to statewide and nationwide precautionary behaviors.<table-wrap position="float" id="tbl0004"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>Qualitative Interview Results: Themes, Description, and Quotes</p></caption><alt-text id="alt0004">Table 4</alt-text><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="top">Themes</th><th valign="top">Subthemes</th><th valign="top">Description</th><th valign="top">Quotes</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="3" valign="top">Positive implications of the COVID-19 pandemic</td><td valign="top">Engagement with meaningful activities and social support</td><td valign="top">The COVID-19 pandemic forced adaptation of several social activities (eg, religious) to virtual platforms.

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p id="para0019">In this study, we assessed the associations between enrollment during the COVID-19 pandemic with baseline pre-HSCT distress, fatigue, and QoL, in 205 patients undergoing HSCT in different geographic regions throughout the United States. Contrary to the widespread notion and our hypothesis that the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated symptoms of distress and fatigue and worsened QoL in HSCT recipients, we found no differences in pre-HSCT distress, fatigue, or QoL in our sample before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, our qualitative assessment of HSCT recipients’ experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic showed that the pandemic has had both negative and positive implications for participant experiences following HSCT.</p>

Indeed, well-established factors, such as patients’ illness experience, treatment burden, and uncertainty regarding future health and potential HSCT complications, are still the likely driving force behind the distress, fatigue, and QoL challenges in this population <xref rid="bib0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. Our study's focus on baseline pre-HSCT assessments likely captured the true contribution of the COVID-19 pandemic on patient-reported outcomes, accounting for any distress accompanying the HSCT procedure itself. Although peritransplantation patient-reported outcome screening is limited in the HSCT population <xref rid="bib0023" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, screening during this phase of the care cycle may help identify patients at increased risk for distress, fatigue, and QoL challenges that likely are compounded by the treatment itself.</p>
              <p id="para0021">Another potential explanation for the discordance between our findings and the widespread notion of intensified patient distress reported by cancer clinicians is that the COVID-19 pandemic forced the whole world to live like HSCT recipients, which may have given them a psychological advantage to managing pandemic-related restrictions on life <xref rid="bib0024" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. For example, HSCT recipients were already used to precautionary behaviors (eg, wearing face masks in public) and limited interactions with large crowds. Although our findings suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic was not associated with increased pre-HSCT distress, fatigue, and decreased QoL, it is possible that we are missing some longitudinal changes in distress, given the restrictions on visitors during HSCT hospitalizations. Our qualitative findings show that the pandemic indeed had both negative and positive implications for HSCT recipients during their recovery. It is also possible that existing self-report measures that assess distress, fatigue, and QoL in cancer populations do not capture pandemic-specific or COVID-19–specific stressors that are likely existential in nature. Patients spontaneously reported that the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic increased their thoughts and distress about mortality, something not typically elucidated by standard distress screening instruments in cancer populations.</p>
              <p id="para0022">Social support and caregivers play critical roles in the treatment and successful recovery of HSCT recipients <xref rid="bib0011" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Regardless of a global pandemic that imposes restrictions on travel and social interactions, social isolation during HSCT hospitalization and acute recovery is substantial and contributes significantly to the distress that already accompanies the toxic side effects of HSCT. Thus, it was unsurprising that a constant theme in our qualitative findings pertained to the pandemic's impact on social isolation and changes in the nature and structure of social support. Some participants reported that the pandemic improved access to social support, whereas others reported that the pandemic has been a barrier to needed social support. Furthermore, participants mentioned that the COVID-19 pandemic increased distress symptoms in their caregivers, owing to the caregivers’ concerns that their actions and lifestyle increased the risk of patients contracting COVID-19. This work highlights the need for further research aimed at understanding social support in patients undergoing HSCT and their caregivers during turbulent times like the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
              <p id="para0023">This study has several limitations. First, the majority of our study participants were non-Hispanic white, married, and educated, all of which may limit the generalizability of our findings, particularly given the disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on ethnic minorities and underserved communities <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Second, the cross-sectional nature of our analysis limits our ability to comment on the causality of our examined variables. Additional longitudinal assessments of patient-reported outcomes in the setting of a pandemic may be useful for gaining a comprehensive understanding of the impact of the pandemic on this population. Third, although we were able to capture important aspects of distress through widely used self-report measures for the HSCT population, it is likely that we were unable to capture the existential components of distress (eg, increased thoughts about mortality reported qualitatively) <xref rid="bib0026" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, which may have been heightened by the pandemic. Fourth, although disease status appeared similar in the 2 groups, the post–COVID-19 cohort reflected a 35% drop in patients from the pre–COVID-19 cohort, and patients who proceeded to HSCT during the pandemic may be fundamentally different than those who underwent HSCT before the pandemic, in terms of both their disease and their psychological status. Fifth, although our sample size is comparable to studies assessing patient-reported outcomes in this population, our null findings may be due simply to our limited power to detect differences in patient-reported outcomes. Sixth, although our study focused only on patients, including direct caregivers’ perspectives from qualitative interviews would provide a more holistic view of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients’ care experiences and social support. Finally, on average, patients are already quite distressed before undergoing HSCT compared with other medical procedures, and the pandemic might not have increased it further.</p>
              <p id="para0024">In conclusion, we did not find that the COVID-19 pandemic significantly worsened distress, fatigue, and QoL in patients about to undergo HSCT. Nonetheless, our findings highlight the need to comprehensively explore the numerous factors (eg, illness experience, treatment burden) that influence patient-reported outcomes in HSCT recipients irrespective of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings also underscore the importance of social support during HSCT recovery, especially during a global pandemic, which imposes further barriers and restrictions on social support networks for vulnerable cancer populations such as HSCT recipients.</p>
