                <p id="P3"><italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasite-specific antibodies are critical for
protection against malaria, yet the development of long-lived and effective
humoral immunity against <italic>Plasmodium</italic> takes many years and
multiple rounds of infection and cure. Here we report that the rapid development
of short-lived plasmablasts during experimental malaria unexpectedly hindered
parasite control by impeding germinal center (GC) responses. Metabolic
hyperactivity of plasmablasts resulted in nutrient deprivation of the GC
reaction limiting the generation of memory B cell and long-lived plasma cell
responses. Therapeutic administration of a single amino acid to experimentally
infected mice was sufficient to overcome the metabolic constraints imposed by
plasmablasts and enhanced parasite clearance and the formation of protective
humoral immune memory responses. Thus, our studies not only challenge the
current paradigm describing the role and function of blood-stage
<italic>Plasmodium</italic>-induced plasmablasts, but also reveal new
targets and strategies to improve anti-<italic>Plasmodium</italic> humoral
immunity.</p>

              <p id="P4">Following either vaccination or microbial infection, humoral immunity
generally consists of temporally and spatially layered B cell activation events.
Early humoral responses are associated with extrafollicular B cells that proliferate
and rapidly differentiate into short-lived antibody secreting cells (ASCs), also
referred to as plasmablasts<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. T
cell-dependent follicular responses take longer to develop and involve
antigen-specific B cells forming a germinal center (GC) where they engage in
sustained interactions with CD4<sup>+</sup> T follicular helper cells
(T<sub>FH</sub>). GC B cells subsequently differentiate into either memory B
cells (MBCs) or long-lived plasma cells (LLPCs) that secrete high-affinity,
class-switched antibodies<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. It is thought that extrafollicular,

blood-stage <italic>Py</italic> infection-induced splenic GC

resting (CD138<sup>lo</sup>IgD<sup>hi</sup>) B cell populations that are each
present on day 10 p.i. (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). Principal
component analysis (PCA) revealed that the three populations of B cells
clustered distinctly from each other (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig.

Of the 3600 genes that were differentially expressed among the populations,
multiple metabolism-related genes that play pivotal roles in the glycolytic and

                <p id="P14">We next sought to investigate factors associated with the increased
metabolism of CD138<sup>hi</sup> plasmablasts. B cell activation and
proliferation and increases in biomass require an ample supply of biomolecules

especially L-glutamine (L-glut) <sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,

the possibility that substantial numbers of CD138<sup>hi</sup> plasmablasts
triggered by blood-stage <italic>Py</italic> infection may deplete local
metabolic resources in the spleen. In support of this hypothesis, targeted
analysis of our RNA-seq data set revealed that multiple amino acid and nutrient

(<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 5</xref>). Ingenuity
Pathway Analysis (IPA) revealed broad activation of genes encoding solute
carrier (SLC) transporters that are involved in amino acid acquisition,
particularly L-glut (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f</xref>). The
activation of these pathways was also associated with CD138<sup>hi</sup>
plasmablast metabolic hyperactivity and expression of Blimp-1, which is known to
promote the expression of amino acid transporters<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. We confirmed the upregulation of a set
of L-glut SLCs, including mRNAs for <italic>Slc1a4</italic> and

parasitemia, increase the GC response and boost the activation of B cells as

whether CD138<sup>hi</sup> plasmablasts deletion and L-glut administration are
functionally overlapping, we administered L-glut to DTx-treated CD138-DTR
chimeric mice (<xref rid="F14" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 6</xref>). As
expected, both L-glut and DTx-treatment independently enhanced parasite control

B cells (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref>) and
GC-T<sub>FH</sub>-like cells (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c</xref>).
However, these effects were not further enhanced when L-glut and DTx were
combined (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>–<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">c</xref>). Furthermore, the metabolic activity of activated
splenic B cells was elevated 8 to 12-fold in mice treated with either L-glut or

these treatments were combined (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6d</xref>).
Taken together, these data suggest that CD138<sup>hi</sup> plasmablast deletion
and L-glut supplementation are functionally redundant, which additionally

promotes MBC and LLPC formation are likely linked to the enhanced function of
the GC reaction and not strictly connected to enhancements in the post-GC

CD138<sup>hi</sup> plasmablast deletion or therapeutic administration of

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="P22">Rapidly forming, short-lived extrafollicular plasmablasts play complex roles
in humoral immunity and host protection. Indeed, it is widely accepted that
plasmablasts can provide an early source of protective antibody during bacterial
infections<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>. Similar to LLPCs, short-lived plasmablasts
express Blimp-1 and are equipped with the machinery to secrete antibodies<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. However, there are also data
suggesting that plasmablasts may either inefficiently prime or directly inhibit
T<sub>FH</sub> cell activation and function<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup>, which may limit autoreactivity and tune the
selection of B cell clones expressing the highest affinity receptors. While our data
do not exclude the possibility that blood-stage <italic>Plasmodium</italic>
infection-induced plasmablasts directly impair T<sub>FH</sub> cell responses, our
results show that either abrogation of plasmablast differentiation or deletion of
plasmablasts during an established experimental <italic>Plasmodium</italic>
infection resulted in enhanced clearance of the parasite, which was associated with
10-fold increases in the magnitude of the GC response. Our observations in mice are
further supported by our <italic>P. falciparum</italic> VIS trials where substantial
plasmablast expansions occured and were positively correlated with parasite burdens.
Distinct from previous work showing immunosuppressive roles for either plasmablasts
or plasma cells<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> our data reveal CD138<sup>hi</sup>
plasmablast populations comprise the dominant proportion of the total activated B
cell pool following blood-stage <italic>Plasmodium</italic> infections. Thus, their
overrepresentation may be a cardinal feature of blood-stage
<italic>Plasmodium</italic> infections and potentially other infections of the
blood that are associated with systemic inflammation, eryptosis, hemolysis, anemia
and impairments in durable humoral immunity.</p>
              <p id="P23">Plasmablast numbers have stood as a surrogate for protective
immunity<sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>. However, our
assays revealed that few (~1%) plasmablasts express receptors that detectably
interact with parasite antigens and that plasmablasts constrain rather than promote
humoral immunity. Our efforts to identify potential mechanisms by which
CD138<sup>hi</sup> plasmblasts constrain GC-dependent MBC and LLPC formation
revealed links to their metabolism. From a cell biological perspective,
<italic>Plasmodium-</italic>infection induced plasmablasts resemble a transient
plasmablastic lymphoma similar to diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL)
characterized by downregulation of tumor suppressor genes and upregulation of genes
that promote tumorigenesis. Moreover, tumor cells<sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup>
and plasmablasts express an array of SLC molecules, likely to help meet the
metabolic demands of their high rates of proliferation and increases in cellular
biomass. It has also been reported that cancer cells are ‘addicted’ to
glutamine and are capable of acting as a metabolic ‘sink’<sup><xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup>. Thus, we hypothesized that the
large numbers and increased metabolic demands of plasmablasts together with their
high expression of SLC molecules may cause energetic and metabolic shortfalls for
other effector B cells in the spleen, which may in turn functionally incapacitate
and/or delay the development of GC response. Consistent with this hypothesis, our
studies show that supplementing the drinking water of <italic>Py</italic>-infected
mice with L-glut could relieve an apparent plasmablast-mediated state of nutrient
deprivation and elevate GC, MBC and LLPC responses. Our kinetic studies revealed a
critical window during which L-glut supplementation can augment GC-dependent humoral
immunity, which temporally overlaps with the expansion and maximal accumulation of
<italic>Plasmodium</italic> blood-stage infection-induced plasmablasts. Thus,
although both plasmablasts and GC B cells may exhibit similar metabolic
requirements, the over-representation of plasmasblasts likely deprives GC B cells of
critical nutrients required for their development and function. Future studies will
be required to determine whether plasmablast deletion and associated changes in
metabolic fitness of GC B cells also impact either B cell antigen receptor affinity
maturation or epigenetic programming of MBCs and LLPCs. Although
<sup>13</sup>C-L-glutamine tracing studies designed to show that plasmablasts sink
glutamine <italic>in vivo</italic> are warranted, these studies are confounded by
the time required for tissue processing and cell sorting. Nevertheless, the
composite of data support the model that plasmablasts serve as a key glutamine sink
during blood-stage <italic>Plasmodium</italic> infection and the hypothesis that
alternative, metabolism-based strategies may have clinically relevant applications
for malaria.</p>
              <p id="P24">Previous studies reported that dietary supplementation of L-arginine
enhanced T cell responses in rodents during lethal <italic>Plasmodium</italic>
infection<sup><xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> and that
inhibiting glutamine metabolism with 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (DON) improved
survival and prevented the onset of experimental cerebral malaria (ECM) in mice
challenged with <italic>Pb</italic>-ANKA<sup><xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup>. No mechanisms were identified in the L-arg study and the
latter report primarily attributed the effects of DON to inhibition of
CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell degranulation, a key function that drives the onset of
ECM. During experimental <italic>Plasmodium yoelii</italic> and
<italic>Pb</italic>-ANKA infections truncated with anti-blood-stage drugs, neither
of which cause CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell-mediated immunopathology and ECM,
CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were robustly activated<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> and contribute to host protection<sup><xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup>. Thus, our data do not exclude the
possibility that an enhanced parasite-specific CD8 T cell response also contributes
to the improvements in host resistance to <italic>Plasmodium</italic> during L-glut
supplementation. We predict that strategies to specifically inhibit L-glut uptake by
plasmablasts would yield results similar to those we observed when we either
abrogated plasmablast development or deleted these cells using genetic approaches.
However, at present we know of no way to block either glutamine uptake or
glutaminolysis specifically in plasmablasts. Nevertheless, our data and the
experiments with L-arg and DON during experimental malaria highlight critical roles
for immune cell metabolism and warrant the further exploration of strategies to
modulate these cell biological processes in specific cell types.</p>
              <p id="P25">In summary, our data support the model that during blood-stage
<italic>Plasmodium</italic> infection, B cell differentiation is biased towards
metabolically hyperactive, short-lived plasmablast responses that by their sheer
numbers constrain GC reactions, likely due to glutamine deprivation. The
preferential induction of extrafollicular, immunosuppressive plasmablasts represents
an additional mechanism by which <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites subvert host
protective immunity. Thus, the identification of an expansion of immuno-inhibitory
plasmablasts during <italic>Plasmodium</italic> infection represents a conceptual
shift with implications for either future immune- or metabolism-based strategies
designed to limit plasmablast expansions, which may ultimately contribute to the
development of durable humoral immunity against malaria.</p>

sequenced using an Illumina NextSeq 550 sequencer using paired-end chemistry
with 50 base pair (bp) read length Gene Expression Omnibus record: GSE134548.
The quality of sequence reads was assessed using FastQC (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/">http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/</ext-link>) and
were aligned using STAR aligner<sup><xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref></sup> to the mouse genome version mm10 and the corresponding
transcriptome. Following read alignment, gene expression profiles were computed
using featureCounts<sup><xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref></sup>. Next,
differentially expressed genes were identified using Partek GS software and
genes with significant changes were filtered using adjusted
<italic>P</italic>-value of 0.05 as threshold. Visualization of differentially
expressed genes represented as heat maps were generated using Partek GS
software. Further, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software (Qiagen Bioinformatics)
was used to identify the underlying molecular pathways and interaction networks
