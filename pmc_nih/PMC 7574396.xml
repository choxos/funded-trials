                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) treated with hemodialysis (HD) experience many distressing symptoms. One frequently reported symptom is insomnia. There are unique issues about HD treatments and schedules that disrupt regular sleep/wake routines and possibly contribute to the high severity of insomnia. Despite evidence for broad-ranging health effects of insomnia, very few clinical trials have tested the efficacy of treatments for HD patients. Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is a recommended first-line therapy but largely inaccessible to HD patients in the United States, partly because they commit considerable amounts of time to thrice-weekly dialysis treatments. Another important reason could be the logistical and reimbursement challenges associated with providing behavioral health care at the dialysis center. CBT-I delivered by telehealth can overcome barriers to access, but its efficacy has never been rigorously tested for these patients. Pharmacotherapy is the most widely used treatment for insomnia; however, some drugs presently used are unsafe as they are associated with a higher risk for death for HD patients (benzodiazepines and zolpidem-like drugs). The efficacy and safety of other medications (trazodone) for the treatment of insomnia has never been tested for patients treated with HD.</p>

                  <p id="Par2">This trial tests the short- and long-term comparative effectiveness of 6-week treatment with telehealth CBT-I, trazodone, or medication placebo. This will be accomplished with a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in which 126 participants treated with HD in community-based dialysis facilities with chronic insomnia will be assigned 1:1:1 to telehealth CBT-I, trazodone, or medication placebo, respectively; short-term effectiveness of each treatment arm will be determined at the end of 6-weeks of treatment and long-term effectiveness at 25-weeks. The primary and secondary patient-reported outcomes will be assessed with computer-based telephone interviewing by research scientists blinded to treatment assignment; additional secondary outcomes will be assessed by participant interview and actigraphy.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par20">In the United States, most adults with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) are undergoing long-term in-center hemodialysis (HD) in community-based facilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Approximately 40–85% of patients treated with HD have significant sleep disturbances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. A nationally representative study selected 1643 patients from 335 dialysis facilities in the United States using equal probability systematic random sampling. In this study, 50% of the patients had trouble falling asleep, 59% reported trouble with waking up during the night, and 49% reported trouble with early morning awakening, 53% reported one or more of these symptoms all or most of the time. A workgroup of the Kidney Health Initiative recently reported that patients undergoing HD treatment prioritized three physical symptoms for finding effective treatments for: insomnia, muscle cramps, and fatigue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In another study using a nominal group technique to obtain consensus, HD patients and their caregivers ranked sleep, fatigue, and anxiety/stress among the top 10 most important outcomes for clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par21">At least two factors may contribute to the high prevalence of insomnia in this patient population. First, day/night sleep reversal is a cardinal manifestation of uremia, the symptom complex associated with kidney failure. Studies have also shown that the severity of sleep problems are related to biochemical measures of kidney failure, suggesting insomnia may be the result of the accumulation of various uremic toxins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Second, while HD is partially effective in removing uremic toxins, it also associated with poor sleep quality. Several studies have shown that compared with advanced kidney disease patients not treated with dialysis, patients treated with HD have a significantly shorter total sleep time and sleep efficiency and more significant sleep fragmentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. This may be a direct result of unpredictable HD treatment schedules, such as early morning or late evening dialysis shifts, which make maintaining regular sleep/wake routines challenging. There is also evidence showing that half of all HD patients nap during the thrice-weekly dialysis treatments, inconsistently disrupting homeostatic sleep drive and circadian rhythm routines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par22">Insomnia is an essential contributor to other poor health outcomes in HD patients. Insomnia in dialysis patients is strongly associated with daytime sleepiness and worse quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Over 50% of dialysis patients report daytime sleepiness, fatigue, pain, and impaired quality of life, and over 25% have depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Successful treatment of insomnia in other patient populations has been shown to produce improvements in quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], but this has never been examined for patients treated with HD. Recent studies have also shown a higher adjusted risk for death in HD patients with poor sleep [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Importantly, the higher frequency of sleep disturbances in HD patients is independent of sleep apnea (an occlusion of the airway [obstructive sleep apnea], absence of respiratory effort [central sleep apnea], or a combination of these factors [mixed apnea]) and Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS), defined as an overwhelming urge to move legs, which is worst at rest and night and relieved by movement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In sum, it is evident that insomnia is a contributor to many highly prevalent symptoms and poor health outcomes in HD patients.</p>
              <p id="Par23">Notwithstanding the wide-ranging adverse effects of insomnia on the health and well-being of HD patients, no clinical trial has ever been done to determine the efficacy of any treatment for insomnia in HD patients in the United States. Short and Long-term Effectiveness of Existing insomnia therapies for Patients undergoing HD (SLEEP-HD) is the first multi-center randomized controlled trial (RCT) for treatment of insomnia in patients undergoing HD and seeks to test the comparative effectiveness of two treatments for insomnia in patients undergoing HD.</p>

                <p id="Par24">SLEEP-HD is a parallel-group RCT wherein 126 HD patients treated in community-based dialysis facilities in Seattle and Albuquerque will be randomized 1:1:1 over 31 months to 6-week treatment with telehealth Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I), trazodone, or medication placebo (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

                  <p id="Par29">CBT-I is the first line therapy for insomnia. In adults with insomnia, CBT-I improves sleep latency, wake after sleep onset, sleep efficiency, sleep quality, and can induce insomnia remission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Based on this evidence, the American College of Physicians strongly recommends CBT-I as the first-line treatment for insomnia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. These studies have limited relevance for HD patients as they have unique challenges to maintaining regular sleep/wake routines. It is unknown if CBT-I will be effective in favorably modifying these behaviors to improve sleep for this patient population. Telehealth, a two-way video interaction between the patient and the therapist, overcomes accessibility challenges and has been identified by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine as having the potential to narrow the gap between the availability of sleep providers and the number of patients needing insomnia treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. To date, only one center has reported a case series of its experience with telehealth CBT-I showing improvement; however, there was no control group to determine efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].</p>

                  <p id="Par30">Pharmacotherapy is widely used as a first-line therapy for insomnia including HD patients; it is also an alternative for patients unwilling to engage with CBT-I or for whom CBT-I is unavailable or inaccessible. However, the drugs used widely have either concerns about safety or efficacy, or have been insufficiently studied for patients undergoing HD. Trazodone is an attractive option as population surveys show it to be the most common or second most common drug prescribed for insomnia in the United States for HD patients, yet is remarkably understudied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].</p>

                <p id="Par76">Actigraphy will be performed at three time-points: (a) the 1-week run-in period; (b) week 7 from randomization; and (c) week 25 from randomization. The key secondary outcome measure will be the average nighttime sleep efficiency (percent time asleep of total time spent in bed).The actigraphy data will be used to compute the following variables for additional exploratory analyses: a) Sleep onset latency; b) Total sleep time; c) Total wake time; d) Daytime inactivity; and e) Light exposure. Each assessment will last 7 days, will be scheduled to start and end with a regularly scheduled dialysis treatment, and the study coordinator will meet with the participant in his/her HD facility. Actigraphy data collection will be scheduled such that the 7-day period starts the week prior to the CATI and ends the week CATI is performed. The actigraphy data will be downloaded and scored using the Actiware 6.0.9 software (Phillips Respironics, Bend, OR) to determine wake and sleep based on one-minute epochs. The actigraphy scorers will be blinded to the randomized treatment assignment of the participant. The validity of data from actigraphy will be increased by our approach of asking participants to maintain sleep diaries to guide scoring of bed and rising times, and to examine artifacts in data collection, e.g., removal of the device [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Additionally, light sensors and actigraphy event marker data will be used in conjunction with the diaries to ensure that in-bed and out-of-bed (daytime) periods used for calculating sleep parameters are accurate.</p>

                <p id="Par98">The primary outcome for Aim 1 is the ISI measured at 6 weeks after initiation of treatment. Given that we have three arms, a simple analysis for this aim would be an ANOVA analysis. However, to maximize the use of information and to account for potential loss to follow-up and/or intermittent missing outcome measures, we will use a comprehensive longitudinal analysis to make inference regarding group differences across time. Specifically, we will use linear mixed models for the analysis of all outcomes including the baseline, 4, 7, 13 and 25-week ISI measurements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. For longitudinal models we will use indicator variables to model the 4, 7, 13, and 25-week changes from baseline (control group temporal trend) and then use two sets of treatment-by-time interactions to characterize the difference in the change over time for the CBT-I group compared to placebo, and the trazodone group relative to placebo. Our primary analysis will use linear mixed model estimation assuming an unstructured outcome covariance matrix in order to minimize model assumptions. Given randomization, we know the baseline group mean difference is zero and therefore, an appropriate longitudinal model imposes this known baseline constraint. The primary test for Aim 1 is a longitudinal variation on ANOVA that would simultaneously test that both the CBT-I treatment by 7-week interaction, and the trazodone by 7-week interaction are zero. This null hypothesis assumes that the change from baseline to 7-weeks is the same for each of the three treatment groups. Secondary analysis will estimate the confidence interval for the pairwise comparisons of each of the three groups from the longitudinal model. A similar analytic approach will be taken for analyses of data for each of the nine pre-specified secondary outcomes. Exploratory analyses will be undertaken to determine if there is preliminary evidence for effect modification by gender, race/ethnicity, restless legs syndrome, cumulative use of sedatives/hypnotics or opiates, dialysis shift, and treatment adherence to CBT-I or trazodone.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par102">Insomnia is a common and distressing symptom for patients on HD, and there is evidence for a much larger impact on the health of patients. The SLEEP-HD study is an open-label RCT to compare two types of treatment for insomnia in participants who have ESKD on HD with chronic insomnia. The two types of treatment involved in the study are CBT-I or treatment with a drug (trazodone vs placebo).</p>
              <p id="Par103">CBT-I is the first line therapy for insomnia but is largely inaccessible to dialysis patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Two clinical trials on HD, one from Taiwan with 72 patients and one from China with 103 patients, have demonstrated improvement in sleep quality, assessed with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, with group CBT-I [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. However, these trials cannot inform clinical practice in the United States where patients must commit 4 h thrice weekly to HD treatments in stand-alone dialysis facilities away from hospitals and medical facilities, making in-person CBT-I inaccessible. In addition, the most important reason CBT-I therapy is inaccessible to most people in the United States and not just HD patients is the lack of trained providers particularly in regions without specialty sleep centers. Thus, it is imperative to develop innovative solutions to make treatment for insomnia more widely available, including for those undergoing HD. Some treatment approaches have been tested in other groups without kidney disease such as self-help strategies, internet programs, or over the telephone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>].These approaches introduce newer limitations as they don’t involve a face-to-face interaction with a therapist; internet-based CBT-I is modestly effective self-help therapy in the short run for insomnia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>], and telephone-based CBT-I has been shown to be efficacious as a first line treatment in healthy midlife women with insomnia symptoms (one of the four MsFLASH trial that was telephone delivered and focused explicitly on treating sleep disturbances) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par104">As for pharmacotherapy, there is limited evidence to support current practices for insomnia for dialysis patients. Notwithstanding clinical practice guidelines, pharmacotherapy is widely used as a first-line therapy for insomnia including HD patients; it is also an alternative for patients unwilling to engage with CBT-I or for whom CBT-I is unavailable or inaccessible. However, the drugs used widely have either concerns about safety or efficacy, or have been insufficiently studied for patients undergoing HD. Benzodiazepines and non-benzodiazepine benzodiazepine-receptor agonists such as zolpidem are prescribed for 8–26% of HD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>] even though two cohort studies have shown that HD patients treated with these drug classes have a significantly higher risk for death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. Trazodone is an attractive option as population surveys show it to be the most common or second most common drug prescribed for insomnia in the United States for HD patients, yet is remarkably understudied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. The drug is metabolized in the liver into inactive metabolites and no dose adjustments are necessary with kidney disease. However, there are limited data to guide clinical practice. Low-quality evidence suggests its efficacy for treating primary insomnia; in two placebo-controlled trials, treatment with trazodone lasted only 7–14 days, and the only trial testing its efficacy as add-on to CBT-I enrolled just 20 patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. Studies have shown the efficacy of trazodone for insomnia in patients with depression, Alzheimer’s disease, and alcohol/opiate dependence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. However, no studies have tested its efficacy and safety in the setting of partial correction of uremia as with HD and none are underway. Furthermore, HD patients have unique behavioral and scheduling challenges and have greater risk with daytime sleepiness when overlaid upon hemodynamic fluctuations with HD and frailty. This study will generate much-needed evidence to support or refute its widespread use for treating insomnia in HD patients.</p>
              <p id="Par105">There is a compelling need to identify effective treatments for insomnia in HD patients, and the interventions being studied in this clinical trial (telehealth CBT-I and trazodone) have a strong scientific premise. Most HD patients have significant impairments in quality of life, mainly from the high frequency of disabling symptoms. Insomnia is one of the most frequently reported symptoms, and studies of HD patients and other populations suggest that it is a significant contributor to other common symptoms and poor health outcomes. It is essential to know that insomnia is common in HD patients with comorbid depression but is independent of sleep apnea and restless legs syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] . There are unique contributors to chronic insomnia in HD patients, and these include the biologic effects of residual uremia after partial correction, as is achieved with current dialysis technology, maladaptation to treatment schedules, and patients’ napping during treatments. If telehealth CBT-I is effective for treating insomnia in HD patients, it will create an option that is presently unavailable to patients. Trazodone is widely used but the data on efficacy for treating insomnia in HD patients are limited as well.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p id="Par106">SLEEP-HD is the first multi-center RCT for the treatment of insomnia in patients undergoing HD and seeks to compare the efficacy of telehealth CBT-I vs. trazodone vs. medication placebo for the treatment of chronic insomnia in patients undergoing HD.</p>
              <p id="Par107">Dialysis is a life-sustaining treatment for patients with kidney failure. Nevertheless, most patients experience many troubling symptoms, and disturbances in sleep are among the most reported problem. However, there has been limited research done to identify what treatments are effective for patients undergoing HD with sleep problems. Moreover, HD treatments are scheduled three times every week, making it extremely difficult for patients to have the time to receive cognitive behavioral therapy – a treatment effective in improving sleep in individuals without kidney failure. In this study, we plan to test the short- and long-term effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy with a therapist face-to-face delivered over the web, instead of in-person, with a drug. This study has the potential not only to benefit patients treated with HD but other patients that have difficulty in accessing treatment for sleep problems such as residents of rural and underserved areas.</p>
