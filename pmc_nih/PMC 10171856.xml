                  <title>Purpose:</title>
                  <p>Both Rapid Syllable Transition Treatment (ReST) and ultrasound biofeedback are effective approaches to treating childhood apraxia of speech (CAS). The purpose of the study was to compare outcomes from these two motor-based treatment approaches for school-age children with CAS.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Method:</title>
                  <p>In a single site, single blind randomized control trial, 14 children with CAS ages 6–13 years were randomly assigned to 12 sessions over 6 weeks of either of ultrasound biofeedback treatment (with a speech motor chaining practice structure) or ReST. Treatment was delivered at The University of Sydney by students trained and supervised by certified speech-language pathologists. Transcriptions from blinded assessors were used to compare the two groups on speech sound accuracy (percent phonemes correct) and prosodic severity (lexical stress errors and syllable segregation) in untreated words and sentences at three time points: pretreatment, immediately posttreatment, and 1-month posttreatment (i.e., retention).</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results:</title>
                  <p>Both groups showed significant improvement on treated items indicating a treatment effect. At no time was there a difference between groups. Both groups showed a significant improvement in speech sound accuracy on untreated words and sentences from pre to post and neither group showed an improvement in prosody pre–post. Changes to speech sound accuracy were retained by both groups at 1-month follow-up. Significant improvement in prosodic accuracy was reported at the 1-month follow-up.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions:</title>
                  <p>ReST and ultrasound biofeedback were equally effective. Either ReST or ultrasound biofeedback may be viable treatment options for school-age children with CAS.</p>

          <body>
            <p>Childhood apraxia of speech (CAS) is a motor-based speech sound disorder involving impairments in speech sound accuracy along with disrupted transitions between sounds and syllables, prosodic disturbances, and token-to-token inconsistency (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">American Speech-Language-Hearing Association [ASHA], 2007</xref>). Treatments for CAS should address these specific characteristics through motor-based approaches (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Maas et al., 2014</xref>). To date, there remain few treatments with strong empirical support and fewer studies that directly compare outcomes for different treatments. In fact, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Morgan and Vogel (2009)</xref> identified a “critical lack of well controlled treatment studies addressing treatment efficacy for CAS, making it impossible for conclusions to be drawn about which interventions are most effective for treating CAS in children or adolescents.” (p. 1).</p>
            <p>This lack of high-level evidence represents a significant challenge for clinical practice, as research has yet to provide sufficient guidance on effective treatment options for this population. Thus, there is need for rigorous study of treatments in order to build an evidence base and to provide clinical guidance. Due in part to the relatively rare nature of the disorder, most studies of CAS treatment have been small in scale and have reflected Phase I (e.g., case series) or Phase II (e.g., small-scale controlled experimental studies) research (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Robey, 2004</xref>). A review by <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Murray et al. (2014)</xref> evaluated which treatment approaches for CAS have sufficient evidence (i.e., Phase II research) to warrant larger scale trials (i.e., randomized control trials [RCTs]). Integrated Phonological Awareness training (IPA; <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">McNeill et al., 2009</xref>), Dynamic Temporal and Tactile Cueing (DTTC; <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Strand, 2020</xref>), and Rapid Syllable Transition Treatment (ReST, e.g., <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Ballard et al., 2010</xref>) were identified as candidate interventions with sufficient Phase II evidence. Since that review was conducted, Phase II research has also been published on ultrasound biofeedback treatment for CAS (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Preston et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Preston, Leece, &amp; Maas, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Preston, Maas, et al., 2016</xref>) in varying dose frequencies including hour-long sessions 2 and 4 times per week.</p>
            <p>Since the <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Morgan and Vogel (2009)</xref> and <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Murray et al. (2014)</xref> reviews, a single RCT has been conducted comparing the effectiveness of two treatments ReST and the Nuffield Dyspraxia Programme–Third Edition [NDP3]; <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Murray, McCabe, &amp; Ballard, 2015</xref>) with both treatments being effective immediately following treatment and at follow-up on measures of treated word accuracy and generalization to untreated nonwords and real words. NDP3 was more effective in the treatment period but had diminishing retention of the observed change, and ReST, while effective in the treatment period, was superior in both retention and generalization, where retention was maintenance of the change seen at the end of treatment and generalization was change in untreated items. To date, the result of that first study has not been replicated. Additionally, in the intervening period, ReST has been shown to be moderately effective in a reduced intensity format of twice per week (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Scarcella et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Thomas et al., 2014</xref>) rather than the four sessions per week reported in the original RCT (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Murray, McCabe, &amp; Ballard, 2015</xref>).</p>
            <p>Of the interventions with sufficient Phase II evidence, only ReST, ultrasound biofeedback, and NDP3 have demonstrated evidence from studies with school-aged children with mild to moderate CAS (DTTC has been tested with moderate-profound CAS and IPA with younger children). Most prior studies have focused on outcomes as a result from examination of a single treatment, where this study directly compares outcomes from two approaches in line with <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Murray, McCabe, and Ballard (2015)</xref>. This study therefore provides an initial or pilot randomized comparison of two treatments, with school-age children with CAS, namely, ReST and ultrasound biofeedback. It should be noted that ReST and ultrasound biofeedback are not designed to treat the same aspects of disordered speech as each other. The differences between the two are described below.</p>
            <sec disp-level="2">
              <title>Motor-Based Treatments</title>
              <p>Many motor-based treatments for CAS, including ultrasound biofeedback and ReST, are rooted in principles of motor learning derived from schema-based motor learning theory (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Schmidt &amp; Lee, 2011</xref>). These principles offer guidance on aspects of training that differentially affect motor performance during two distinct therapeutic phases: acquisition and learning. While <italic toggle="yes">acquisition</italic> reflects performance during training as a motor skill is emerging, <italic toggle="yes">learning</italic> is the ultimate goal of therapy. Speech motor learning reflects both generalization (i.e., accurate performance on untrained contexts) and retention (i.e., maintenance of observed change in performance over time). Specifically, treatments that result in improvements only in treated targets during therapy sessions may not be efficient if they fail to also facilitate motor learning. Therefore, the primary outcomes of treatments should address performance on untreated items.</p>
              <p>A range of <italic toggle="yes">feedback</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">practice</italic> elements are believed to impact speech motor learning. As reviewed by <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Maas et al. (2008)</xref>, the principles of feedback that may influence speech motor learning include both the type and the frequency of feedback. Feedback type may take the form of <italic toggle="yes">knowledge of performance</italic> (<italic toggle="yes">KP</italic>), which includes information about the performed movement, or <italic toggle="yes">knowledge of results</italic> (<italic toggle="yes">KR</italic>), which includes information only related to accuracy (i.e., correct or incorrect). Of these two types of feedback, KP is theorized to facilitate acquisition of a movement pattern that is in error, whereas KR is believed to be more facilitative of learning; however, recent research suggests that detailed KP feedback may also contribute to speech motor learning in children with speech disorders (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">McKechnie et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Preston, McAllister, et al., 2019</xref>). With respect to the amount of feedback that is provided during treatment, frequent feedback is thought to facilitate acquisition while less frequent feedback is thought to facilitate learning.</p>
              <p>In addition to feedback, numerous aspects of how speech is practiced may contribute to speech motor learning (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Maas et al., 2008</xref>). Where acquisition may be facilitated with constant blocked practice (i.e., practicing the same target the same way multiple times in a row), learning may be facilitated by variable random practice (i.e., practicing the target in a slightly different way in a random order; <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Hitchcock &amp; McAllister Byun, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Preston et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Skelton &amp; Hagopian, 2014</xref>). Additionally, during the acquisition phase when speech targets are simple (e.g., syllables), clients may have a high level of success. However, for motor learning to occur, complex targets should be practiced (e.g., polysyllabic words) and therefore clients may have lower success during this phase.</p>

              <title>ReST</title>
              <p>ReST treatment is designed to treat the hypothesized core speech motor planning disorder in CAS. That is, ReST challenges children to use their speech motor planning skills with relatively novel speech productions (nonsense words). In all studies published to date (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Ballard et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">McCabe et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Murray, McCabe, &amp; Ballard, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Scarcella et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Thomas et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Thomas et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Thomas et al., 2016</xref>), children were challenged to produce 20 randomly ordered nonsense words that had been specifically selected to be difficult but not impossible for the child to produce (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">McCabe et al., 2020</xref>). In producing the nonsense words, it was hypothesized that the child would be forced to create a new motor plan, suppress old motor plans, and use both feedback and feedforward mechanisms to evaluate and modify their productions. To achieve this change in motor planning, ReST uses blocked low dose practice with high frequency, KP feedback in the brief prepractice phase of each session and random high dose practice with decreasing and random frequency, KR feedback in the practice phase of each session.</p>
              <p>Through addressing speech motor planning, the authors (e.g., <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">McCabe et al., 2020</xref>) claim that ReST targets the consensus core features of CAS of inconsistent production of vowels and consonants, difficulty with syllabic and segmental transitions, and impaired prosodic accuracy including difficulties with lexical or phrasal stress (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">ASHA, 2007</xref>).</p>

              <title>Ultrasound Biofeedback Treatment</title>
              <p>Ultrasound biofeedback involves training articulatory patterns using real-time visual displays of the tongue. The tongue is arguably the most important articulator for speech, as it is involved in production of most consonants and in all vowels. To visualize the tongue, the ultrasound transducer is placed beneath the chin and angled up toward the tongue. Sagittal images enable visualization of aspects of the tongue tip/blade (for cueing movements associated with alveolar and palatal sounds) and the tongue dorsum (for velar sounds). In coronal views, midline grooving of the tongue and elevation of the lateral margins of the tongue can be observed (e.g., as required for production of sibilants or rhotics). Ultrasound can show both static positions of the tongue (e.g., tongue shape for the midpoint of the stop /k/) as well as sequences of speech movements (e.g., actions such a tongue dorsum elevation followed by tongue tip raising for /kl/ sequences). The visual information can be diagnostically useful for the clinician (e.g., to observe differentiated movement of tongue parts) and may facilitate more precise cueing with targets provided on the screen for children to “hit” or “match” with their tongue. This visual information can enable children to self-evaluate in real time to determine what actions were (in)correct and thus make adjustments in subsequent trials. Ultrasound imaging therefore provides a form of KP feedback which, according to schema-based motor learning theories (e.g., <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Maas et al., 2008</xref>) is helpful in establishing a skill and increasing performance during a task, although the visual feedback should be faded in order to facilitate motor learning. In the protocol used in this study and others by the same team, this fading is achieved by alternating blocks of practice with and without ultrasound although each session followed the same general schedule.</p>
              <p>The structure of the ultrasound treatment is designed to scaffold learning through speech motor chaining (building movement patterns from simple to more complex (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Preston, Leece, &amp; Storto, 2019</xref>). Practice begins at syllables (Level 1) and, based on performance, practice progresses through monosyllabic words, multisyllabic words, phrases, and client-generated sentences (Level 5). Within each level of increasing complexity, modifications to feedback type, feedback frequency, practice variability, and complexity are implemented. That is, as the child is successful, feedback type transitions from primarily KP to primarily KR, feedback frequency is reduced, variability is introduced with intentional modifications of prosody, and linguistic complexity increases.</p>

              <title>Treatment Method Comparison: ReST Versus Ultrasound Biofeedback</title>
              <p>Although both treatments were designed to include several principles of motor learning, there are differences in the foci of each treatment and the specific approach to implementing these principles. For example, ultrasound biofeedback focuses heavily on production of speech sounds and sound sequences and aims to increase accuracy and consistency. Treatment begins at the syllable level and progresses to real words and phrases; there is no explicit treatment of lexical stress, although targets eventually become embedded in multisyllabic productions. In contrast, ReST focuses from the outset on producing complex (multisyllabic) nonsense words to target accurate production of stress patterns, transitioning between sounds/syllables, and accurate production of sounds that are already within the child's inventory. Practice in the ultrasound program is in small blocks (six consecutive attempts at the same target), whereas practice in ReST is fully randomized. Therefore, each approach has a different structure but broadly aims to improve speech motor control. With respect to treatment outcomes, ultrasound biofeedback may be better suited to facilitate improvements in consonant and vowel accuracy whereas ReST may be most appropriate to address prosodic aspects of speech.</p>
              <p>Comparison studies in clinical research can ultimately aid clinical decision-making for clinicians and families who may be familiar with multiple treatments but seek guidance on whether outcomes are stronger with one treatment over another. Given that both treatments have previously been shown to be effective in Phase I and Phase II studies and ReST has evidence from a single Phase III RCT, we were particularly interested in exploring magnitude of any differences between these treatments of speech motor learning in CAS, especially in generalization or retention. Here learning is conceived as a relatively permanent change in behavior otherwise known as retention of change which occurs in treatment while generalization is the application of the skill to novel situations. Ideally, any treatment aims to be as efficient as possible; one measure of efficiency is generalization of learning to new situations, in this case, untreated words and sentences, so that less treatment is required over the child's lifetime. To some extent, change on treated items in the session, which is a traditional way to evaluate treatment in a clinical setting, is a metric that values acquisition over learning.</p>

                <title>Participants</title>
                <p>Fourteen children with CAS were recruited in Sydney, Australia through referrals from local speech-language pathologists (SLPs) and a research database held at the University. An additional four children were referred for the study but were found ineligible based on the criteria described below. An initial visit was used to determine eligibility for the study. Up to two additional pretreatment sessions were used to collect further information on speech and language skills and to aid in treatment target selection.</p>
                <sec>
                  <title>Eligibility Criteria</title>
                  <p>Eligible children were between the ages of 6 and 13 years, had an existing diagnosis of CAS, and spoke English as their first and primary language. Participants were also required to pass a hearing screening and parents agreed that the children had normal or corrected-to-normal vision with glasses. All were required to have receptive vocabulary standard score above 85 on the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test–Fourth Edition (PPVT-4; <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Dunn &amp; Dunn, 2007</xref>) and nonverbal intelligence standard scores above 70 (–2 <italic toggle="yes">SD</italic>) on the Test of Nonverbal Intelligence (TONI; <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Brown et al., 2010</xref>). Two children were excluded before randomization due to behavioral difficulties in assessment sessions, which included refusal to participate in the assessment tasks. The first and third authors reached a consensus that these children would have difficulty participating in treatment sessions due to the structured nature of sessions. All children had received previous speech therapy; however, none had received either ReST or Ultrasound Biofeedback previously. Six children had been research participants previously in studies investigating the NDP-3 (<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Williams &amp; Stephens, 2004</xref>). None were receiving additional therapy at the time of the study, and parents also agreed to refrain from additional speech treatment for 4 weeks after completion of the therapy to evaluate retention, which has also been the case with other ReST studies. Additionally, as in all previous ReST and ultrasound studies, parents agreed not to do any formal speech homework during the study in order to control the dose of therapy provided to each child and to help isolate the effects of these treatment conditions. No data were collected confirming compliance with these requests.</p>
                  <p>For description of the children, several additional tasks were administered. Verbal memory was evaluated with the Memory for Digits subtest of the Comprehensive Test of Phonological Processing–Second Edition (CTOPP-2; <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Wagner et al., 2013</xref>). Children also completed a nonword repetition task (Children's Non-Word Repetition Test [CNWRT] ; <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Dollaghan &amp; Campbell, 1998</xref>). An oral mechanism exam was completed (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Robbins &amp; Klee, 1987</xref>), and children were required to have normal oral structure and normal nonverbal oral function. The Goldman-Fristoe Test of Articulation–Second Edition (GFTA-2; <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Goldman &amp; Fristoe, 2000</xref>) was administered to evaluate speech sound accuracy at the single word level and to determine that the child had a speech sound disorder. Using two-tailed Mann–Whitney <italic toggle="yes">U</italic> tests, there were no significant differences between intervention groups, described below, prior to treatment on any variable (age, PPVT-4 receptive vocabulary, CTOPP-2 digit memory, GFTA-2 percentile, CNWRT percentile; probe percent phonemes correct [PPC] or Prosodic Severity; all <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>s &gt; .20) except the TONI, where children in the ultrasound group performed at a higher level than those randomized to the ReST group (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = .017).

                  <title>CAS Diagnosis</title>
                  <p>All children had a community CAS diagnosis on referral to the study. This diagnosis was independently confirmed by two research SLPs (first and third authors) based on the children's performance across a battery of tasks. Tasks were the GFTA-2, the diadochokinetic task on oral mechanism exam, a connected speech sample and the Test of Polysyllables (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Gozzard et al., 2006</xref>), which requires production of 50 polysyllabic words through picture naming. Additionally, 20 of the polysyllabic words were repeated 3 times to evaluate consistency. Tasks were partially selected based on <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Murray, McCabe, Heard, and Ballard (2015)</xref> who reported that the Test of Polysyllables and DDK performance was diagnostically sufficient in a similar sample of school-aged children. Percent lexical stress match and the occurrence of syllable segregation were computed as proxies for difficulty with lexical stress and lengthened and disrupted coarticulatory transitions. Participants were required to present with all three core features of CAS (inconsistency, difficulty with lexical stress, and lengthened and disrupted coarticulatory transitions; <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">ASHA, 2007</xref>) in at least two of these tasks for a diagnosis of CAS. Fourteen children met the criteria.</p>

                <title>Design</title>
                <p>Following confirmation of eligibility, children were prospectively randomly assigned to receive either ReST or ultrasound biofeedback treatment through independent concealed random allocation using sequentially numbered envelopes. Treatment was provided by seven speech-language pathology students under the supervision of a clinical researcher with expertise in both treatment approaches (Authors 1 and 3). This approach has been used for all previous ReST studies. Students were provided with manuals explaining procedures for both treatments, and 2 days of training was provided describing and practicing each of the treatments. To reduce clinician effects, each student clinician treated children in both conditions. Although children, parents, and clinicians could not be blinded to treatment condition, outcomes were assessed by research assistants who were blinded to condition and time. All participants received the treatment to which they were allocated and fidelity was measured to ensure no crossover of treatment components.</p>
                <p>The distribution of treatment sessions was the same across the two conditions. Both treatments were delivered twice per week for 1-hr sessions for 6 weeks, a frequency and cumulative dose which have been shown to be sufficiently intense to facilitate improved speech production in children with CAS (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Namasivayam et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Preston et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Thomas et al., 2014</xref>).</p>

                  <title>Acquisition of Treated Items</title>
                  <p>Individualized target stimuli were developed for each child. These reflected the specific targets for the child and were dependent upon the treatment condition. For example, children in the ultrasound biofeedback condition were treated with selected sounds in a syllable position (e.g., /k/ onset or /s/ coda) with targets increasing in complexity (syllables, words, phrases, and sentences), whereas children in ReST were treated using multisyllabic nonsense words that contained sounds in the child's inventory. Within-session accuracy was rated as 0 (incorrect) or 1 (correct) for each word by the student clinician. For ReST, participants needed to have correct articulation and prosody to be scored as correct, whereas for ultrasound treatment, accuracy is judged on articulation alone.</p>

                  <title>Motor Learning: Generalization Probes</title>
                  <p>The primary outcomes were derived from a common list of 20 untreated polysyllabic words, 20 sentences each containing the single polysyllabic words, and one sentence that was loaded with words containing /ɹ/ and /s/ (see the <xref rid="A1" ref-type="app">Appendix</xref>). The probe was developed by the authors with many words coming from <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Gozzard et al. (2006)</xref>. Polysyllabic words were selected to ensure that probe stimuli were sufficiently challenging to older and milder children with CAS. Probe words were highly picturable and likely known to school-aged children in Australia. Probe sentences were required to be motorically complex and contain various stress patterns (e.g., weak syllable onset) while being unfamiliar to participants. Words and sentences were presented with accompanying pictures on individual PowerPoint slides with an audio file. Participants were required to listen to the audio file before repeating it. Children were never asked to read the stimuli. None of these sentences were treated in either condition.</p>
                  <p>Dependent variables on which the groups were compared included measures of speech sound accuracy and prosody derived from phonetic transcriptions entered into Phon version 3.0.5 (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Hedlund &amp; Rose, 2019</xref>). First, speech sound accuracy was assessed using PPC (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Shriberg et al., 1997</xref>). Second, prosodic accuracy was assessed using a novel Prosodic Severity Score (in which higher numbers represented more severe prosodic impairment). Prosodic accuracy is a concept that incorporates two equally important components, lexical stress errors and syllable segregation, neither of which alone captures the meaning of prosodic accuracy. Accordingly, prosodic accuracy was measured using this novel index, which includes both components. It was hypothesized that it should be more sensitive to ReST than to ultrasound treatment.</p>
                  <p>The Prosodic Severity Score was calculated as follows: <disp-formula id="E1"><mml:math id="m1" overflow="scroll"><mml:mtext mathvariant="italic">Prosodic Severity</mml:mtext><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mfenced open="(" close=")"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>#</mml:mo><mml:mtext mathvariant="italic">words with lexical stress errors</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mfenced open="(" close=")"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>#</mml:mo><mml:mtext mathvariant="italic">words with syllable segregation</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mfenced open="(" close=")"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>#</mml:mo><mml:mtext mathvariant="italic">words in the sample</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:mn>100</mml:mn></mml:math><label>(1)</label></disp-formula>
</p>
                  <p>Lexical stress errors included, for example, transcribed weak syllable deletion or perceptually noted in the inappropriate pitch, duration, or intensity of syllables in words or connected speech. Syllable segregation was retrieved from the probe transcription where an abnormal gap was inserted between sounds and syllables within a word or between words in connected speech. The Prosodic Severity Score is higher when more errors are present in the speech sample.</p>
                  <p>The generalization probes provided a common metric for comparison across the two groups. Probes were administered immediately before the first treatment session, 1 week, and 1 month posttreatment.</p>
                  <p>Two levels of blinding were included in this data collection. First, each probe for an individual child was collected by a different clinician who was not involved in treatment of that child and blinded to their allocation and performance in therapy. Second, phonetic transcriptions from the probes were completed in random order by research assistants who were blind to pretreatment performance, treatment condition, and time point. Diacritics were included to indicate consonant and vowel distortions. Lexical stress markers were included to indicate perceived stress patterns. Syllable segregations were coded with the syllable segregation diacritic used in Phon (^). PPC was computed using Phon software with the specification that diacritics were counted as errors. Lexical stress accuracy was computed using the Phon analysis Word Match and selecting the option for stress pattern. Syllable segregations were identified in Phon by querying the count of the number of occurrences of the syllable segregation diacritic (^).</p>

                <title>Consensus Reliability</title>
                <p>An iterative consensus transcription process using an audio recording was used such that transcriptions were (a) initially completed by hand by the blinded research assistant who transcribed the probe, (b) checked by an independent research assistant as they were entered into Phon, and (c) reviewed again by a different, independent transcriber to verify accuracy of segments, diacritics, lexical stress, and syllable segregations, and to ensure adjustments were properly made for dialectally acceptable variations of productions. If a disagreement in transcription was identified, the first author listened to the segment and chose between the transcriptions.</p>

                  <title>Target Selection</title>
                  <p>All treatment target selection followed the manualized procedure (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">McCabe et al., 2017</xref>). That is, all children had 20 nonsense words created for them containing consonants and vowels that were in their existing repertoire as determined in the assessment described above. No additional stimulability testing was conducted as all sounds needed to have been produced accurately at least once in the assessment tasks. Both individual phonemes and clusters were considered for inclusion in the nonsense words; however, if clusters were included only one cluster was selected as one of the four possible consonants. Across the four included consonants or clusters, diversity in place, manner, and voicing was desired and therefore where possible, selected phonemes differed on at least one of these features. Included consonant sets depended on the individual child and ranged from /b, d, w, p/, which has relatively low distinctive feature diversity to /ɹ, tʃ, pl, g/, which has both higher diversity and complexity. As per the manual and the more recent ReST research, nonsense words varied in length between two and three syllables by child with one child starting with two-syllable nonsense words and six children starting with three-syllable nonsense words. In line with standard ReST procedures, the decision to start at a given nonsense word syllable count was based on the most syllables in a word produced in the pretreatment assessment. The 20 nonsense words for each child therefore consisted of 10 with a strong onset [Sw(w)] and 10 with a weak onset [wS(w)] where the inclusion of the third syllable was optional depending on the treatment complexity selected for an individual child.</p>

                  <title>Session Overview</title>
                  <p>Treatment methods within each session were similar to those described elsewhere (cf. <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">McCabe et al., 2020</xref>). Each session began with prepractice on some of the nonsense words to enable instruction. This was followed by practice on the 20 nonsense words for the remainder of the time. The program was intended to include 1,200 practice attempts over the 12 sessions (100 per session, although if fewer than 100 trials were completed in early sessions then later sessions made up for trials that were not completed to ensure 1,200 total trials).</p>

                  <title>Prepractice</title>
                  <p>Sessions began by instructing or reminding children of what would be considered correct productions of the target nonsense word. This included accurate production of all sounds, accurate stress patterns (“beats,” which represents the number of syllables in the word and the relative stress between syllables), and smooth/connected productions (i.e., smooth transitions between sounds and syllables with no repetitions or restarts, no evidence of syllable or word segregation). As all children had received prior speech therapy, most were familiar with the concept of accurate speech sounds. To convey the concepts of accurate prosody, child-friendly descriptions were used to describe the beats within words, making reference to long/short, loud/soft, and high/low pitch (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Ballard et al., 2010</xref>). Metaphors were used such as comparing strong and weak syllables to long or short train cars or loud or soft drumbeats. To convey the notion of smoothness of productions, metaphors were used such as connected/disconnected train cars or paper dolls holding hands. In early sessions (1–3), prepractice focused on these concepts and in later sessions (4–12) clinicians were free to focus as indicated by the data from the previous session on an individual concept or several specific nonsense words as the child required. Prepractice finished when the child had produced five accurate productions of any target word or words. Prepractice was scheduled for no more than 20 min in the first two sessions and no longer than 10 min in Sessions 3–12. Children were provided with a short break between prepractice and practice.</p>

                  <title>Practice</title>
                  <p>As described in the ReST Manual (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">McCabe et al., 2017</xref>), the practice component of ReST consists of five blocks of therapy trials, each comprising one imitated production of each of the child's 20 nonsense words in random order. Children received delayed randomized KR feedback on 60% of attempts. The standard treatment hierarchy in ReST was followed, which consists of two-syllable nonsense words, three-syllable nonsense words, and three-syllable nonsense words in carrier phrases. In the hierarchy, children move up to a more complex level if they correctly produced more than 80% of trials in two consecutive sessions. Should a child produce fewer than 5% of practice trials correctly in two consecutive sessions, therapy then was stepped down to a lower level in the hierarchy. Additionally, some variation was permitted with sessions dependent on performance. Children who produced four or fewer nonsense words correctly in two consecutive blocks in an individual session were provided with a second period of prepractice before recommencing practice in the same session.

                  <title>Target Selection</title>
                  <p>For each child, two treatment categories were identified based on pretreatment speech production data. Each treatment category included a target consonant in a selected word position (e.g., consonant–vowel [CV], VC, or CC); thus, targets were onset singletons, onset clusters, or coda singletons. Phonemes were included as treatment targets based on the pretreatment assessment described above and consisted of lingual consonants (alveolar, postalveolar, or velar) in onset position or in coda position, selecting the two which were the lowest accuracy prior to treatment (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">McAllister et al., 2022</xref>). Within each treatment category, three adjacent phonemes were selected to create three target sequences. For example, onset singleton /ɹ/ could be treated in sequences /ɹe/, /ɹo/, and /ɹu/; onset s-cluster could be treated in /sk/, /st/, and /sl/ (clusters were always practiced with a following vowel, as in /ski/, /ste/, and /sle/). Once these core sequences were mastered, subsequent practice included monosyllabic words (with onset and coda), polysyllabic words, phrases, and self-generated sentences that included the target sequences (e.g., /ɹe/, <italic toggle="yes">rain</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">rainbow</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">rainbow in the sky</italic>, and self-generated sentences with <italic toggle="yes">rainbow</italic>). Note: Australian English does not use rhotic vowels or word final /ɹ/ in single words.</p>

                  <title>Session Overview</title>
                  <p>A USB-powered Seemore PI 7.5 MHz ultrasound transducer was used to provide visual feedback. The ultrasound sessions were generally similar to methods described elsewhere and are illustrated in <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Preston et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>, <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Preston &amp; Leaman, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Preston, Leece, &amp; Maas, 2016</xref>). To guide the use of ultrasound, sessions were divided into four 12-min therapy periods (Time Periods A, B, C, and D), and each therapy period was separated by a 2-min nonspeech activity (e.g., card game or computer game). A timer was used to adhere to the time structure. Time Periods A and C involved the use of ultrasound for prepractice and practice, whereas no ultrasound was used in Periods B and D. This session structure followed that of prior studies using ultrasound biofeedback in CAS (e.g., <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Preston et al., 2017</xref>), as the goal was to facilitate articulatory changes with ultrasound biofeedback but also to work toward independent practice and limit reliance on external feedback. In the first session, Periods A and C focused heavily on interpreting the ultrasound images and describing tongue shapes and movement patterns for the target sounds. In each session, Time Periods A and B addressed one target sound category selected for the child, and Time Periods C and D addressed the second target sound category.</p>

                  <title>Prepractice</title>
                  <p>Similar to ReST, prepractice focused on establishing a minimal reference of correctness for the sound category. The three sound sequences associated with a sound category (i.e., /ɹe/, /ɹo/, and /ɹu/ for initial /ɹ/) were practiced one at a time until six correct productions were achieved. To achieve correct productions, modeling and verbal instructions were provided, which included reference to the ultrasound visual display (during Time Periods A and C). Sound-specific phonetic placement cues were also provided (e.g., “lift the front of your tongue up a little higher”) along with verbal KP and KR feedback. Shaping techniques were also used if necessary (e.g., shaping /d/ from /t/ or /n/, shaping /ɹ/ from /l/). Once six correct productions were achieved for each sound sequence, the session advanced from prepractice to practice. For children who were not stimulable, sessions could be spent entirely in prepractice. For children who were stimulable, prepractice could be completed in approximately 1–2 min.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Practice</title>
                  <p>Once the prepractice criterion for the session was met, children advanced to practice (regardless of which Time Period they were in). Practice followed speech motor chaining procedures (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Preston, Leece, &amp; Storto, 2019</xref>) such that the target sequence at the syllable level was then incorporated into the monosyllabic word level (which included both an onset and a coda), multisyllabic word level, phrase level, and in self-generated sentences. Practice on a chain always began at the syllable level. All practice occurred in blocks of six attempts, after which a decision point was reached. At each decision point, if the child had achieved at least five of six correct productions of the target sequence in the block, then practice stepped up to the next level of linguistic complexity in the chain (e.g., from syllables to monosyllabic words). If, at any linguistic level, the child achieved zero to four correct trials out of six, then practice moved to the syllable level of the next chain. For example, a child with /s/-cluster targets might begin at /stʌ/ followed by <italic toggle="yes">stun</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">stunning</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">a stunning picture</italic>, and self-generated sentences with <italic toggle="yes">stunning</italic>. If the child failed to produce at least five of six at any of these levels, the next practice was on at the syllable level of another chain, such as /spʌ/.</p>
                  <p>Verbal feedback from the clinician was provided at prespecified levels, fading to less frequent feedback and less KP at higher linguistic levels. Verbal feedback occurred at the syllable level on five of six trials (4 KR + KP, 1 KR), at the monosyllabic word level on five of six trials (3 KR + KP, 2 KR), at the polysyllabic word level on four of six trials (2 KP + KR, 2 KR), at the phrase level on four of six trials (2 KR + KP, 1 KR), and at the self-generated sentence level on three of six trials (1 KR + KP, 2 KR). This verbal feedback schedule was provided during practice regardless of which time block was occurring (with or without the ultrasound).</p>
                  <p>Additionally, starting at the third session, children were required to self-evaluate their performance on three trials per block during Time Blocks B and D (without the ultrasound). Participants rated themselves as correct or incorrect on these trials before getting feedback from the clinician.

As described above, there were two primary outcomes to reflect motor learning: PPC and Prosodic Severity. Improvement over time within treatment groups (increasing medians for PPC and decreasing medians for Prosodic Severity) was tested with Wilcoxon signed-ranks tests. Comparisons between treatment groups used Mann–Whitney <italic toggle="yes">U</italic> tests. An alpha level of .025 was used for all comparisons.</p>

For one child from the ReST group who did not return for the 1-month follow-up, his data were conservatively imputed by assuming return to baseline (pretreatment) levels on the probe of untreated words and sentences. Effect sizes r were interpreted as follows: 0.1 is small, 0.3 medium, and 0.5 large (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Welkowitz et al., 1982</xref>). Statistical significance is reported for all comparisons, but our primary interest in this pilot study was effect sizes.</p>

                <p>Ultrasound treatment fidelity was calculated on adherence to each of duration of each phase, accuracy of feedback, decisions to move up the treatment hierarchy, and inclusion of child self-evaluation. The mean ultrasound treatment fidelity across children was 85.4% (<italic toggle="yes">SD</italic> = 8.4%; range: 70.7–94.7), which is toward the lower end of the previously reported range for ultrasound treatment of children with CAS (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Preston, Leece, &amp; Maas, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Preston, Maas, et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
                <p>As has been the case in recent ReST papers (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Scarcella et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Thomas et al., 2017</xref>), ReST treatment fidelity in the practice phase was calculated on accuracy of the model; provision of feedback only when indicated in the protocol; provision of only KR feedback; and feedback being delayed by 3–5 s. Mean ReST treatment fidelity across children was 93.6% (<italic toggle="yes">SD</italic>, range: 89.5–97). This is comparable or better than other ReST studies (e.g., <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Murray, McCabe, &amp; Ballard, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Thomas et al., 2014</xref>). The only component with poorer fidelity was delayed feedback, where clinicians found it difficult to maintain the delay; again, this aligns with previously reported fidelity.</p>

                <title>Dose of Therapy</title>
                <p>In recent years, cumulative dose and dose intensity have been measures of interest in interpreting treatment research (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Baker, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Warren et al., 2007</xref>). The total number of trials in the practice phase of each treatment for each child is reported in <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Importantly, in both arms, treatment was provided in equal duration. All children in each arm had 12 sessions of treatment spread over 6 weeks, and each session was between 55 and 60 min on each occasion, yielding a cumulative duration of between 660 and 720 min per child. Holding the cumulative dose (time) constant allows for comparison based on number of trials as required. Where children in either group missed a session due to illness, it was replaced with another session as soon as practical. This resulted in one child in each arm taking 6.5 weeks to complete 12 sessions.</p>

                <p>In ultrasound therapy, the number of trials is dependent on the speed of the clinician and the responsiveness of the child. In the ultrasound arm, clinicians were asked to aim for at least 100 practice trials per session. In ReST therapy, the aim is for 100 trials per session (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">McCabe et al., 2017</xref>); however, some children in some previous studies have not achieved this goal and children who step up to the carrier phrase level may have insufficient time per session to achieve this number of trials.</p>
                <p>As can be seen in <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, ultrasound treatment resulted in a greater mean number of trials per session than ReST, although there was much more variability in the number of trials in ultrasound therapy than in ReST as may have been expected from the different protocols.</p>

              <p>Target selection was different for each group and therefore it was not appropriate to directly compare within-session treatment data between groups. Acquisition (correct production of target utterances during treatment) was calculated by the treating clinicians during the session, resulting in a percent correct per session. The mean percent correct for each group for all 12 sessions is shown in <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, with error bars representing standard deviations. It can be seen that both groups increased the accuracy of production of the target utterances. While these data reveal that both treatments resulted in an increase in session performance of the respective targets across the 12 treatment sessions, the hypotheses concern generalization and retention.

                <p>To assess generalization to untreated words following treatment, we first explored changes in speech sound accuracy on PPC. Results of a Wilcoxon signed-ranks test indicated a significant effect of time from pre- to posttreatment on children's PPC, with a large treatment effect (<italic toggle="yes">Z</italic> = 2.67, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = .008, <italic toggle="yes">r</italic> = .714). To address the second hypothesis that the ultrasound biofeedback group would show greater increase than the ReST group, a Group × Time interaction was then explored by comparing the groups on their change scores (postminus pretreatment) using a Mann–Whitney <italic toggle="yes">U</italic> test. There was no significant group difference on the change scores and the effect size was small (Z = .575, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = .620, <italic toggle="yes">r</italic> = .15).</p>
                <p>We next explored generalization to untreated words on Prosodic Severity from pre- to posttreatment. The results of a Wilcoxon signed-ranks test indicated no significant difference between pre- and posttreatment Prosodic Severity (<italic toggle="yes">Z</italic> = 1.57, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = .16, <italic toggle="yes">r</italic> = .420), although the effect size was moderate. Additionally, a Mann–Whitney <italic toggle="yes">U</italic> was used to test the hypothesis that ReST would result in more improvement in Prosodic Severity than ultrasound biofeedback; the results indicated no significant group difference on the prosodic severity change scores from pre- to immediately posttreatment (<italic toggle="yes">Z</italic> = .45, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = .710, <italic toggle="yes">r</italic> = .131) again with a small effect size.</p>

                <title>Retention</title>
                <p>The second hypothesis was that both treatments would result in retention of skills above pretreatment levels. To assess whether children's speech sound accuracy remained above pretreatment levels at the 1-month follow-up, PPC at pretreatment was compared with PPC at follow-up using a Wilcoxon signed-ranks test. There was a significant positive difference between pretreatment and follow-up (Z = 3.23, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = .001, <italic toggle="yes">r</italic> = .863) with a very large effect size, suggesting greater accuracy at the follow-up compared with pretreatment. A Mann–Whitney U on the change scores revealed no evidence of a Group × Time interaction (Z = .06, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 1.00, <italic toggle="yes">r</italic> = .016) with virtually no effect size, suggesting similar retention of PPC between the two groups.</p>
                <p>Finally, to assess whether children's prosody was significantly different at the 1-month follow-up than at pretreatment, Prosodic Severity scores were compared at pretreatment and follow-up using a Wilcoxon signed-ranks test. The results suggested a significant difference between pretreatment and the 1-month follow-up on Prosodic Severity (<italic toggle="yes">Z</italic> = 2.61, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = .009, <italic toggle="yes">r</italic> = .697) with a large effect size. Results of a Mann–Whitney <italic toggle="yes">U</italic> test on Prosodic Severity change scores indicated no significant evidence of a Group × Time interaction on Prosodic Severity from pretreatment to the 1-month follow-up (<italic toggle="yes">Z</italic> = 1.73, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = .086, <italic toggle="yes">r</italic> = .462), although the effect size favoring Ultrasound was moderate.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>This study compared two motor-based treatments for school-age children with CAS. Over the course of 12 treatment sessions delivered over 6 weeks, both treatments were associated with increased accuracy on treated items thus allowing for hypothesis testing on the two a priori questions regarding generalization and retention. Additionally, both treatments resulted in significantly higher posttreatment than pretreatment speech sound accuracy (PPC). Fewer prosodic errors on untreated words were observed posttreatment, although this reduction in prosodic errors only reached statistical significance at the 1-month follow-up. However, with respect to the first hypothesis, we did not find evidence that ultrasound biofeedback results in more accurate speech sound production than ReST, or that ReST results in more accurate prosody than ultrasound biofeedback. The study showed no evidence of group differences, with nonsignificant <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> values and small to moderate sample effect sizes. This was in the context of statistically significant retention with very large sample effect sizes, suggesting that if any group differences in effectiveness exist, they are smaller than the absolute changes associated with either treatment.</p>
              <p>As there are few studies for CAS that compare two different active treatment conditions using a randomized group design, this study adds information that can provide some preliminary clinical guidance for clinicians. That is, based on this study, there is no evidence of a superior treatment and, at present, both treatments may be equally viable options for treating school-age children with CAS. Although small, this study provides the first group evidence that ultrasound biofeedback is an effective intervention for school aged children with CAS and extends the age range to include children as young as 6 years old. Additionally, this study provides group-level evidence of the effectiveness of ReST treatment when provided twice per week, a finding previously reported in a single case experimental design study (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Thomas et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
              <p>It is possible that the two treatments address speech motor control via different pathways, with ReST being more focused on developing an accurate motor plan before speech (feedforward) and ultrasound addressing trial to trial performance through visual feedback (e.g., <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Terband et al., 2009</xref>). Despite this hypothesized difference in mechanisms, we found little difference in outcome with both showing changes following treatment, including generalization and retention. We could speculate that multiple theoretically driven treatments addressing either feedback or feedforward control, if delivered in sufficient dose/practice, may result in a relatively permanent change in speech performance. Further research is needed to validate this claim.</p>
              <p>One notable difference between the two treatments in this study is the complexity of targets compared with the cumulative dose in each of the treatments, with ReST using relatively more complex targets with a relatively lower dose while children in the ultrasound arm began practice with relatively simpler targets with a higher dose, despite dose not being deliberately manipulated in the study. This observation could be interpreted in two ways. First, that there is an as-yet undetermined minimum dose for effective treatment and children in both arms received this dose. Alternately, there may be an interaction between dose and target complexity that clinicians could use in planning therapy; if this were proven experimentally, choosing simpler targets with more practice or complex targets with less could be tested in future studies.</p>
              <sec>
                <title>Caveats and Limitations</title>
                <p>This pilot RCT included a relatively small sample, although the rarity of CAS has, to date, necessitated the use of small samples in the literature. While the sample size was justified in relation to previous research, it limits the statistical power and the results should therefore be viewed as preliminary and not yet definitive. The large within-group variability, reflecting the heterogeneity of CAS, also limits the statistical power. However, the effect sizes reported here can be used to guide future studies.</p>
                <p>The significant effect of time suggests that both groups increased their speech sound accuracy over the 6 weeks of treatment and maintained that change for 4 weeks following the completion of treatment. We also observed a trend toward fewer prosodic errors immediately following treatment, and the effect reached statistical significance at the 1-month follow-up visit (with no observable differences between groups). However, the design did not include an untreated control group. Therefore, the relative contributions of the treatment conditions versus maturation effects cannot be distinguished. Prior research, however, has suggested that both of these treatments result in greater improvements in treated relative to untreated targets (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Murray, McCabe, &amp; Ballard, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Preston et al., 2013</xref>). It should also be noted that school-aged children with CAS, as reported here, unlike preschoolers, do not rapidly change their speech without therapy (e.g., <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Jacks et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
                <p>As with most studies of CAS intervention, there was variation in treatment response. The sample size is not sufficiently large to determine whether there are predictors of individual factors that may indicate which children are best suited for either of these treatments. It should be noted that a recent individual participant data analysis of ReST studies (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Ng et al., 2022</xref>) has reported that baseline characteristics including, for example, better performance on treated nonsense words, higher expressive language and GFTA scores, and lower speech consistency and percent vowels correct predict absolute performance on treated nonsense words, whereas pretreatment performance on real words predicts performance post treatment on untreated real words. However, future research should be aimed at determining if measurable child-level factors can inform candidacy for ultrasound biofeedback and to compare suitability across treatments. Finally, inclusion of parent and patient reported outcome measures is required to establish the ecological validity of the reported changes in speech accuracy and prosody. In the absence of a significant difference in accuracy-based outcomes, such information may be helpful for clinicians and families in choosing an appropriate intervention for an individual child.</p>

                <title>Future Research and Conclusions</title>
                <p>Clearly, additional research is required to explore a range of issues that arise from this article. These include the need to conduct larger studies comparing these two interventions and others, in particular, studies which consider the sequence and timing of individual interventions are needed to inform clinical practice about which intervention is appropriate at a given time. This article has suggested that there may be an interaction between therapy dose and target complexity and indeed that there may be a minimum effective dose of motor speech treatment, regardless of which intervention is selected. These questions need to be explicitly examined. This study did not consider parent or child perspectives on the interventions nor were measures of participation collected. Future studies need to consider outcomes more broadly. Finally, there is no agreed measure of clinically significant change in CAS, and this area needs further research so that the results of studies such as this one can be interpreted clinically. The combination of using parent and child reported outcome measures and an agreed measure of clinically significant change will substantially improve the utility of future treatment studies.</p>
                <p>Both ReST and ultrasound biofeedback were associated with improvements in speech sound accuracy in untreated words immediately after treatment, and speech sound accuracy and prosody were above pretreatment levels at a 1-month follow-up. This study did not identify a superior treatment, suggesting that both motor-based approaches are presently equally viable options for clinicians who treat children with CAS.</p>
