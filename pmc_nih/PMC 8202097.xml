                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Metastatic human epidermal growth receptor II (HER2) negative breast cancer remains incurable. Our phase I study showed that anti-CD3 × anti-HER2 bispecific antibody armed activated T cells (HER2 BATs) may be effective against HER2-tumors. This phase II trial evaluates the efficacy and immune responses of HER2 BATs given to patients with metastatic HER2-estrogen and/or progesterone receptor positive (HR+) and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) as immune consolidation after chemotherapy. The primary objective of this study was to increase the traditional median time to progression after failure of first-line therapy of 2–4 months with the secondary endpoints of increasing overall survival (OS) and immune responses.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>HER2- metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients received 3 weekly infusions of HER2 BATs and a boost after 12 weeks.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>This phase II study included 24 HER2-HR+ and 8 TNBC patients who received a mean of 3.75 and 2.4 lines of prior chemotherapy, respectively. Eight of 32 evaluable patients were stable at 4 months after the first infusion. There were no dose limiting toxicities. Tumor markers decreased in 13 of 23 (56.5%) patients who had tumor markers. The median OS was 13.1 (95% CI 8.6 to 17.4), 15.2 (95% CI 8.6 to 19.8), and 12.3 (95% CI 2.1 to 17.8) months for the entire group, HER2-HR+, and TNBC patients, respectively. Median OS for patients with chemotherapy-sensitive and chemotherapy-resistant disease after chemotherapy was 14.6 (9.6–21.8) and 8.6 (3.3–17.3) months, respectively. There were statistically significant increases in interferon-γ immunospots, Th<sub>1</sub> cytokines, Th<sub>2</sub> cytokines, and chemokines after HER2 BATs infusions.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>In heavily pretreated HER2-patients, immune consolidation with HER2 BATs after chemotherapy appears to increase the proportion of patients who were stable at 4 months and the median OS for both groups as well as increased adaptive and innate antitumor responses. Future studies combining HER2 BATs with checkpoint inhibitors or other immunomodulators may improve clinical outcomes.</p>

              <p>Patients with unresectable or human epidermal growth receptor II (HER2) negative metastatic breast cancer (MBC) have a median overall survival (OS) between 18 and 24 months.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Progression of disease after failure of first-line therapy is inevitable and durable responses to subsequent therapies are in the order of months and become shorter and shorter after each subsequent line of therapy.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> There is a need for novel, non-toxic strategies to prolong time to progression (TTP) and OS in the 75%–80% of the HER2-MBC patients who are not eligible for HER2-targeted therapies.</p>
              <p>Although trastuzumab and other anti-HER2 antibodies have been approved for HER2 positive breast cancer (BrCa), the antibodies or bispecific antibodies (BiAb) have failed in clinical trials directed at HER2 negative BrCa. Arming ex vivo activated T cells (ATC) with anti-CD3 × anti-HER2 BiAb (HER2Bi) creates an entire population of HER2Bi armed ATC (HER2 BATs) that kill BrCa cells in a non-MHC restricted manner via perforin and granzyme B. Our preclinical studies show that HER2 BATs not only target and kill cells expressing high levels of HER2 but also low HER2 receptor expressing target cells.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 4</xref></p>
              <p>In a phase I clinical trial, the median OS for 23 women with HER2 0–3+MBC who received multiple infusions of HER2 BATs was 37 months.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> The median OS for the HER2 3+ and the HER2 negative (0–2+) were 57 and 27 months, respectively.

              <p>In this study, we hypothesized that consolidation IT consisting of 3 weekly HER2 BATs infusions after 4 months or 4 cycles of standard chemotherapy (chemoT) in combination with cyclophosphamide immune depletion would improve TTP from an estimated 2–4 months and OS. This phase II study confirms the encouraging clinical effects of our phase I study in women with high risk MBC and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC).<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> It also shows that HER2 BATs infusions can vaccinate the endogenous immune system against the patient’s own tumors.</p>

PBMC were collected from patients using a single apheresis, activated with anti-CD3 mAb and expanded with interleukin 2 (IL-2) to ATC. The ATC were harvested after 12–16 days of culture, armed with HER2Bi,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> and cryopreserved in aliquots for infusions.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> After apheresis, patients received four cycles or 4 months of their oncologist’s choice chemoT. The original protocol included a single dose of lymphodepleting cyclophosphamide 1.0 gm/m<sup>2</sup> (Cy) on day −7 prior to the first dose of HER2 BATs. Immune studies in the first five patients (#1–5) suggested that the addition of Cy to 4 cycles or 4 months of chemotherapy was impairing endogenous immune. Therefore, further immune depletion was eliminated from the protocol. In an effort to increase immune responses, the last five patients (#28 – #32) were given low dose IL-2 300 000 IU/m<sup>2</sup> subcutaneous injections daily and granulocyte-macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) 250 µg/m<sup>2</sup> two times per week.

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p>The primary endpoint was to determine if infusions of HER2 BATs would increase the TTP beyond the estimated 2 months expected after 3 cycles of chemoT and to confirm the safety of HER2 BATS. SD (SD) and OS were measured from the first infusion. Published trials on chemoT alone reported a median TTP of around 1.6 months when calculated from completion of 3 cycles of chemoT without additional treatment. We estimated the median TTP would be roughly 2 months under traditional treatment (estimated 4-month TTP was 25%). We hypothesized that HER2 BATs treatment would improve the median TTP by 2 months (estimated 4-month TTP of 50%) using one-stage design test for a 4-month TTP ≤25% vs a 4-month TTP ≥50%. If ≥9 out of 26 patients had not progressed by the 4-month follow-up, we could declare that the treatment was effective on TTP. The secondary endpoint was OS among all patients which will be investigated from enrolment and from the first BATs infusion. The Kaplan-Meier (K-M) method was used to estimate TTP and OS. TTP and OS was examined among the chemoT-sensitive (ChemoS) and chemoT-resistant (ChemoR) groups. The secondary endpoints were to assess response rates. TTP and OS were measured from enrolment of the date of the first infusion. Descriptive statistics were used to evaluate immune monitoring using Prism (GraphPad, V.8.0). We used a paired t-test to compare their levels at pre-, mid- and post-infusion time points separated by their chemoT response status (ChemoS or ChemoR). We also applied Cox regression models to examine if chemoT response status, each biomarker level at prefirst infusion, or the change between preinfusion and postinfusion would be associated with TTP or OS. Biomarkers in ELISpot were log10-transformed in data analysis to improve their normality of distribution.</p>

The fold changes were all highly significant for those listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">online supplemental table S5</xref>. The upper panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4A</xref> shows that Th<sub>1</sub> cytokine levels IL-12, IL-2, IFN-γ, TNF-α and IL-2R increased significantly (p&lt;0.0001 p&lt;0.0005) at mid-IT and post-IT compared with pre-IT levels. The fold increases for Th<sub>1</sub> cytokines IL-2, IL-2R, IL-12, TNF-α, IFN-ɣ, GM-CSF were 23.8, 1.6, 46.2, 14.5 times baseline, respectively.

Among the Th<sub>2</sub> cytokines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4B</xref>), IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-13 showed significantly increased levels at mid-IT and post-IT (p&lt;0.0005) compared with pre-IT levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4B</xref>). IL-6 levels were significantly elevated at mid-IT and post-IT (p&lt;0.001) without concomitant increases in clinical toxicities. Intriguingly, IFNγ induced chemokines IP-10 and MIG levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4C</xref>) increased significantly at mid-IT and post-IT along with T cell recruiting chemokines MIP-1α and MIP-1β (p&lt;0.0001 and p&lt;0.0003) compared with pre-IT levels. The mean = Th<sub>1</sub>[IL-2+IFNγ]/Th2 [IL-4+IL-10] ratio in the lower right of panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4</xref>, shows a Th<sub>1</sub>-type response induced as a function of HER2 BAT infusions, ratio increasing from 1 at pre-IT to 3.5 at post-IT. It should be noted that fold changes of serum cytokines/chemokines were greater than 10-fold for IL-2, TNF-α, IFN-ɣ, MIP-1α, and MIP-1β. These findings were consistent with increased specific IFN-γ production observed by ELISpot analysis of patient PBMC exposed to SK-BR-3 tumor cells at the post-IT time point. Together these immune data show that there is activation of a systemic endogenous immune effect induced by infusions of HER2 BATs.

We observed an increase in serum levels of IL-12 at mid-IT and pos-tIT time points in patients with MBC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4A</xref>). These data provide evidence that HER2 BATs infusions induce systemic Th<sub>1</sub>-type antitumor immunity that may activate monocytes during the process of T cell engagement of the tumor to produce IL-12.</p>

              <p>This study shows that immune consolidation with HER2 BATs after chemoT may improve clinical responses in patients who have failed multiple lines of therapy. Furthermore, infusions of HER2 BATs induced adaptive and innate immune responses in heavily pretreated HER2-HR+patients and TNBC patients. Historically, patients progress sooner after each subsequent line of therapy. Initial responses to hormonal and chemoT in patients with HER2- metastatic BrCa last between 8 and 14 months.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 8</xref> In phase III trials of second and subsequent lines of chemoT for HER2-metastatic disease, the median TTP ranged from 3 to 6.3 months.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 7 9–11</xref></p>
              <p>By the time of the first infusion after chemoT, the mean number of lines of chemoT was 4.4 L of therapy for the entire study population. Given this prospective, the median OS for the entire group of 13.8 months is noteworthy. The median OS for the HR +patients who had received a mean of 4.75 L of therapy and TNBC patients who had received a mean of 3.28 L of therapy were 16.5 and 12.3 months, respectively. There are only a few study comparators for OS for HR+, HER2-MBC and mTNBC for 2L+failures of chemoT. The OS for HER2-patients is usually reported as HER2- MBC together with mTNBC after they have received 2L+was 12.6 months.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> In study 301, the eribulin phase 3 group MBC/mTNBC had a median OS of 15.1 months after 2 L.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Perez <italic>et al</italic> reported a median OS of 8.8 months in the MBC/mTNBC population after 3 L<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> and Isakoff <italic>et al</italic> reported a median OS of 11.0 months after 1–2 L in the MBC/mTBNC patients.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p>
              <p>For the eight patients with metastatic TNBC who received a mean of 2.4 L (range of 1–6 L), the median OS was 12.4 months with a TTP of 3.2 months after receiving a mean of 3.4 L. Only a few studies report TNBC patients. O'Shaughnessy <italic>et al</italic> reported a median OS of 8.1 months for 109 patients with mTBNC after 2–3 L<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> and Li <italic>et al</italic> reported a median OS of 16.5 months for five patients with mTNBC patients after 2–3 L.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p>
              <p>We also analyzed TTP and OS from the initiation of chemoT. The median OS from starting chemoT for all patients, HER2-HR+, and TNBC were 17.0, 19.0, and 15.1 months, respectively. The medians for OS for time from initiating chemoT were not different from the medians for OS for time from first infusion.</p>
              <p>The decreased in the median OS of 27 months from the first infusion seen in the HER2-group in our earlier phase I clinical trial<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> to a median OS of 15.2 months in this trial may be due to the additional lines of chemoT and/or investigator selection bias. The additional chemoT may impair immune responses that were already damaged by chemoT. However, eliminating Cy depletion or addition of IL-2 and GM-CSF did not improve immune responses in those who did not receive Cy depletion or the combination of IL-2 and GM-CSF.</p>
              <p>Immune responses to SK-BR-3 BrCa line and K562 (NK target) were significantly increased above pretreatment baseline at the mid-IT after starting HER2 BATs infusions. There were no obvious differences in immune responses between patients who received Cy or patients who received IL-2 and GM-CSF from patients who did not receive either Cy or IL-2/GM-CSF, although the numbers were too small to see differences. Serum Th<sub>1</sub> and Th<sub>2</sub> cytokines significantly increased from baseline to levels seen at mid-IT and post-IT when compared with pre-IT levels. The Th<sub>2</sub> cytokines IL-4 and IL-6 increased significantly. Although levels of IL-10 and IL-13 increased in some patients, the difference was not statistically significant. The IP-10 (CXCL10), MIP-1α, MIG, and IL-12 were significantly elevated with IT with the Th<sub>1</sub>/Th<sub>2</sub> ratio increasing from 1.0 pre-IT to 3.5 post-IT. These immune correlates show that 3–4 infusions of 11–83 x 10<sup>9</sup> are able to induce immune responses. Three infusions of HER2 BATs followed by a boost induced endogenous cellular immune responses similar to those seen in the phase I.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Infusions of HER2 BATs in the phase I clinical trial involving 23 patients were safe, induced CTL and antibodies directed at BrCa antigens, a Th<sub>1</sub> cytokine pattern, and a median OS of 27 months for the HER2 negative patients.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> There was no chemoT given between apheresis and the first HER2 BATs infusion. The rationale for making immune space for HER2 BATs to expand after infusion was part of the original rationale. To our surprise, despite the extensive amount chemoT, the immune systems of patients made detectable anti-tumor responses. It should be noted that the patients with a HER2- tumors in the phase I received mild or no bridging chemoT.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p>
              <p>In subsequent proof-of-concept study involving five of the phase I MBC patients, ‘immune T cells’ were obtained by a second apheresis after HER2 BATs infusions were expanded to produce immune ATC that were infused after autologous stem cell transplant (SCT). Immune testing within 1 month after SCT showed accelerated and enhanced reconstitution of specific anti-BrCa cellular and humoral responses to different epitopes of cancer antigens and different tumor associated antigens. Together, the immune data from the phase I study using booster infusions of immune ATC after SCT show that specific immunity develops and can be transfer after SCT.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> A follow-up question is whether ATC alone without infusion of BiAb can provide an antitumor effect. Multiple infusions of ATC were given to 23 women with stage IIIb/IV BrCa after autologous SCT in an early phase I study.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> OS and PFS at 32 months were 70% and 50%, respectively; whereas the OS and PFS in the historical group of 22 autologous SCT without ATC at 32 months was 50% and 10%, respectively. The study suggested that ATC alone can provide anti-tumor activity and the arming of ATC enhances anti-tumor activity above that seen for ATC alone.</p>
              <p>In summary, HER2 BATs is a promising immunotherapeutic in patients with HER2 negative, HR+ or TNBC MBC. The correlative studies show that 3–4 infusions of HER2 BATs could induce endogenous adaptive and innate immune responses. This study suggests those with chemoS disease would benefit the most from IT and patients who are stable or better at the time of enrolment may have improved OS. Our study shows that those with SD, PR, or CR survived longer than those with PD. The K-M curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2G</xref>) shows significant difference between patients with stable or better disease and those with PD (p=0.029) and the hazard rate in chemoS patients was 43% of that in chemoR patients showing that chemoS patients had a significantly better OS than chemoR patients (HR=0.39, p=0.068). The chemoS effect was apparent in the HR+ group with median OS for chemoS and chemoR disease of 16.5 and 8.6 months, respectively. These results suggest that the ten patients who did not receive HER2 BATs due to PD may have benefited going directly to IT. Our ongoing trials in MBC and hormone refractory prostate cancer using HER2 BATs in combination with checkpoint inhibitors without additional chemoT suggest that their immune systems may be providing antitumor effects. The design of upcoming trials using HER2 BATs with checkpoint inhibitors or other immune modulators may lead to further improvements in T cell-based IT.</p>
