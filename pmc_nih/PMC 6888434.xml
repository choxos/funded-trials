                <p>Although the health benefits of exercise and exposure to nature are well established, most evidence of their interaction comes from acute observations of single sessions of activity. However, documenting improved health outcomes requires ongoing interventions, measurement of multiple outcomes, and longitudinal analyses. We conducted a pilot study to guide the development of a protocol for future longitudinal studies that would assess multiple physiological and psychological outcomes. Herein, we report psychological outcomes measured from thirty-eight participants before and after three conditions: a 50 min walk on a forest path, a 50 min walk along a busy road, and a period of activities of daily living. Changes in positive and negative affect, anxiety, perceived stress, and working memory are reported. We benchmark these results to existing studies that used similar protocols and also identify elements of the protocol that might impair recruitment or retention of subjects in longer-term studies. Linear mixed-models regression revealed that walking improved psychological state when compared to activities of daily living, regardless of walk environment (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Comparison of mean differences showed that forest walks yielded the largest and most consistent improvements in psychological state. Thus, despite a protocol that required a 3.5 h time commitment per laboratory visit, the beneficial effects of walking and exposure to a forested environment were observed. </p>

              <title>1. Introduction</title>
              <p>Mental health diagnoses and the need for mental health treatments have increased substantially in recent decades. Current estimates suggest that 20% of adults experience a mental illness in a given year, and 4.6% experience a serious mental illness in 2018 [<xref rid="B1-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Some of the increase in diagnoses of mental illness across socio-economic groups has been attributed to the stresses of urbanization and lack of contact with nature [<xref rid="B2-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In response, awareness of the relationship between mental health and the structure of the built environment has grown worldwide, leading to a corresponding increase in research on the social and health benefits of urban greenspace. </p>
              <p>Urban greenspace is defined as areas with predominant vegetation (e.g., trees, grasslands, or water features), whether naturally occurring or man-made spaces [<xref rid="B6-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The American Public Health Association has recommended that public health practitioners collaborate with urban planners, parks and recreation departments, and others to increase access to greenspace and encourage people to be more active outdoors [<xref rid="B8-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Similarly, the United Nations made the unprecedented move in 2015 to include promotion of mental health in their Sustainable Development Agenda and proposed that access to greenspace in urban areas be incorporated into public health initiatives [<xref rid="B10-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. A grass roots movement has developed to encourage physicians and other health care providers to encourage patients to engage in physical activity in greenspaces by writing “nature”, “park”, or “green” prescriptions (hereafter “Nature Rx”) [<xref rid="B12-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Nature Rx is an example of a non-pharmacological or social prescription intended to increase physical activity and increase time outside [<xref rid="B16-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, evidence documenting the specific health conditions that would benefit from the appropriate “dose” of nature and how different populations may respond to Nature Rx is lacking [<xref rid="B17-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p>
              <p>Several mechanisms have been proposed to yield improvements in psychological and physiological outcomes in response to exposure to greenspace independently of increased physical activity. These diverse mechanisms include, but are not limited to: psychological stress reduction; attention restoration; exposure to cleaner air and secondary plant compounds (phytoncides); and improved social networks [<xref rid="B9-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B19-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Population-based cross-sectional studies show that living in or near urban greenspaces is associated with a lower incidence of psychiatric morbidity (including anxiety, and both self-reported and objective stress measures), as well as cardiometabolic disease, after controlling for measures of socioeconomic status, demographic factors, and physical activity [<xref rid="B32-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B35-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B36-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. A limited number of longitudinal studies also support the hypothesis that exposure to greenspace may promote improved health outcomes, such as self-reported mental health and the incidence of type 2 diabetes, independently of increased physical activity [<xref rid="B37-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B38-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B39-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Thus, while numerous studies have long indicated that light-to-moderate physical activity has a strong positive association with health and well-being [<xref rid="B40-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="B41-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="B42-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="B43-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], greenspace exposure has unique characteristics that may confer added health benefits via multiple pathways for those completing physical activity in a green environment. </p>
              <p>Additional evidence supporting the hypothesis that exposure to greenspace adds to or synergizes with physical activity comes from experimental studies that measure a battery of mental and cognitive outcomes before and after physical activity in green and non-green environments [<xref rid="B12-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B44-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="B45-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Berman and colleagues demonstrated that, following a mentally fatiguing task, a 50–55 min walk in the forest, but not along city sidewalk, conferred improvements in attention and affect [<xref rid="B46-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Bratman et al. similarly found that a 90 min walk in a forest led to reductions in rumination (i.e., the process of continuously thinking the same thoughts repeatedly, which is generally associated with anxiety and depression) and decreases in neural activity in brain regions associated with rumination [<xref rid="B47-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Meanwhile, Park and colleagues found improvements in psychological and physiological (e.g., cortisol and heart rate variation) measures of stress when participants walked in, or simply sat and viewed a forest for 20 min, but not city streets [<xref rid="B48-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="B49-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. </p>
              <p>Taken together, the preceding papers and others in the literature indicate that a single bout of exercise in greenspace results in greater improvements in acute measures of cognitive function, mood, and mental well-being, compared to similar amounts of exercise completed indoors or in urban areas [<xref rid="B50-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="B51-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="B52-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. In contrast, studies of walking interventions aimed at improving health outcomes typically last weeks or months [<xref rid="B53-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="B54-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="B55-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="B56-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,<xref rid="B57-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="B58-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Although studies comparing the effects of walks in green- versus non- greenspaces show dramatic changes in acute measures of psychological state, a research gap exists in our understanding of whether regular bouts of exercise in greenspace lead to greater improvement in long-term health outcomes and quality of life than the same amount of activity in built spaces.</p>
              <p>The Walking Green Project (WG) was designed to engage and enrich the growing field of inquiry surrounding the Nature Rx movement. The project consists of two pilot studies one conducted at Northwestern University (NU) (<uri>ClinicalTrials.gov</uri> registration #NCT03950661) and one at the University of Minnesota (UMN) (e.g., de Brito et al., [<xref rid="B59-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] <uri>ClinicalTrials.gov</uri> #NCT03442998). Both pilot studies were designed to inform the development of protocols for future studies of longer duration in populations with documented mental or physical health concerns. Of specific concern for the development of future protocols was that the burden imposed by taking multiple physiological and psychological measures at each visit might offset benefits of the proposed interventions. Therefore, the present paper examines a subset of data from WG-NU to provide a direct comparison to the study by Berman and colleagues [<xref rid="B46-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Both WG-NU and Berman et al. [<xref rid="B46-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] used similar study cohorts (convenience samples of healthy, young adults), similar exposures (50 min walks along a forest path and a busy road), and similar assessments (Positive and Negative Affect Scale, backward digit span test) [<xref rid="B46-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. WG-NU additionally assessed anxiety and perceived stress and collected data from sessions during which participants engaged in their normal daily activities (Activities of Daily Living, ADL) instead of study-related walking. We report on lessons learned in our efforts to recruit and retain equal numbers of men and women for a protocol that required multiple visits to the laboratory, some lasting up to 3.5 hours. </p>

                <p>Walking Green-NU used a within-subjects randomized crossover design (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-04338-f001">Figure 1</xref>). After providing informed consent, participants completed a brief survey to assess their psychological and cognitive states (hereafter, “survey”). Subsequently, each participant completed two series of three 50 min walks in a specified location, separated by a nine-day washout period between series (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-04338-f001">Figure 1</xref>). Each participant completed a series of three 50 min walks along a busy road and one series in a forest preserve, but the sequence (Roadside to Forest (RtF) or Forest to Road (FtR)) for walk locations was assigned randomly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-04338-f001">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

The walks taken on days 8 and 22 are the first walks that each participant took in each location and thereby provided the most direct comparison to prior studies [<xref rid="B46-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="B47-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="B48-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Prior to each walk participants came to the laboratory, where they completed the survey to assess their psychological and cognitive state and also engaged in measurement of physiological outcomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-04338-f002">Figure 2</xref>A). Participants were then driven to the start site for the walk; after the walk they were driven back to the laboratory where they repeated the survey in order to assess their post-walk psychological and cognitive state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-04338-f002">Figure 2</xref>A). </p>
                <p>To provide control data about changes in psychological and cognitive state on days with no walks, participants came to the laboratory on days 15 and 29 and completed the survey but did not go for a study-related walk.

                <p>After completing the pre-walk survey, one to four participants were driven from the laboratory to the starting point for the walks; a drive of approximately 10 km (~20 min; one-way). The duration of the drive is consistent with the Forest Preserve District of Cook County’s goal to ensure that 75% of county residents can access forest preserves in 20 min by car or 45 min by public transportation [<xref rid="B60-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Forest and roadside walks both began and ended in the parking lot of Harms Woods (George F. Nixon Woods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-04338-f003">Figure 3</xref>A), one of the Forest Preserves of Cook County, IL, located at the intersection of Harms Road and Old Orchard Road in Glenview, IL. Participants assigned to walk along the roadside crossed Harms Road (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-04338-f003">Figure 3</xref>B) and walked east, on the sidewalk of Old Orchard Road (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-04338-f003">Figure 3</xref>C,D). This road is a busy 4 lane road that passes over Interstate 94 as it approaches a large shopping mall approximately 1 km away. Participants assigned to walk in the forest walked north from the parking lot on a well-groomed gravel trail into the woods along the North Branch Trail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-04338-f003">Figure 3</xref>E), which follows the Chicago River (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-04338-f003">Figure 3</xref>F). After walking north for approximately 500 m, they crossed a footbridge over the river then walked south on the graveled trail for approximately 750 m (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-04338-f003">Figure 3</xref>G). Distances walked along both routes varied depending on each participants’ pace. </p>
                <p>Participants were instructed to walk the assigned route for 25 min and then return by the same route. All participants walked alone. If multiple participants had been driven to the walk site together, their start times were staggered so they were not walking in pairs or groups. Participants did not carry cell phones or other mobile devices during the walks, and they were provided a stopwatch to time their walks. Participants controlled their own walking pace, were discouraged from running, and were asked not to sit down at any point, but simply to walk continuously. After a nine-day washout period, participants walked in the other location.</p>

Linear mixed-models regression supported this interpretation, revealing the effects of intervention on changes in Positive Affect, Negative Affect, STAI-state, and Perceived Stress, but not working memory (vBDS) (<xref rid="ijerph-16-04338-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>).</p>
                <p>Closer inspection of the mean differences among interventions (details in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijerph-16-04338">Supplementary Materials</xref>, <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijerph-16-04338">Tables S2–S6</xref>) revealed that although walking leads to improved psychological state regardless of location, walks in the forest lead to greater improvements than walks on the roadside for several of the measures. Specifically, positive affect showed the greatest improvement following forest walks (Mean change [95% CI] +1.7 points [−0.6, 4.0]). However, there was a slight decrease in positive affect following roadside walks (-0.4 points [−2.1, 1.2]) and a greater decline after activities of daily living (ADL-R: −1.7 points [−3.6, 0.2]. ADL-F: −1.5 points [−2.8, −0.06]). </p>
                <p>Negative affect improved following forest walks, as indicated by a decrease in scores (−1.4 points [−2.3, −0.4]). Roadside walks led to smaller improvements in negative affect (−0.8 points [−2.0, 0.3]). In contrast, negative affect was slightly worse after ADLs, indicated by a positive change in score (ADL-R: 0.1 points [−1.0, 1.2]. ADL-F: 0.9 points [0.2, 1.7]). Forest walks also led to greater reductions in state anxiety than did roadside walks (Forest: −3.0 points [−5.7, −0.3]; Roadside: -1.5 points [−3.7, −0.68]). However, walks in both locations yielded improvements in contrast to ADLs for which state anxiety increased over the course of the day (ADL-R: 1.9 points; [−0.69, 4.52]. ADL-F: 1.4 points; [−0.9, 3.6]). </p>
                <p>As with the other measures, perceived stress was reduced following forest walks as shown by a decrease in score from pre- to post-walk (−1.4 points; [−2.6, −0.2]). There was a slight increase in perceived stress following walks along the road (0.4 points; [−0.6, 1.3]). Perceived stress showed an increase following ADL-R (0.8 points, −0.2, 1.9), but a decrease under ADL-F (−0.4 points; [−1.2, 0.4]); when combined ADL conditions reflected an increase in perceived stress (0.21 point; [−0.45, 0.87]).</p>
                <p>Working memory, as assessed by the vBDS test, was the only measure for which linear regression did not indicate a relationship between intervention type and change in score (<italic>p</italic> = 0.57, <xref rid="ijerph-16-04338-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). This is reflected in the similarity of the average values and the fact that the confidence intervals of the data from the four interventions all show considerable overlap with zero and with each other (Forest: 0.7 points; [−0.3, 1.6]. Roadside −0.2 points; [−0.2, 1.2]. ADL-R: −0.0 points; [−0.6, 0.6]. ADL-F: 0.3 points; [−0.5, 1.1]). </p>

                <title>3.2. Recruitment and Retention: </title>
                <p>Eighty people responded to the recruitment materials and took the health screening survey. Only one person was ineligible to participate based on the screening survey. Detailed information about the study protocol, time commitment, and scheduling information was sent to the 79 people who were deemed eligible for the study. After receiving this additional information, 41 (52%) of those eligible enrolled in the study. Of the first 20 people to enroll in the study 14 (70 %) were women. To increase the participation of men, new recruitment materials that specifically referred to men were prepared. Also, due to the receipt of additional funding, it was possible to increase the compensation from $U.S. 6.00/hour to $U.S. 9.00/hour. Recruitment continued until 41 participants enrolled, with enrollment of male participants prioritized during the second half of recruitment in order to obtain a final cohort with approximately equal numbers of males and females. The majority of the participants enrolled completed the entire study (N = 38, 93%). Reasons given for dropping out were unrelated to the study (one person became ill and two others developed scheduling conflicts).</p>

              <p>Our observations demonstrated that moderate-intensity walking in a forested environment had a positive impact on psychological health. These findings support the long-known effects of moderate-intensity physical activity on mental health and suggest that completing physical activity in greenspaces amplifies beneficial acute psychological responses. Indeed, these results echo a rich literature extolling the mental and physical health benefits of physical activity, which consistently finds that, whenever and wherever possible, 30–50 min of light exercise can buffer against the wear-and-tear of daily life [<xref rid="B42-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="B83-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. The results also support the growing literature that activity in greenspace yields greater improvements in mental health than does activity completed indoors or in a built urban environment [<xref rid="B43-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="B44-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="B52-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. </p>
              <p>Data collected during ADL sessions was crucial for interpreting the results. Specifically, by measuring acute changes to psychological and working memory outcomes after a roadside walk, and a forest walk, and after their respective ADL sessions, we were able to parse out how moderate-intensity exercise and especially green exercise each make a positive contribution to mental health. Results from the ADL-F and ADL-R sessions showed that participants’ psychological state declined over the course of the day, possibly reflecting fatigue and stress experienced in daily life (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-04338-f003">Figure 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijerph-16-04338">Supplemental Material Tables S2–S5</xref>). When compared to ADL sessions, a walk on the forest path led to improved scores on all measures of psychological health, whereas roadside walks lead only to improvements in negative affect and state anxiety (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-04338-f003">Figure 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijerph-16-04338">Supplemental Material Tables S2–S5</xref>).</p>
              <p>Our observation that women tended to volunteer at a higher rate than men is consistent with other studies [<xref rid="B84-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>,<xref rid="B85-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>,<xref rid="B86-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>,<xref rid="B87-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>,<xref rid="B88-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>,<xref rid="B89-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. We found that increasing compensation to an amount similar to the local minimum wage ($U.S. 9.00) at the time of the study and modifying recruitment materials to say that men were sought for the study increased the participation of men. However, which of these factors was responsible for the increased participation of men could not be determined. </p>
              <p>The protocol for Walking Green imposes a significant participant burden as compared to prior studies in three ways [<xref rid="B46-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="B47-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="B48-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. First multiple psychological and physiological outcomes were assessed before and after each walk. Second, the entire study lasted 29 days and required nine visits to the laboratory. Finally, participants spent as much as 3.5 hours per day engaged in the study. The fact that only 52% of those interested in the study continued to enroll after being informed of its full scope and schedule attests that these three requirements imposed a significant burden on participants.</p>
              <p>Despite the participant burden, it is striking that the results of the current study are consistent with those reported by Berman et al. [<xref rid="B46-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] in showing an improvement in mood following walks in the forest. We expand on the results of the previous study by documenting a decrease in negative affect in addition to an increase in positive affect [<xref rid="B46-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. We also expand on those findings by showing that forest walks also led to reduced state-anxiety and perceived stress, which is consistent with other studies [<xref rid="B59-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,<xref rid="B90-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>,<xref rid="B91-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. </p>
              <p>However, our observations differ somewhat from those of Berman et al. [<xref rid="B46-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] in that we did not see a significant improvement in working memory capacity as a result of walking location, nor did we see an improvement in working memory following walking in either location as compared to ADL. Other studies have also failed to see improvements in working memory in response to green exercise [<xref rid="B59-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,<xref rid="B92-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>,<xref rid="B93-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>,<xref rid="B94-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. Three differences in the protocols may account for this difference in results between the current study and that to Berman et al. [<xref rid="B46-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. First, participants in the previous study were given a directed forgetting task to mentally fatigue them before walking, which may have magnified the difference in BDS scores before and after the walks [<xref rid="B46-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. In addition, the current protocol used the visual BDS test, whereas the previous study used the verbal BDS; the use of different modalities for the test may have led to different results [<xref rid="B67-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>,<xref rid="B68-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>,<xref rid="B69-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>,<xref rid="B95-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. Although several studies have assessed the impact of different modalities for administering the BDS on absolute scores, to our knowledge no study has compared the effect of test modality (visual versus verbal) on differences in scores before and after an intervention [<xref rid="B67-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>,<xref rid="B68-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>,<xref rid="B69-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>,<xref rid="B95-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>].</p>
              <p>The third difference between the two studies is that participants in our study were driven to and from the laboratory and the start site for the walks, which required a minimum of 20 min each way. This constraint on our study protocol was intentional based on two criteria. First, we specifically selected a forested environment that was comparable to the Ann Arbor Arboretum, used in Berman et al. [<xref rid="B46-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], but that location was 10 km away from the laboratory. Second, the drive time is reflective of real-world conditions and thereby makes results more generalizable. Although the driving time introduced an additional exposure between surveys and walking, it was consistent for all participants. In fact, participants who were to walk the forest and roadside routes intentionally were driven to the start site together. Finally, the heavy participant burden may have eliminated any benefit of walking or exposure to greenspace to working memory.</p>
              <p>The fact that both the forest and roadside walks started from the same location, the parking lot of the Forest Preserve, and the fact that the roadside walk took place on a suburban roadside, may also explain why the differences between the psychological outcomes for roadside and forest walk were attenuated as compared to other studies [<xref rid="B46-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="B47-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="B48-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="B59-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Post-hoc calculation of the effect sizes for comparisons between the forest and roadside walks were small (i.e., partial η2 less than 0.03) whereas the effect sizes for comparisons among walks and ADL conditions were of medium size (i.e., partial η2 greater than 0.06) [<xref rid="B73-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>,<xref rid="B96-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. The studies of Berman et al., [<xref rid="B46-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] Bratman et al., [<xref rid="B47-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] and Park et al. [<xref rid="B48-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] compared forested to urban areas with limited or no exposure to greenspace, which may have provided a greater contrast of environments than our locations. In the present study, participants experienced the trees and other greenspace associated with the Forest Preserve when arriving from and departing for the laboratory, regardless of which route they were scheduled to walk each day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-04338-f003">Figure 3</xref>A). Second, although the Roadside route exposed participants to a heavily trafficked four lane suburban street as well as a national interstate highway, the route also contained trees and green lawns associated with business office parks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-04338-f003">Figure 3</xref>B–D). Thus, when comparing locations with less contrasting conditions—that is, forested versus suburban rather than forested versus urban—larger sample sizes may be required.</p>
              <p>It should be remembered that the goal is for this pilot study to be a proof of concept and refine the protocols for the Walking Green Protocol, as we initiate longitudinal studies of the health outcomes of physical activity in forested as compared to urban environments. Future studies with a larger sample size and longer term (e.g., weeks to month) longitudinal interventions will allow for more definitive conclusions about the optimal dose of nature needed to improve psychological health and cognitive functions [<xref rid="B19-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B57-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="B58-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. A longer randomized longitudinal study could also determine the effects of nature on more chronic psychological indicators such depression or trait anxiety.</p>
              <p>One final limitation that should be noted is that the wording for one of the response scale for the STAI was inadvertently changed from “Almost Never, Sometimes, Often, and Almost Always” to “Not at all, Somewhat, Moderately So, and Frequently So” [<xref rid="B59-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,<xref rid="B63-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,<xref rid="B64-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. This change in wording was not intentional and was not discovered until the study had been completed. Importantly, our participants’ baseline scores on this scale (<xref rid="ijerph-16-04338-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) do not differ from normative data; thus, we have included these data in this report as indicative of the intended measure.</p>

              <title>5. Conclusions</title>
              <p>Three conclusions arise from our results: (1) a 50 min walk makes a positive impact on acute measures of mental health; (2) a 50 min walk in a forest amplifies the acute mental health benefits conferred via walking, even when participants experience a 20 min drive to and from the walk location, and (3) participant burden and gender bias in volunteerism need to be taken into account when designing recruitment strategies for longitudinal studies. Based on these results and the existing literature, we organized policy implications for each of these findings accordingly: <list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Efforts to design communities to encourage walking and active living should be supported [<xref rid="B9-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B97-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>].</p></list-item><list-item><p>Plans to provide access to greenspace should include public transportation to enable access to greenspace [<xref rid="B60-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>].</p></list-item><list-item><p>Healthcare professionals should counsel patients to be active, and prioritize activity in greenspaces through the use of Nature Rx [<xref rid="B9-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B12-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B90-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>].</p></list-item></list></p>
              <p>Considerable research has focused on the questions of how distance and access to greenspace influence the health outcomes of urban residents, often emphasizing the importance of living near greenspace [<xref rid="B2-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B11-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B98-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>,<xref rid="B99-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>,<xref rid="B100-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. Based on this emerging literature, more parks, gardens, and natural areas should be included in city planning efforts. However, when it is not possible to place such amenities near people, our results suggest that providing opportunities for people to travel short distances to greenspace on a regular basis can be beneficial.</p>
              <p>Walking or spending time in greenspace can be cost effective way to improve mental wellness, thus in addition to reducing stress, anxiety, and improving mood for those experiencing the wear and tear of everyday life, physical activity in greenspace may also provide an important adjunct therapy to clinical therapies [<xref rid="B12-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B101-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>,<xref rid="B102-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>,<xref rid="B103-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>,<xref rid="B104-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>,<xref rid="B105-ijerph-16-04338" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>].
