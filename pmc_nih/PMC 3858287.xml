                <p>The presence of abnormal hematologic findings such as lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and pancytopenia were diagnosed in severe cases of avian influenza A H5N1. Whether direct viral dissemination to bone marrow (BM) cells causes this phenomenon remains elusive. We explore the susceptibility of the two stem cell types; hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) isolated from human BM cells or cord blood, to infection with avian H5N1 viruses. For the first time, we demonstrated that the H5N1 virus could productively infect and induce cell death in both human stem cell types. In contrast, these activities were not observed upon human influenza virus infection. We also determined whether infection affects the immunomodulatory function of MSCs. We noted a consequent dysregulation of MSC-mediated immune modulation as observed by high cytokine and chemokine production in H5N1 infected MSCs and monocytes cocultures. These findings provide a better understanding of H5N1 pathogenesis in terms of broad tissue tropism and systemic spread.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>The highly pathogenic avian influenza A virus of the H5N1 subtype was originally endemic to poultry, but crossed the avian-human species barrier. It has emerged as a highly fatal infectious disease in the human population with a 60% mortality observed in more than ten countries, as reported to the World Health Organization since 2003 <xref rid="pone.0081805-Beigel1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0081805-WHO1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. The pathologic process of H5N1 patients is initial presentation with fever and respiratory symptoms including cough and shortness of breath <xref rid="pone.0081805-Tran1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. In addition, severe cases are characterized by fulminant viral pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, multi-organ failure and death <xref rid="pone.0081805-Korteweg1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Upon infection, the virus can spread from the lungs to other organs <xref rid="pone.0081805-Gu1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> and can also pass to the fetus <xref rid="pone.0081805-Korteweg1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0081805-Gu1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, causing systemic disease which leads to an unusually high mortality rate. The fatal outcome of H5N1 viral infection has been linked to the presence of high viral load, hypercytokinemia and the associated reactive hemophagocytosis syndrome <xref rid="pone.0081805-Korteweg1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Hematologic abnormalities were commonly observed in severe cases, including lymphoid depletion, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia and pancytopenia, which are likely related to bone marrow (BM) suppression, and/or virus-associated hemophagocytosis. Despite the known systemic spread of the virus, there have been no reports of viral isolation from BM itself, even when the viral antigen was detected in other samples from the same autopsy subject <xref rid="pone.0081805-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. If the virus-mediated BM suppression is a possible factor contributing to the observed substantial cell loss, hematologic abnormalities, and hyperinflammatory cytokine production, it is thus intriguing to determine whether the observed suppression is a result of direct invasion of virus.</p>
              <p>Bone marrow (BM) is an important source from which progenitor cells are generated. It contains two types of progenitor cells; hematopoietic stem cells and non-hematopoietic stem cells which can differentiate into blood cells and cells of mesenchymal lineages (osteoblasts, chondrocytes, adepocytes, etc.), respectively <xref rid="pone.0081805-Gurkan1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) have renewal and differentiation abilities <xref rid="pone.0081805-Watt1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. HSCs are able to migrate out of the bone marrow into the blood circulation system <xref rid="pone.0081805-Magnon1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. CD34<sup>+</sup> cell is a population that includes hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), myeloid, erythroid and lymphoid progenitors <xref rid="pone.0081805-Manchester1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Recently, umbilical cord and placenta were recognized as rich sources of HSCs for isolation <xref rid="pone.0081805-Musina1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> which share similar characteristics as HSCs of BM <xref rid="pone.0081805-NIH1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. MSCs have many of the key biological characteristics that make up the defining criteria for accepted stem cells as reviewed above. In BM, MSCs act as supporting cells that regulate the normal hematopoiesis process including growth, maturation, differentiation and survival of HSCs <xref rid="pone.0081805-Uccelli1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Due to its ability to differentiate, MSCs can regenerate damaged tissues by differentiating into the particular phenotype of the damaged cells <xref rid="pone.0081805-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. MSCs also exert immunomodulatory activities by suppressing NK, T, B and monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MoDCs) proliferation and function <xref rid="pone.0081805-Aggarwal1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0081805-Spaggiari1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. These properties appear to be more important for therapeutics designed to regulate the immune response under conditions such as tissue injury, transplantation, and autoimmunity <xref rid="pone.0081805-Singer1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p>
              <p>The fact that BM is a rich source of progenitor cells <xref rid="pone.0081805-Chamberlain1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> and a possible target of H5N1-induced hematologic abnormalities <xref rid="pone.0081805-Chotpitayasunondh1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, led us to investigate the direct infection of H5N1 virus in BM. In this study, we demonstrated that highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus could productively infect and replicate in CD34<sup>+</sup> HSCs and MSCs. Sialic acid (SA) receptors on the target cells surface were believed to be the major receptor mediating virus binding and entry. H5N1 viral infection induced cell death in both CD34<sup>+</sup> HSCs and MSCs. We also observed that pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were enhanced in cocultures of MSCs and primary monocytes indicating that H5N1 infection altered the immunomodulative effect of MSCs.</p>

                <p>Mononuclear Cells (MCs) were isolated from both CB (CBMCs) and BM (BMMCs) using IsoPrep (Robbins Scientific, Canada) density centrifugation. CD34<sup>+</sup> HSCs were isolated from both CBMCs and BMMCs using CD34 MACS Microbeads (Miltenyi, Gladbach, Germany) following the manufacturer's instructions. The efficiency of CD34<sup>+</sup> HSCs purification was determined by staining of isolated cell surface markers with phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated anti-CD34 monoclonal antibody (Miltenyi, Gladbach, Germany) for 30 min at 4Â°C. Cells were washed in PBS and analyzed by Flow Cytometry (Becton-Dickinson Pharmingen, Heidelberg, Germany) on an instrument equipped with an argon laser tuned at 488 nm. The percentage of obtained CD34<sup>+</sup> HSCs ranged from 98% to 99% in all of the purified CB and BM samples. Cells expressing &gt;98% CD34 antigen were cultured in Stemline II media (Sigma, USA) supplemented with specific hematopoietic growth factor cocktail that included 50 ng/ml stem cell factor, 50 ng/L rh-IL-6 and 50 ng/L rh-IL-3 (R&amp;D Systems). CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes used in the cocultures study were isolated as previously described <xref rid="pone.0081805-Thitithanyanont1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Briefly, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained by centrifugation using IsoPrep, and CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes were isolated by using CD14 MACs Microbeads. Monocytes were cultured in RPMI 1640 media (Gibco, Life Technology, Rockville, Md., USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM L-glutamine and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Pen/Strep).</p>

                <p>BMMCs were separated by density gradient centrifugation with IsoPrep. Briefly, 10 ml of heparinized bone marrow samples were mixed in with an equal volume of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) (Gibco, Life Technology, Rockville, Md., USA) and centrifiuged at 1000 g for 30 min at room temperature. The interface mononuclear cells were collected and washed twice with DMEM. Total cell count and viablility were evaluated by 0.2% Trypan blue. A total of 2Ã10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml of BMMCs were cultured in DMEM complete medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% Pen/Strep at 37Â°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. After 72 hours of cultivation, non-adherent cells were discarded and this process was repeated every four days. Upon reaching 90% confluency, MSCs were trypsinized by 0.05% trypsin-EDTA and passaged for the next expansion.</p>

                <p>Considering MSCs are non-immune cells that possess an immunomodulative activity, further exploring the role of MSCs in H5N1 pathogenesis is crucial. Previous reports demonstrated that MSCs are capable of suppressing the differentiation of monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MoDCs) <xref rid="pone.0081805-Aggarwal1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0081805-Spaggiari1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. It is interesting to investigate the immune dysregulation following H5N1 infection. Therefore, we hypothesized that H5N1 infection could alter MSCs-mediated immune modulation. Monocytes/macrophages secreted mainly inflammatory mediators including IL-1Î², IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, MIP-1Î² and GM-CSF which are known to be key players in the H5N1-mediated immunopathogenesis <xref rid="pone.0081805-Hui1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0081805-Cheung1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Here, we designed an experiment in which MSCs/monocyte cocultures was infected with H5N1 virus at an MOI of 0.04, and alterations in the cytokine profiles of infected cocultures were compared to those of mock, MSCs monoculture, and monocyte monoculture. At 24 hours post-infection, culture supernatants were collected to determine cytokine production. Cytokines and chemokines were measured by using a Bio-plex Pro Human Cytokine Assay. We found that IL-6 level of H5N1-infected MSCs was comparable with mock, whereas it was barely detectable in infected CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0081805-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). The chemokines; MCP-1 and MIP-1Î² were not up-regulated in H5N1-infected MSCs monoculture, but slightly increased in infected CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0081805-g005">Figure 5B and 5C</xref>). IL-6, MCP-1 and MIP-1Î² were significantly up-regulated in the H5N1-infected MSCs/Monocytes cocultures compared with mock, and both monocultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0081805-g005">Figure 5Aâ5C</xref>). In contrast, some cytokine and chemokines such as IL-1Î², IL-8, and GM-CSF from H5N1-infected cocultures were not significantly different from their respective controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0081805.s005">Figure S5</xref>). These findings demonstrated that H5N1-infected MSCs/Monocytes cocultures could produce high level of IL-6, MCP-1 and MIP-1Î² indicating that H5N1 infection has a potential to induce immune dysregulation of MSCs when they were cocultured with monocytes.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Details regarding the pathogenesis of H5N1 are limited. H5N1 infection is not restricted to respiratory organs, and this systemic spread of the virus makes H5N1 unique from other human influenza viruses. Detection of viral RNA in BM upon autopsy and the presence of hematologic abnormalities in severe H5N1 cases increased our interests in H5N1-mediated BM suppression. It is therefore important to investigate viral tropism in BM cells. Previous studies of direct infection of CD34<sup>+</sup> HSCs and MSCs by other persistent viruses, such as Measles virus (MV) <xref rid="pone.0081805-Manchester1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> and Cytomegalovirus (CMV) <xref rid="pone.0081805-Smirnov1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0081805-Bego1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> have demonstrated virus-mediated immunosuppression. However, acute viral infection of BM cells remains unclear.</p>
              <p>In the present study, we first demonstrated that H5N1 virus could directly infect primary human BM progenitor cells: HSCs and MSCs. Viral infection induced cell death and affected the immune modulation activity of MSCs. Our obtained data could better explain viral pathogenesis in extra-pulmonary organs. We started with isolation of CD34<sup>+</sup> HSCs and MSCs from the BM and CB of healthy donors. Using different techniques including flow cytometry, quantitative RT-PCR, plaque assay, immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy, we demonstrated that CD34<sup>+</sup> HSCs and MSCs supported a productive infection of H5N1 virus, although to a lesser degree in CD34<sup>+</sup> HSCs. Both stem cells were resistant to human influenza virus (H1N1 and H3N2) infection, even though these two cells expressed both Î±-2,3 SA and Î±-2,6 SA, receptors for avian and human influenza viruses, respectively. Our findings suggested that H5N1 virus had BM tropism and CD34<sup>+</sup> HSCs and MSCs could serve as key amplifiers of virus within the BM compartment. The mobilizing property of these two cells could support a spread of virus throughout the body <xref rid="pone.0081805-Magnon1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0081805-Sinclair1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Our findings are consistent with Gu J., <italic>et al</italic>. <xref rid="pone.0081805-Gu2" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> and Uiprasertkul M., <italic>et al</italic>. <xref rid="pone.0081805-Uiprasertkul1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> studies that demonstrated H5N1 was able to disseminate and infect extra-pulmonary organs showing a broad tissue tropism of virus. However, there is a limited autopsy data to prove a dissemination of virus in systemic organs.</p>
              <p>The susceptibility of each cell type to H5N1 infection is partly dependent on SA receptors since some Î±-2,3 SA and 2,6-SA expressing cells are unable to support efficient infection and replication of virus <xref rid="pone.0081805-Yao1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. In addition, there might be some unknown intracellular factors or mechanisms that involved with permissibility of CD34<sup>+</sup> HSCs to H5N1 virus. Previous studies have demonstrated that H5N1 could infect various targets in particular cells of the immune system <xref rid="pone.0081805-Thitithanyanont1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0081805-Friesenhagen1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0081805-Tumpey1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, it is possible that H5N1 is able to evade the host innate immune response with multiple mechanisms such as NS1-mediated IFN inhibition, the proapoptotic function of PB1-F2 in limiting efficient immune cell-mediated virus clearance <italic>in vivo</italic>, and the receptor switching of avian to human receptors enabling H5N1 to evade the virus-neutralizing effects of mucins containing Î±-2,3 SA <xref rid="pone.0081805-Korteweg1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0081805-Hale1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Further investigations should be performed to understand the mechanism underlying high susceptibility of progenitor cells to H5N1 over H1N1 and H3N2 viruses, although these two viruses are more likely to be laboratory strains than human influenza strains.</p>
              <p>Studies have shown that apoptosis plays a major role in H5N1 pathogenesis. Apoptosis was induced upon infection of epithelial cells and lymphocytes <italic>in vitro</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0081805-Daidoji1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0081805-Nichols1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Increased apoptosis in human lymphocytes leading to severe lymphopenia which was caused by either direct infection or over-activation of the cytokine response <xref rid="pone.0081805-Nichols1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. In this study, H5N1 virus induced high rates of apoptosis in both MSCs and CD34<sup>+</sup> HSCs. Apoptosis observed in a majority of infected MSCs was likely due to direct infection, whereas, apoptosis in CD34<sup>+</sup> HSCs might be induced by paracrine factors as apoptotic signals were observed in uninfected CD34<sup>+</sup> HSCs population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0081805-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Additional experiments to confirm unusual apoptosis in CD34<sup>+</sup> HSCs will be further investigated. Since CD34<sup>+</sup> HSCs and MSCs are primitive progenitor cells that contain self-renewal ability and generate descendant cells during hematopoiesis and mesengenic processes, the reduction of precursor cells may affect these two processes which eventually decrease the number of differentiated cells in all lineages. The disruption of hematopoiesis was observed in depleted stromal and CD34<sup>+</sup> populations by MV infection, which significantly impaired repopulation of lymphoid precursors following MV-induced lymphopenia <xref rid="pone.0081805-Manchester1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Our findings supported abnormal hematologic findings including low peripheral blood counts and cytopenia which are prominent clinical features in patients with severe H5N1 infection. In addition, substantial loss of MSCs would affect the immunosuppressive activity, leading to hyperactivation of the immune response.</p>
              <p>The pathogenesis of the H5N1 virus was characterized by broad tissue tropism, systemic replication and hypercytokinemia <xref rid="pone.0081805-Cinatl1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0081805-deJong1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. H5N1-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines were generated by various immune cells as they coordinate an attack on invading pathogens. Under normal conditions, anti-inflammatory cytokines are immunoregulatory molecules that regulate pro-inflammatory responses. On the other hand, under pathological conditions, disruption of the balance of the anti-inflammatory response to the pro-inflammatory response may occur <xref rid="pone.0081805-Darwish1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. MSCs have potent immunoregulatory actions that make them attractive targets for reducing the inflammation and injury <xref rid="pone.0081805-Singer1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0081805-Cardenes1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. MSCs have been shown to interact with CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes and block monocytes differentiation to dendritic cells (DCs) which IL-6 is partially involved in this action <xref rid="pone.0081805-Aggarwal1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0081805-Spaggiari1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0081805-Nauta1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0081805-Nemeth1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. In addition, MSCs can modulate cytokine production by dendritic and T cell subsets <xref rid="pone.0081805-Aggarwal1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. The fact that interaction of MSCs and monocytes leads to immunopathology and dysregulated MSCs-mediated immunomodulation during infection is controversial. Interestingly, our result demonstrated that IL-6, MCP-1, and MIP-1Î² from MSCs/CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes cocultures were up-regulated, whereas this effect was not seen in MSCs or monocytes monoculture. Elevated IL-6 may enhance inflammation as shown in previous studies <xref rid="pone.0081805-deJong1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0081805-Chan1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0081805-Cheung2" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. It is possible that H5N1 may subvert MSCs-mediated immune modulation by skewing immune modulator towards enhancer as evidenced by the significantly increased levels of IL-6 in infected cocultures. Higher levels of IL-6 are likely to promote inhibition of DC maturation contributing to a reduction in the number of antigen presenting cells which thus leads to slow virus clearance. Previously published data reported that H5N1 was a potent inducer of MCP-1 and MIP-1Î² which were responsible for the recruitment of immune cells into the infected site <xref rid="pone.0081805-Cheung2" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0081805-Yu1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. Therefore, high levels of MCP-1 and MIP-1Î² secreted by infected cocultures may amplify the inflammatory response by attracting many of immune cells into the BM milieu <xref rid="pone.0081805-Brandau1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref> indicating that MSCs might involve indirectly with H5N1-induced inflammation since they are more active responding to H5N1 infection when they are cocultured with monocytes.</p>
              <p>Hyperactivation of cytokines, including TNF-Î±, soluble IL-2 receptor, IL-1 and IL-6 may play a role in the pathogenesis of reactive hemophagocytosis syndrome (RHS) <xref rid="pone.0081805-Fisman1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. High levels of IL-6, MCP-1, and MIP-1Î² production in H5N1-infected cocultures are likely to induce RHS in BM. RHS is characterized by activated macrophages which consequently engulf neighboring cells including hematopoietic cells <xref rid="pone.0081805-Rajam1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. This can contribute to markedly hypocellular BM. To <italic>et al</italic>., previously documented that both hypocellular conditions and RHS in BM were the most prominent pathologic features observed in fatal H5N1 cases <xref rid="pone.0081805-To1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>.</p>
              <p>Besides BM tissue, MSCs have been identified in many other organs with similar functions including the lung <xref rid="pone.0081805-Sinclair1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0081805-Sabatini1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. They are important for the maintenance of lung homeostasis and repair following lung injury <xref rid="pone.0081805-Sinclair1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. As lung is the primary site of influenza infection, it is possible that lung-resident MSCs may get infected by H5N1 virus resulting in disruption of renewal and differentiation processes. Also, MSCs-mediated immunomodulatory function may be dysregulated as hypothesized contributing to severe injury in the lung. Although there has been no data in humans, influenza virus-infected lung MSCs were investigated in the lungs of both chicken and swine <xref rid="pone.0081805-Khatri1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0081805-Khatri2" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>.</p>
              <p>In summary, we demonstrated that H5N1 virus more efficiently infected and replicated in CD34<sup>+</sup> HSCs and MSCs compared to human influenza viruses <italic>in vitro</italic>. Apoptosis was a direct result of infection in MSCs, whereas, it might be induced by paracrine factors in CD34<sup>+</sup> HSCs. In addition, H5N1 infection could interfere with MSC-mediated immune modulation by shifting immune modulator production towards enhancers, which, in turn, amplifies the cytokine response by the influx of circulating monocytes and macrophages. Our explorations provide an insight into H5N1 pathogenesis in terms of aggressive systemic infection and hematologic abnormalities in patients with severe H5N1 infection.</p>
