                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>This randomised, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase 1/2a study (TRAVERSE) was done at 11 centres in the USA and one centre in Rwanda. Eligible participants were adults aged 18 to 50 years, who were HIV-uninfected, healthy at screening based on their medical history and a physical examination including laboratory assessment and vital sign measurements, and at low risk of HIV infection in the opinion of study staff, who applied a uniform definition of low-risk guidelines that was aligned across sites. Enrolled participants were randomly assigned at a 2:1 ratio to tetravalent and trivalent groups. Participants in tetravalent and trivalent groups were then further randomly assigned at a 5:1 ratio to adenovirus 26 (Ad26)-vectored vaccine and placebo subgroups. Randomisation was stratified by region (USA and Rwanda) and based on a computer-generated schedule using randomly permuted blocks prepared under the sponsor's supervision. We masked participants and investigators to treatment allocation throughout the study. On day 0, participants received a first injection of tetravalent vaccine (Ad26.Mos4.HIV or placebo) or trivalent vaccine (Ad26.Mos.HIV or placebo), and those injections were repeated 12 weeks later. At week 24, vaccine groups received a third dose of tetravalent or trivalent together with clade C gp140, and this was repeated at week 48, with placebos again administered to the placebo group. All study vaccines and placebo were administered by intramuscular injection in the deltoid muscle. We assessed adverse events in all participants who received at least one study injection (full analysis set) and Env-specific binding antibodies in all participants who received at least the first three vaccinations according to the protocol-specified vaccination schedule, had at least one measured post-dose blood sample collected, and were not diagnosed with HIV during the study (per-protocol set).

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>Of 201 participants who were enrolled and randomly assigned, 198 received the first vaccination: 110 were in the tetravalent group, 55 in the trivalent group, and 33 in the placebo group. Overall, 185 (93%) completed two scheduled vaccinations per protocol, 180 (91%) completed three, and 164 (83%) completed four. Solicited, self-limiting local, systemic reactogenicity and unsolicited adverse events were similar in vaccine groups and higher than in placebo groups. All participants in the per-protocol set developed clade C Env binding antibodies after the second vaccination, with higher total IgG titres after the tetravalent vaccine than after the trivalent vaccine (10 413 EU/mL, 95% CI 7284–14 886 in the tetravalent group compared with 5494 EU/mL, 3759–8029 in the trivalent group). Titres further increased after the third and fourth vaccinations, persisting at least through week 72. Other immune responses were also higher with the tetravalent vaccine, including the magnitude and breadth of binding antibodies against a cross-clade panel of Env antigens, and the magnitude of IFNγ ELISPOT responses (median 521 SFU/10<sup>6</sup> peripheral blood mononuclear cells [PBMCs] in the tetravalent group and median 282 SFU/10<sup>6</sup> PBMCs in the trivalent group after the fourth vaccination) and Env-specific CD4+ T-cell response rates after the third and fourth vaccinations. No interference by pre-existing Ad26 immunity was identified.</p>

                  <title>Interpretation</title>
                  <p>The tetravalent vaccine regimen was generally safe, well-tolerated, and found to elicit higher immune responses than the trivalent regimen. Regimens that use this tetravalent vaccine component are being advanced into field trials to assess efficacy against HIV-1 infection.</p>

              <p id="para20">One strategy to potentially overcome this limited immune coverage is the mosaic HIV-1 vaccine concept,<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> which uses in-silico design of complementary <italic>env, gag</italic>, and <italic>pol</italic> sequences that are computationally predicted to broaden the immune response and thereby increase the immune coverage against globally circulating HIV-1 strains. Bivalent and trivalent sets of mosaic inserts have been shown to broaden the immune response in non-human primate models.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> We applied this mosaic concept to develop a vaccine to achieve more optimal coverage of circulating HIV-1 strains.

              <p id="para30">In humans, bivalent mosaic inserts have elicited cross-clade immune responses.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> Previous clinical studies have shown that the adenovirus serotype 26 (Ad26) vector is well tolerated and elicits humoral and cellular immune responses,<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> mucosal responses,<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> and immune responses that are augmented by sequential vaccinations including Env proteins.<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Mosaic 2 Env has highest coverage of clade C strains of HIV-1, and is designed to complement the coverage of Mosaic 1 Env, which has highest coverage of clade B and CRF01_AE strains. The original Mosaic 2 Env construct showed non-optimal cell surface expression and immune response in preclinical models. Along with some manufacturing challenges, this led to APPROACH,<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> an initial phase 1/2a study of this Ad26 mosaic gp140 regimen with a trivalent vector combination (Ad26.Mos.HIV) encoding a single Mosaic Env antigen and two Mosaic Gag-Pol antigens (2:1:1 virus particle ratio), rather than a tetravalent vector combination encoding two complementary mosaic sequences per antigen (two Mosaic Env antigens and two Mosaic Gag-Pol antigens; 1:1:1:1 virus particle ratio).</p>

                    <bold>Evidence before this study</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para70">There is a need for an effective prophylactic vaccine against HIV-1 infection. A major hurdle in HIV-1 vaccine development is the global diversity of the virus. One strategy to overcome this diversity is the so-called mosaic concept: the use of bioinformatics to design molecular inserts for different target antigens, to broaden the immune response and improve coverage against multiple strains of HIV-1. We used the terms “HIV-1”, “vaccine”, and “mosaic” to do an unrestricted PubMed search on March 31, 2020, which revealed several preclinical and phase 1 clinical studies of vaccination regimens using different viral vectors, including modified vaccinia Ankara and recombinant adenovirus serotype 26 (Ad26). The trivalent Ad26 mosaic vaccine candidate has been shown to be effective in raising immune responses against antigen components in preclinical studies and phase 1/2a clinical studies in human participants. Further work to enhance the breadth of the response has led to a tetravalent vaccine candidate, and to our knowledge our study is the first to assess that candidate in humans.</p>
                  <p id="para80">
                    <bold>Added value of this study</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para90">This is the first-in-human comparison of the trivalent and tetravalent mosaic vaccine candidates that shows that the tetravalent formulation enhances both the magnitude and breadth of humoral and cellular immune responses compared with the trivalent vaccine. These immune responses persisted until the end of follow-up at 72 weeks. Both regimens were generally well tolerated with predominantly mild to moderate, transient reactogenicity and did not raise any safety concerns.</p>

                    <bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para110">In preclinical studies in non-human primates, the mosaic vaccine concept has been shown to be protective against heterologous simian HIV challenge. In those models the vaccine induced immune responses that resemble those observed in humans in clinical testing. Although no direct correlation has been shown between such protection and any specific component of the induced immune response, the enhancement of all aspects of those responses in humans by the tetravalent formulation is sufficient justification to take this regimen into further clinical testing in targeted populations. Such studies are now ongoing in young women in South Africa, and in men who have sex with men and transgender individuals in the Americas and Europe.</p>

The protocol was approved by the institutional review boards of each study centre. The study adhered to current Declaration of Helsinki and ICH Good Clinical Practice guidelines. The objective was to compare the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of two vaccination regimens consisting of two immunisations with Ad26.Mos.HIV or Ad26.Mos4.HIV at day 0 and week 12, followed by two concomitant immunisations of clade C gp140 and Ad26.Mos.HIV or Ad26.Mos4.HIV at weeks 24 and 48, respectively.</p>

                <p id="para150">On day 0, participants received a first injection of tetravalent vaccine (Ad26.Mos4.HIV), trivalent vaccine (Ad26.Mos.HIV), or placebo, and those injections were repeated 12 weeks later. At week 24, vaccine groups received a third dose of tetravalent or trivalent together with clade C gp140, and this was repeated at week 48, with placebos again administered to the placebo group.

                <p id="para160">Soluble HIV envelope antigen based on Mosaic 2 Env has been described previously,<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> but showed non-optimal cell surface expression and immune response. The Mosaic 2 Env sequence was optimised to have higher expression of correctly folded native-like Env. The modification remained as close as possible to the optimal clade C sequence coverage and, when paired with Mosaic 1 Env (which has highest coverage of clade B and CRF01_AE), conferred optimal global HIV-1 sequence coverage. An optimised soluble Mosaic 2S Env was based on the gp140 ectodomain with or without a fusion with a C-terminal GCN4 trimerisation domain. Similar membrane-anchored versions of the designs were made in which the ectodomains were cleavable by furin, the C-termini were extended with the transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic region truncated after residue 712. Expression of the Mosaic 2S Envs variant was much higher than the Mosaic 2 Env (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix pp 13–14</xref>).</p>

Participants then used diary cards to record solicited local (pain or tenderness, erythema, and swelling or induration) and systemic (pyrexia or fever, fatigue, headache, nausea, myalgia, and chills) adverse events on the day of injection and for the subsequent 7 days. Further safety assessments included clinical laboratory tests (haematology, chemistry, urinalysis), vital sign measurements, and physical examinations. Unsolicited adverse events were recorded until 28 days after each study injection. Serious adverse events, adverse events leading to discontinuation from the study, and adverse events of special interest such as confirmed HIV infection, were recorded through week 72.

                <p id="para210">No prespecified statistical hypothesis was tested. The sample size was deemed appropriate to assess the safety and tolerability of the different vaccine regimens and to collect sufficient data on immunogenicity. Participants receiving placebo were included for safety evaluations and to provide control specimens for immunogenicity assays. Although mild-to-moderate vaccine reactions (local site and systemic responses) were expected, adverse events that would preclude further vaccine administration or more serious ones that would limit product development were not anticipated. Participant numbers were presecified. With 110 individuals in the tetravalent Ad26.Mos4.HIV vaccine regimen, we calculated that observing 0 such reactions would provide 95% confidence that the true rate was below 2·7%. With 165 individuals in the combined vaccine groups, we calculated that 0 reactions would provide 95% confidence that the true rate was below 1·8%. Safety analyses were done on all participants who received at least one study injection (full analysis set). Immunogenicity analyses were done on all participants who received at least the first three vaccinations according to the protocol-specified vaccination schedule (± 2 weeks), had at least one measured post-dose blood sample collected, and were not diagnosed with HIV during the study (per-protocol set). Samples taken after week 48 from participants in the per-protocol set who did not receive the fourth vaccination in the protocol-specified time window (± 2 weeks) were excluded from the analyses. No comparisons were made based on region because of the relatively small number of Rwandan participants. Analyses were done using SAS (version 9.4). Differences between the tetravalent and trivalent groups after third and fourth vaccinations were explored as geometric mean ratios (including 95% CI) with a two-sample <italic>t</italic> test on log-normally distributed data, or as medians by a Wilcoxon rank sum test. Anticipating a dropout rate of approximately 10%, sample sizes allowed detection of approximately 1·5-fold differences in Env-binding antibody geometric mean concentrations between Ad26.Mos4.HIV (approximately 100 evaluable participants) and Ad26.Mos.HIV (approximately 50 evaluable participants) groups with 80% probability, assuming a one-sided 5% type 1 error and an SD of 0·4 on the log<sub>10</sub> scale.

Two cases of grade 3 pyrexia (≥39·3°C) occurred, one in the tetravalent group after the first vaccination and one in the trivalent group after the second vaccination. Grade 3 solicited systemic adverse events were more frequently reported by participants receiving the tetravalent (23%) and trivalent (24%) vaccines compared with those receiving placebo (3%). There were no grade 4 solicited systemic adverse events.</p>
              <p id="para260">Similar frequencies of unsolicited adverse events occurred over the study duration in each group: 74 (67%) of 110 participants in the tetravalent group, 35 (64%) of 55 participants in the trivalent group, and 23 (70%) of 33 participants in the placebo group. The most frequent unsolicited adverse events were infections: 43 (39%) of 110 participants in the tetravalent group, 22 (40%) of 55 participants in the trivalent group, and 16 (49%) of 33 participants in the placebo group. Reporting rates were similar after each of the four doses. Grade 3 unsolicited adverse events were reported by five (5%) of 110 participants in the tetravalent group and three (6%) of 55 participants in the trivalent group, but in no participants in the placebo group. Six participants in the tetravalent group reported a total of seven serious adverse events: grade 2 rheumatoid arthritis and lymphoedema (occurring in one participant), grade 3 atrial fibrillation, ankle fracture, and syncope (each occurring in one participant), and grade 3 acoustic neuroma on day 93 and grade 3 angina pectoris on day 239 (occurring in one participant). The investigator considered the case of rheumatoid arthritis related to vaccination. This participant had a medical history of eczema, depression, anxiety, and multiple fractures, and developed progressive symptoms of bilateral joint pains and decreased mobility from 32 days after the final dose of tetravalent vaccine. They were diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis about 4 months after symptoms onset. Other serious adverse events were considered unrelated to the study interventions, and no adverse events of special interest (ie, confirmed HIV infection) occurred during the study.</p>

Asymptomatic bradycardia was observed in 15 (14%) of 110 participants in the tetravalent group, nine (16%) of 55 participants in the trivalent group, and seven (21%) of 33 participants in the placebo group. Two cases of asymptomatic bradycardia were grade 3 (one in the tetravalent group and one in the trivalent group), and both participants already had low heart rate values at baseline.

Both trivalent and tetravalent vaccine regimens were generally safe and well tolerated, with acceptable reactogenicity profiles consisting of low rates of attributable severe or serious adverse events for both. These data support advancing the tetravalent vaccine into further clinical development. As previously noted with adenovirus-vectored vaccines, some local and systemic vaccination-associated reactions occur; they are typically mild, last 1 or 2 days, are more notable after the first vaccination, and diminish with subsequent doses. Overall, the safety profile we observed is consistent with previous experience,<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> showing consistency of the vaccine regimen safety profile across studies with largely different sites and investigative teams.</p>

Immune responses to the tetravalent vaccines were higher than the trivalent vaccine, with no evidence of any interference between the mosaic Env constructs or from anti-vector immunity from previous natural exposure. The characterisation of immunogenicity profile in this TRAVERSE study for the trivalent vaccine is consistent with the earlier APPROACH study,<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> both in the frequency and magnitude of binding and functional antibody responses as well as cellular responses.</p>

Increases in both humoral and cellular immune responses seen by replacing half of the Ad26.Mos1.Env dose with Ad26.Mos2S.Env support the decision to select this tetravalent vaccine for further evaluation of its ability to confer protection against HIV-1 acquisition in efficacy studies.</p>

The T-cell response to potential T-cell epitope Env peptide pools increased significantly throughout the study in the tetravalent regimen group, suggesting that this regimen could induce improved immune responses relevant to the globally circulating strains of HIV (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 29</xref>).</p>
              <p id="para390">The tetravalent regimen improves the vaccine concept selected from the APPROACH and NHP studies.<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> The studies showed that this vaccine regimen provided substantial protection against repetitive, heterologous, intrarectal SHIV-SF162P3 challenges. Furthermore, similar levels of immune response associated with protection in rhesus monkeys were also induced in humans, and support advancing this vaccine concept towards clinical efficacy testing. We have now observed that the tetravalent vaccine regimen further exceeds these same immunogenicity criteria and, despite being non-mechanistic these immunological parameters might be markers for actual protective immune responses. The principal limitation of this study is that the relevance of immune markers and vaccine protection in rhesus monkeys to clinical efficacy in humans remains to be shown. Vaccine regimen optimisation based on these markers can guide the selection of the best available candidate vaccines to advance for further testing. Future studies on how these results compare with other HIV vaccines will enable deeper insights into how the vaccine delivery system and schedules affect magnitude and quality of immune response.</p>
              <p id="para400">The absence of neutralising antibody response detected to clinically relevant tier 2 strains, including to the vaccine-autologous strain, is consistent across studies of this vaccine concept including those where protection was achieved in non-human primates.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Instead, the cellular and multifunctional humoral responses are reactive to diverse HIV-1 strains and have the opportunity to act against HIV virus and infected cells at multiple stages of a potential infection. These mechanisms are distinct from the presumed modes of action by which other viral vaccines confer protection. By mediating functions such as phagocytosis or cytotoxicity, the Ad26 mosaic and gp140 vaccines have the potential to be relevant for protection against diverse strains of HIV-1 that exist globally.</p>
              <p id="para410">In conclusion, we have shown that including an additional Ad26-encoded mosaic Env increases humoral and cellular responses. The results of this study do not indicate any difference in safety and tolerability between participants receiving the tetravalent regimen and the trivalent regimen. Based in part on these results, the ongoing Imbokodo study in southern Africa (registered with <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov" id="interrefs50">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="ClinicalTrials.gov" xlink:href="NCT03060629" id="interrefs60">NCT03060629</ext-link>) is measuring the protective efficacy of the tetravalent Ad26.Mos4.HIV and clade C gp140 regimen in young women. A second efficacy study (MOSAICO) for this vaccine concept using the tetravalent Ad26.Mos4.HIV is also ongoing in the Americas and Western Europe (registered with <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov" id="interrefs70">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="ClinicalTrials.gov" xlink:href="NCT03964415" id="interrefs80">NCT03964415</ext-link>) in men who have sex with men and transgender individuals. Through these studies, we will learn how the immunogenicity profiles described here relate to clinical efficacy.</p>
