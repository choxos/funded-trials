                  <title>Objective</title>
                  <p>The mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) has emerged as a therapeutic target for treating insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). We evaluated whether MPC inhibitors (MPCi) might correct impairments in branched chain amino acid (BCAA) catabolism, which are predictive of developing diabetes and NASH.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Circulating BCAA concentrations were measured in people with NASH and type 2 diabetes, who participated in a recent randomized, placebo-controlled Phase IIB clinical trial to test the efficacy and safety of the MPCi MSDC-0602K (EMMINENCE; NCT02784444). In this 52-week trial, patients were randomly assigned to placebo (n = 94) or 250 mg MSDC-0602K (n = 101). Human hepatoma cell lines and mouse primary hepatocytes were used to test the direct effects of various MPCi on BCAA catabolism in vitro. Lastly, we investigated how hepatocyte-specific deletion of MPC2 affects BCAA metabolism in the liver of obese mice and MSDC-0602K treatment of Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>In patients with NASH, MSDC-0602K treatment, which led to marked improvements in insulin sensitivity and diabetes, had decreased plasma concentrations of BCAAs compared to baseline while placebo had no effect. The rate-limiting enzyme in BCAA catabolism is the mitochondrial branched chain ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKDH), which is deactivated by phosphorylation. In multiple human hepatoma cell lines, MPCi markedly reduced BCKDH phosphorylation and stimulated branched chain keto acid catabolism; an effect that required the BCKDH phosphatase PPM1K. Mechanistically, the effects of MPCi were linked to activation of the energy sensing AMP-dependent protein kinase (AMPK) and mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase signaling cascades in vitro. BCKDH phosphorylation was reduced in liver of obese, hepatocyte-specific MPC2 knockout (LS-<italic>Mpc2</italic>−/−) mice compared to wild-type controls concomitant with activation of mTOR signaling in vivo. Finally, while MSDC-0602K treatment improved glucose homeostasis and increased the concentrations of some BCAA metabolites in ZDF rats, it did not lower plasma BCAA concentrations.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>These data demonstrate novel cross talk between mitochondrial pyruvate and BCAA metabolism and suggest that MPC inhibition leads to lower plasma BCAA concentrations and BCKDH phosphorylation by activating the mTOR axis. However, the effects of MPCi on glucose homeostasis may be separable from its effects on BCAA concentrations.</p>

              <p id="p0030">The mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) has emerged as a therapeutic target for treating metabolic diseases including insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) [<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>]. The MPC is a heterodimeric complex in the inner mitochondrial membrane that is composed of two proteins, MPC1 and MPC2 [<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Given that pyruvate is synthesized primarily in the cytosol while the enzymes that metabolize pyruvate (pyruvate carboxylase and pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH)) are localized exclusively in the mitochondrial matrix, transport across the inner mitochondrial membrane is a critical step in the metabolism of this substrate. Pharmacologic inhibition or genetic deletion of the MPC in the liver has been shown to be beneficial in mouse models of insulin resistance, diabetes, and NASH [<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>]. Mitochondrial pyruvate metabolism is required for high rates of flux of pyruvate into the gluconeogenic pathway, which is markedly increased in diabetes [<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and MPCi improve glycemia by reducing hepatic glucose production [<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, there could be other molecular mechanisms mediating therapeutic effects that have yet to be identified.</p>
              <p id="p0035">In addition to the well-known effects on glucose homeostasis, insulin resistance and diabetes are also associated with perturbations in lipid and amino acid metabolism [<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. For example, plasma concentrations of valine, leucine, and isoleucine, which are classified as branched chain amino acids (BCAAs), are increased in people with obesity and insulin resistance [<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>], and high plasma BCAA concentrations are predictive of future development of diabetes [<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Marked weight loss in people with obesity leads to reduced plasma BCAA concentrations [<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Furthermore, dietary restriction of BCAAs in Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats lowers plasma BCAAs and improves insulin sensitivity [<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], suggesting that high BCAA concentrations play a causative role in the development of insulin resistance. Consistent with this, genome-wide association studies in humans have demonstrated that genetic variations in genes encoding enzymes controlling BCAA metabolism are associated with increased BCAA concentrations and are also linked to the development of insulin resistance [<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Strategies that correct accumulation of these bioactive amino acids may have value as therapeutic avenues for treating diabetes.</p>
              <p id="p0040">Circulating BCAA concentrations are regulated by dietary intake, rates of protein synthesis and proteolysis, and BCAA catabolism. To be oxidized, BCAAs are first converted to branched chain keto acids (BCKAs) by branched chain aminotransferases (BCAT). Next, BCKAs undergo oxidation that is catalyzed by the BCKA dehydrogenase (BCKDH) enzyme complex (E1, E2, and E3 subunits) localized in the mitochondrial matrix. BCKDH catalyzes a committed and rate-limiting step in BCAA catabolism [<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. BCKDH activity is regulated by inhibitory phosphorylation of serine 293 of the E1 alpha subunit (pBCKDH), which is mediated by a BCKDH kinase (BDK). Conversely, BCKDH is activated by a protein phosphatase (PPM1K) that removes this covalent modification [<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Mechanistic studies conducted over the past several years have demonstrated that the phosphorylation of BCKDH is increased in the liver of rodent models of obesity/diabetes (<italic>ob/ob</italic> and ZDF rats) [<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], suggesting that impairments in BCKA catabolism may drive the accumulation of BCAAs in obesity. The increase in pBCKDH content seems to be mediated by reduced PPM1K and increased BDK activity [<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and genetic or pharmacologic approaches to suppress BDK activity or overexpress PPM1K are effective at enhancing BCKA catabolism and improving glucose intolerance in rodent models of obesity [<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p>
              <p id="p0045">In this work we examined the potential effects of MPC inhibition on BCAA metabolism by using pharmacologic and genetic approaches and explored the molecular mechanisms involved. These studies unveiled interesting metabolic crosstalk between the mitochondrial metabolism of pyruvate and BCKAs. Moreover, these studies suggest that part of the metabolic benefit derived from MPC inhibition could be mediated by stimulating the catabolism of BCAAs.</p>

                <title>Inhibition of the MPC increases BCKA oxidation and reduces BCKDH phosphorylation in vitro</title>
                <p id="p0150">Oxidation of BCKA in the BCKDH complex is an irreversible and rate-limiting step in BCAA catabolism and impairments in this process may play a causative role in elevated BCAA concentrations observed in obesity. We sought to determine if MPCi could directly affect BCAA/BCKA oxidation in an in vitro system by quantifying conversion of radiolabeled <sup>14</sup>C-ketoisovaleric acid (ketovaline) into <sup>14</sup>CO<sub>2</sub> in human hepatoma cells (Huh7 cells). Treatment of Huh7 cells with 7ACC2, a potent MPCi that is structurally unrelated to MSDC-0602K, or MSDC-0602K lead to a significant 32% and 43% increase in BCKDH oxidation relative to vehicle, respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A). In addition, we quantified intermediary metabolites from Huh7 cells treated with MPCi (UK5099 or 7ACC2). We detected an increase in ketovaline levels, and found trends toward increases in downstream BCAA catabolites including hydroxyisobutyrate, propionyl CoA, and methylmalonyl CoA (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>B). We also observed substantial decreases in levels of various TCA intermediates including citrate, fumarate, and malate, which is consistent with a suppression of pyruvate entry into the TCA cycle (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>B). Interestingly, we found that extracellular pyruvate was increased in the media of cells treated with 7ACC2 (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). TCA intermediates were among the most reduced metabolites that were examined, whereas levels of methionine and nucleotide monophosphates (GMP, UMP, and CMP) were highly elevated in response to MPCi treatment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>C). Importantly, as depicted in the heatmap, both MPCi (UK5099 and 7ACC2) produced similar changes in metabolite abundance, confirming the reproducibility of our results (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>B–C). Overall, these data suggest that MPCi lead to increased BCKDH activity and BCAA catabolism in vitro.<fig id="fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>BCKDH oxidation and BCAA catabolism are increased with MPC inhibition.</bold> (A) BCKA oxidation assay performed in Huh7 cells treated with either Veh, 7ACC2 (2.5 μM), or MSDC-0602K (25 μM).

                <p id="p0155">The rate-limiting enzyme in BCAA catabolism is the mitochondrial branched chain ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) that is deactivated by phosphorylation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A). Using human hepatoma cell lines (Huh7 and HepG2), we tested the effects of several MPCi including UK5099, 7ACC2, zaprinast, and MSDC-0602K on BCKDH phosphorylation. Overnight treatment of serum-starved hepatoma cells with the various MPCi resulted in substantial decreases in pBCKDH, relative to vehicle-treated Huh7 cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B). 7ACC2 also reduced BCKDH phosphorylation in HepG2 cells (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Fig. 2A</xref>). Since hepatoma cells have metabolic features not observed in hepatocytes in vivo, we isolated primary mouse hepatocytes from wild-type mice and treated them with the MPCi UK5099. Like human hepatoma cell lines, we found that BCKDH phosphorylation was decreased in MPCi-treated primary hepatocytes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>C). BCKDH phosphorylation is controlled by a BCKDH kinase (BDK) and a corresponding phosphatase PPM1K (aka PP2Cm or PP2Ckappa) [<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A). Recent work has suggested that BDK and PPM1K also directly phosphorylate and dephosphorylate, respectively, ATP citrate lyase (ACLY), a key enzyme involved in de novo lipogenesis at serine 455 [<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Interestingly, the phosphorylation of ACLY at serine 455 (pACLY) was increased by each of the MPCi tested and in mouse primary hepatocytes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B–C), suggesting that the effect of MPCi is specific to the phosphorylation of BCKDH.<fig id="fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Inhibition of the MPC reduces BCKDH phosphorylation in vitro.</bold> (A) Schematic showing the oxidative decarboxylation of BCKA, releasing CO<sub>2</sub>, by BCKDH that is regulated via an inhibitory phosphorylation by BDK, or an activating dephosphorylation by PPM1K.

                <p id="p0160">Additionally, the effect of MPCi was dose-dependent, with marked decreases in BCKDH phosphorylation being observed in the nanomolar (UK5099 and 7ACC2) and micromolar (MSDC-0602K) range (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>D and <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Fig. 2B</xref>). These dose effects are consistent with the established relative potency of these compounds as MPCi [<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Further, since the average trough levels of MSDC-0602K and its active metabolite at the 250 mg dose were approximately 6.2 μM [<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], these effects could be relevant in vivo. Lastly, we performed a time-course study and saw observable decreases in pBCKDH with as little as 30 min of MPCi treatment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>E). Compared to the effect of MPCi to decrease pBCKDH, the increase in pACLY caused by MPCi was similarly dose- and time-dependent.</p>

                <p id="p0165">To determine whether MPCi might be regulating BCKDH phosphorylation through BDK, we tested whether BT2, a chemical inhibitor of BDK, would impact the effects of MPCi. As can be seen in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>F, treatment with either a low or high dose of BT2 reduced pBCKDH in vehicle-treated cells. However, MPCi treatment had an additive and quantitatively greater effect even with high dose BT2 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>F), suggesting that the effect of MPCi is not mediated by inhibition of BDK. To confirm this, we used siRNA to selectively diminish expression of either PPM1K or BDK. Western blotting confirmed decreased protein expression of PPM1K or BDK with the respective siRNA (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>G). MPCi-treatment yielded a comparable reduction in pBCKDH levels in both control and BDK siRNA treated cells; again, suggesting a BDK-independent effect. In contrast, PPM1K siRNA markedly blunted the effects of 7ACC2 on BCKDH phosphorylation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>G), suggesting that MPCi-induced effects on pBCKDH are mediated via the PPM1K phosphatase. Notably, the MPCi-mediated increase in pACLY was not diminished with either BDK or PPM1K knockdown or by BT2 treatment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>F–G).</p>

                <title>MPCi activate the energy-sensing kinases AMPK and mTOR to mediate the effect on BCKDH</title>
                <p id="p0170">Previous studies have shown that pyruvate and glucose negatively regulate BCKDH activity in the perfused rat heart [<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. This effect was reversed by treatment with early MPCi or dichloroacetate (DCA), which inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase to stimulate pyruvate oxidation by dephosphorylation of the PDH enzyme. We hypothesized that MPCi could be preventing the accumulation of high intramitochondrial levels of pyruvate, thus avoiding the inhibitory effects of pyruvate on BCKDH activity. Addition of pyruvate to the media of Huh7 cells resulted in increased BCKDH and PDH phosphorylation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A). As expected, DCA reduced PDH phosphorylation and, interestingly, 7ACC2 treatment also reversed the effect of pyruvate on PDH phosphorylation. Treatment with 7ACC2 or DCA mostly blocked the effects of added pyruvate on pBCKDH and led to a substantial decrease in pBCKDH with both vehicle and MPCi treatment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A). Taken together, these data indicate that MPCi likely decreases intramitochondrial pyruvate levels, consequently preventing the inhibitory effects of pyruvate on BCKDH activity.<fig id="fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>MPCi activate the energy-sensing kinases AMPK to mediate the effect on BCKDH</bold>.

                <p id="p0175">Alternatively, or in addition, the effects of MPCi on pBCKDH could be mediated by compensatory changes in mitochondrial energy homeostasis. As its name suggests, the energy-sensing AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is activated by elevated AMP concentrations [<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Metabolomic analyses of Huh7 cells treated with either UK-5099 or 7ACC2 revealed increased AMP and an increased AMP/ATP ratio, compared to vehicle controls (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>B). Consistent with this, MPCi treatment led to a slight increase in the phosphorylation of the α subunit of AMPK and a more prominent increase in the phosphorylation of the AMPK target acetyl-CoA carboxylase (pACC) at serine 79 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>C). Treatment with the AMPK inhibitor, dorsomorphin, at concentrations that blocked most of the effect of MPCi on pACC also inhibited the effect of MPCi on pBCKDH and attenuated the effect on pACLY (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>C). Interestingly, the inhibition of PDKs with DCA also increased pACC, but this was somewhat attenuated when pyruvate was added with DCA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>D). These data suggest that inhibition of the MPC leads to an activation of AMPK that mediates the metabolic crosstalk leading to reduced pBCKDH.</p>
                <p id="p0180">The lack of glutamine in the amino acid-free media supplied to cells during MPCi treatment 1–2 h prior to harvest could produce TCA insufficiency. We therefore looked at the effects of titrating in various amounts of glutamine during this time. Adding back higher concentrations of glutamine (≥0.2 mM) blunted the effect of MPC inhibition on pBCKDH and pACLY, as well as pACC at the highest concentration (2 mM) in Huh7 cells, suggesting that stimulating glutaminolysis may overcome the effect of MPC inhibition (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>).</p>

                <title>MPCi treatment activates mTORC2 signaling, which is required for reduced pBCKDH</title>
                <p id="p0185">The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase is another nutrient sensing signaling cascade that can mediate effects through two multi-subunit complexes (mTORC1 and mTORC2) that control a variety of cellular and metabolic processes [<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Prior work has demonstrated that AMPK is a direct activator of mTORC2 [<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. We hypothesized that mTORC2 might be activated by MPCi because ACLY phosphorylation at serine 455 is known to be enhanced by mTORC2 activation [<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], which could explain why pACLY was increased with MPCi treatment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B). Indeed, we found that phosphorylation of AKT at serine 473 (pAKT), which is a known target of mTORC2, was decreased by pyruvate treatment and increased in cells treated with MPCi or DCA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>D).</p>
                <p id="p0190">We next examined the effects of treating cells with UK-5099 on mTORC pathway activation using an mTOR phospho antibody array. As predicted, the array indicated that the phosphorylation of AMPK was increased (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>A), confirming our previous results (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>C), and revealed increased phosphorylation of several mTOR targets (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>A). Furthermore, treatment with rapamycin, which is partially selective for mTORC1, somewhat attenuated the effect of MPCi on pBCKDH and pACLY (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>B). However, Torin1, which inhibits both mTORC1 and mTORC2, completely blocked the effect of MPCi on pBCKDH and markedly attenuated the increased phosphorylation of pACLY in Huh7 cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>B). We attempted to block the effect of MPCi by siRNA-mediated suppression of mTOR signaling by knocking down key components of mTORC1 (Raptor) or mTORC2 (Rictor) complexes. Interestingly, knocking down either Raptor or Rictor had no effect on the ability of MPCi to reduce pBCKDH and increase pACLY (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>C). However, siRNA directed against the mTOR kinase itself, blocked the effect of MPCi on these serine phosphorylation events like the effect of Torin1 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>C). These data could suggest that either mTORC1 or mTORC2 is sufficient to mediate the metabolic crosstalk or, alternatively, that additional mTOR complexes may exist, which has been suggested [<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].<fig id="fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>MPCi treatment activates mTORC2 signaling, which is required for reduced pBCKDH.</bold> Huh7 cells treated with either Veh (DMSO) or MPCi (UK5099, 2.5 μM) were harvested and used for analysis of signaling with an mTOR phosphoarray (described in methods).

However, obese rats fed MSDC-0602K had a significant reduction in liver weight and hepatic triglycerides compared to vehicle-fed obese rats (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Figs. 6B–C</xref>). Interestingly, these findings are similar to previous work showing that individuals treated with MSDC-0602K displayed elevated body weight and a significant reduction in hepatic steatosis [<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Vehicle-fed fa/fa rats had a 2.7-fold increase in fasting blood glucose concentrations and 4.2-fold increase in HOMA-IR, whereas both glucose and HOMA-IR in MSDC-0602K-fed obese rats were not significantly different from lean rats (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>B–C). Plasma triglyceride concentrations were also similar between obese MSDC-0602K-fed and lean rats, whereas vehicle-fed obese rats had a 7.2-fold increase in circulating triglycerides relative to lean rats (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>D).<fig id="fig7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>Pharmacological MPC inhibition in diabetic rats improves hyperglycemia.</bold> Obese (fa/fa) Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats were placed on either a standard rodent chow (Veh) or rodent chow containing MSDC-0602K (0602 K) for a period of 3 weeks, along with lean (fa/+) controls.

                <p id="p0220">Hepatic pBCKDH abundance was variable in vehicle-treated fa/fa rats and only a trend towards increased pBCKDH compared to fa/+ rat liver was detected. However, pBCKDH content tended to be decreased with MSDC-0602K treatment compared to vehicle treated fa/fa rats (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>E–F). We found that hepatic pACLY was increased by 2.8-fold in MSDC-0602K-fed rats, relative to lean controls, but pACC was decreased in MSDC-0602K-fed compared to vehicle-treated obese rats (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>E–F). Previous studies have shown that extrahepatic tissues are also highly involved in BCAA catabolism [<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], including brown adipose tissue (BAT), skeletal muscle, and heart. However, we observed no major differences in pBCKDH levels between vehicle-fed and MSDC-0602K-fed rats in these tissues (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Figs. 6A–C</xref>).</p>
                <p id="p0225">Plasma concentrations of valine, isoleucine, and total BCAAs were elevated in both vehicle- and MSDC-0602K-fed obese rats, relative to lean rats, whereas leucine levels were only statistically increased in vehicle-fed rats (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>G). Plasma BCKAs and pyruvate tended to be decreased in fa/fa vehicle vs fa/+ vehicle rats and tended to be increased in MSDC-0602K-fed vs vehicle-fed fa/fa rats (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Figs. 6D–E</xref>). Interestingly, the BCKA metabolite 3-hydroxybutyrate (3-HIB), which has been shown to promote insulin resistance in mice [<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], was increased by ∼2.1-fold in vehicle-fed fa/fa rats compared to lean controls, but MSDC-0602K feeding corrected this effect (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>H). Lastly, compared to lean rats, the BCKA metabolites C3- and C5-acylcarnitines were reduced in both vehicle- and MSDC-0602K-fed obese rats, but MSDC-0602K feeding significantly increased C3-acylcarnitines relative to vehicle-fed fa/fa rats (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>H). Collectively, these data suggest that improvements in glucose and lipid homeostasis elicited by MSDC-0602K in rats are associated with some alterations in BCKA metabolism, but not a correction in plasma BCAA concentrations.</p>

              <p id="p0230">In recent years, pharmacologic or genetic inhibition of the MPC in liver has demonstrated promise for treating metabolic diseases such as insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and NASH in both animal models and in clinical trials [<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>]. Although plausible mechanisms of action for the effectiveness of MPCi in these diseases have been identified, other possibilities remain to be explored. In the current work, we investigated the possible effects of MPC inhibition on BCAA metabolism, which is dysregulated in insulin resistance and T2DM, and further dissected the mechanisms taking place. Herein we show that patients with NASH, treated with the MPCi MSDC-0602K, had marked reductions in plasma BCAA levels, which coincided with improvements in plasma glucose, insulin, and adiponectin concentrations. Mechanistically, we found that genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of the MPC leads to reduced phosphorylation of BCKDH that is possibly secondary to diminished intramitochondrial pyruvate and mediated by the PPM1K phosphatase. Collectively, our work indicates a novel mechanism whereby MPCi modulate the cross talk between mitochondrial pyruvate and BCAA metabolism, and enhance BCKDH activity via PPM1K to lower plasma BCAA concentrations.</p>
              <p id="p0235">Multiple metabolomic studies have demonstrated that plasma BCAA, and related metabolites, are highly correlated with insulin resistance, T2DM, and the risk of future development of T2DM in humans [<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>]. However, whether BCAA levels promote insulin resistance, or are simply a consequence of the disease, is still a matter of debate. Indeed, reports correlating elevated BCAA levels to increased serum insulin, in patients with obesity, suggested that elevated levels were likely a secondary manifestation of obesity since amino acid levels decreased upon weight loss [<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. On the other hand, genome-wide association studies have linked genetic variations in enzymes that control BCAA metabolism [<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], especially PPM1K [<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], to plasma BCAA levels and insulin resistance and dietary restriction of BCAA in ZDF rats lowers plasma BCAAs and improves insulin sensitivity [<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], suggesting that high BCAA concentrations play a causative role in the development of insulin resistance. Herein, we report that treatment with an insulin sensitizing MPCi lowers plasma BCAA in people with NASH in association with marked reductions in plasma glucose and insulin concentrations. However, in rats, improvements in blood glucose and triglyceride concentrations with MPCi treatment were not associated with lower plasma BCAA content, but were associated with reversal of obesity-related changes in the circulating BCAA metabolites 3-HIB and C3 acylcarnitine. While the present studies cannot clarify the cause-and-effect relationship between BCAAs and insulin resistance in people, they are consistent with another study demonstrating that an insulin sensitizing agent and known MPCi, pioglitazone, also lowers plasma BCAAs in people with NASH [<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].</p>
              <p id="p0240">Circulating BCAA are increased in Zucker diabetic fatty rats (ZDF), which is believed to be mediated by reduced levels of PPM1K and increased hepatic BDK activity, which leads to increased pBCKDH and impaired BCKA oxidation [<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In contrast, diet-induced obese mice were found to have no change in plasma BCAA [<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. This may be explained by species differences in the regulation of BDK, since mice lack a carbohydrate response element binding protein binding site in the BDK promoter that is present in rats and humans [<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, there are some reports that mice with leptin or leptin receptor mutations exhibit elevated plasma BCAA concentrations [<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In the present study, we found that <italic>db/db</italic> mice exhibit increased hepatic pBCKDH, which was reduced in <italic>db/db</italic> LS-<italic>Mpc2</italic>−/−; however, we did not see a dramatic decrease in circulating BCAAs between fl/fl and LS-<italic>Mpc2</italic>−/− on the <italic>db/db</italic> background (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Fig. 5</xref>). It is possible that the effects on BCKDH phosphorylation, seen with hepatocyte-specific <italic>Mpc2</italic> deletion, are not sufficient to enhance BCKA catabolism to a degree that results in reduced circulating BCAAs. The effects of pharmacologic MPCi on BCAAs may be more dramatic because they are not liver-specific and could enhance BCKA oxidation in other organs that have high rates of BCKA catabolism. Indeed, a recent study with BDK liver-specific knockout mice demonstrated that this was not sufficient to affect systemic BCAA concentrations, but that systematic BDK inhibition lowered BCAAs by enhancing oxidation in extrahepatic tissues [<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. In the rat study described herein, we did not find an effect of MPCi on BCKDH phosphorylation in heart, BAT, or skeletal muscle and only a trend towards reduced pBCKDH in liver. It should be noted that the pBCKDH content of fa/fa liver was not elevated compared to fa/+ due to individual rat variability. Concordantly, with the lack of change in multi-tissue pBCKDH content, plasma BCAA concentrations were not affected by MPCi treatment, but changes in BCAA downstream metabolite content were detected. It is possible that the dose and duration of treatment was insufficient to lower BCAA, but the three-week treatment corrected obesity-related derangements in plasma triglyceride and glucose concentrations as well as improving the HOMA-IR. These findings suggest that MPCi-mediated improvements in glucose and HOMA-IR can occur independently of reduced BCAA. We cannot exclude the possibility that alterations in downstream BCAA metabolites, which could be mediators of insulin resistance [<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], play a role in the response to MPCi, since 3-HIB and C3 acylcarnitine were corrected by MSDC-0602K.</p>
              <p id="p0245">The present findings describe metabolic crosstalk between mitochondrial pyruvate and BCKA metabolism. Our model suggests that high intramitochondrial pyruvate abundance leads to increased pBCKDH. This is supported by evidence that supplementation of pyruvate increases pBCKDH, but that this can be counteracted by MPCi or enhancing pyruvate oxidation with DCA. These effects on BCKDH covalent modification are consistent with biochemical data generated many years ago by the Olson group [<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In those studies, they found that addition of pyruvate suppressed <sup>14</sup>C-BCKA oxidation in heart and that DCA and an early MPCi (α-cyanocinnamate) could prevent the effects of exogenous pyruvate on BCKA oxidation [<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. At that time, the regulation of BCKDH activity by phosphorylation had yet to be discovered and was therefore not assessed. The present studies are quite consistent with these historic findings and add additional mechanistic insight including demonstration that the effects of pyruvate and MPCi are likely mediated by the phosphorylation status of BCKDH and require PPM1K activity.</p>
              <p id="p0250">The mitochondrial phosphatase PPM1K is known to bind to the E2 subunit of the BCKDH complex, and dephosphorylate the E1 alpha subunit at serine 293 to increase BCKDH activity [<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Mutations in the gene encoding PPM1K lead to maple syrup urine disease in people, which is characterized by high urinary excretion of BCAAs and BCKAs due to impaired BCKA oxidation [<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The gene encoding PPM1K is transcriptionally regulated in HepG2 cells and is downregulated in media without BCAA [<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], but we saw no effect of MPCi on the abundance of PPM1K protein. Further investigation will be required to understand the relationship between MPCi and PPM1K.</p>
              <p id="p0255">Analysis of metabolite abundance revealed a trend towards increased BCAA catabolites (hydroxyisobutyrate, propionyl CoA, methylmalonyl CoA) and a substantial decrease in various TCA intermediates in MPCi-treated cells. Reduction in TCA intermediate abundance could be expected since MPCi block an important step in the complete oxidation of glucose by impeding pyruvate entry into the mitochondria. Increased BCKDH activity and BCAA catabolites could be a compensatory mechanism to provide alternative substrates to replenish TCA intermediates. Accordingly, we found MPCi-treated cells had elevated levels of AMP, ADP, and an increase in the ratio of AMP/ATP, which is known to activate AMPK, a critical regulator of energy homeostasis. Indeed, MPCi led to enhanced AMPK activity as evidenced by greater phospho-AMPKα at threonine 172, as well as a downstream target of AMPK, phospho-ACC at serine 79 [<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The role of AMPK was further demonstrated by the addition of dorsomorphin, an AMPK inhibitor, which blunted the effects of MPCi on pBCKDH in Huh7 cells. This may be an effect that is relevant only to our in vitro studies, since we did not observe an increase in phospho-ACC serine 79 in vivo with MPC inhibition or deletion. It is possible that the in vitro conditions used led to a relative depletion of key energy substrates since glutamine supplementation attenuated the signaling effects of MPCi on AMPK and pBCKDH.</p>
              <p id="p0260">Several observations suggest that selective activation of mTORC2 by MPCi is an important facet of the response to this compound both in vitro and in vivo. We found increased phosphorylation of the mTORC2 target Akt, at serine 473, and ACLY at serine 455, which is a substrate of Akt [<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], in hepatoma cells and in liver of diet-induced obese LS-<italic>Mpc2</italic>−/− mice and ZDF rats. Mechanistic studies revealed that the addition of Torin1, which inhibits both mTORC1 and mTORC2, diminished the effects of MPCi on pBCKDH, while Rapamycin, which somewhat selectively inhibits mTORC1, had a much lesser effect. Knockdown of the mTOR kinase itself, via siRNA, reversed the effect of MPCi on pBCKDH. However, knockdown of the regulatory components of mTORC1 (Raptor) or mTORC2 (Rictor) did not alter MPCi-mediated pBCKDH reduction. These data could suggest that signaling through either mTORC1 or mTORC2 is sufficient to mediate the metabolic crosstalk. Alternatively, a non-canonical mTOR complex (mTORC3), which has previously been suggested to exist [<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], could mediate the response. In contrast to AMPK signaling, the effects of MPCi on mTOR activity were observed both in vitro and in vivo. It is likely that this is the critical component this metabolic crosstalk in response to MPCi. Our studies indicate that MPCi enhances BCKDH phosphorylation in a manner that is dependent on mTOR, but further work will be needed to identify additional downstream mediators that connect mTOR to altered BCKDH phosphorylation.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p id="p0265">To conclude, we show that use of the MPCi MSDC-0602K, in people with NASH, led to marked improvement in insulin sensitivity and glycemia, which was accompanied by substantial decreases in circulating BCAA levels. Furthermore, phosphorylation of BCKDH, which inactivates the rate-limiting enzyme in BCAA catabolism, was decreased in human hepatoma cell lines treated with MPCi, which was mediated by the phosphatase PPM1K. Activation of pyruvate oxidation mimicked the effect of MPCi, suggesting that MPCi may enhance BCKDH activity by reducing intramitochondrial pyruvate accumulation. Addition of MPCi led to elevated AMP levels and an increase in phosphorylation of downstream targets of AMPK and mTORC2, while inhibition of these kinases abolished the effects of MPCi on pBCKDH in vitro. Phosphorylation of BCKDH was decreased, and downstream mTOR targets (Akt and ACLY) were increased in the liver of obese LS-<italic>Mpc2</italic>−/− mice, and a trend towards similar changes was observed with pharmacological MPCi in obese rats. Collectively, these data reveal cross talk between BCAA metabolism and mitochondrial pyruvate, and provide evidence that inhibition of the MPC leads to reduced circulating BCAA levels and hepatic BCKDH phosphorylation in a manner that is dependent on AMPK/mTOR signaling.</p>
