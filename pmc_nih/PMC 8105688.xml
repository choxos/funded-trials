                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Intervention during the first years of life for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) may have the strongest impact on long-term brain development and functioning. Yet, barriers such as a shortage of trained professionals contribute to significant delays in service. The goal of this proof-of-concept study was to explore strategies that support timely and equitable deployment of ASD-specific interventions.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">This 15-week, randomized proof-of-concept study explored the acceptability of a digital parent mediated intervention online reciprocal imitation training (RIT; a naturalistic developmental behavioral intervention) and compared it to a treatment as usual (TAU) control on parent and child outcomes. Eligible children were between 18 and 60 months, met the cutoff for ASD on the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-2nd Edition and demonstrate significant social imitation deficits. Primary outcomes include the acceptability of RIT (Scale of Treatment Perceptions) and the feasibility of the Online RIT digital intervention (online RIT attributes). Secondary outcomes included parent fidelity (RIT parent fidelity form) and parental self-efficacy (Early Intervention Parenting Self-Efficacy Scale). Exploratory outcome measures included child social communication (Social Communication Checklist), child imitation skills (Unstructured Imitation Assessment), and family quality of life (Beach Center Family Quality of Life Scale).</p>

                  <p id="Par3">Twenty participants were randomized in a 1:1 fashion. The acceptability and feasibility of RIT and the Online RIT digital intervention were rated highly. Among the secondary outcomes, there were significant group differences in parent fidelity (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and self-efficacy (<italic>p</italic> = .029). On exploratory outcomes, there were group differences in child social communication (<italic>p</italic> = .048). There were no significant group differences in imitation ability (<italic>p</italic> = .05) or family quality of life (<italic>p</italic> = .22).</p>

                  <title>Limitations</title>
                  <p id="Par4">There are several limitations with this study, including the small sample size as well as lack of data on enactment and website engagement. This study was not able to address questions related to which variables predict program engagement and treatment response, which will be critical for determining which families may benefit from such a stepped-care delivery model.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p id="Par5">Overall, the Online RIT program delivered in a stepped-care format shows strong acceptability and holds promise as an innovative delivery model.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par27">There are clear benefits to specific early interventions for young children with and at-risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Yet, limited availability of services results in many children “missing out” on intervention during the key developmental period proposed to have the most powerful effect on gene expression, brain development and behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The discrepancy between service need and access is compounded for those in underserved communities where children receive even fewer interventions and at later ages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Commonly cited barriers to care include transportation issues, limited funding, and a shortage of well-trained professionals, all of which contribute to significant waitlists and delays in care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Research examining strategies to directly address these barriers and support deployment of ASD-specific interventions in a timely, equitable and efficient manner is a top priority [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p>
              <sec id="Sec2">
                <title>Naturalistic developmental behavioral interventions (NDBIs)</title>
                <p id="Par28">There is growing evidence for Naturalistic Developmental Behavioral Interventions (NDBIs), a category of interventions that merge applied behavioral and developmental sciences, for improving social communication and developmental outcomes in young children with and at-risk for ASD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. While each NDBI has specific features, they are characterized by commonalities in terms of the nature of learning targets (e.g., focus on building a social learning infrastructure), learning contexts (e.g., teaching within naturalistic contexts), and development-enhancing strategies. NDBIs share evidence-based strategies such as use of a three-part contingency, child-initiated teaching episodes, environmental arrangement, and natural reinforcement (see 7 for a full list of shared strategies). Best practice indicates that delivery of NDBIs should be initiated as early as possible, include a parent component, and concurrently address underlying core deficits and teach new skills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par29">Comprehensive NDBIs, such as the Early Start Denver Model (ESDM; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]) target a number of broad functional outcomes and therefore are often intensive in terms of resources, time, and duration, and rely on highly trained interdisciplinary specialists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The importance of comprehensive programs should not be understated; however, the complex nature of these programs may hinder access, adoption and implementation—especially in community settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In particular, families who have access to traditional comprehensive interventions vastly underutilize the hours they are allotted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Additionally, recent estimates indicate an average time-lag of roughly 3 years between diagnosis and receipt of early intensive behavioral intervention in the community [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Further, the younger a child at diagnosis, the greater the time-lag to service access, suggesting a significant gap in care during a period when the child and family may be particularly vulnerable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par30">Given the current services landscape, it is critical to consider additional models such as focused NDBIs, which may be particularly well suited to serve as a “bridge” or supplement to more comprehensive approaches. Focused interventions teach a specific skill or set of skills, are often less complex and intensive, and hold promise for more efficient dissemination and adoption across formats (e.g., parent mediated intervention) and settings (e.g., early childhood classrooms, home-based IDEA Part C services). Research suggests a number of focused NDBIs, such as Reciprocal Imitation Training (RIT) and Joint Attention Symbolic Play Engagement and Regulation (JASPER), can improve specific social communication skills at a relatively low intensity and when implemented by caregivers and other key members of a child’s community [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Taken together, focused NDBIs are particularly well-suited for use when examining innovative delivery models to provide care to families without or with limited access to evidence-based services.</p>

                <title>Telehealth</title>
                <p id="Par31">Telehealth, or the ability to provide long-distance health care and education, has been one of the most rapidly growing fields of research and clinical care in the last decade. In 2019, 90% of adults in the United States reported using the internet, 81% report owning a smartphone, and approximately 78% of homes had broadband internet connection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Given the intuitive appeal of telehealth, this delivery model has already been adopted in community settings. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, two thirds of U.S. hospitals employ some kind of telehealth technology, one third of states have enacted telehealth parity laws, and nearly all state Medicaid programs cover at least some form of telehealth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In 2012, only 13 states had incorporated telehealth into the Part C Early Intervention system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]); this number has grown dramatically over the last decade, and most recently during the global COVID-19 pandemic, with nearly all states launching initiatives to support statewide implementation of telehealth-based Early Intervention services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The scientific data and stakeholder excitement around telehealth suggests that it is poised to serve as a viable alternative or supplement to traditional service delivery models with potential to deliver care in an effective, acceptable, and cost-efficient manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par32">Telehealth can be used to deliver intervention in a variety of formats. For example, there is a growing emphasis on the use of digital interventions or self-directed applications (e.g., smart phone apps) and websites to deliver evidence-based intervention such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for common psychiatric conditions such as depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Similarly, earlier telehealth early intervention research explored self-directed digital interventions to deliver parent training in NDBIs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. While digital interventions provide greater flexibility for user engagement, reduce costs, and facilitate large scale dissemination, limitations to this approach must be considered. Specifically, parents using self-directed digital intervention programs are more likely to report barriers to participation (such as time), less likely engage with and complete program elements, and less likely to report gains in child skills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Research has also examined the use of videoconferencing or “real-time”/synchronous telehealth, to deliver instruction and parent coaching to support skill acquisition in caregivers of children with ASD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Despite the promise of these data, remote parent coaching alone still does not address the significant barrier of a shortage of trained professionals in community settings.</p>
                <p id="Par33">Importantly, digital interventions and remote parent coaching approaches can be integrated for more effective service delivery. For example, a parent could access digital tools (in the form of a website or game) to learn the intervention content at their own time at pace, and then connect remotely with a professional to get feedback on their use of the strategies and help with problem solving and planning. Ingersoll and colleagues compared use of an interactive website alone to the website plus remote coaching and found both groups showed gains from pre- to post-intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. However, parents in the remote-coaching condition improved more in their intervention fidelity and increased positive perceptions of their child, and the children in that condition showed greater gains in social skills.</p>
                <p id="Par34">Although there is limited understanding of the specific variables predicting response to treatment, these data support the notion that tailoring of both digital tools (e.g., interactive website) and coaching approaches should be explored to enhance learning and application of skill from such hybrid telehealth programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Equally as important is the close consideration of personalized telehealth models to maximize reach and efficiency of service delivery.</p>

                <title>Adaptive interventions</title>
                <p id="Par35">Given the modest evidence for the “one size fits all” telehealth approach, an examination of individualized models for promising NDBIs is warranted. Adaptive interventions allow for variation in intervention intensity as a function of individual or environmental characteristics and treatment response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Adaptive interventions may be especially fitting when there are high levels of heterogeneity in treatment response and a need to consider a cost–benefit trade-off between intervention intensity and available resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Given the current state of ASD research and practice, there is a strong rationale for exploration of adaptive telehealth NDBIs.</p>
                <p id="Par36">Stepped-care is a model of adaptive intervention which offers less intensive intervention as a first-line treatment, and more intensive care only when clinically indicated. Decisions about who receives “stepped up” care are data-driven in that they are informed by closely monitoring patient outcomes using what are referred to as tailoring variables to determine if and when additional care is indicated. Two of the main indicators of success in parent-mediated interventions are parent fidelity and self-efficacy. Parent fidelity (i.e., the proper implementation of an intervention) has been instrumental for positive increases in child outcomes across several NDBIs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Parent self-efficacy (i.e., parental belief in their capabilities) is thought to serve a vital role in maximizing early intervention outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par37">Stepped-care models have been designed for the delivery of interventions for eating disorders, substance abuse, anxiety, depression and childhood trauma, and data indicate it is an effective, acceptable and cost-efficient model, particularly for brief interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Investigators have suggested that stepped-care may be an especially promising delivery model for targeted early interventions for ASD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] but research has not yet examined a stepped-care parent mediated intervention for ASD.</p>

                <title>Current study</title>
                <p id="Par38">Online RIT is an interactive website introducing Reciprocal Imitation Training (RIT), an NDBI focused on enhancing social imitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. RIT uses a naturalistic behavioral approach to teach object and gesture imitation to young children with ASD within a play-based context. The efficacy of RIT has been demonstrated through a small randomized control trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and several single-subject design studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], as well as in independent replications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Prior research also suggests that parents can be taught to effectively use RIT with their children in person [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], and two single-subject design studies detail the development and feasibility testing of Online RIT plus therapist assistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In Study 1, parents used the website and received in-vivo coaching; children showed corresponding improvements in imitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. In Study 2, parents used the website with remote coaching; parents improved in RIT fidelity across study phases, and concurrent improvements in child imitation were observed. All families received remote coaching, but 2/5 achieved the fidelity threshold after the website alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. These preliminary data suggest Online RIT may serve as an ideal platform for examining the potential of individualized telehealth delivery formats, such as stepped-care.</p>
                <p id="Par39">This proof-of-concept study addresses the gap in the current literature and represents an important next step in digital intervention development by examining a stepped-care version of Online RIT. Although not frequently employed in behavioral intervention research, a proof-of-concept study is warranted given the significant financial and resource investment associated with developing and trialing digital interventions. Indeed, proof-of-concept studies are increasingly common early in the lifecycle of digital interventions, particularly in the field of behavioral health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Furthermore, proof-of-concept studies can be used to inform decisions about whether to proceeded with further investment in the tool and larger more expensive studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. As such, the goal of the current study was to determine the acceptability and feasibility of a stepped-care format of Online RIT and to explore initial differences in critical outcomes such as parent fidelity and self-efficacy, when compared to treatment as usual.</p>

                <p id="Par54">Online RIT is a digital intervention in the form of an interactive website that was developed to teach RIT to parents of young children with or at-risk for ASD. Program development was guided by the technology acceptance model, media richness theory (i.e., which technologies best reduce uncertainty and equivocality), and principles of instructional design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. A collaborative and iterative development process with pilot participants was employed to ensure acceptability and usability. Online RIT is hosted on a unique URL owned and managed by RUMC, requires a unique username and password to log in, and is consistent with “best practices” in terms of safeguards to ensure website security. The program is mobile device and computer compatible.</p>
                <p id="Par55">Online RIT presents RIT techniques in four sequential learning modules: (1) <italic>Setting Up For Success</italic> (selecting activities, antecedent controls, scheduling practice time, ensuring a support system); (2) <italic>Imitating your Child</italic> (contingent imitation, imitating the child’s vocalizations, gestures, body movements and play with toys); (3) <italic>Describing Play</italic> (linguistic mapping, using simple and descriptive language at or slightly above the child’s linguistic level); (4) <italic>Teaching Object Imitation</italic> (using modeling, prompting, reinforcement to teach a target skill, and pacing the interaction). Each learning module includes an instructional video, quiz, interactive exercises, and at-home planning and reflection. The website also includes a video library, Frequently Asked Questions, downloadable visual aids, links to relevant external resources, and a customizable “dashboard” that allows users to track their individualized goals and the amount of time they have spent working on their goals (e.g., practice log).</p>
                <p id="Par56">Parent coaching sessions were held remotely using Vidyo, which provides secure bidirectional audio and video conferencing capability along with advanced capabilities such as content/screen sharing, video streaming, far end camera control, encryption, DTMF controls and more. Vidyo meets HIPAA privacy standards and has built-in security management (e.g., SSL certificates, private key management, and HTTPS all FIPS 140-2 compliance). Participants in the current study downloaded an app to their smartphone, tablet or computer to allow for seamless videoconferencing.</p>

Prior research on parent-mediated intervention in RIT and related NDBIs suggests improvements in, and pivotal mediating roles for, parent fidelity and parent empowerment/self-efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. As such, these two variables were selected as tailoring variables for this stepped-care model. Fidelity (RIT-PFF) and self-efficacy (EIPSES) at 5 weeks were used to determine which participants were in need of a “step up” in care, in the form of remote parent coaching.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par69">The current proof-of-concept study is the first to evaluate a stepped-care telehealth parent training program for delivering ASD-specific intervention. Families of young children with or at-risk for ASD experience significant uncertainty and stress during the period that they are waiting for an evaluation and initiation of comprehensive early intervention services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. In addition, many children are “missing out” on intervention during critical developmental periods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Thus, the development and evaluation of innovative interventions and delivery models, such as Online RIT, with potential to deliver timely, equitable and cost-efficient ASD-specific intervention to young children is critical.</p>
              <p id="Par70">RIT, as a skill building intervention, was experienced as safe, effective and a good fit for families. The Online RIT program was rated highly across characteristics known to be associated with more successful dissemination of novel interventions such as acceptability, relative advantage, observability and lack of complexity. Perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness are particularly important in the context of technological innovations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. Qualitative feedback about the ease of use and usefulness of Online RIT included “Ease of logging in at any time, ease of pausing and then coming back to complete tasks, a great library of videos to learn from,” “The [Online] RIT website allowed me to view real-life examples of techniques. It's easier and entertaining to watch the techniques than to read about them,” and “It's a great way to see what other people are doing and how to apply it with my own son!” These data suggest strong potential for the deployment of RIT across diverse settings and service delivery formats including via the Online RIT program.</p>
              <p id="Par71">This is the first study to examine the potential of a stepped-care model for an ASD telehealth intervention. Even within this small sample, differences in parent learning and experience were observed. For example, only one parent was considered a full responder and therefore did not require coaching. This parent achieved the fidelity threshold and showed increases in self-efficacy after using the website alone. Our iterative process and user-centered framework provides a data-driven approach to better meet diverse user needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. For example, one route is to use rapidly evolving technological innovations to improve engagement and individualized support through the digital intervention itself. A participant suggested “I recommend a schedule to complete the lessons. A way of tracking when I'm done with the homework and saving it also informing me when it's time to do the reflection. Case in point, my first lesson I did everything at once without practicing the skill first.” Building in personalized recommendations for how and when to use the digital intervention could not only enhance learning but allow users to feel more competent and successful along the way. Consistent with best practices in digital intervention development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>] <italic>real time</italic> multi-dimensional assessment of participant experience (e.g., website usage, ecological momentary assessment (EMA; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]) of self-efficacy) would also allow for immediate identification of participants who would benefit from the addition of a coach, thereby reducing the time lag time between need and access.</p>
              <p id="Par72">Another important goal of this proof-of-concept study was to explore differences in intervention outcomes between participants in the Online RIT group and those in TAU. After adjusting for baseline scores, parents in the intervention condition showed larger improvements in parent fidelity of RIT and parent self-efficacy. While it is not surprising that parents who received Online RIT learned the strategies better than parents who did not receive the program, these data support the notion that Online RIT can be an effective model for parents to learn ASD-specific intervention strategies and change their behavior accordingly during interactions with their young children at home. All but one parent in the Online RIT condition eventually implemented RIT with fidelity, suggesting that with the right supports RIT is a relatively easy NDBI to learn and use. Indeed, prior research has found that despite overall improvements in skill after digital interventions and remote coaching in more complex NDBIs, many parents still do not achieve the fidelity threshold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. As noted above, there is a rich opportunity to capitalize upon technological innovations to build more engaging and supportive digital intervention programs. Concurrently, it is important to note that these predetermined fidelity thresholds are also a legacy from lab-based efficacy studies, and the necessity or impact of achieving the fidelity threshold remains unclear in parent-mediated intervention studies.</p>
              <p id="Par73">Consistent with research from parent mediated NDBIs, data from the current study suggest a meaningful relationship between Online RIT and parent self-efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. Self-efficacy is an important driver of individual behavior change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>], with higher self-efficacy related to a greater likelihood of embracing and sustaining novel behaviors, even when faced with obstacles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. It is possible that parents who feel more efficacious in interactions with their child with ASD may engage with their child more often, have higher expectations for their child’s behavior, and/or more effectively advocate for their child’s needs, all of which may contribute to improved parent and child level outcomes, especially during a time of uncertainty and need. Interestingly, two parents in the Online RIT group who were observed to be implementing RIT with fidelity after using the website alone reported experiencing declines in self-efficacy during that same period. Again, these patterns point to the need to incorporate more adaptive features into the digital intervention platform, as well as the need to identify certain subsets of individuals who could benefit from coaching and at earlier stages, to enhance parenting efficacy in response to such a program.</p>
              <p id="Par74">No significant differences between the two groups on broad family quality of life at post-intervention were observed. This is an area that is often not directly measured within early intervention for ASD trials, as primary outcomes tend to be related to the child (e.g., social communication, developmental functioning) or to the parents’ use of the intervention techniques (e.g., fidelity of the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]). However, enhancing a family’s capacity to problem solve, advocate and seek out supports are considered critical outcomes of early intervention programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. There is potential to build features into the digital intervention program that could have a stronger impact on broad family quality of life; as one participant explained Online RIT could house “tips/videos of parents embedding RIT into regular everyday routines, tips and resources for using RIT with siblings around and in community play groups with peers, success stories from parents to encourage other parents, inspiration and play ideas from parents, a forum for parents to exchange ideas and motivate each other and discuss how they fit it into their busy lives.”</p>
              <p id="Par75">After adjusting for baseline scores, children in the intervention condition had improved scores on parent report of overall social communication skills. Although significant differences between the two groups were not observed on the UIA, the effect size favored the intervention condition with three of these children showing reliable improvement in their UIA performance. While the small sample size could help account for the lack of significant group differences on the UIA, it is also important to note that standardized clinician-administered social communication assessments as primary endpoints command a high threshold that may not be sensitive to subtle markers of change in early social communication skills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. Thus, it is possible that a certain amount of time and intensity of intervention may be necessary for generalized social communication gains to be observed on such standardized clinical assessments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par76">The extent to which parents actually practiced and implemented these strategies with their children day-to-day is unknown. This metric, often referred to as enactment or dose, is extremely challenging to measure and is historically under-reported in studies of parent mediated interventions for ASD and related conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. In the current study, a text message approach to collecting this data was trialed. First, the study team text messaged three times per week (“Have you used RIT with your child today? Y/N”; if Y “For about how many minutes did you use RIT today?”). Although families initially responded, the response rate dropped to zero after two weeks. Parents reported that these texts were “too frequent,” so the rate was reduced to once a week, but the similar response rate was observed. The rapid rate of technological innovation means that certain features, such as a pop-up calendar that emerges when a user signs into the website, are now possible in a way that they were not when the site was first developed. A critical area for future research will be to work with families and other key stakeholders to determine acceptable, effective and feasible strategies for collecting this critical enactment data.</p>
              <sec id="Sec39">
                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p id="Par77">Several limitations to the current study have been noted in the discussion section including the small sample size, lack of enactment data, and a lack website engagement data. Given the nature of the proof-of-concept trial, we were not able to offer a robust test of treatment effectiveness, although preliminary data on child imitation and family functioning are promising. In addition, the rapid shift to digital healthcare during the pandemic has highlighted both the potential and challenges of telehealth care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. It is acknowledged that telehealth and digital interventions may not be universally acceptable and/or effective for all families. The extent to which critical family characteristics such as cultural background, race, and ethnicity, impact access to and engagement with the Online RIT program could not answered in the current work. In addition, the extent to which parent motivational and cognitive variables, as well as child skills, moderate treatment effectiveness remains unknown. Such work will be critical as we incorporate technology allowing for more individualization of the digital intervention and coaching approach, as well as for determining a priori who would benefit from such a delivery model and who may be better served through a different format. Finally, despite random assignment, the two groups were unbalanced on certain background characteristics such race and ethnicity (with greater racial and ethnic diversity in the Online RIT intervention group relative to TAU) and average weekly intervention hours (with the Online RIT intervention group recieving, on average, more hours each week than TAU).</p>

              <title>Conclusions and future directions</title>
              <p id="Par78">With the limitations above noted, the current proof-of-concept study still serves as an important initial step in exploring the feasibility of a stepped-care format of Online RIT. We found that parents enjoyed the intervention content and website, that they were able to learn and use RIT with their children as a result of the program, and that they had ideas and suggestions for further improving the digital intervention user experience. Taken together, these results compel additional investment in the digital intervention program and offer clear next steps in the larger scale evaluation of this innovative intervention approach. For example, we selected parent fidelity of RIT and parent self-efficacy as tailoring variables in the current model based on theoretical rationale, but by design we were not able to explicitly test whether these are the “right” tailoring variables or the extent to which different levels of care predicted specific response to treatment across outcomes of interest. In addition to identifying appropriate tailoring variables, a related critical next step of this work is to understand how participant characteristics, including socioeconomic status and demographic characteristics, impact engagement with and completion of digital interventions. Moreover, future research will empirically test the efficiency and effectiveness of possible active components of the intervention and to understand the extent to which these components can be adjusted to provide more individualized intervention. Theoretically informed pilot data from this trial are critical for use of novel research strategies such as Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]) which has been posited as an alternative to the traditional randomized control/confirmatory trial in the development and evaluation of telehealth and digital interventions. Indeed, planned future research with Online RIT will capitalize upon such innovative research designs to create and evaluate an optimized adaptive telehealth intervention.</p>
