                <p id="Par1">Advanced systemic mastocytosis (AdvSM) is a rare hematologic neoplasm driven by the <italic>KIT</italic> D816V mutation and associated with poor survival. This phase 1 study (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02561988">NCT02561988</ext-link>) evaluated avapritinib (BLU-285), a selective KIT D816V inhibitor, in patients with AdvSM. The primary endpoints were the maximum tolerated dose, recommended phase 2 dose and safety of avapritinib. Secondary endpoints included overall response rate and changes in measures of mast cell burden. Avapritinib was evaluated at doses of 30–400 mg once daily in 86 patients, 69 with centrally confirmed AdvSM. Maximum tolerated dose was not reached, and 200 mg and 300 mg daily were studied in dose-expansion cohorts. The most frequent adverse events observed were periorbital edema (69%), anemia (55%), diarrhea (45%), thrombocytopenia (44%) and nausea (44%). Intracranial bleeding occurred in 13% overall, but in only 1% of patients without severe thrombocytopenia (platelets &lt;50 × 10<sup>9</sup>/l). In 53 response-evaluable patients, the overall response rate was 75%. The complete remission rate was 36%. Avapritinib elicited ≥50% reductions in marrow mast cells and serum tryptase in 92% and 99% of patients, respectively. Avapritinib induced deep and durable responses, including molecular remission of <italic>KIT</italic> D816V in patients with AdvSM, and was well tolerated at the recommended phase 2 dose of 200 mg daily.</p>

                <p id="Par13">In patients with AdvSM, the most frequent hematologic AEs (any grade and grade 3 or 4) were anemia (58% and 36%), thrombocytopenia (51% and 41%) and neutropenia (22% and 19%). Patients with baseline cytopenias were more likely to have cytopenia AEs on study. The risk of ≥grade 3 thrombocytopenia was 20% in the absence of baseline thrombocytopenia, but 70% where thrombocytopenia was present at baseline. Neutropenia of ≥grade 3 occurred in 25% without, and 63% with baseline neutropenia.

Only one (1%) patient experienced ICB in the absence of prior severe thrombocytopenia. Avapritinib dose, platelet count, coagulation studies and platelet transfusions for patients who had ICB are reported in Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. Due to the increased incidence of ICB in association with antecedent severe thrombocytopenia, the protocol was amended to exclude the enrollment of new patients with severe thrombocytopenia (&lt;50 × 10<sup>9</sup>/l), to increase monitoring of the platelet count, and to provide guidance for pausing avapritinib and providing platelet transfusion support for severe thrombocytopenia.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par26">Patients with AdvSM have life-threatening organ damage and poor survival, caused by the increased proliferation of neoplastic mast cells driven by the <italic>KIT</italic> D816V mutation in ~95% of patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Midostaurin, until recently the only approved therapy for all subtypes of AdvSM, does not selectively target the KIT D816V mutant and only rarely do patients achieve a complete remission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. In a post hoc exploratory analysis of the pivotal midostaurin phase 2 study using IWG-MRT-ECNM criteria, responses occurred in 28% of patients with a 2% CR rate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par27">Based on data from this phase 1 study and the ongoing phase 2 PATHFINDER (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03580655">NCT03580655</ext-link>) study, avapritinib received United States FDA approval in June 2021 for adult patients with all subtypes of AdvSM, at a recommended dose of 200 mg orally QD. Due to the risks of ICB associated with severe thrombocytopenia, avapritinib is not recommended for the treatment of patients with AdvSM with a platelet count of &lt;50 × 10<sup>9</sup>/l. The results of this phase 1 dose-escalation/expansion study demonstrated that potent and selective inhibition of KIT D816V by avapritinib elicited rapid, profound reductions of measures of mast cell disease burden, resolved organ damage, and improved patients’ symptoms across the spectrum of AdvSM subtypes.</p>
              <p id="Par28">Responses (CR/CRh/PR/CI) occurred in 75% of patients, including 36% achieving CR/CRh. These responses were adjudicated using stringent mIWG-MRT-ECNM response criteria, which require a sustained response with 12-week confirmation and full resolution of one or more C-findings. Responses were observed irrespective of disease subtype, prior therapy or presence of high-risk <italic>S/A/R</italic> mutations.</p>
              <p id="Par29">Notably, <italic>KIT</italic> D816V became undetectable in the BM of 30% of patients with AdvSM, using a highly sensitive ddPCR assay. This demonstrated that avapritinib induced deep molecular responses, an outcome that represents a new response benchmark in AdvSM. In an earlier multivariate analysis of 38 midostaurin-treated patients with AdvSM, a mere 25% reduction in <italic>KIT</italic> D816V RNA-expressed allele burden was statistically associated with prolonged survival<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par30">Consistent with these findings, early outcomes with avapritinib were excellent. While midostaurin and avapritinib have not been directly compared in a prospective, randomized trial, the survival of patients with AdvSM in the current study is noteworthy. The median OS was not reached in patients with AdvSM on avapritinib, with an estimated 24-month OS rate of 76% (95% CI, 64–87%). The published literature confirms the particularly poor prognosis of patients with MCL, with only a 24% probability of 24-month OS in this subgroup<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. In the current study of avapritinib, the 24-month estimated median OS in patients with MCL was 92% (95% CI, 76–100%), while in the previous trial of midostaurin, 24-month OS in patients with MCL was 26% (95% CI, 6–54%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Importantly, avapritinib demonstrated high ORR rates and similar OS in patients with and without prior midostaurin exposure, suggesting that cross-resistance to avapritinib is rare.</p>
              <p id="Par31">Although patients with and without <italic>S/A/R</italic> mutations at baseline had similar response rates, the presence of <italic>S/A/R</italic> mutations or a MARS score of ≥2 was associated with shorter OS. These findings suggest that although avapritinib reduced mast cell burden and C-findings regardless of co-mutation status, patients with adverse myeloid co-mutations such as <italic>S/A/R</italic> were more likely to experience disease progression. In contrast, patients with AdvSM and a MARS score of 0–1 had excellent outcomes on avapritinib monotherapy in this study, as demonstrated by a 100% 24-month OS rate.</p>
              <p id="Par32">Avapritinib at ≥200 mg QD starting doses induced rapid responses, with a median time to CR/CRh/PR of 2 months, as compared with over 9 months for &lt;200 mg QD starting doses. Given the poor overall survival characteristic of AdvSM, the rapid responses observed with a starting dose of at least 200 mg are clinically important.</p>
              <p id="Par33">Avapritinib was generally well tolerated with few discontinuations due to AEs. The most common AEs, including fluid retention, gastrointestinal effects and cytopenias, were consistent with those reported with other inhibitors of KIT/PDGFR, and usually responded to dose modification. Cytopenias were the most common ≥grade 3 AEs, and they occurred at a higher rate in patients who had baseline cytopenias. Cognitive events and ICB have previously been reported in patients with GIST treated with avapritinib<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Although symptoms such as brain fog and memory impairment are known disease features of SM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>, cognitive effect AEs were less frequent in this AdvSM population than those previously observed in patients with GIST<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, which may be related to the lower starting doses in this study.</p>
              <p id="Par34">ICB was more frequent in the AdvSM setting compared with GIST and was strongly associated with antecedent severe thrombocytopenia (platelets &lt;50 × 10<sup>9</sup>/l). The incidence of ICB in AdvSM in the absence of severe thrombocytopenia (1%) was similar to the incidence in GIST. The observation of an association between severe thrombocytopenia and ICB led to the implementation of several patient selection and risk mitigation strategies in both the phase 1 EXPLORER and ongoing phase 2 PATHFINDER (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03580655">NCT03580655</ext-link>) studies: exclusion of severely thrombocytopenic patients, increased platelet count monitoring, dose interruption in patients developing severe thrombocytopenia, and permanent treatment discontinuation after ICB of any grade. Antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants were avoided, and any coagulation abnormalities were corrected, if possible. The risk of ICB was mitigated in the aforementioned phase 2 study following the implementation of these measures. A proactive patient management strategy to minimize ICB risk will require platelet monitoring with dose interruption, reduction and platelet support in the event of severe thrombocytopenia.</p>
              <p id="Par35">The primary objectives of this dose-escalation/expansion study were to determine the MTD, safety and the RP2D of avapritinib, an investigational potent and selective KIT D816V inhibitor. Considering efficacy, tolerability and PK, the RP2D was identified as 200 mg QD based on consistent exposure above the KIT D816V in vivo IC<sub>90</sub> and rapid time to response. At this dose, avapritinib induced deep and durable clinical, pathologic and molecular responses in patients with AdvSM, reduced disease-related symptoms, and was generally well tolerated.</p>
              <p id="Par36">The ongoing phase 2 PATHFINDER study has been designed to further characterize the safety and efficacy of avapritinib in patients with AdvSM at the 200 mg QD starting dose.</p>

During dose escalation, patients received oral avapritinib at starting doses ranging from 30 to 400 mg QD in continuous 28-d treatment cycles. Dose escalation followed a 3 + 3 design (described below) until the MTD or RP2D was determined. During part 1, intra-patient dose escalation to assess dose levels not exceeding the MTD was allowed. Dose expansion was initially conducted at a starting dose of 300 mg QD; a second expansion cohort at 200 mg QD was subsequently introduced via protocol amendment. Dosing continued until patients experienced unacceptable toxicity, disease progression, death or withdrew consent.</p>

Dose escalation then proceeded at increments up to 100% until one or more patients treated at a given dose level had a ≥grade 2 non-hematologic AE possibly related to avapritinib or a grade 4 hematologic AE possibly related to avapritinib, or if the given dose exceeded the highest dose determined to be safe in the first-in-human study of avapritinib in patients with GIST (400 mg). Three patients were enrolled initially in each cohort with an additional accrual of three patients if the cohort required expansion due to DLT. Once the escalation cohort was full, up to three additional patients (diagnosis of AdvSM only) could be enrolled into an enrichment cohort at a lower dose. Data from these patients were intended for further exploration of PK, pharmacodynamics and safety in patients with AdvSM.</p>

The study was designed by the sponsor (Blueprint Medicines) and study investigators. The full protocol was approved by the institutional review board (IRB) or independent ethics committee of each participating center: South Central–Berkshire Research Ethics Committee, Bristol; IRB, University of Pennsylvania; Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Office for Human Research Studies; University of Utah IRB; University of Michigan Medical School IRB (IRBMED); The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center IRB; Administrative Panels on Human Subjects in Medical Research, Stanford University (Stanford IRB); Western IRB (WIRB); and the Biomedical Research Alliance of New York (BRANY). The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, International Conference on Harmonization guidelines for Good Clinical Practice and local regulations. All patients provided written informed consent. Participants were not compensated, except for reimbursement of reasonable travel expenses. All authors had access to all data, reviewed and provided critical input to the manuscript and made the decision to submit for publication. All authors vouch for the validity of the study results and adherence to the protocol.</p>
                <p id="Par44">A formal independent data monitoring committee was not used for this study. The sponsor had access to the safety data on a regular basis, as this was an open-label study. The sponsor’s clinical study team hosted investigator teleconferences on a regular basis during the study. During part 1 of the study, the clinical study team and the investigators spoke by teleconference at the end of each treatment cohort to discuss and evaluate all of the gathered safety data. At the dose-escalation teleconference, safety information, including DLTs and all grade 2 or worse AEs reported during C1, and all available PK data were described and reviewed for each patient in the current dose cohort. Updated safety, PK and other data for all other ongoing patients, including data from later cycles, were also discussed. In addition, emerging safety and efficacy data were reviewed by the sponsor at quarterly safety meetings that included the study medical monitor, site personnel and biostatisticians.</p>
                <p id="Par45">In the event a patient was withdrawn from study drug administration or the follow-up phase of the study, the medical monitor was informed. If there was a medical reason for withdrawal, the patient remained under the supervision of the investigator or designee until the condition returned to baseline or stabilized.</p>
                <p id="Par46">Progress reports and notifications of serious unexpected adverse drug reactions were provided to the IRB/independent ethics committee and regulatory authority according to local regulations and guidelines.</p>

                  <p id="Par48">To ensure a consistent diagnosis, retrospective central pathologic review of enrolled patients’ BM aspiration and biopsy samples and peripheral blood smears were assessed by an independent central pathologist. In addition, documentation (including site-entered data, as well as requested de-identified radiology reports and clinic notes) of baseline and historical (if relevant) C-findings were reviewed by the RAC to adjudicate and obtain consensus on SM diagnosis and subtyping based on the sum of available data. Diagnosis and subtyping were performed according to WHO criteria, with the following clarifications: the C-finding of weight loss was defined as documented weight loss of &gt;10% within a 6-month (±3 months) period, and large osteolytic lesions were defined as ≥2 cm. These clarifications and strict requirement for documentation led to locally diagnosed ASM patients being reclassified as having indolent SM or smoldering SM by central diagnosis (based on data available to the RAC) for the purposes of data analysis. The MCL category also included MCL cases with evidence of AHN. The resulting comparison of local and centrally adjudicated diagnoses is presented in Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>.</p>

                <p id="Par50">Eligibility was determined locally during the 56-d screening period. All patients were followed for safety or toxicity (until 30 d after treatment discontinuation) and for survival. The frequency of assessments was per protocol schedule.</p>
                <p id="Par51">The safety population included all enrolled patients and was used to report AEs and PROs (in those who completed the questionnaire). The dose-determining population included all patients in a cohort in part 1 who received ≥21 prescribed avapritinib doses in C1 and completed follow-up through C1, or experienced DLT. The determination of the MTD and RP2D were based on the dose-determining population. The AdvSM safety population comprised all patients exposed to ≥1 dose of avapritinib, who had a diagnosis of AdvSM (ASM, SM-AHN or MCL) as centrally confirmed by the RAC. The AdvSM safety population was also used to report AEs and OS. The primary efficacy (response-evaluable) population included all patients with a centrally confirmed diagnosis of AdvSM (ASM, SM-AHN or MCL) who received ≥1 dose of avapritinib, and had at least one evaluable C-finding at baseline per mIWG-MRT-ECNM criteria as adjudicated by the RAC (MCL did not require baseline C-findings), and sufficient follow-up to be assessed for confirmed response (defined as being on study for at least six 28-d treatment cycles with ≥2 post-baseline BM assessments, or having an end-of-study assessment). The response-evaluable population was used to report adjudicated response rates and PFS. The PK population comprised all patients with sufficient plasma concentration–time data to reliably estimate the PK parameters of avapritinib.</p>
                <p id="Par52">The percentage change from baseline in spleen and liver volume as measured by central radiographic assessment using an MRI or a CT scan was summarized over time in the safety population. In addition, maximum percentage reduction was presented in waterfall plots.</p>
                <p id="Par53">Spleen response was determined for patients with baseline splenomegaly (spleen ≥ 5 cm by palpation) and was assessed by palpation or spleen volume by imaging (that is, ≥35% reduction from baseline in spleen volume based on central imaging); presence of either criterion was considered a response. DOR started at the first evidence of a response in any evaluable C-finding (per mIWG-MRT-ECNM criteria) and ended at the time a response was lost (that is, loss of response per mIWG-MRT-ECNM criteria). For patients who were still responding at the time of analysis, DOR was censored at the latest time point that the patient is assessed as having clinical improvement or better. OS was analyzed in the safety population and was defined as the time from first dose to the time of death due to any cause. PK data were summarized for patients with sufficient plasma concentration–time data. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize PK parameters for each dose level, as appropriate.</p>
                <p id="Par54">No imputation was performed for missing data elements. Where the date of onset of an AE was missing, event onset was assumed to be the date of treatment to conservatively report the event as treatment emergent.</p>

Time to CR/CRh/PR was defined as the time from the start of treatment to the time a CR/CRh/PR by mIWG-MRT-ECNM was first met. DOR was defined as the time from first documented response to the date of first documented progressive disease/loss of response or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. OS was defined as the time from the start of treatment to the date of death. PFS was defined as the time from the start of treatment to the date of first documented progressive disease or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Progressive disease was defined per mIWG-MRT-ECNM criteria as worsening of ≥1 baseline C-finding confirmed for at least 4 weeks, or progression to acute myeloid leukemia.</p>
