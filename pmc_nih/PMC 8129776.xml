                  <p id="P5">In Toronto, Ontario (November 2014 to June 2017), a 20-session, 4-week course of 20 Hz rTMS targeting dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) (90%RMT) was compared to sham stimulation in 16—35 year-olds with ASD (28 male/12 female), without intellectual disability, who had impaired everyday EF performance (n = 20 active/n = 20 sham).

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="P9">Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects 1—2% of the population worldwide [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The majority of individuals diagnosed with ASD, including those without intellectual disability (ID), feature prominent functional impairment and require substantial support [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>–<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Evidence-based treatment options are particularly lacking for 13-30 year-olds with ASD where no intervention has been shown to improve long-term outcomes [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The heterogeneity that is inherent to ASD and the absence of consistent biological markers are key challenges for treatment innovation [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p>
              <p id="P10">Executive functions (EF) are high-order cognitive functions necessary for shifting flexibly from one focus to another (set-shifting), controlling/regulating behavior (response inhibition), and maintaining and manipulating information over a short period of time (working memory) [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. A recent meta-analysis characterized the presence and stability across development of impaired EF performance (with a moderate effect size) in ASD versus age and IQ-matched control groups across multiple domains (e.g., planning, working memory, mental flexibility) [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. As EF performance is a strong predictor of adaptive (everyday) functioning and mental health in ASD [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], interventions that target EF deficits could have a clinically meaningful impact on functional outcomes.</p>
              <p id="P11">Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) involves stimulation of the superficial cortex by a train of magnetic field pulses at typical frequencies between 1 and 20Hz [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Based on favorable safety and efficacy, high frequency rTMS to left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is an approved treatment for depression [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Improvement on secondary neuropsychological outcomes in efficacy studies for depression has sparked interest in developing TMS interventions for cognition [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. A meta-analysis examining studies that included adults with depression, schizophrenia, Alzheimer’s dementia or unimpaired controls, indicated that protocols using repeated sessions of high frequency rTMS to DLPFC were most promising for improvement of EF outcomes [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Preliminary RCTs (n = 17—36) exploring rTMS effects on specific domains have shown improved verbal memory recall [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], facial affect recognition [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and working memory [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] in participants with chronic schizophrenia following active rTMS to DLPFC versus sham stimulation with large effect sizes reported [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p>
              <p id="P12">Several smaller studies provide preliminary support for the feasibility and acceptability of rTMS as an intervention for individuals with ASD [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Two open-label studies (n = 40 and 54, respectively) showed improved performance on a selective attention task following 12—18 weeks of once-weekly, 1 Hz rTMS delivered at 90% resting motor threshold (RMT), stimulating left-only or bilateral DLPFC in 9—21 year-olds with ASD without ID, compared to a waitlist control group [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Only one controlled study of daily rTMS sessions has been published in ASD [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. That RCT showed a reduction in self-reported social relating symptoms measured on the Ritvo Autism-Asperger Diagnostic Scale in adults with ASD that received two weeks of weekday 5 Hz rTMS at 90% RMT to bilateral dorsomedial prefrontal cortex versus sham stimulation (n = 28). No study that we are aware of has examined whether rTMS can enhance EF in persons with ASD [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p>
              <p id="P13">The fronto-parietal network (comprised of DLPFC, and parietal cortex along the intraparietal sulcus) is hypothesized to support engagement and flexible integration of distributed brain networks, supporting high-order cognitive ability, including EF [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. A number of neuroimaging studies have found evidence of altered functional MRI-measured DLPFC activation or altered distributed frontoparietal network connectivity during spatial working memory (SWM) performance in children [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] or adults with ASD versus controls [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>–<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Children and adults with ASD commonly have impaired SWM performance [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and these deficits have been linked to adaptive functioning [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Hence, the DLPFC may be a promising biological target for modifying SWM performance in autism through augmentation of local activation or frontoparietal connectivity with the potential for impact on everyday functioning.</p>
              <p id="P14">In this pilot RCT, we administered the same high frequency rTMS protocol targeting bilateral DLPFC demonstrated to be safe, feasibly implemented and shown to improve working memory deficits in individuals with chronic schizophrenia [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], in a group of autistic youth and young adults. Individuals with ASD are often treated with medications similar to those used in schizophrenia (e.g., antipsychotics, antidepressants) and similar cognitive and functional impairments have been found across young adults with either primary clinical diagnosis [<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Parameters selected (i.e., intensity, frequency, duration) were also based on previously published data demonstrating neurophysiological changes to the cortex in control participants [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and in line with intensity used in previously published rTMS trials in ASD. Our primary objectives were to: (i) investigate the feasibility and acceptability of conducting a future definitive trial of rTMS for EF deficits in ASD based on recruitment, retention, adverse events, and (ii) examine for preliminary evidence of efficacy of rTMS on EF performance. Given the heterogeneity inherent to ASD, we anticipated that certain variables might influence efficacy of rTMS. Exploratory sub-group analyses were conducted to examine the moderating effects of baseline adaptive functioning and gender.</p>

While mean standard score on the VABS-II Adaptive Behavior Composite was more than two standard deviations below mean IQ score across the sample, within-subject scores ranged considerably (score range = 43—104, categorized as low to adequate functioning). A total of 9/40 (~23%) clinical trial participants had clinically significant attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which was defined as being treated with a stimulant medication at the time of trial participation.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="P30">The current pilot trial is the first to examine the feasibility, acceptability and clinical effects of rTMS for EF deficits in an autism sample. Our pilot study demonstrated good feasibility and acceptability of a 20-session course of 20 Hz rTMS to DLPFC applied to youth and young adults with ASD. We did not find preliminary evidence for efficacy for active vs. sham rTMS in relation to improving EF performance across the sample. A small effect (effect size = 0.28) favoring active compared to sham rTMS on BRIEF-MCI score is potentially clinically relevant. We were powered to detect a moderate to large effect size, somewhat limiting our ability to detect significant effects of this size. Our exploratory analyses implied that baseline adaptive functioning and gender possibly moderated effects of rTMS treatment on EF performance outcomes. Such exploration of clinical effects in our pilot RCT enables evaluation of a number of aspects of our clinical trial design for planning future efficacy studies.</p>
              <p id="P31">In relation to our aim to determine feasibility and acceptability of our protocol targeting EF deficits, we completed our pilot RCT in 2.5 years with outcomes exceeding <italic>a priori</italic> thresholds for determining favorable feasibility/acceptability of the implemented protocol. As far as we are aware, only one published double-blind pilot RCT examining rTMS effects in ASD is available [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Adverse events in that trial were mild and transient. In our trial, no drop-out was due to adverse events and events experienced were transient, with mild-to-moderate severity. These results are consistent with safety findings from over 40 clinical trials and 15 meta-analyses examining rTMS as a treatment intervention for a variety of patient populations [<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], the majority of these testing high-frequency rTMS to DLPFC to modulate cortical excitability [<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Therefore, one of the key findings from the current pilot trial is that repeated sessions of high-frequency rTMS to DLPFC in youth and young adults with ASD has a similar, favorable safety profile as in other psychiatric populations.</p>
              <p id="P32">In relation to our examination for preliminary efficacy of rTMS for EF deficits in autism, no effect of rTMS on CANTAB SWM performance was seen. Of note, our ability to detect differences in performance following active versus sham stimulation was diminished by improved EF performance found over time across the trial sample. Similar practice/learning effects have been found on prior small positive rTMS studies for cognitive deficits in schizophrenia [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. A small effect favoring active over sham rTMS on mean change in BRIEF-MCI was found. Although additional research is needed to define a minimum clinically important difference (MCID) on the BRIEF, given that the BRIEF measures EF performance in everyday settings, any change could be clinically meaningful [<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Evaluation of the 95% confidence interval for the effects estimate of rTMS on BRIEF-MCI in the current study indicates that possible mean change difference may range from a two-point worsening to a seven-point improvement between active versus sham rTMS in individuals with ASD. Given the confidence interval found, it is not evident that an adequately powered large-scale trial using the same protocol would detect a clinically meaningful difference between groups favoring active treatment on the BRIEF [<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Nonetheless, the upper limit of the confidence interval suggests that further development of rTMS targeting EF deficits in ASD is warranted.</p>
              <p id="P33">Here, we used the same stimulation protocol as the prior positive pilot RCT that found a large effect of active over sham rTMS on working memory in persons with schizophrenia [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. An important difference between the prior trial in schizophrenia and the current study is that baseline cognitive deficit on a neuropsychological battery was incorporated as part of the previous trial’s entry criterion. Variable EF impairment and ceiling effects in our ASD sample, in addition to the presence of practice effects, may all contribute to a diminished ability to detect rTMS effects on EF performance. Although large-scale clinical trials of direct effects of rTMS on cognition have yet to be published, one larger study (n = 77 active/79 sham) failed to find significant active over sham rTMS to DLPFC effects on secondary EF outcomes in persons with schizophrenia and prominent negative symptoms [<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. In that study, practice effects across groups were postulated as one factor contributing to the lack of active-sham group difference on EF performance. Interestingly, age, duration and severity of illness also ranged broadly in the larger-scale rTMS study in schizophrenia (50), while participant samples may have been more severely impaired overall (i.e. older age, longer duration of illness, inpatients only) in prior smaller studies finding positive rTMS effects on cognitive outcomes [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>–<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].</p>
              <p id="P34">Although clinically significant functional impairment in social, occupational or other important areas is part of the diagnostic criteria for ASD, severity of functional impairment varies widely across the autism spectrum [<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. As in the general ASD literature [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], a significant gap between IQ and baseline adaptive functioning was found in our sample, but baseline functional ability ranged from low to adequate. We anticipated that individuals with greater baseline functional impairment may exhibit more impaired EF performance and might respond more to active rTMS, relative to participants with higher baseline functioning. Indeed, baseline adaptive functioning may have influenced the clinical effect of rTMS in our sample, as our exploratory analysis revealed a small favorable effect of rTMS on EF performance in participants with lower baseline adaptive functioning. It may be that when functional impairment is more pronounced, there is more room for improvement, pointing to features of an ASD subgroup where the beneficial effect of active rTMS on EF performance may be stronger and perhaps more clinically meaningful. Adaptive functioning has recently been linked to white matter microstructure in children and youth with ASD, where lower functioning predicted reduced fractional anisotropy<sup>_ENREF_</sup>[<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] [<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. This relationship extended to a number of major white matter tracts, including the corpus callosum, connecting homologous DLPFC regions. Functional connectivity of the frontoparietal control network (including the DLPFC) was also found to predict change in adaptive functioning over time in a sample of young people with ASD of similar age and functional level as those in our study [<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Although speculative, more pronounced alterations at the brain level, involving the DLPFC, may contribute to both EF and general functional impairments.</p>
              <p id="P35">Interpretation of the influence of gender on clinical effects of rTMS in our study is limited by the small subset of our sample that was female (n = 6/group). Baseline adaptive functioning did not differ between males and females in our sample. However, interpreting the improved effect in females compared to males is complicated by numerically worse baseline EF performance in ASD females compared to males that may have reduced ceiling effects overall, revealing stronger clinical effects of active over sham treatment in a more impaired sample, regardless of gender. Nevertheless, the behavioral presentation of ASD and related cognitive (including EF) characteristics differ in part in females vs. males [<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] and etiological or neurobiological alterations may vary by sex [<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], implying the need for future intervention research to consider sex/gender-stratified approaches. A prior study in schizophrenia also found improved rTMS response on cognitive outcomes in females versus males, though worse baseline performance in females complicated interpretation of this effect as well [<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>].</p>
              <p id="P36">Additional considerations for future efficacy study planning include evaluation of: different EF outcome measures that may be less susceptible to practice effects [<xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], whether the current trial was under-dosed in terms of the intensity and number of pulses per session for targeting cognitive outcomes and the use of an active/sham coil for improved blinding of treatment allocation. Our pilot trial was not powered to determine efficacy and findings from our moderator analyses would not survive stringent multiple comparison correction. Moderator analyses are presented as exploratory to help guide refinement of the approach used for future research. Future research in this area should account for the common presence of co-occurring ADHD in ASD [<xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] and treatment with medications with the potential to influence EF abilities.</p>
              <p id="P37">In conclusion, the current pilot, double-blind RCT demonstrates for the first time that repeated sessions of high frequency rTMS is feasible and well tolerated in youth and young adults with ASD and a rigorous clinical trial design can be implemented to study the effects of rTMS in this population. The favorable profile of rTMS highlights the clear opportunity to harness this biological tool for developing targeted treatments that may improve clinical symptoms and functioning in people with ASD. However, the clinical and biological heterogeneity of ASD continues to be a challenge to be overcome. Our findings suggest that any further development of rTMS intervention research in ASD will benefit from careful consideration of which regions of the brain should be targeted, using what stimulation parameters and dosing, for what indication, and in which well-defined clinical subgroup. Our results indicate that a future efficacy trial of rTMS to DLPFC on EF deficits in ASD is warranted in the subgroup of individuals without ID that feature prominent impairment in EF ability and adaptive functioning.</p>
