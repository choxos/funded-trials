                <title>PURPOSE</title>
                <p>Therapeutically actionable molecular alterations are widely distributed across cancer types. The National Cancer Institute Molecular Analysis for Therapy Choice (NCI-MATCH) trial was designed to evaluate targeted therapy antitumor activity in underexplored cancer types. Tumor biopsy specimens were analyzed centrally with next-generation sequencing (NGS) in a master screening protocol. Patients with a tumor molecular alteration addressed by a targeted treatment lacking established efficacy in that tumor type were assigned to 1 of 30 treatments in parallel, single-arm, phase II subprotocols.</p>
                <sec>
                  <title>PATIENTS AND METHODS</title>
                  <p>Tumor biopsy specimens from 5,954 patients with refractory malignancies at 1,117 accrual sites were analyzed centrally with NGS and selected immunohistochemistry in a master screening protocol. The treatment-assignment rate to treatment arms was assessed. Molecular alterations in seven tumors profiled in both NCI-MATCH trial and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) of primary tumors were compared.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>RESULTS</title>
                  <p>Molecular profiling was successful in 93.0% of specimens. An actionable alteration was found in 37.6%. After applying clinical and molecular exclusion criteria, 17.8% were assigned (26.4% could have been assigned if all subprotocols were available simultaneously). Eleven subprotocols reached their accrual goal as of this report. Actionability rates differed among histologies (eg, &gt; 35% for urothelial cancers and &lt; 6% for pancreatic and small-cell lung cancer). Multiple actionable or resistance-conferring tumor mutations were seen in 11.9% and 71.3% of specimens, respectively. Known resistance mutations to targeted therapies were numerically more frequent in NCI-MATCH than TCGA tumors, but not markedly so.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>CONCLUSION</title>
                  <p>We demonstrated feasibility of screening large numbers of patients at numerous accruing sites in a complex trial to test investigational therapies for moderately frequent molecular targets. Co-occurring resistance mutations were common and endorse investigation of combination targeted-therapy regimens.</p>

              <p>The National Cancer Institute–Molecular Analysis for Therapy Choice (NCI-MATCH) trial was the first national-scale trial in the United States incorporating centralized diagnostic testing and geographically distributed clinical investigation of dozens of treatment options in parallel. We hypothesized that this platform would provide the most expedient approach to understanding the homogeneity or heterogeneity of response across oncogene and targeted-therapy pairs. We investigated treatments that had shown clear evidence of clinical benefit or at least promising preliminary efficacy in the proposed eligibility genotype in any tumor histology. We describe the frequency with which actionable genetic alterations occurred in a US population of 5,954 patients with advanced refractory cancer.</p>

                <p>Of 6,391 registered patients, 5,954 submitted a tumor specimen. Of these, 4,629 patients had a biopsy performed specifically for NCI-MATCH screening, 1,211 had an archived specimen from prior tumor biopsy or excision, and source of tissue was unknown for 121 patients. Adverse consequences of the screening biopsy were assessed within 30 days after the biopsy (Data Supplement). Of 4,627 patients with data, 26 (0.6%) and seven (0.2%) experienced grade 3 and 4 events, respectively. No deaths were related to the biopsy procedure. Of the 5,954 samples submitted, 5,540 (93.0%) were sequenced successfully. Molecular testing could not be performed on some tumors for a variety of different reasons. Absence of or insufficient amount of tumor in the specimen and/or presence of only necrotic tumor explained the vast majority. The median and 75th percentile times from receipt of samples to return of results were 16 days and 23 days, respectively.</p>

                <p>The subprotocols available at some time during the screening portion of the trial are summarized in the Data Supplement. Molecular alterations for assignment to an NCI-MATCH subprotocol were present in 37.6% of patients (Data Supplement). When molecular, prior treatment, and specific cancer exclusions were accounted for, the match rate was 26.4%. Lack of subprotocol availability, because the subprotocol had reached accrual or because of the limit on certain histologic types was reached, led to a treatment assignment rate of 17.8% (n = 985 of 5,540; 95% CI, 16.8 to 18.8).</p>
                <p>Assignment rates for NSCLC, colorectal, breast, and prostate cancer were 17.4%, 13.7%, 17.8%, and 23.0%, respectively (Table <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Assignment rates &gt; 25% were found in patients with CNS cancer (37.2%), urothelial cancer (36.0%), cholangiocarcinoma pancreaticobiliary (25.9%), cervical cancer (28.4%), gastroesophageal cancer (27.8%), melanoma (26.3%), uterine cancer (26.2%), and anal cancer (25.5%). Conversely, assignment rates were low in patients with pancreatic cancer (5.8%), small-cell lung cancer (5.1%), and lymphoma (5.0%; Table <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).</p>
                <p>Seventy percent of assigned patients received treatment on a subprotocol. Eleven of 30 subprotocols reached the accrual goal of at least 31 eligible patients. No subprotocol whose targeted alteration had a prevalence of &lt; 1.5% reached the accrual goal in this phase of the trial (18 subprotocols).</p>

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>To our knowledge, NCI-MATCH represents the first attempt to establish the likelihood of identifying targeted investigational therapeutic options within a clinical trial cohort representative of the population of patients with advanced refractory cancer. We demonstrated the feasibility of nationwide accrual of patients with successful biopsy at local facilities, a high rate of technical success using a specific NGS platform addressing most of the relevant molecular alterations found in cancers, timely return of results, and, if eligible, protocol treatment. A stringent definition of actionable molecular alterations for which promising investigational agents existed was developed and 37.8% of patients had an actionable alteration in their tumor, similar to an analysis of a large sample of patients from individual major academic medical centers.<sup><xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> When exclusion criteria were applied to this broad population with advanced cancer, for whom ≤ 30 treatment subprotocols were available, the assignment rate was 17.8%.</p>
              <p>Specificity of the NGS assay was prioritized, and minimum variant allele and copy number values were put into place to optimize that feature. The assay reported on a finite gene list that was fit for purpose to identify targets for the agents selected for the trial and was deemed more than adequate to support required inclusionary actionable variants as well as exclusionary variants required for the trial. Resulting limitations include the limited number of and breadth of coverage of genes, which reduced the potential to characterize off-target pathways of effects or resistance. Fusions were detected by sequencing RNA of known and previously reported fusions; the assay was not capable of detection of novel fusion variants. The lower rate of severe complications from the required screening tumor biopsy procedures (&lt; 1% grade 3 or 4 events; no fatal complications) was achieved by providing guidelines directed to interventional radiologists in the protocol and a scoring system to qualify metastatic lesion by location, size, and radiographic features as predicted safe sites for core needle biopsy (Data Supplement).</p>
              <p>The match rate varied widely across tumor types. More than 25% of patients with cholangiocarcinoma, melanoma, and cancers of the prostate, uterus, gastroesophageal junction, urothelium, CNS, or cervix matched to a treatment. By contrast, only 5.8% of those with pancreatic cancer did, reflecting the lack of targeted treatments for the common mutations in this group of patients. Among the tumor profiles we compared with those in TCGA, cholangiocarcinoma stands out as a tumor type with the most actionable alterations. Given that standard treatments for this tumor are few, exploration of targeted treatments in multiarm master protocols may aid development of more effective treatment of this group of patients with poor prognosis.</p>
              <p>NCI-MATCH differs from other recently reported NGS-guided clinical trials in several respects. Some studies have focused on exploring targeted agents approved in at least one tumor type across other cancer types when routine clinical NGS testing identifies such patients.<sup><xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Single-center trials have generally used molecular tumor boards to adjudicate the off-label use of approved agents or triaging to available clinical trials, with widely varying rates of treatment assignment.<sup><xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> The largest reported multicenter trial sought to evaluate the benefit of offering therapies based on characterization of hormone receptor expression and genetic alteration in the PI3 kinase and MAP kinase pathways compared with physicians’ choice of therapy. Forty percent of patients were assigned to one of 10 available treatment regimens on the experimental arm (n = 293 of 741 patients).<sup><xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> To our knowledge, NCI-MATCH is the only trial that used uniform, centralized molecular testing and a rules algorithm to assign treatments systematically based on predetermined molecular eligibility, rather than a tumor board. Unlike other studies evaluating the clinical utility of NGS, NCI-MATCH was designed to investigate both approved and investigational agents broadly across cancer types, beyond established biomarker-defined indications.</p>
              <p>Most of the actionable alterations in NCI-MATCH occurred at frequencies of &lt; 5%, consistent with other analyses.<sup><xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> The striking responses occasionally observed with drugs targeting rare mutations such as <italic toggle="yes">NTRK</italic> fusions motivate broad screening across cancer types, but the logistics of conducting research in these populations in a single trial are daunting. The investigation of novel therapies in less common molecular subgroups is made more efficient by investigating many therapies in parallel in an NGS-guided platform trial. For alteration frequencies &lt; 1.5%, however, a much larger screening population is needed to identify enough patients to enroll a typical, single-arm, phase II trial cohort. For these molecular subgroups, we have now used external academic and commercial sequencing platforms that are being used in routine practice, to continue accrual in NCI-MATCH, and will confirm the outside NGS result with the NCI-MATCH assays.</p>
              <p>The requirement for fresh tumor biopsy specimens was driven by the desire to have an accurate assessment of tumor somatic genetic make-up at the time of study entry. This is not necessary for the purpose of detecting founder or truncal mutations that are present in all tumor cells but was considered important for the purpose of identifying additional genetic changes that manifest during tumor evolution and are enriched under selective pressure of other therapies.</p>
              <p>Among those tumors with an actionable alteration and available investigational agent in NCI-MATCH, co-occurring alterations in genes with evidence that they mediate resistance in other settings (ie, <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">KRAS</italic>, or <italic toggle="yes">APC</italic>) or that activate potentially competing survival pathways were common. At the time NCI-MATCH was designed, these co-alterations lacked evidence of degradation of response to the specific targeted therapies and did not preclude treatment assignment to many of the subprotocols. For patients with <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">APC</italic> mutations (62% harbored at least one of these alterations), indirect therapeutic strategies are needed to address the consequences of loss of function in these critical tumor-suppressor mechanisms.<sup><xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Although we have not yet compared the NCI-MATCH specimens with the patients’ primary tumors, the available data from TCGA and NCI-MATCH suggest there is not substantial evolution in the genetic features from primary to metastatic cancers. Furthermore, surprisingly, cytotoxic chemotherapy does not significantly alter the genomic landscape. Pending the results of ongoing whole-exome sequencing of patients who were assigned to treatment subprotocols, we cannot yet conclude whether important information is gained from tumor biopsy specimens at baseline versus sequencing of archival tumor specimens. Therapies that place significant selective pressure (eg, hormonal therapy for prostate and breast cancer; EGFR inhibitors in <italic toggle="yes">EGFR</italic>-mutated NSCLC) do produce clear, pathway-convergent resistance mutations.</p>
              <p>Our findings support the feasibility and efficiency of using NGS to triage patients to investigational therapy, provided that a sufficiently large pool of agents is made available. The molecular landscape of a population of patients with relapsed, refractory advanced cancer strongly endorses a shift to investigation of combination targeted-therapy regimens in such genetically complex tumors, most notably those harboring multiple actionable alterations.</p>
