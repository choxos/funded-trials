                <title>Background:</title>
                <p>Voluntary medical male circumcisions (MCs) are safe: the majority of men heal without complication. However, guidelines require multiple follow-up visits. In Zimbabwe, where there is high mobile phone ownership, severe health care worker shortages, and rapid MC scale up intersect, we tested a 2-way texting (2wT) intervention to reduce provider workload while safeguarding patient safety.</p>
                <sec>
                  <title>Setting:</title>
                  <p>Two high-volume facilities providing MC near Harare, Zimbabwe.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods:</title>
                  <p>A prospective, unblinded, noninferiority, randomized control trial of 722 adult MC clients with cell phones randomized 1:1. 2wT clients (n = 362) responded to a daily text with in-person follow-up only if desired or an adverse event (AE) was suspected. The control group (n = 359) received routine in-person visits. All men were asked to return on postoperative day 14 for review. AEs at â¤day 14 visit and the number of in-person visits were compared between the groups.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results:</title>
                  <p>Cumulative AEs were identified in 0.84% [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.28 to 2.43] among routine care men as compared with 1.88% (95% CI: 0.86 to 4.03) of 2wT participants. Noninferiority cannot be ruled out (95% CI: ââ to +2.72); however, AE rates did not differ between the groups (<italic>P</italic> = 0.32). 2wT men attended an average of 0.30 visits as compared with 1.69 visits among routine care men, a significant reduction (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001).</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions:</title>
                  <p>Although noninferiority cannot be demonstrated, increased AEs in the 2wT arm likely reflect improved AE ascertainment. 2wT serves as a proxy for active surveillance, improving the quality of MC patient care. 2wT also reduced provider workload. 2wT provides an option for men to heal safely at home, returning to care when desired or if complications arise. 2wT should be further tested to enable widespread scale-up.</p>

              <p>After clinical trials found that male circumcision (MC) reduced the risk of female-to-male HIV-1 transmission by up to 60%,<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> nearly 19 million voluntary medical MC procedures were performed across 14 African countries.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> MC in sub-Saharan Africa is safe and effective<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>: an adverse event (AE) rate of 2% combined moderate and severe AEs is considered acceptable as a global standard for MC safety.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> In southern African, the average rate of reported moderate and severe AEs is approximately 0.8% (range: 0.4%â4.2%)<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>: 99% of men likely heal without complication. In 2016, the United Nations set an annual target of 5 million MCs.<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> However, these MC expansion efforts focus on countries with severe health care worker shortages,<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> threatening already overburdened health care systems. As MC typically includes 1 or more follow-up visits within 14 days,<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> overstretched clinic staff may spend invaluable time conducting unnecessary reviews for MC clients without complications. This inefficiency negatively impacts MC clients too: men may needlessly pay for transport, miss work, and wait for unnecessary reviews.</p>
              <p>Zimbabwe has high mobile phone ownership,<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> severe health care worker shortages,<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> and rapid scale up of MC,<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> making it an ideal location to test a mobile health (mHealth) intervention to reduce workload while safeguarding patient safety. Since 2013, the University of Washington's International Training and Education Center for Health (I-TECH) and its ZAZIC consortium, comprised of 3 local implementing organizations, has implemented a large-scale MC program in partnership with the Zimbabwe Ministry of Health and Child Care (MoHCC), conducting approximately 100,000 MCs annually among men aged 10 years and above with a reported AE rate of 0.4%.<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> ZAZIC MCs are performed predominantly by MoHCC clinicians, with roving support from ZAZIC clinical teams, as part of routine care. In ZAZIC sites, more than 95% of MC clients reportedly return for 2- and 7-day postoperative visits, each requiring reception, record updating, waiting, and examination. In 2017 alone, ZAZIC health care workers likely conducted up to 200,000 multistage MC reviews for men healing without complication. In ZAZIC outreach sites (outside the central health care facility), these reviews likely required multiple, multihour trips away from other routine duties.</p>
              <p>In this context, we hypothesized that 2-way texting (2wT) using bidirectional, interactive, text-based short message service (SMS) during the initial, and most critical, 13 days after circumcision would be similar to routine, in-person follow-up for patient safety and would reduce unnecessary follow-up. Our randomized control trial had 3 aims<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>: (1) determine if 2-way texting (2wT) can safely reduce MC follow-up visits; (2) estimate the cost savings associated with 2wT over routine MC follow-up; and (3) assess the acceptability and feasibility of 2wT for further scale-up. If successful, 2wT would reduce provider workload and patient burden while maintaining the quality of care. This article presents the results of aim 1.</p>

                  <p>2wT men received all routine MC services (Table <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). In addition to the 5-minute, routine, postoperative care, 2wT men received an additional 10 minutes of counseling: 5 minutes on incoming texts (how to respond and ask questions) and 5 minutes on bandage removal, wound care, and AE recognition using a photo flip book showing signs of common mild or moderate AEs. Intervention men were then registered in a custom 2wT software application built using the open source Community Health Toolkit (see example app built using the Toolkit, Figure 1, Supplemental Digital Content, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://links.lww.com/QAI/B386">http://links.lww.com/QAI/B386</ext-link>). 2wT clients received automated daily texts from days 1 to 13 in either English or Shona; responses were in either language. If they responded without suspicion of complication, no immediate action followed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). If a 2wT client responded affirmatively to any daily text with suspicion of complication, the 2wT MC nurse exchanged modifiable, scripted texts with them to determine the symptoms, frequency, and severity. Then, if deemed necessary, the client was asked to return to clinic the following day or earlier if an emergency was suspected. If 2wT patients did not respond to texts on day 2 or day 7, MoHCC tracing was activated. 2wT men were asked to return for study-specific, day-14 follow-up to review healing and verify AEs. Study-specific day-14 tracing was conducted only if there had been no client contact by day 14. Day 14 was chosen for verification because 95% of AEs within ZAZIC's MC program are reported by day 14.<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> The day 14 review was conducted by routine MC providers according to MoHCC review guidelines.

                <p>The primary safety outcome was cumulative AE rate (moderate or severe) at â¤day 14 visit. The rates were calculated per arm as follows: (# moderate + severe AEs)/(total # who attended day 2, 7, or 14 follow-up visit). The primary workload outcome was mean follow-up visits calculated as the average number of in-person visits, not including day 14 study-specific visit. Secondary outcomes included the following: AE rates identified at day-14 visit (#AEs on day 14 visit/total # who attended day-14 follow-up visit); texting response rate; time between 2wT potential AE text and follow-up; severity of AEs. The visit date variables included the following ranges: day-2 visit included visits on days 1â4; day-7 visit included visits on days 5â10; day-14 visit include days 11â24. For day-14 visit, this range was determined to allow for minimal client delay and as a previous ZAZIC study indicated that 99% of all AEs occur on or before this postoperative day.<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup></p>
                <p>To assess AE- and visit-related outcomes, all participants gave permission to use routine MC data; routine variables of interest were entered in an online database using Medic Mobile software and verified through paper and online data checks. For secondary outcomes, data on text responses and time from potential AE text and follow-up actions were ascertained from the study-specific, Medic Mobile database.</p>

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>Although MC follow-up via 2-way SMS between patients and providers could not be definitively shown to be noninferior, 2wT should be considered safe. 2wT identified more AEs (1.88%) than those observed in routine care (0.84%) and still falls below the globally accepted standard for MC safety of 2% AEs. Increased AE ascertainment via 2wT is consistent with improved quality of care. 2wT is also demonstrably noninferior when assessing both arms in the same way at the same time. At the day-14, in-person visit, there were no incident AEs among 2wT men and 1 incident AE among routine; there was no surplus of unidentified AEs within the texting group. The study also demonstrated reduced visit workload as compared with MC follow-up with scheduled in-person visits. By using 2-way SMS to identify men who needed or desired in-person review, 2wT enabled men without concerns to heal independently, reducing burdens on providers and patients. This follow-up method was provided largely within routine MC service delivery, suggesting advantages for MC scale-up and sustainability in the region. There are several lessons learned for replication of this follow-up approach.</p>
              <p>2wT likely serves as a proxy for active surveillance of AEs, improving the quality of patient care. Recent active surveillance conducted by ZAZIC in both rural and periurban sites in Zimbabwe found average AE rates of 4.6%, ranging from 1% to 8%.<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> Therefore, we believe that the increased rate of identified AEs within the texting arm reflects improved AE ascertainment and not a true increase in AEs. Moreover, daily SMS responses from participants likely helped increase AE identification by encouraging clients to seek care when complications were suspected and by encouraging improved AE documentation. Active surveillance efforts typically lead to increases in reported AE rates: evidence from resource-intensive, patient-tracing efforts in large-scale MC programs in Kenya found AE rates of between 4% and 18%,<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> higher than global AE averages. Improved AE ascertainment via 2wT was not based on active tracing but on daily reminders for men with identified concerns to return for review. Therefore, 2wT may provide a less intensive, but effective alternative, for improved surveillance efforts. In turn, this increases identification and management of AEs within a routine MC setting, a benefit for client safety.</p>
              <p>The increased ascertainment of AEs may also be the result of enhanced postoperative counseling and daily follow-up, critical components of the 2wT intervention. The daily, SMS-based nurse-to-client communication throughout the period of highest risk for AEs affirmed the counseling messages and provided client reassurance. The augmented counseling also likely raised healing vigilance by providing men with bandage removal instructions, information on wound care, and photographic examples of early-stage complications. When prompted by the daily texts, men were likely better prepared to observe their wound, recognize early complication signs, and report findings via SMS. For those concerned, subsequent nurse interaction via SMS- or phone-based counseling offered reassurance and, if needed, encouraged 2wT men to return promptly for in-person visit on any postoperative day. The daily interaction provided to clients by 2wT also strengthened the continuum of care, improving MC program quality.</p>
              <p>In theory, 2wT-based daily interactions could affect AE rates in either direction (see Table 2, Supplemental Digital Content, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://links.lww.com/QAI/B386">http://links.lww.com/QAI/B386</ext-link>: Type, timing, and severity of AEs). 2wT could reduce AEs by catching and managing mild AEs early, preventing some reportable moderate or severe infections. Of 9 mild AEs, 7 (78%) were among texting men between days 3 and 14 (see Table 2, Supplemental Digital Content, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://links.lww.com/QAI/B386">http://links.lww.com/QAI/B386</ext-link>: Type, timing, and severity of AEs), suggesting that 2wT may encourage timely treatment. Alternatively, triaging by SMS or phone could lead to late diagnosis resulting from false reassurance and delayed care seeking. However, delays most likely increase infection severity<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>; with no severe infections in the texting group, it appears that 2wT encouraged prompt care seeking, and delays in diagnosis were unlikely to be clinically significant. In the texting group, 2 severe and 1 moderate bleeding were identified. In both severe cases, the men texted but returned before waiting for a response, indicating understanding of the instructions to return swiftly in an emergency. The client with moderate bleeding texted and returned after brief exchange with the nurse. Three 2wT men with moderate infections texted with a potential AE and returned in-person after receiving counsel from the 2wT nurse.</p>
              <p>This study has several limitations. First, increased AE ascertainment in the texting arm was anticipated and considered a sign of quality care. However, selection of the 1.6% noninferiority margin was based on 0.4% AE rate from passive surveillance in Zimbabwe,<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> a rate that reflects sizeable AE underreporting,<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> muddling evidence for 2wT noninferiority. Second, the daily SMS reminder was intended to raise awareness of potential complications and encourage care seeking, likely leading to more AE identification. Third, AEs could be underreported: men could seek care for AEs at another clinic and outcomes among men without follow-up visit are unknown. Fourth, although day-2 attendance among routine men for bandage removal was high, attendance at the day-7 visit was 65%, reaffirming previous evidence on suboptimal attendance at routine visits.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> As moderate infections were found among texting men on days 4,7, and 11, it is possible that routine group AEs were undetected during this period and resolved on their own. Fifth, the time between potential AE texts and follow-up visits could not be determined for multiple reasons, including clients sending subsequent âno AEâ after âpotential AEâ texts; interactive messages resolving complications; and client decision to return for an in-person visit spontaneously. Finally, results could vary in other settings. Despite these limitations, we believe that the strength of these findings is indicative of the potential benefits for 2wT to improve the quality of care in routine MC settings.</p>

              <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
              <p>Although the study could not demonstrate conclusively that SMS was noninferior, 2wT appears safe for patients. 2wT ascertained and reported more AEs than routine care, suggesting that this follow-up method approximates active surveillance, improving the quality of patient care. Increased AE ascertainment was also likely attributable to improved counseling: texting men also were empowered to observe their healing and report potential complications promptly. In addition, 2-way SMS appeared to reduce the visit workload for providers and patients while maintaining quality care. For providers, reduced in-person follow-up could free health care workers to perform other duties, including additional MC surgeries. For patients, fewer visits could decrease patient costs, both economic and social, reducing a barrier to MC uptake. Implementation of 2wT within an existing MoHCC MC program structure increases the likelihood of program scalability and sustainability. As the rate of unnecessary, in-person care in both Zimbabwe and other regional MC programs is likely high, and potential gains in efficiency are large. Future research is needed to further test 2wT in diverse field (rural, urban) and patient (device-based, guardians of minor clients) contexts to better inform 2wT adaptation and replication for scale.</p>
