              <abstract>
                <p>Vaccine-induced HIV antibodies were evaluated in serum samples collected from healthy Tanzanian volunteers participating in a phase I/II placebo-controlled double blind trial using multi-clade, multigene HIV-DNA priming and recombinant modified vaccinia Ankara (HIV-MVA) virus boosting (HIVIS03). The HIV-DNA vaccine contained plasmids expressing HIV-1 gp160 subtypes A, B, C, Rev B, Gag A, B and RTmut B, and the recombinant HIV-MVA boost expressed CRF01_AE HIV-1 Env subtype E and Gag-Pol subtype A. While no neutralizing antibodies were detected using pseudoviruses in the TZM-bl cell assay, this prime-boost vaccination induced neutralizing antibodies in 83% of HIVIS03 vaccinees when a peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) assay using luciferase reporter-infectious molecular clones (LucR-IMC) was employed. The serum neutralizing activity was significantly (but not completely) reduced upon depletion of natural killer (NK) cells from PBMC (p=0.006), indicating a role for antibody-mediated FcŒ≥-receptor function. High levels of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC)-mediating antibodies against CRF01_AE and/or subtype B were subsequently demonstrated in 97% of the sera of vaccinees. The magnitude of ADCC-mediating antibodies against CM235 CRF01_AE IMC-infected cells correlated with neutralizing antibodies against CM235 in the IMC/PBMC assay. In conclusion, HIV-DNA priming, followed by two HIV-MVA boosts elicited potent ADCC responses in a high proportion of Tanzanian vaccinees. Our findings highlight the potential of HIV-DNA prime HIV-MVA boost vaccines for induction of functional antibody responses and suggest this vaccine regimen and ADCC studies as potentially important new avenues in HIV vaccine development.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>There is considerable evidence that neutralizing antibodies are important to protect from HIV-1 infection. In fact, passive immunization studies using HIV-1 neutralizing polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies against HIV-1, HIV-2, SIV or SHIV have been shown to provide various degrees of protective efficacies in primates [<xref rid="pone.0118486.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. HIV-specific monoclonal antibodies infused intravenously to macaques have been shown to protect against intravenous and mucosal chimeric SHIV challenge [<xref rid="pone.0118486.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0118486.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0118486.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0118486.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Neutralizing antibodies block HIV entry by recognizing epitopes on the envelope spike critical for their interaction with receptors and co-receptors, and/or play a role in the fusion process [<xref rid="pone.0118486.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, developing an effective HIV vaccine that elicits neutralizing antibodies against a wide range of primary HIV isolates remains a significant challenge [<xref rid="pone.0118486.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p>
              <p>Recently, antibodies with functional properties other than the classical cell-free virus neutralizing activity are being considered as potentially protective against HIV-1 [<xref rid="pone.0118486.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Non-neutralizing antibodies have the ability to control HIV infection by binding to Fc receptors mediating anti-HIV activities, including antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent cell-mediated viral inhibition (ADCVI) [<xref rid="pone.0118486.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. These activities are primarily mediated by Fc-Œ≥ receptor IIIa (FcŒ≥-RIIIa) or CD16 expressed on the surface of monocytes/macrophages and natural killer (NK) cells. Antibodies binding the HIV-1 antigens expressed on the membrane of infected cells can also bind the FcŒ≥-RIIIa via their Fc region of immunoglobin G (IgG). The effector cells are then triggered to release cytokines such as IFN-Œ≥ and cytotoxic granules containing perforin and granzymes that specifically lyse the HIV-infected cells [<xref rid="pone.0118486.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p>
              <p>Unlike virus neutralizing antibodies, which neutralize and clear free virions from circulation, ADCC-mediating antibodies can kill the CD4<sup>+</sup> cells targeted by HIV-1 at the time of virus entry [<xref rid="pone.0118486.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and/or at the time of virus budding, thus preventing infection and/or the cell-to-cell transmission of HIV-1 [<xref rid="pone.0118486.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. It has been reported that rhesus macaques vaccinated with replicating recombinant adenovirus type 5 followed by SIV gp120 developed potent ADCC antibody activity that significantly correlated with reduced acute viremia after a mucosal challenge with pathogenic SIV [<xref rid="pone.0118486.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0118486.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. During persistent infection with live attenuated SIV, Env-specific ADCC activity developed and was associated with protection against pathogenic SIV challenge [<xref rid="pone.0118486.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Increasing titers of gp120-specific ADCC-mediating antibodies have been shown to correlate inversely with the rates of HIV-1 disease progression, while rapid progressors had significantly lower titers of antibodies against HIV-1 gp120 compared to the non-rapid progressors [<xref rid="pone.0118486.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Similarly, HIV-1 elite controllers with undetectable viremia had higher ADCC antibody titers than viremic individuals [<xref rid="pone.0118486.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0118486.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Recently, Wren et al. reported that HIV infected long-term slow progressors have broader epitope specific ADCC responses compared to progressors [<xref rid="pone.0118486.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Additionally, ADCC activity in breast milk has been shown to be associated with reduced risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV [<xref rid="pone.0118486.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In a study of children born to HIV-infected mothers, higher ADCC antibody titers correlated with a better clinical stage of the children [<xref rid="pone.0118486.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Lastly, it has been postulated that ADCC responses detected in the RV144 study might have played a role in the protection against HIV-1 infection in individuals with low levels of anti-Env IgA antibodies [<xref rid="pone.0118486.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0118486.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p>
              <p>We have previously conducted a phase I/II HIV vaccine trial (HIVIS03) in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, that included priming with HIV-DNA followed by boosting with HIV-MVA among healthy adult volunteers [<xref rid="pone.0118486.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. A high neutralizing antibody response rate (up to 83%) was demonstrated in the vaccinees using infectious molecular clones (IMC) in a peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) assay, but there was no neutralizing activity in the TZM-bl pseudovirus assay [<xref rid="pone.0118486.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Other investigators have also reported contrasting data when using PBMC versus TZM-bl neutralization assays [<xref rid="pone.0118486.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0118486.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0118486.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0118486.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0118486.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The IMC/PBMC assay used here is a platform where the antibody is continuously present. It has been reported that NK cells may influence the assessment of neutralization by HIV+ polyclonal sera under such conditions [<xref rid="pone.0118486.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The aim of the current study was to determine the role of NK cells in the HIV inhibitory activity observed in PBMC assays using sera from the HIVIS03 vaccinated volunteers, and to further explore potential FcŒ≥R-mediated ADCC responses, as compared to neutralizing or binding antibody responses.</p>

In the HIVIS03 trial, 60 HIV-uninfected volunteers were randomized into three groups of 20 volunteers and received placebo or 1 mg HIV-DNA intradermally (id) or 3.8 mg intramuscularly (im). DNA plasmids expressing HIV-1 gp160 subtypes A, B, C; Rev B; Gag A, B and RTmut B were given at months 0, 1 and 3 using a needle-free Biojector device. Recombinant MVA expressing CRF01_AE HIV-1 Env subtype E and Gag-Pol subtype A (HIV-MVA) was administered im by needle at months 9 and 21 [<xref rid="pone.0118486.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].

                <p>A PBMC assay, employing IMC carrying the luciferase gene from <italic>Renilla reneformis</italic> (LucR) as a reporter, was used for measuring neutralization activity [<xref rid="pone.0118486.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The PBMC were obtained by standard ficoll-hypaque gradient centrifugation and the mixed (bulk) PBMC were cryopreserved at 30 million per ml of freezing medium in 1 ml cryovials. The following IMCs were used: CM235 CRF01_AE, SF162 subtype B and BaL subtype B. IMC reporter virus (25 Œºl) was incubated at 37¬∞C with 25 Œºl of diluted test serum from pre-and post-vaccination in triplicates in 96-well round bottom plates for 1 hour. For the bulk PBMC assays, phytohemagglutinin (PHA) stimulated PBMC (10<sup>5</sup> cells/well in 50 Œºl) were added and plates were incubated overnight. One hundred Œºl of RPMI/IL-2 medium were added to each well on the next day and plates were incubated further for three days. Each well was then treated with 50 Œºl of lysis buffer, followed by two freeze/thaw cycles, and 20 Œºl of the cell lysate was transferred to a corresponding 96-well Perkin Elmer black opti-plate. A 100 Œºl aliquot of substrate was then added to each well via the injection system of the Envision Luminometer (Perkin Elmer Inc. USA), followed by immediate measurement of luminescence signal in relative luminescence units (RLU). The percent neutralization of the post-vaccination serum was calculated based on the level of virus growth in the presence of the same dilution of pre-vaccination serum and neutralization values greater than 50% were considered positive.</p>

The response rates were highest against the CM235 CRF01_AE virus (24/29, 83%), followed by the SF162 subtype B virus (21/29, 72%) and the BaL subtype B virus (9/29, 31%) [<xref rid="pone.0118486.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In the present study, we calculated titers to measure the magnitude of neutralizing antibodies against the CM235 IMC. Thus, while there was no neutralizing activity demonstrated in the pseudovirus/TZM-bl assay (all ID<sub>50</sub>s &lt;20), significant titers were measured four weeks after the second HIV-MVA vaccination when using the IMC/PBMC assay. The ID<sub>50</sub>s among responders in the IMC/PBMC assay ranged from 20 to 2868, with a median titer of 357, as shown in <xref rid="pone.0118486.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>. The neutralizing antibody titers did not differ significantly between id primed (median 421, range 20‚Äì1289) and im primed (median 259, range 96‚Äì2886) vaccinees (p = 0.67 by Mann-Whitney test) (Fig S2A in <xref rid="pone.0118486.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>).</p>

                <title>Role of Natural Killer (NK) cells in PBMC neutralizing antibody assay activity</title>
                <p>Given that the TZM-bl pseudovirus entry assay demonstrated no neutralizing activity and taking into consideration that the PBMC assay utilizes a mixture of cells, we sought to better understand the functional antibody activity observed in the PBMC assay, where antibody remains present with the cells and virus throughout the entire 4 day culture period allowing other effector cells present to exert potential functional activity [<xref rid="pone.0118486.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], and where multiple rounds of infection may occur. To explore the possible role of NK effector cells in these neutralization assays using vaccinee sera, we tested the neutralizing activity of sera from HIVIS03 vaccinees against the CM235 CRF01_AE and BaL subtype B IMC using bulk and NK cell-depleted PBMC as targets in the neutralization assay. Sera from nine vaccinees collected four weeks after the second HIV-MVA boost who had neutralizing antibody titers above 200, were tested at 1:20 and 1:60 dilutions. NK cell depletion resulted in a significant decrease, but not a complete loss of, neutralizing activity against the CM235 IMC when using sera diluted at 1:20 (<xref rid="pone.0118486.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>, p = 0.0039) and at 1:60 (<xref rid="pone.0118486.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>, p = 0.0039), indicating a possible role for antibody-mediated FcŒ≥-receptor function. At a serum dilution of 1:20, some residual activity was still present against CM235 virus when NK cell-depleted PBMC were used, indicating that, for certain volunteers, some of the neutralization was not dependent on NK cells. When sera from the same 9 volunteers were similarly tested against the BaL subtype B IMC, neutralization was significantly reduced at both 1:20 (p = 0.003, Fig S1A in <xref rid="pone.0118486.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>) and at 1:60 (p = 0.003, Fig S1B in <xref rid="pone.0118486.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>), and no neutralization &gt;50% was observed when using NK-depleted PBMC.</p>

                <p>Having demonstrated a role for NK effector cells in the PBMC assay, we next assessed whether ADCC antibody responses were elicited by the HIVIS03 vaccine regimen. Serum samples collected four weeks after the second HIV-MVA vaccination were tested against the vaccine homologous CRF01_AE (Env E) and subtype B viruses. Sera from the 29 vaccinees were examined for ADCC activity against gp120-coated CEM.NKR<sub>CCR5</sub> target cells using the flow cytometric GTL assay and/or against IMC-infected CEM.NKR<sub>CCR5</sub> target cells using the ADCC-luciferase assay. The serum samples from one volunteer were only available in sufficient volume for ADCC testing against the CM235 IMC-infected target cells. Sera were tested at baseline, two months after the first HIV-MVA boost and four weeks after the second HIV-MVA boost. There was no detectable ADCC activity pre-vaccination and two months after the first HIV-MVA boost in either of the two ADCC assays. The ADCC antibody response rates four weeks after the second HIV-MVA boost are summarized in <xref rid="pone.0118486.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Twenty-one out of 28 (75%) vaccinees had detectable ADCC-GTL activity against SF162 gp120-coated targets (median titer 876, range 296‚Äì5261) and 24/28 (86%) against CM243 gp120-coated target cells (median titer 1841, range 146‚Äì7327).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>In the present study, we investigated the antibody responses of HIVIS03 vaccinees primed with HIV-DNA containing plasmids expressing HIV Envelope subtypes A, B and C and boosted with HIV-MVA (containing genes expressing Env subtype CRF01_AE and Gag-Pol subtype A). We found that a majority of the vaccine recipients had ADCC antibody responses, 68% against subtype B (present in the prime) and 97% against CRF01_AE (present in the boost) four weeks after the second HIV-MVA vaccination. We had previously observed neutralizing antibodies using an IMC/PBMC assay in the same HIVIS03 sera tested four weeks after the second HIV-MVA vaccination, where up to 83% of the vaccinees exhibited neutralizing activity to CM235 CRF01_AE virus [<xref rid="pone.0118486.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Here, we demonstrate that the magnitude of ADCC-mediating antibody correlated well with neutralizing activity against the vaccine-homologous CM235 CRF01_AE IMC. Furthermore, NK cell depletion from PBMC targets abrogated the neutralizing activity (but did not completely abolish the activity in all volunteers) in the PBMC assay, indicating a role for Fc-receptor mediated antibody functions, as well as some possible additional neutralizing function(s). Brown et al. have previously demonstrated that NK cells were critical for a substantial portion of the neutralizing activity of HIV+ sera detected when using the IMC/PBMC assay [<xref rid="pone.0118486.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In our study, the residual neutralizing activity detected after NK cell depletion in the IMC/PBMC assay may have been due to either Fab-dependent neutralizing activity, or Fc-dependent antiviral activity mediated by other cells in bulk PBMC, such as monocytes/macrophages, that express surface Fc receptors. In future studies, it might be interesting to test for the presence of antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis, direct NK cell-mediated killing, or other antibody-dependent cell-mediated virus inhibition mechanisms, using select sera from our study.</p>
              <p>This is the first demonstration using human vaccinee sera, where HIV neutralizing activity was detected in an assay employing PBMC targets, while detecting no activity in a pseudovirus HIV entry inhibition assay. Data that are discordant in the TZM-bl cell versus PBMC assays have been previously reported for human monoclonal antibodies [<xref rid="pone.0118486.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and for HIV positive sera [<xref rid="pone.0118486.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0118486.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. It has thus been suggested that for HIV vaccine evaluation, a battery of different functional antibody assay approaches should be applied until an antibody-based correlate of immune protection is identified [<xref rid="pone.0118486.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0118486.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p>
              <p>Here, we report high titers of ADCC-mediating antibodies induced by HIV-DNA priming and HIV-MVA boosting in healthy volunteers, with a delay of 11‚Äì16 months preceding the second HIV-MVA boost. No difference was seen between vaccinees receiving three priming immunizations with a 3.8 mg dose of HIV-DNA im versus a 1 mg dose of HIV-DNA id prior to the HIV-MVA boosting.</p>
              <p>We observed a dichotomy between neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibody responses, because the NAb were not detected in standard TZM-bl neutralization assays, whereas we observed a high (&gt;50%) ADCC response rate. This is different than what was observed in the RV144 clinical trial where a protein subunit boost induced modest, but detectable NAb responses that did not correlate with lower risk of infection. In the efficacy trial conducted in Thailand, priming with a recombinant canarypox vector vaccine (ALVAC-HIV) and boosting with recombinant gp120 subunit vaccine (AIDSVAX B/E) induced ADCC activity that was associated with a reduced risk of infection in a subgroup of individuals with low serum IgA Env-specific antibodies [<xref rid="pone.0118486.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0118486.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Prime/boost vaccine concepts in non-human primate studies have previously been shown to induce ADCC-mediating antibodies [<xref rid="pone.0118486.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0118486.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0118486.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0118486.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Furthermore, in rhesus macaque vaccine studies, ADCC responses were reported to correlate with reduced acute viremia after intrarectal SIVmac251 challenge [<xref rid="pone.0118486.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0118486.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] or intravenous SHIV89.6P challenge [<xref rid="pone.0118486.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p>
              <p>We characterized the ADCC activity against tier 1 viruses, including the CM235 CRF01_AE virus and the SF162 subtype B virus. At the time these analyses were performed, subtypes A and C LucR-IMC were not available for use in the ADCC or PBMC neutralization assays. There was no demonstrable neutralizing activity in the TZM-bl pseudovirus assay using BaL subtype B, GS015 subtype C and CM235 CRF01 AE pseudoviruses [<xref rid="pone.0118486.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. ADCC antibody responses were demonstrated using both gp120-coated (ADCC-GTL assay) and IMC-infected target cells (ADCC-luciferase assay) in samples collected four weeks after the second HIV-MVA vaccination. The ADCC antibody response rates were higher to CRF01_AE virus, (86% in the ADCC-GTL assay and 97% in the ADCC-luciferase assay) than to subtype B virus (75% in the ADCC-GTL assay and 68% in the ADCC-Luciferase assay). Similarly, using an assay employing <sup>51</sup>Cr labeled CEM.NKR cells coated with either CRF01_AE gp120 or subtype B gp120 as target cells and PBMC as effector cells, a 40% ADCC antibody response rate to CRF01_AE and 30% response rate to subtype B was reported in vaccinees after receipt of three doses of 10<sup>8</sup>pfu MVA-CMDR [<xref rid="pone.0118486.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In the Phase I/II RV135 clinical trial, a combination of ALVAC-HIV (vCP1521) prime and AIDSVAX B/E gp120 boost generated more HIV-specific ADCC activity in vaccinees, as compared to ALVAC-HIV alone. While we observed stronger and more frequent humoral responses to CRF01_AE in the present study, ADCC activity in RV135 sera tended to be slightly higher against the MN subtype B gp120, as compared to ADCC activity against the CM243 CRF01_AE gp120, but the difference was not statistically significant [<xref rid="pone.0118486.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. This observation is not surprising, as the protein boost in RV135 contained a MN subtype B gp120, while our HIV-MVA used as a boost contained only the CM235 CRF01_AE subtype E Env.</p>
              <p>All vaccinees in the present study produced cross-clade binding antibodies to subtype C and CRF01_AE envelopes. Anti-CM243 gp120 CRF01_AE binding correlated with CRF01_AE ADCC antibody activity determined by ADCC-GTL (using matched CM243 gp120 coated targets), but not with ADCC antibody activity detected using CM235 IMC-infected target cells (ADCC-luciferase assay). Minor differences in gp120-specific ADCC epitopes between the CM235 and CM243 strains could account for the lack of correlation, or more likely, a contribution of ADCC responses directed against gp41 epitopes in the IMC-infected cell targets could play a role. Subtype C ADCC antibody activity was not tested for, but cross-clade gp140 subtype C binding antibodies were detected. Taken together, these findings suggest that antibodies mediating ADCC, and possibly neutralization, constitute subsets of antibodies detected in the ELISA, as would be expected. A similar correlation between ADCC responses and gp140 binding antibodies has been reported in SIV infection [<xref rid="pone.0118486.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p>
              <p>In summary, we have found that the HIV-DNA prime, recombinant HIV-MVA boost vaccine elicited potent ADCC mediating antibody responses in a high proportion (up to 97%) of the vaccinees four weeks after a second HIV-MVA vaccination. The NK cells were responsible for the majority of the inhibitory activity demonstrated by the IMC/PBMC assay, thereby supporting the observation of potent ADCC responses. Our findings highlight the potential of HIV-DNA prime, HIV-MVA boost vaccines for induction of non-neutralizing functional antibody responses and suggest this vaccine regimen and ADCC studies as a potential new avenue in HIV vaccine development.</p>
