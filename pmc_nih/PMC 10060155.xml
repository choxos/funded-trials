The interaction of menin with lysine methyltransferase 2A (KMT2A), an epigenetic regulator, is a dependence in acute leukaemia caused by either rearrangement of <italic>KMT2A</italic> or mutation of the nucleophosmin 1 gene (<italic>NPM1</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. <italic>KMT2A</italic> rearrangements occur in up to 10% of acute leukaemias and have an adverse prognosis, whereas <italic>NPM1</italic> mutations occur in up to 30%, forming the most common genetic alteration in acute myeloid leukaemia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Here, we describe the results of the first-in-human phase 1 clinical trial investigating revumenib (SNDX-5613), a potent and selective oral inhibitor of the menin–KMT2A interaction, in patients with relapsed or refractory acute leukaemia (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04065399). We show that therapy with revumenib was associated with a low frequency of grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse events and a 30% rate of complete remission or complete remission with partial haematologic recovery (CR/CRh) in the efficacy analysis population. Asymptomatic prolongation of the QT interval on electrocardiography was identified as the only dose-limiting toxicity. Remissions occurred in leukaemias refractory to multiple previous lines of therapy. We demonstrate clearance of residual disease using sensitive clinical assays and identify hallmarks of differentiation into normal haematopoietic cells, including differentiation syndrome. These data establish menin inhibition as a therapeutic strategy for susceptible acute leukaemia subtypes.</p>

              <p id="Par3">The prognosis of acute leukaemias harbouring rearrangements of the gene lysine methyltransferase 2A (<italic>KMT2A</italic>), previously known as mixed-lineage leukaemia (<italic>MLL</italic>), is poor, with a 5-year overall survival of less than 25% (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>). <italic>KMT2A</italic> rearrangements (<italic>KMT2A</italic>r) occur in 80% of infant acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and in 5–15% of children and adults with acute leukaemia, whether myeloid, lymphoid or mixed phenotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Mutated nucleophosmin 1 gene (<italic>NPM1</italic>) is the most common genetic alteration in adult acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), occurring in up to 30% of patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Currently there are no targeted therapies specifically approved for acute leukaemia with <italic>KMT2A</italic>r or mutated <italic>NPM1</italic>.</p>
              <p id="Par4">Genetic rearrangements of <italic>KMT2A</italic> lead to aberrant expression of homeobox (<italic>HOX</italic>) genes and their DNA-binding cofactor <italic>MEIS1</italic> (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>). This gene expression programme, normally expressed in stem cells, causes a haematopoietic differentiation block and leukaemic transformation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. For leukaemias driven by <italic>KMT2A</italic>r, menin is a critical oncogenic cofactor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. The menin-binding motif is preserved throughout all KMT2A fusion proteins, and menin is an essential cofactor for binding to <italic>HOX</italic> gene promoters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Similarly, in AML with mutated <italic>NPM1</italic>, the interaction between wild-type <italic>KMT2A</italic> and menin leads to <italic>HOX-</italic> and <italic>MEIS1</italic>-mediated leukaemogenic transcription<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Blockade of the menin–KMT2A interaction disrupts the assembly of oncogenic KMT2A wild-type or fusion complexes on chromatin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Preclinical studies showed that menin inhibition downregulates <italic>HOX</italic> and <italic>MEIS1</italic> transcription and reverses leukaemogenesis in <italic>KMT2Ar-r-</italic> or <italic>NPM1</italic>-mutated leukaemia models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Revumenib, previously known as SNDX-5613, is a potent, oral, selective inhibitor of the menin–KMT2A interaction. Treatment with revumenib led to abrogation of aberrant <italic>HOX</italic> gene expression and dramatic antileukaemic activity in those models (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">1</xref>; GEO accession no. for RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE216730">GSE216730</ext-link>). In this first-in-human clinical trial we assessed the safety, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles in patients with relapsed or refractory acute leukaemia, and present the clinical activity of revumenib in patients with <italic>KMT2A</italic>r or mutated <italic>NPM1</italic>.</p>
              <p id="Par5">This phase 1 dose-escalation study was conducted across nine sites in the United States. Because revumenib is a substrate of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), two parallel dose-escalation cohorts, one without (Arm A) and one with (Arm B) strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, were conducted. Revumenib was administered orally every 12 h (q12h) in continuous 28-day cycles. Although all patients could enrol at study initiation regardless of cytogenetic and mutational profile, given the strong preclinical rationale demonstrating that the menin–KMT2A interaction is a targetable vulnerability in acute leukaemia with <italic>KMT2A</italic>r or mutated <italic>NPM1</italic>, an early amendment to the protocol restricted enrolment to patients with relapsed or refractory acute leukaemia with <italic>KMT2A</italic>r or mutated <italic>NPM1</italic> (88% of the total study population). Between 5 November 2019 and 31 March 2022, a total of 68 patients (37 in Arm A and 31 in Arm B) were enroled and treated. The data cutoff date for this analysis was 31 March 2022. Patient disposition is presented in Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">2</xref>.</p>
              <p id="Par6">Baseline characteristics of patients are provided in Extended Data Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">1</xref>. There were 56 patients (82%) with relapsed or refractory AML, 11 (16%) with ALL and one with mixed-phenotype acute leukaemia (2%). Forty-six patients (68%) had <italic>KMT2A</italic>r, 14 (21%) had mutated <italic>NPM1</italic> and eight (12%) had neither <italic>KMT2A</italic>r nor <italic>NPM1</italic> mutations. Sixty patients were adults (at least 18 years old) and eight were children or adolescents (under 18 years of age). The median age was 42.5 years (range, 0.8–79). The median age of adult patients was 50.5 years (range, 19–79) and the median age among paediatric patients was 2.5 years (range, 0.8–16). The study population was heavily pretreated with a median of four previous lines of therapy (range, 1–12), and 31 patients (46%) had relapsed after an allogenic stem cell transplant. All patients who received at least one dose of revumenib were included in the safety analysis whereas only patients with <italic>KMT2A</italic>r or mutated <italic>NPM1</italic> were included in the efficacy analysis.</p>
              <p id="Par7">The dose-escalation schema is shown in Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. The only dose-limiting toxicity observed in both Arm A and Arm B was grade 3 prolongation of the QT interval (over 500 ms) on electrocardiography (ECG), a toxicity predicted in preclinical animal studies. These events occurred without any clinical correlate or symptoms. This dose-limiting toxicity was observed in Arm A at dose levels of 226 mg q12h (<italic>n</italic> = 1) and 339 mg q12h (<italic>n</italic> = 2), and in Arm B at 113 mg q12h (<italic>n</italic> = 1) and 226 mg q12h (<italic>n</italic> = 2). The incidence of grade 3 QT prolongation was 10% at dose levels either at or below MTD.</p>
              <p id="Par8">A total of 67 treated patients (99%) had an adverse event during treatment with revumenib whereas 53 patients (78%) had a treatment-related adverse event (TRAE) of any grade (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The most frequent treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) of any grade, irrespective of a relationship to revumenib, were prolongation of the QT interval (56%), nausea (50%), vomiting (40%) and febrile neutropenia (31%); a full listing of these adverse events in at least 20% of the patients is given in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. The most frequent TEAEs of grade 3 or higher were febrile neutropenia (31%), thrombocytopenia (19%) and sepsis (18%) (Extended Data Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The most frequent TRAE was prolongation of the QT interval, in 36 patients (53%). Eleven patients (16%) had grade 3 or 4 TRAEs (Extended Data Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The most frequent grade 3 TRAE was prolongation of the QT interval, in nine patients (13%). There were no ventricular arrythmias, and all episodes of grade 3 QT prolongation resolved either before the next dose or with protocol-directed dose hold. All patients with grade 3 QT prolongation were able to resume dosing at the next-lower dose level. Other grade 3 TRAEs included diarrhoea (3%), hypercalcaemia (2%), tumour lysis syndrome (2%), anaemia (3%), asthenia (2%), fatigue (2%), neutropenia (2%), thrombocytopenia (2%), and hypokalaemia (2%). Grade 4 TRAEs included neutropenia (2%) and thrombocytopenia (2%), with one event each. No patients permanently discontinued revumenib due to TRAEs, and no TRAEs led to death.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Any-grade treatment-related and TEAEs, regardless of causality</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Event</th><th>Overall population (<italic>n</italic> = 68)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><bold>Any-grade TRAE (5% or over)</bold></td><td>53 (77.9%)</td></tr><tr><td>   ECG QT prolonged</td><td>36 (52.9%)</td></tr><tr><td>   Nausea</td><td>18 (26.5%)</td></tr><tr><td>   Differentiation syndrome</td><td>11 (16.2%)</td></tr><tr><td>   Vomiting</td><td>11 (16.2%)</td></tr><tr><td>   Diarrhoea</td><td>7 (10.3%)</td></tr><tr><td>   Decreased appetite</td><td>5 (7.4%)</td></tr><tr><td>   Dysgeusia</td><td>5 (7.4%)</td></tr><tr><td><bold>Any-grade TEAE (20% or over)</bold></td><td>67 (98.5%)</td></tr><tr><td>   ECG QT prolonged</td><td>38 (55.9%)</td></tr><tr><td>   Nausea</td><td>34 (50.0%)</td></tr><tr><td>   Vomiting</td><td>27 (39.7%)</td></tr><tr><td>   Febrile neutropenia</td><td>21 (30.9%)</td></tr><tr><td>   Diarrhoea</td><td>20 (29.4%)</td></tr><tr><td>   Fatigue</td><td>18 (26.5%)</td></tr><tr><td>   ALT increased</td><td>17 (25.0%)</td></tr><tr><td>   Headache</td><td>16 (23.5%)</td></tr><tr><td>   Hyperphosphataemia</td><td>16 (23.5%)</td></tr><tr><td>   Hypokalaemia</td><td>15 (22.1%)</td></tr><tr><td>   Hyponatraemia</td><td>15 (22.1%)</td></tr><tr><td>   Thrombocytopenia</td><td>15 (22.1%)</td></tr><tr><td>   Epistaxis</td><td>14 (20.6%)</td></tr><tr><td>   Peripheral oedema</td><td>14 (20.6%)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>All AEs shown as <italic>n</italic> (%).</p><p>ALT, alanine aminotransferase.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p>
              <p id="Par9">A common occurrence in antileukaemia therapies that induce myeloid differentiation is the development of a clinically apparent differentiation syndrome. Differentiation syndrome is caused by cytokine alterations associated with haematopoietic differentiation, with common manifestations including fever, arthralgias, leukocytosis, pleural or pericardial effusions and respiratory or renal failure in severe cases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.

In this study, differentiation syndrome was reported in 11 patients (16%), all grade 2. All cases of differentiation syndrome resolved following treatment with corticosteroids, with the addition of hydroxyurea for associated leukocytosis seen in five of the 11 patients (Extended Data Figs. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). One patient missed one day of dosing, but otherwise treatment with revumenib was uninterrupted because of differentiation syndrome. The median time of onset of differentiation syndrome was 18 days (range, 5–41) with manifestations including bone pain or arthralgia, pericardial effusion, pleural effusion, pulmonary infiltrates, increase in creatinine, rash, oedema and pyrexia.</p>
              <p id="Par10">Pharmacokinetic studies showed that dose-proportional exposure was achieved in both Arm A (no strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) and Arm B (with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor).

              <p id="Par11">Following a review of prespecified protocol criteria on safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic data, the revumenib doses of 226 mg q12h and 276 mg q12h in Arm A and 113 mg q12h and 163 mg q12h in Arm B met the prespecified criteria for RP2D.</p>

Subsequently with additional cycles following phenotypic remission, fusions are no longer detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization, probably because of apoptosis of differentiated cells or replacement by normal haematopoiesis.</p>
              <p id="Par15">With a median follow-up of 11.9 months (95% CI 4.9–14.8) in patients who achieved CR/CRh, the median duration of response was 9.1 months (95% CI 2.7 to not reached (NR)) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). Median overall survival in the efficacy population, regardless of remission status, was 7 months (95% CI 4.3–11.6) (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">8</xref>) and median follow-up of overall survival in the efficacy population was 14.3 months (95% CI 10.6–16.7). Twelve patients received an allogeneic stem cell transplant as consolidation following response to revumenib, with nine in remission at the time of the data cutoff, seven of whom have been in remission for over 6 months. The median duration of response in those who achieved CR/CRh with censoring at the time of allogeneic stem cell transplant was 4.4 months (95% CI 1.9–NR) (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">9</xref>).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par17">The treatment of patients who have relapsed or refractory acute leukaemia with <italic>KMT2A</italic>r is challenging. The rate of CR or complete remission with incomplete count recovery in relapsed <italic>KMT2A</italic>r AML following two previous lines of therapy is 9% (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>). Despite notable progress in the treatment of childhood acute leukaemia, infant <italic>KMT2A</italic>r acute leukaemias have remained a therapeutic challenge with high rates of resistance to multi-agent chemotherapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Mutations in <italic>NPM1</italic> are the most common alterations in AML, and targeting of vulnerabilities associated with this subset expand the reach of targeted therapy to the largest portion of patients with this disease. The menin inhibitor revumenib has the potential to address these unmet needs. In this first-in-human clinical trial, we provide clinical evidence of the effectiveness of menin inhibition with an oral targeted therapy, which is the first epigenetic therapy that evicts protein complexes from chromatin, leading to remissions in patients with acute leukaemia. We found an encouraging clinical benefit, with deep molecular remissions and minimal toxicities, in a heavily pretreated population of both children and adults with advanced acute leukaemia. However, recent data suggest that clinical resistance to targeted menin inhibition is mediated through the acquisition of mutations in menin that prevent inhibitor binding and can lead to clinical relapse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. The emergence of resistance mutations highlights the critical role of the menin–KMT2A interaction in the pathogenesis of <italic>KMT2A</italic>r and <italic>NPM1-</italic>mutant acute leukaemia.</p>
              <p id="Par18">Because revumenib disrupts the effect of epigenetic regulators in leukaemia that are dependent on the menin–KMT2A interaction, this leads to abrogation of aberrant gene expression and removal of the haematopoietic differentiation block<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. In this study, we show evidence of this mechanism of action with differentiation of leukaemia cells, persistence of cytogenetic abnormalities at the time of morphologic response and differentiation syndrome associated with menin inhibition in some patients, which resolved following appropriate therapy.</p>
              <p id="Par19">Other leukaemia genotypes have recently been identified as susceptible to menin inhibition, such as AML with rearrangement of the nucleoporin 98 gene (<italic>NUP98</italic>), a common and adverse genotype among children with relapsed and refractory disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Another example is the rare occurrence of AML with translocations involving the meningioma-1 gene (MN1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Therefore, menin inhibitors have the potential to reach a larger subset of acute leukaemia with similar dependency on the menin–KMT2A interaction, which could be identified using precision approaches testing characteristic gene expression.</p>
              <p id="Par20">In conclusion, in children and adults with highly refractory acute leukaemia with <italic>KMT2A</italic>r or <italic>NPM1</italic> mutation, menin inhibition with revumenib monotherapy was associated with promising antileukaemic activity leading to deep and sustained remission.</p>

                <p id="Par21">We conducted a phase 1, multicentre, open-label, dose-escalation study (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04065399). Revumenib was administered orally in either capsule or liquid formulation, q12h, in 28-day continuous cycles with dose adjustment by body surface area for patients weighing under 40 kg (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). We employed a rolling-6 design, an algorithm-based extension of the 3+3 design that allows for concurrent accrual of two to six patients onto a dose level, thereby shortening the duration of phase 1 without increasing the risk of toxicity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Therefore, the number of patients enrolled followed this dose-escalation design without an absolute prior estimation of sample size. The study included two parallel dose-escalation cohorts, for patients either not taking (Arm A) or taking (Arm B) strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. Dose expansion occurred at safe and efficacious doses. Dose-limiting toxic effects were defined as nonhaematologic toxic effects of grade 3 or higher during cycle 1, or as haematologic toxicities directly attributed to the study drug rather than to the underlying disease.</p>

              <title>Data availability</title>
              <p>Syndax Pharmaceuticals (Syndax) is committed to providing qualified scientific researchers access to anonymized data and clinical study reports from the company’s clinical trials for the purpose of conducting legitimate scientific research. Syndax is also obligated to protect the rights and privacy of trial participants and, as such, has a procedure in place for evaluating and fulfilling requests for sharing company clinical trial data with qualified external scientific researchers. Following submission of a request (to datarequest@syndax.com), Syndax will provide an outline of the process and requirements for submitting a data request. Feasible requests will be reviewed by a committee of Syndax subject matter experts to assess the scientific validity of the request and the qualifications of the requestors. In line with data privacy legislation, submitters of approved requests must enter into a standard data-sharing agreement with Syndax before Syndax may grant data access. Data will be made available for request after product approval in the United States and European Union, or after product development is discontinued. There are circumstances that may prevent Syndax from sharing requested data, including country- or region-specific regulations. If Syndax declines the request, it will communicate the decision to the investigator. Access to genetic or exploratory biomarker data requires a detailed statistical analysis plan that is collaboratively developed by the requester and Syndax subject matter experts.</p>
