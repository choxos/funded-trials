                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Most people with opioid use disorder (OUD) never receive treatment. Medication treatment of OUD in primary care is recommended as an approach to increase access to care. The PRimary Care Opioid Use Disorders treatment (PROUD) trial tests whether implementation of a collaborative care model (Massachusetts Model) using a nurse care manager (NCM) to support medication treatment of OUD in primary care increases OUD treatment and improves outcomes. Specifically, it tests whether implementation of collaborative care, compared to usual primary care, increases the number of days of medication for OUD (implementation objective) and reduces acute health care utilization (effectiveness objective). The protocol for the PROUD trial is presented here.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">PROUD is a hybrid type III cluster-randomized implementation trial in six health care systems. The intervention consists of three implementation strategies: salary for a full-time NCM, training and technical assistance for the NCM, and requiring that three primary care providers have DEA waivers to prescribe buprenorphine. Within each health system, two primary care clinics are randomized: one to the intervention and one to Usual Primary Care. The sample includes all patients age 16‚Äì90 who visited the randomized primary care clinics from 3¬†years before to 2¬†years after randomization (anticipated to be‚Äâ&gt;‚Äâ170,000). Quantitative data are derived from existing health system administrative data, electronic medical records, and/or health insurance claims (‚Äúelectronic health records,‚Äù [EHRs]). Anonymous staff surveys, stakeholder debriefs, and observations from site visits, trainings and technical assistance provide qualitative data to assess barriers and facilitators to implementation. The outcome for the implementation objective (primary outcome) is a clinic-level measure of the number of patient days of medication treatment of OUD over the 2¬†years post-randomization. The patient-level outcome for the effectiveness objective (secondary outcome) is days of acute care utilization [e.g. urgent care, emergency department (ED) and/or hospitalizations] over 2¬†years post-randomization among patients with documented OUD prior to randomization.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="Par29">Of the more than 2 million individuals in the United States with opioid use disorder (OUD), the vast majority do not receive treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Increasing treatment of OUD is critical, but not likely to be achieved unless it is provided in general medical settings in addition to specialty substance use treatment clinics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Buprenorphine and naltrexone are two FDA-approved medications with demonstrated efficacy for OUD, which can be provided in primary care (PC) settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Although the use of medication treatment for OUD has increased over time, it reaches only 51% of privately insured patients with OUD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and merely 25% of Medicaid patients with OUD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Most patients with OUD do not receive OUD treatment in PC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par30">Substantial barriers to treating OUD in PC persist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. These include perceptions that treating OUD is out of the scope of PC practice, which lacks the time, resources, structure, and behavioral interventions required for OUD treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Concerns are sometimes raised that PC cannot provide high quality OUD treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Finally, many experts believe that pessimism and stigma pose major, if often unspoken, barriers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Clinicians express concern that patients with OUD are difficult and could overwhelm PC practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par31">Effective strategies exist to successfully implement high quality care for treating OUD in medical settings. A recent review identified 6 models of OUD treatment in PC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Successful models generally relied on team-based approaches to address the above barriers. One of the models with the most support in the literature is the Massachusetts Collaborative Care Model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The Massachusetts model (hereafter the ‚ÄúMA Model‚Äù) includes a full time OUD nurse care manager (NCM) as part of a team-based approach that shares care between the NCM and PC provider, with the nurse providing assessment, education, rapid access to medication, monitoring, and care coordination.</p>
              <p id="Par32">The MA Model has demonstrated effectiveness engaging and maintaining PC patients in OUD treatment, as well as attracting new patients into PC for OUD treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The model has been associated with high rates of persistent treatment at 12¬†months (51‚Äì67%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], and it is being tested in the recently funded and congressionally-mandated HEALing Communities multi-site trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. However, the MA Model has been used predominantly in publicly-financed Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) in MA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and is not widely implemented outside MA. As implemented in FQHCs in MA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], each NCM was expected to care for a panel of approximately 100 patients with OUD after full implementation, suggesting that the model could be cost-effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. However, to date, other health systems have not made the upfront investment of hiring a full-time NCM, as required by the MA Model. This highlights the need for evidence of the MA Model‚Äôs feasibility, effectiveness and costs in other regions and across diverse health systems.</p>

                <title>Objectives and hypotheses</title>
                <p id="Par34">The PROUD trial is a pragmatic, hybrid type III cluster-randomized implementation trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], a design which includes both a primary implementation objective and a secondary effectiveness outcome. PROUD tests strategies for implementing the MA Model in primary care, while secondarily evaluating the effectiveness of implementation for improving patient outcomes. The implementation objective (Objective 1; primary aim) is to test whether the MA Model, as compared to Usual PC in six diverse health systems, increases patient-days of medication treatment of OUD with either buprenorphine or extended release injectable naltrexone (XR-NTX) in PC, as documented in electronic medical records (EMRs) 2¬†years post-randomization. The primary implementation hypothesis is that the number of patient days of medication treatment of OUD is significantly greater in clinics randomized to the PROUD intervention compared to clinics randomized to Usual PC.</p>
                <p id="Par35">The effectiveness objective (Objective 2, powered secondary aim) evaluates whether the MA Model decreases acute care utilization in PC patients with OUD. The primary effectiveness hypothesis is that PC patients with documented OUD in the 3¬†years prior to randomization who receive care in PROUD intervention clinics, compared to those who receive care in Usual PC clinics, have fewer days of acute care utilization (e.g., in urgent care, emergency department [ED] and/or hospital) in the 2¬†years after randomization. This effectiveness objective reflects whether the PROUD intervention decreases acute health care utilization, a proxy for improved patient health outcomes.</p>
                <p id="Par36">Other study objectives include: (1) evaluating whether sex and race/ethnicity modify the impact of the PROUD intervention; (2) testing whether the intervention improves other implementation or effectiveness outcomes; and (3) identifying barriers and facilitators to implementation of the MA Model. In addition, since findings from the developmental phase of PROUD (Phase 1, described below) suggested that the recruited clinics may not be typical, observational analyses compare recruited clinics to other non-recruited (i.e. non-randomized) Usual PC clinics in the same system at baseline. Finally, four health systems in PROUD Phase 1 had unique care models for OUD treatment that health system leaders thought might be equal or superior to the MA Model. Thus, observational analyses compare outcomes in the PROUD intervention clinics to outcomes in these ‚Äúexemplar‚Äù PC clinics.</p>

                <title>Overview of trial design</title>
                <p id="Par37">The PROUD trial is being conducted in six health systems across the United States (Fig.¬†<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). These health systems were recruited from among 11 health systems that participated in Phase 1. For PROUD Phase 2‚Äîthe trial described in this report‚Äîeach participating health system recruits two PC clinics willing to implement the MA Model, resulting in a total of 12 clinics across the six health systems. One of the two recruited PC clinics in each health system is randomly assigned to implement the MA Model, while the other is randomly assigned to continue Usual PC. The PROUD Data and Analytics Team obtains all quantitative data for sample identification and measures solely from existing electronic health records (EHRs), which include but are not limited to electronic administrative data, patients‚Äô EMRs, and/or electronic data on health insurance claims, during a baseline (pre-randomization) period and follow-up (post-randomization) period. The PROUD Implementation Monitoring Team obtains qualitative data via: anonymous staff surveys at baseline and after the trial ends; stakeholder debriefs throughout the trial; and observations at site visits, trainings, and technical assistance (TA) throughout the trial.

                <p id="Par38">The PROUD Trial design is guided by the Practical, Robust Implementation and Sustainability Model (PRISM) framework for implementation, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] which combines domains that impact the success of implementation. It includes four domains of barriers and facilitators to implementation: (1) the PROUD <italic>intervention</italic>, and how it interacts with recipients of the intervention; (2) the <italic>recipients</italic> of the intervention, including patient, clinician, and organization; (3) the implementation and sustainability <italic>infrastructure</italic> of the health system, including quality improvement teams, as well as space and EMR; and (4) the <italic>external environment</italic>, including regulatory policies, healthcare financing, and national quality measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. These domains guide qualitative data collection by the PROUD Implementation Monitoring Team (See Data Sources). The PRISM‚Äôs outcome domains that reflect the success of implementation are contained within the RE-AIM framework: Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation fidelity, and Maintenance of the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].

                <title>Developmental phase: PROUD Phase 1</title>
                <p id="Par39">The Developmental Phase of PROUD (Phase 1) lasted from January 2017 to November 2017. Objectives for Phase 1 were to select health systems that could obtain institutional support for the trial and demonstrate the feasibility of data collection. Phase 1 included 11 health systems from across the country that indicated they could provide the required data and possibly obtain permissions for participation in the main trial. From January to March 2017, lead investigators in the 11 Phase 1 health systems (‚ÄúSite PIs‚Äù) worked to engage their health system leaders to assess whether the health system would be willing to participate in the PROUD trial. Six of the 11 Phase 1 sites were able to obtain the required support from all levels of their health systems within the required timeframe. Other activities during Phase 1 included preparation for data collection (e.g., development of measures and a data dictionary to create common data fields from the EMR and insurance claims data across the health systems) and obtaining approval of the NIDA National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network Data and Safety Monitoring Board. As above, one important finding of Phase 1 was that many clinics were unable to participate due to lack of leadership or PC provider support; consequently observational analyses were planned comparing recruited clinics to non-recruited (i.e. non-randomized) clinics in the same system at baseline. Another important finding of Phase 1 was that four health systems included PC clinics with unique models of OUD care (‚Äúexemplar‚Äù hereafter) that health system leaders felt were potentially as‚Äîor more‚Äîeffective than the MA Model tested in the PROUD trial. As a result, observational analyses were also added to compare outcomes in the four exemplar clinics to outcomes in the six sites randomized to the PROUD intervention (Phase 2).</p>

                <p id="Par40">Health systems were eligible for the PROUD trial based on: (1) health system and clinic leaders providing letters of support agreeing to participate in the trial, (2) having two adequately-sized PC clinics (i.e., approximately 10,000 unique patients with visits in a year) willing to participate by integrating a NCM into their clinic, (3) having at least three PC providers in the clinic willing to be waivered to prescribe buprenorphine, (4) a demonstrated ability to obtain the data necessary for the PROUD outcome measures‚Äîspecifically days of treatment with medication for OUD and acute care utilization, (5) ability to meet all data sharing and regulatory requirements, (6) geographic, demographic and health system diversity, and (7) clinics not in close proximity to reduce cross-over potential. The six health systems selected included: two integrated insurance and delivery systems (Henry Ford Health System, MI; Kaiser Permanente [KP] Washington, WA), a community health system (Multicare Health System, WA), two university affiliated safety-net health systems (Harris Health System, TX; Montefiore Health System, NY), and a university-affiliated health system (University of Miami Health System, FL). For purposes of the trial, a ‚Äúclinic‚Äù could be a cluster of two to three nearby smaller clinics that would function as a unit, sharing the NCM if randomized to the PROUD intervention. Three of the 12 recruited clinics are a cluster of two clinics (hereafter referred to simply as ‚Äúclinics‚Äù).</p>

                <title>Overview of the MA Model</title>
                <p id="Par45">The MA Model is a team-based, collaborative care approach that uses a full-time clinic-based NCM to integrate medication treatment of OUD into PC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The model is one of shared care between the NCM and the PC providers who prescribe OUD medications, in which agreed upon protocols, per the MA Model Office Based Addiction Treatment (OBAT) manual [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], allow the NCM to provide much of the routine care, with the provider‚Äôs role focused on diagnosis and treatment decisions, including referral to specialty addictions care when appropriate. The role of the NCM includes connecting with health system departments, hospitals, and community services so they can refer patients to PC for OUD treatment; assessment and support and engagement of patients seeking OUD treatment; coordinating with insurance plans; providing rapid access to intake assessments; coordinating prescriber visits to diagnose and prescribe buprenorphine or XR-NTX; support for medication initiation; monitoring and coordinating prescriptions refills for stable patients; checking the state Prescription Drug Monitoring Program; coordinating with outside agencies monitoring treatment; and monitoring urine drug tests. Although each health system chose how to use urine drug tests as part of care for OUD, in general, urine drug tests were used at the initial assessment of new patients and for monitoring during treatment to help guide clinical care. In the MA model, urine drug tests serve as a clinical tool in treating patients with OUD, allowing the NCM to have a conversation with patients and, when urine drug tests are positive or unexpected, allows the NCM to offer more support (e.g. increased frequency of visits), provide other tools or link to additional services, or talk about fentanyl, a ‚Äúcritical lab value,‚Äù which patients may not know was in their drug supply. The NCM role allows the PC provider to treat OUD in the normal flow of PC and minimizes additional workload. The NCM becomes an expert in OUD treatment and also plays an educational role to overcome barriers to OUD treatment both within the clinic and in the larger health system, with a focus on decreasing stigma by using non-stigmatizing language and normalizing OUD treatment in PC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p>

This measure was selected as the primary outcome because: it reflects both initiation and retention and thus both access and quality; it is continuous and therefore maximizes statistical power in a study with a small number of clusters; and it can be estimated in the entire sample of PC patients to avoid identification bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Primary, secondary, and other outcomes measured during the 2 years post-randomization based on EHR data, as entered into clinicaltrials.gov</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td align="left">Outcome measures</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>¬†Objective 1.

                  <p id="Par61">Medication treatment for OUD includes buprenorphine formulations that are FDA approved for OUD or XR-NTX; methadone is not included since data from methadone opioid treatment programs (OTPs) are not available in EMRs and most of the health systems do not have data on methadone OTPs. An OUD diagnosis for buprenorphine is not required because Phase 1 analyses revealed OUD diagnoses are sometimes missing, consistent with the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], and an OUD diagnosis is more likely to be documented for patients in Intervention compared to Usual PC clinics, so that requiring an OUD diagnosis could bias findings toward favoring the intervention. Since XR-NTX is also FDA-approved for AUD, when both OUD and AUD are documented, XR-NTX is considered OUD treatment if the number of documented OUD diagnoses are about equal to AUD (i.e. within two). Medication orders from EMRs are the basis for the primary outcome. This outcome measure was selected because not all sites had data on medication dispensing from pharmacies or insurance claims for contracted OUD treatment in their EHRs, and the trial requires an outcome that is comparable across all sites. However, pharmacy dispensing data and insurance claims and other EHR data, when available, are used for secondary measures.</p>

This coding process consists of four steps. First, at the end of the study the Implementation Monitoring Team members each identify up to 10 important barriers and facilitators of implementation for each health system. Second, after discussion, the Implementation Monitoring Team arrives at a consensus regarding key barriers and facilitators for each site. Third, results for each site are shared with stakeholders (the NCM, Site PIs and Site project managers, and the TA team), for feedback on appropriate representation of context and revised accordingly. Finally, barriers and facilitators are categorized into the PRISM‚Äôs four domains described above: (1) intervention; (2) recipients‚Äîpatients, clinicians, managers, staff and organizational leaders; (3) health system and clinic implementation infrastructure; and (4) external environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p>

Other secondary analyses of the primary (implementation) outcome include: site-specific (descriptive) analyses comparing PROUD intervention and Usual PC clinics at each site; ‚Äúper protocol‚Äù analyses (1) restricted to health systems whose intervention clinic‚Äôs NCM treated over 30 patients (indicating successful implementation), or (2) using a modified definition of the follow-up period over which the Objective 1 outcome measure is calculated (e.g., after the NCM began seeing patients to account for delay in implementation due to NCM hiring and training). Additional sensitivity analyses are conducted in which the outcome specifications are varied (e.g., using the most complete EHR data available from each site by including pharmacy dispensing and insurance claims data from sites where it is available). Descriptive analyses also evaluate crossover from a Usual PC clinic pre-randomization to the PROUD intervention clinic post-randomization in patients with OUD. Analyses of other pre-specified implementation outcomes (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) use largely the same general approach as for the primary outcome. Exploratory outcomes also describe different dimensions of implementation based on the PRISM model such as adoption (e.g., proportion of PC providers who prescribe buprenorphine), implementation fidelity (e.g., use of urine drug tests). Differences between intervention and Usual PC clinics, and any changes in PC staff attitudes from baseline to after the trial ends will also be assessed.</p>

The primary analyses of effectiveness exclude patients newly diagnosed with OUD post-randomization, as these patients could differ systematically between PROUD intervention and Usual PC clinics, if the MA Model attracts new patients into PC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], which could lead to biased estimates of the treatment effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. A mixed-effect Poisson regression model (with log link) is fit at the patient level to the number of days of acute care utilization. The model adjusts for the baseline value of the outcome (count measure of the number of days of acute care utilization) and accounts for clustering of patients within a clinic by including clinic-specific random intercepts. If any site randomizes after 2/28/2018, analyses would also adjust for time from randomization to the end of the trial (2/29/2020) by including an offset term. The Objective 2 effectiveness hypothesis is evaluated by testing whether the coefficient of the intervention group assignment (PROUD versus Usual PC) differs from zero using a two-sided test at the 0.05 level with a small-sample correction method given the small number of clusters in the analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p>

There is no agreed upon benchmark for high quality OUD treatment, and an increase of this magnitude, which could reflect a fivefold increase in the number of patients who access and/or are retained in treatment, was felt to be clinically-relevant and a substantial enough increase to convince policy-makers. Simulations, using PROUD phase 1 data, were conducted to calculate power under the planned analytic approach, as described above (mixed-effect regression model that adjusts for the baseline value of the outcome), with a one-sided test with a type 1 error rate of 0.05. Parameter values for the simulation were estimated using Phase 1 data on the 12 clinics recruited into the PROUD trial (two clinics from each health system). Details on the data-generating model for the simulation along with the specific parameter values are in the study Statistical Analysis Plan (available from authors). Based on these simulations, the PROUD trial is estimated to have at least 80% power to detect a 30% increase in the number of OUD-treated days per patient seen in PC. Because 30% is far smaller than the fivefold (400%) clinically- or policy-meaningful increase, the study is sufficiently powered with two clinics in each of six health care systems to detect the targeted fivefold increase in the primary outcome measure.</p>

                  <p id="Par75">Power calculations for Objective 2 used simulations to calculate the power to detect a reduction in acute care utilization among patients with an OUD diagnosis pre-randomization, comparing PROUD intervention versus Usual PC clinics, under a range of assumed values of the effect size, as well as a range of assumed values for the proportion of patients with OUD treated by the PROUD NCM. Outcome data on acute care utilization for simulations were generated using a Poisson mixed-effect model with sample size and parameters estimated using Phase 1 data for the 12 clinics recruited into the PROUD trial. These simulations assumed that among patients with OUD in the PROUD intervention clinic, those who visit the PROUD NCM and receive sustained treatment with buprenorphine or XR-NTX would have 10‚Äì20% of the rate of acute care utilization (i.e., a relative rate <inline-formula id="IEq10"><alternatives><tex-math id="M21">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par77">Despite the availability of first-line medication¬†treatment for OUD that can be provided in PC, many practices do not offer such treatment. The PROUD trial seeks to address this gap by implementing a promising model, the MA model, into PC to engage patients in OUD treatment in medical settings. The MA Model is a collaborative care model designed to support treatment of OUD in PC practices by providing nurse support for all elements of care, except OUD diagnosis and medication prescribing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. This model of shared-care between a PC provider and NCM was also designed to address knowledge gaps, lack of time, need for clinic support, and stigma, which are common barriers to treatment of OUD in PC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Promising reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] suggest that the MA Model allows a nurse to develop deep expertise in OUD treatment, supported by national experts, as a way to improve access, overcome stigma and support the development of local PC expertise in OUD treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The model also allows PC providers to treat many more patients with OUD than they could alone‚Äîup to 100 per NCM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The PROUD trial is designed to provide information for clinical leaders and policy makers regarding benefits and costs of the MA Model by testing the model in real-world PC settings in diverse health systems. The trial relies on health systems to implement the model and uses secondary data to identify the study samples and evaluate implementation and effectiveness outcomes. As a result, all PC patients who visited the randomized clinics over the study period are included in primary analyses. The PROUD trial can provide a roadmap for other health systems searching for a practical care model for OUD treatment in PC.</p>

                <title>Limitations and strengths</title>
                <p id="Par78">In this pragmatic trial that relies on EHR data for defining the primary and secondary outcomes, the data can be a limitation to the trial‚Äôs internal validity. For the primary outcome (days of medication treatment for OUD), orders for buprenorphine or XR-NTX in the EMR could be written and never dispensed or ingested (for oral medications), and patients could obtain OUD treatment outside the participating health systems -¬†including methadone from opioid treatment programs‚Äîthat may not be documented in the EHR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. There is no way to determine whether services were not provided or whether the data are missing, and external OUD treatment data are not included in the primary outcome measure because they are unavailable at most sites. However, randomization is stratified within health system and the participating health systems provide the vast majority of care for the populations they serve; therefore, limitations in outcome data should be similar in both arms within a site. Limitations of data sources are also addressed with sensitivity analyses which vary the specification of the outcome (e.g., to include dispensing of medications, insurance claims, and methadone data at sites where available) to estimate whether this meaningfully changes the main results. Incomplete ascertainment of acute care utilization could also under-estimate or bias results regarding effectiveness (Objective 2) as only two participating systems are health insurance plans with claims data. However, analyses of acute care utilization among patients with OUD are adjusted for patients‚Äô pre-randomization acute care utilization, and stratified randomization ensures that systematic differences in ascertainment between health systems are balanced across intervention groups. Another limitation is that only some adverse health effects of OUD lead to urgent, emergency, or hospital care, and although other outcomes are evaluated, many adverse outcomes of OUD cannot be ascertained from EHRs. Further, many PC patients with OUD do not have a documented OUD diagnosis and are therefore excluded from Objective 2 analyses, and others may leave or obtain care outside the health system, which can only be ascertained for the two systems with health insurance plans and claims data. However, sensitivity analyses are planned that include patients with documented OUD post-randomization or require PC visits post-randomization (as a proxy for continued enrollment). In addition, if the trial finds that the MA Model meaningfully increases OUD treatment, a future planned ancillary study will obtain population-based death data from the National Death Index to evaluate the intervention‚Äôs impact on death among patients with documented OUD.</p>
                <p id="Par79">Limitations to external validity relate to the cost of the nurse, which is not borne by the health systems, and the fact that sites recruited are a select group of clinics with a leader and/or clinicians willing to participate in the trial. The MA Model‚Äôs requirement for a large upfront investment in a full-time NCM and regional shortages of nurses might limit generalizability. However, additional observational comparisons evaluate outcomes in the PROUD intervention clinics compared to potentially more generalizable ‚Äúexemplar‚Äù models of OUD care already in place and compare recruited and randomized PC clinics to non-recruited PC clinics before randomization. Prior research suggests that some PC providers are not willing to prescribe, and models that utilize non-physicians may be needed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Finally, a limitation of using ‚Äúusual care‚Äù as a comparison is that its characteristics must be clearly described at baseline and changes over the course of a trial must be clearly ascertained and described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. To understand usual care provided in control clinics (and its generalizability), the Implementation Monitoring Team conducts robust assessment at baseline and monitoring throughout the study, with qualitative and quantitative data collected by each site‚Äôs PI and project manager, while avoiding contact between researchers and sites.</p>
                <p id="Par80">At the same time, the PROUD trial has important strengths related to its design, sample, and innovative measures allowing evaluation of the MA model in diverse naturalistic settings. The pragmatic design of the trial allows the study of a sample of patients with OUD seen in PC who seldom seek OUD treatment or enroll in trials. Further, the design allows evaluation of treatment engagement and acute care outcomes over a 2-year follow-up period. Each system agreed to implement the MA Model in one randomly selected PC clinic and to provide data from 3¬†years before and 2¬†years after randomization. The trial obtains adequate statistical power for a trial with 12 clinics by using a novel primary outcome measure of patient-days of medication treatment for OUD per 10,000 PC patients seen, which reflects both access and retention. The trial design also allows evaluation of the extent to which the MA Model attracts new patients into PC for OUD treatment or leads to newly recognized OUD in the intervention clinics. An innovative Implementation Monitoring Team assesses usual care at baseline and monitors usual care and intervention implementation over time, identifying barriers and facilitators in each system, which allows interpretation of variation in outcomes across sites. Further, the trial includes geographically diverse health systems that serve racially and ethnically diverse populations and have varying organization of health care delivery and financing, including two safety net systems, one academic system, one regional healthcare delivery system, and two systems that integrate health insurance with care delivery.</p>

              <p id="Par81">The PROUD trial is an innovative pragmatic trial that is evaluating the ability of the MA Model to improve access to and retention in OUD treatment in PC clinics in six diverse health systems. Results will provide critical evidence to help health system leaders evaluate whether investing upfront in a full-time NCM for OUD treatment increases OUD treatment in PC and decreases the need for acute care.</p>
