Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated to compare differences in cost per QALY gained among the 4 treatment strategies.ResultsIn the 2-year analysis, booster strategies (EX+MT+B and EX+B) dominated no-booster strategies, with both lower health care costs and greater effectiveness. EX+MT+B had the lowest total health care costs. EX+B cost${\$}$1061 more and gained 0.082 more QALYs than EX+MT+B, for an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of${\$}$12,900/QALY gained.LimitationsThe small number of total knee arthroplasty surgeries received by individuals in this study made the assessment of whether any particular strategy was more successful at delaying or preventing surgery in individuals with knee OA difficult.ConclusionsSpacing exercise-based physical therapy sessions over 12 months using periodic booster sessions was less costly and more effective over 2 years than strategies not containing booster sessions for individuals with knee OA.Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality10.13039/100000133AHRQ 1R01HS019642-02NIH10.13039/100000002) -->

A recent systematic review concluded that evidence regarding cost-effectiveness of surgical knee OA treatments is limited.<sup><xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> An economic analysis found various combinations of exercise and manual therapy were all more cost-effective than usual care (eg, physician visits, pharmaceuticals, knee injections) among New Zealanders with osteoarthritis.<sup><xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> However, it is unclear which treatment combination is most cost-effective for knee OA in the United States.</p>
            <p>To reduce knee OA–related pain and disability, exercise is an effective first-line intervention endorsed by professional organizations including the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, American College of Rheumatology, Osteoarthritis Research Society International, and European League Against Rheumatism.<sup><xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> A recent systematic review suggested that greater improvements may be achieved with an individually supervised exercise program rather than a group- or home-based program.<sup><xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup></p>
            <p>Evidence regarding manual therapy for individuals with knee OA is mixed,<sup><xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11,12</xref></sup> but recent studies suggest that it likely provides at least short-term benefits in pain and physical function and may be cost-saving compared to usual care.<sup><xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13,14</xref></sup> Recently published clinical effectiveness results of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) also support the presence of short-term benefits of manual therapy for knee OA.<sup><xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup></p>
            <p>Current evidence is conflicting regarding whether booster physical therapy sessions sustain rehabilitation benefits over longer periods. Booster sessions are supervised sessions occurring weeks or months following the initial formal supervised program and may aid in progression of an independent home program and motivate the patient to continue the program.<sup><xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> We recently found similar clinical effectiveness at 1-year follow-up between physical therapy strategies that did and did not include booster sessions.<sup><xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Other recent evidence is conflicting, with 2 studies noting positive clinical benefits of booster sessions for those with knee OA and a third study finding no benefit.<sup><xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> The cost-effectiveness of booster sessions has not been studied.</p>
            <p>The clinical effects of the 4 physical therapy strategies studied in the present RCT were similarly positive, further supporting the effectiveness of exercise but providing conflicting information regarding whether manual therapy and/or booster sessions enhance the magnitude or persistence of benefits from exercise therapy.<sup><xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> These findings warrant further investigation to determine whether different physical therapy strategies are equally effective, but 1 strategy costs substantially less. Dissemination and implementation of that strategy may provide substantial cost savings and inform payer and provider policies regarding delivery of physical therapy services for knee OA. In the present economic evaluation conducted alongside a 2-year RCT,<sup><xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> we evaluated the cost-effectiveness of 4 combinations of exercise therapy, manual therapy, and booster sessions provided by physical therapists.</p>

All groups received similar exercise interventions focusing on strength and flexibility of hip and knee musculature. The manual therapy groups additionally received stretching and nonthrust knee joint mobilizations. Hip and ankle treatments were used if clinical examination indicated the presence of impairment in these joints. Additional details of the interventions are described elsewhere.<sup><xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup></p>
                <p>Individuals receiving booster sessions received 8 visits over 9 weeks, followed by 4 additional booster sessions spaced across 1 year. Booster sessions were periodic face-to-face appointments with the treating physical therapist. At each booster session, the physical therapist reviewed the home exercise program with the participant, discussed problems, and made recommendations for progression or modification of the program. Although individuals receiving booster sessions had a reduced frequency of initial physical therapy (8 visits over 9 weeks) compared to the 1 to 3 visits per week commonly used in outpatient physical therapy care, the overall dosage of physical therapy was equal across both groups (12 total visits). Individuals not receiving booster sessions received 12 physical therapy sessions across 9 weeks.</p>

                  <title>Model construction</title>
                  <p>Markov state-transition modeling was used to estimate the cost-effectiveness of the 4 physical therapy strategies. Primary physical function data collected from each study participant over the 2-year period were entered into the model to depict the functional and surgical status of each study participant over time. Although a trial-based cost-effectiveness model would provide extremely similar results to modeling for the base case analysis, modeling was selected in favor of a trial-based cost-effectiveness analysis method for 2 primary reasons. First, modeling allows robust sensitivity analysis, with systematic variation of each parameter over empiric ranges, including the probability of adverse events not observed in the sample. Second, modeling allows projection of data beyond the observation period.</p>
                  <p>There are several possible Markov health states that a participant could be in at any point in time (see Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1</xref> for a schematic depiction of health states). All study participants were assumed to be in a state of “poor/worsening function” upon entry to the study. Transitions between states were dependent upon whether each participant underwent surgery of the affected knee and whether the WOMAC score improved or declined beyond the published minimum clinically important difference (16-point improvement or 33-point decline on the 240-point version of the scale).<sup><xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> Transitions between states were averaged across each time period. For example, if 12 individuals had “good function” at the 1-year follow-up and “poor function” at the 2-year follow-up, then the model assumed that 1 individual per month had transitioned from good function to poor function. Individuals whose baseline WOMAC score was too low to improve beyond the minimum clinically important difference (ie, the participant was too highly functioning) were excluded from the analysis. Otherwise, missing data (which totaled 7.5% of data because of dropouts during the study) was handled by imputing the mean value for the missing variable. Death was assumed possible only as a complication from surgery.</p>
                  <p>The model does not depict the possibility of a person moving directly from “good/improving function” to any of the surgical states. Logically, a person who is functioning well would not undergo surgery. However, since our WOMAC data were only collected at baseline, 9 weeks, 1 year, and 2 years, a few individuals did indeed progress directly from good/improving function to arthroscopy or total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The probability of doing so varied from 0 to 0.043; this direct transition was accounted for in the model but is not depicted in Figure<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1</xref> or Table<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">2</xref> for the sake of simplicity.</p>

In addition, a probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) was performed to account for sampling and parameter uncertainty.<sup><xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> All parameter values were varied simultaneously over distributions 5000 times. Triangular distributions were used for most variables, and uniform distributions were used when data were sparse.

                  <p>Short-term reductions in utility were expressed for 5 scenarios (arthroscopy with or without complication, TKA with or without complication, and hospitalization because of complications from medical treatment of knee OA). For each scenario, the number of days of disutility were expressed as the median length of stay; minimum and maximum values were the median length of stay plus/minus the standard error.<sup><xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27,28</xref></sup> We assumed those days were worth zero utility and were essentially QALYs lost; in a sensitivity analysis, we varied this over a utility range of 0.0 to 1.0.</p>
                  <p>Our base case scenario had a 2-year time horizon, based on the duration of study data collection. The Markov cycle length was 1 month (a participant must remain in a health state for 1 month; at the end of the monthly cycle, the participant may move into a different health state depending upon functional and surgical status). State transition probabilities were averaged over time to account for the fact that data were not collected monthly.</p>

              <p>Only 1 parameter was revealed to potentially change the preferred strategy in a 1-way sensitivity analysis.

              <p>In a post hoc analysis, we calculated incremental costs and effectiveness between the 4 strategies after including the 6 participants who had been excluded from the base case calculations because of a ceiling effect on the WOMAC. This did not change the preferred strategy; the EX+MT+B strategy remained the least costly and was dominant over nonbooster strategies.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Our results indicate physical therapy strategies using booster sessions, where physical therapy sessions are distributed over 1 year, result in greater effectiveness and lower health care utilization than nonbooster strategies (all allotted sessions delivered within 9 weeks). In nearly every plausible scenario, the preferred strategy in our cost-effective analysis was a combination of exercise and booster sessions, with or without manual therapy.</p>
              <p>Clinical effectiveness results of this trial (published elsewhere) indicated that all 4 treatment strategies were associated with marked improvement in physical function, but no single strategy resulted in superior WOMAC scores compared to the others.<sup><xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Because it may be argued that all 4 strategies may result in similar clinical improvement, determining cost-effectiveness is important because both clinicians and insurers may want to select the strategy that is least costly or provides the greatest improvement in quality of life. Therefore, these results support the adoption of booster sessions in the physical therapy management of knee OA.</p>
              <p>A strength of this study is that data were collected directly from participants over 2 years. It was important to collect primary data for this analysis because little information is available regarding the use of booster sessions for patients in the United States; therefore, reliance upon existing literature would have significant limitations. We did refer to existing literature to estimate probabilities and costs when appropriate. Because of the breadth of information needed to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis, it is relatively rare to have a data set based on actual measurements of most parameters as opposed to estimation from the literature or expert opinion.</p>
              <p>Sensitivity analysis strongly supported the results of the study, as shown by the stability of the model. We varied all parameters across plausible ranges and/or 95% confidence intervals. Results indicate that all variables were stable across all plausible ranges. Preferred strategies changed only when varying parameters well beyond what was observed within the study. The PSA further supported the model's stability, indicating that strategies containing booster sessions are superior to those without booster sessions.</p>
              <p>Current clinical practice is influenced by payment models that encourage short episodes of physical therapy care with a specific number of visits over a discrete period. Our findings indicate spacing visits across longer periods may result in sustained improvements in function and decreased health care utilization. These sustained improvements would have a substantial impact on health and well-being for patients with knee OA. However, widespread adoption of booster sessions in physical therapy would require health insurers to consider innovative payment models.</p>
              <p>Literature examining the cost-effectiveness of physical therapy strategies to treat knee OA is scarce.<sup><xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> One well-known study in the United Kingdom, the ESCAPE knee pain trial, found that an exercise-based program consisting of 12 physical therapy visits was cost-effective over 30 months compared to usual care across willingness-to-pay thresholds up to £9750.<sup><xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> This analysis, however, was reported from the third-party payer perspective only while our base case analysis was performed from the societal perspective as recommended by the Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine.<sup><xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30,31</xref></sup></p>
              <p>One study examined the cost-effectiveness of a physical therapy strategy including physical activity promotion and booster sessions over 1 year compared to traditional guideline-based physical therapy for people with hip and/or knee OA.<sup><xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> Surprisingly, this study found large ICERs favoring usual physical therapy care. These results were largely driven by a lack of difference in effect between the 2 strategies. That study did not include manual therapy, and thus is not directly comparable to the strategies used in our study. In addition, that study was performed in the Netherlands; its information regarding costs and health care utilization are not generalizable to the United States.</p>
              <p>In the recent Management of Osteoarthritis (MOA) trial, Abbott et al<sup><xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> found that either exercise therapy or manual therapy was superior to usual care for individuals with hip and knee OA. The combination of exercise and manual therapy was beneficial, but less effective than exercise or manual therapy alone.<sup><xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Cost-effectiveness analysis revealed similar results: manual therapy was cost-saving; exercise therapy was cost-effective, while combination therapy and usual care were not as cost-effective.<sup><xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Our results within nonbooster strategies are fairly consistent with the MOA trial; the EX+MT group had higher costs and lower effectiveness than the EX group. However, results for the 2 booster strategies in the present trial are somewhat inconsistent with the findings of Abbott et al (the EX+MT+B group in the present study had lower costs and slightly lower effectiveness than the EX+B group). It is difficult to directly compare the 2 studies because we did not study manual therapy alone, and the MOA trial did not investigate booster sessions. However, dosage may play a role in the relative cost-effectiveness of different strategies. In the MOA trial, participants receiving combined manual and exercise therapy tended to receive less of each (eg, participants may receive 60 minutes of manual therapy, 60 minutes of exercise therapy, or 30 minutes of each). In our trial, participants who received combined manual therapy and exercise had longer physical therapy visits.</p>

              <title>Limitations</title>
              <p>A primary limitation in our study was the small number of TKA surgeries. This resulted in limited power to detect differences between strategies in the number of cases that progressed to TKA. If 1 strategy is superior in its ability to delay or eliminate the need for TKA, then that strategy would likely be the least costly. The study was not powered to detect differences in the number of TKAs undergone by participants in each group. A larger sample size and longer follow-up would be needed to investigate this issue. In addition, our estimates of utility scores for individuals with TKA are likely imprecise because of the small number of TKAs. However, we did vary utility scores from 0 to 1 in additional sensitivity analyses, and the preferred treatment strategy remained the same.</p>
              <p>We relied on participant self-report for utilization of common health care procedures such as knee radiographs, injections, and medications. Although our cost data were derived from publicly available databases and thus were accurate, it is possible that recall bias regarding utilization impacted the overall calculation of health care costs.<sup><xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19,20</xref></sup> However, the Osteoarthritis Cost and Consequences Questionnaire has been validated against reference-standard provider databases over 3 months and similar cost questionnaires have been validated over longer periods of time.<sup><xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33,34</xref></sup></p>
              <p>To capture potential benefits of physical therapy strategies used beyond the 2-year follow-up, we used our Markov model to perform secondary analyses projected to a 5-year time horizon using the same probabilities observed over the 2-year period. It is possible that these probabilities would not have remained steady from year 2 to year 5, so the results of the 5-year projected analysis should be interpreted with caution.</p>
              <p>We followed guidelines for cost-effectiveness analysis that recommend using the societal perspective.<sup><xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> We did not include lost productivity, as it was not recommended by the Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine at the time this study was conducted. Because our analysis is from a societal perspective, our analysis is not generalizable to individual health care consumers or payers. These results may change if the analysis is performed from an individual or payer perspective.</p>
              <p>The trial on which this analysis was based did not include a usual care group because the trial's purpose was to compare different strategies of physical therapy for individuals with knee OA. This precludes us from comparing cost-effectiveness between usual care and structured rehabilitation. However, because most clinical practice guidelines recommend physical therapy or supervised exercise as a first-line treatment for knee OA, we feel that the present study provides policy-relevant information to the field of physical therapy.</p>

              <title>Future Directions</title>
              <p>Our findings suggested that people with knee OA may benefit from a policy shift allowing longer episodes of physical therapy care with periodic boosters to promote long-term maintenance of improvements. Innovative payment models, including bundled care and pay-for-performance, may be the first step toward adoption of cost-effective nonsurgical management of knee OA. Future research should comprehensively study progression to TKA or other costly surgery in a larger sample, as well as the potential influence of various physical therapy strategies on this progression.</p>
