                <p id="Par1">The human capacity to master multiple languages is remarkable and leads to structural and functional changes in the brain. Understanding how the brain accommodates multiple languages simultaneously is crucial to developing a complete picture of our species’ linguistic capabilities. To examine the neural mechanisms involved in processing two languages, we looked at cortical activation in Spanish-English bilinguals in response to phonological competition either <italic>between</italic> two languages or <italic>within</italic> a language. Participants recognized spoken words in a visual world task while their brains were scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Results revealed that <italic>between</italic>-language competition recruited a larger network of frontal control and basal ganglia regions than <italic>within</italic>-language competition. Bilinguals also recruited more neural resources to manage between-language competition from the dominant language compared to competition from the less dominant language. Additionally, bilinguals’ activation of the basal ganglia was inversely correlated with their executive function ability, suggesting that bilinguals compensated for lower levels of cognitive control by recruiting a broader neural network to manage more difficult tasks. These results provide evidence for differences in neural responses to linguistic competition <italic>between</italic> versus <italic>within</italic> languages, and demonstrate the brain’s remarkable plasticity, where language experience can change neural processing.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="Par2">One of the most groundbreaking and exciting findings in neuroscience in recent decades is the extent to which experience changes the brain. Whether it is due to musical training<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, spatial navigation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, or motor skill development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, the brain remains highly plastic throughout life. Of all human experiences, language use has arguably the greatest potential to generate widespread neural changes, given its fundamental role in human function and the broad neural network essential to language processing. One example of a linguistically and cognitively demanding experience that causes substantial structural<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> and functional<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> changes in the brain is bilingualism. Bilinguals’ ability to switch between languages and maintain separation between them may appear effortless, but this seamlessness masks a complex interactive cognitive architecture. The aim of the current investigation is to examine the neural mechanisms enabling bilinguals to control their two languages during spoken language comprehension.</p>
              <p id="Par3">The need to maintain two languages provides unique challenges for bilinguals and affects neural processing of language and executive function. For example, behavioral and neuroimaging studies have shown that when bilinguals perform a language comprehension task in one language, the other non-target language also becomes activated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Because bilinguals’ two languages are consistently coactivated, bilinguals’ brains adapt to manage language access differently than monolinguals. This experience managing linguistic activation appears to also extend to non-linguistic tasks. For example, bilinguals’ use of executive function in non-linguistic attentional control tasks has revealed differences compared to monolinguals in the recruitment of structures such as the prefrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par4">Activation of non-target words during language comprehension is not itself unique to bilinguals. As listeners hear speech input unfold over time, similar-sounding words become activated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. These lexical items compete for selection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, and must be inhibited before language comprehension can proceed. Both monolingual<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> and bilingual listeners<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> experience lexical competition during spoken language comprehension. Compared to monolinguals who face phonological competition only within a single language, bilinguals experience competition both within one language as well as between their two languages. For example, when Russian-English bilinguals are instructed (in one language only) to find an item on a visual display (e.g., “Click on the <italic>shovel</italic>”), they make eye movements to objects that are phonologically similar both in English (<italic>shark</italic>) and in Russian (<italic>sharik</italic>, Russian for “balloon”)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Bilinguals’ fixations to both between- and within-language competitor objects, even when only one language is being used, suggest that lexical items in both languages are activated simultaneously.</p>
              <p id="Par5">Due to the highly interactive nature of a bilinguals’ two languages, cognitive control mechanisms are required to overcome competition. This suggests that bilinguals’ management of linguistic competition may be associated with their general executive control abilities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Indeed, bilinguals have been shown to use general executive control to manage switching between their two languages in production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> and comprehension<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. The link between executive control resources and the management of phonological competition within a single language has also been investigated and revealed that bilinguals recruit an efficient network of control regions to overcome within-language competition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. This efficient deployment of neural resources observed in bilinguals provides additional empirical support for the recently-proposed Bilingual Anterior to Posterior and Subcortical Shift model (BAPSS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. The BAPSS model proposes that, with increased second language experience, bilinguals shift their processing load during executive tasks from frontal control areas, like the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate, to posterior perceptual areas and subcortical regions, such as the basal ganglia.</p>
              <p id="Par6">The present research aims to use phonological competition resolution to look at cortical processing of between- and within-language competition. The neural underpinnings of phonological competition within a single language have been shown in both monolingual and bilingual speakers. For example, English monolingual speakers activate frontal and temporal language regions in response to phonological competition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, particularly the left supramarginal gyrus and the left inferior frontal gyrus. For bilinguals, the neural correlates of overcoming competition arising within a single language have been elucidated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, but the cortical regions subserving between-language competition remain unknown. In response to within-language competition, bilinguals’ brains efficiently recruit frontal executive control regions, as they are able to manage competition without exhausting additional cortical resources relative to when competition is not present. Phonological competition that occurs between two languages, however, may present additional challenges for the bilingual, because of the additional need to control activation of the non-target language. In the current paper, we seek to compare how phonological competition that emerges between two languages and competition arising within a single language are managed in bilinguals.</p>
              <p id="Par7">The two main objectives of the present study are: (1) To compare the neural resources required to overcome between-language versus within-language competition; and (2) To examine the relationship between language coactivation and cognitive control. We predict that when confronted with between-language competition, bilingual listeners will recruit a broader network of frontal-control regions than that required by within-language competition. Because of the link between linguistic and non-linguistic cognitive control, we expect that individual differences in inhibitory control skill will be related to degree of neural activation in response to phonological competition.</p>

              <title>Results</title>
              <p id="Par8">To examine the neural mechanisms involved in processing two languages, we compared cortical activation in Spanish-English bilinguals in response to between- versus within-language phonological competition. Participants completed a spoken word recognition task using the visual world paradigm while in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanner, under four experimental conditions: English within-language (English target, English competitor), English between-language (English target, Spanish competitor), Spanish within-language (Spanish target, Spanish competitor), and Spanish between-language (Spanish target, English competitor). Neural responses to phonological competitors were compared to baseline trials where no phonological competitors were present. In addition, participants completed assessments of phonological working memory, inhibitory control, and language proficiency outside the scanner.</p>

                <title>Accuracy and Response Time</title>
                <p id="Par9">For both accuracy and RT, the effects of Competition (competitor, unrelated), Language (target in English or in Spanish), and Type (between-language, within-language) and their interactions were analyzed using logistic (for accuracy) or linear (for RT) mixed effect regression (using the lme4 package<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> in the R statistical computing environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>), including subject and item as random effects.</p>
                <p id="Par10">Accuracy was high overall (<italic>M</italic> = 91.57%, <italic>SD</italic> = 27.79) and there were no significant main effects, but there was a significant Language by Type interaction (<italic>Estimate</italic> = 19.4, <italic>SE</italic> = 9.0, <italic>z</italic> = 2.161, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Follow-up pairwise comparisons did not reveal any significant differences between the four levels of Language and Type (<italic>p</italic>s &gt; 0.1). To account for a crossover interaction of Language and Type, we ran a new model including fixed effects of Competition, Target-Language, and Competitor-Language. This follow-up model was used to determine whether the language of the competitor, rather than its relation to the target (i.e., within- or between-languages) affected accuracy. We found a significant main effect of Competitor-Language (<italic>Estimate</italic> = 9.7, <italic>SE</italic> = 4.5, <italic>z</italic> = 2.161, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), with lower accuracy for the English-Competitor condition, 86.67%, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.032, compared to the Spanish-Competitor condition 96.35%, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.032. These results indicate that as a competing language, English, which was the participants’ dominant language, affected task performance more than Spanish did. Outlier RTs (greater than the global mean plus two standard deviations) were replaced with M + 2.5 SDs (2.80% of trials). RTs on correct trials were 1785.18ms (<italic>SD</italic> = 383.35) overall. No significant main effects or interactions were observed (the same pattern of results was observed in an analysis removing outlier RTs entirely, with no significant main effects or interactions).</p>

              <p id="Par20">Bilinguals’ ability to seamlessly switch between two distinct communication systems masks the considerable control exerted at the neural level. Spoken language comprehension is especially taxing, because the bilingual listener does not control the language of the input, and spoken words unfold gradually over time. To cope with this uncertainty in the input, bilinguals start by activating words in both languages that partially overlap with the auditory signal before selecting the best match. The current study examined the neural networks involved in processing two languages, offering the first comparison of how bilinguals control phonological competition that arises between both of their languages or within one language.</p>
              <p id="Par21">We found that the size and type of the neural network that bilinguals recruited to resolve phonological competition differed depending on the source of competition. When competition occurred between two languages, bilinguals recruited additional frontal control and subcortical regions, specifically the right middle frontal gyrus, superior frontal gyrus, caudate, and putamen, compared to competition that occurred within a single language. This difference in recruitment of brain regions suggests that between-language competition may require additional effort to suppress activation of the non-target language. Increased putamen and caudate activity in the between-language condition relative to the within-language condition is also in line with research suggesting that these areas are involved in cognitive and motor control<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. The neural patterns observed in the present experiment provide additional empirical support for the BAPSS model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> and are consistent with the model’s proposal that between-language competition is initially managed by an extensive network of frontal regions, but later relies less on the frontal network and more on subcortical structures, such as the putamen and caudate. Even within our group of highly proficient bilinguals, the activation of subcortical structures was found to be related to small differences in proficiency. Specifically, as proficiency in the non-dominant language increased, so too did activation in the putamen in response to competition that occurred between languages.</p>
              <p id="Par22">We also found that the neural mechanisms recruited by bilinguals to resolve phonological competition differed depending on the language of competition. Specifically, relative proficiency in the two languages made a greater difference than age of acquisition in determining neural activation. The language with higher proficiency, English, showed more extensive activity than participants’ native language, Spanish. This is consistent with previous literature on bilingual language processing, showing that proficiency is more important than age of acquisition in determining cortical activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Although counterintuitive, earlier age of acquisition does not always lead to higher proficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, as is the case for the participants in the current study, who were Spanish native and English dominant, due to growing up in a country where English was the majority language, including in all academic settings. During between-language competition, when bilinguals received auditory input in Spanish and faced competition from English (the more dominant language), additional frontal control regions were recruited, including the right middle frontal gyrus and superior frontal gyrus, compared to when they received input in English and faced competition from Spanish (the less dominant language). This neural pattern suggests that additional cognitive resources are required to suppress competition from the more dominant language than competition from the less dominant language. These results are in line with cognitive models such as the Revised Hierarchical Model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, which propose that bilinguals access words differently as their second language proficiency increases; specifically, access to the second language may become more automatic with increasing proficiency, rather than controlled. Just as bilinguals with higher second language proficiencies have been shown to have decreased prefrontal activation relative to low-proficiency bilinguals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>, bilinguals in the current study also showed less activation of frontal control regions when processing target words in English, which, although acquired second, was their dominant and more automatic and proficient language. Thus, proficiency in a language may be more important than age of acquisition for predicting the degree of competition experienced across languages.</p>
              <p id="Par23">Notably, these neural differences in response to phonological competition were observed despite minimal behavioral effects (i.e., accuracy and RT). In visual world tasks, phonological competition does not always have an effect on accuracy or RT, and is often only detected with more sensitive measures like eye-tracking or mouse-tracking<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. We did find an interaction between language and competition type in accuracy, where the two conditions that included English competitors (i.e., English within-language and Spanish between-language) were responded to less accurately than the conditions that included Spanish competitors (i.e., Spanish within-language and English between-language). These findings are consistent with the neural results, which indicated that the more proficient and more dominant language exerted a stronger competition effect than the less proficient and less dominant language.</p>
              <p id="Par24">Looking at the functional neuroimaging data, we did not find significant differences in neural activation for within-language competition relative to baseline. There may be two factors contributing to this lack of an effect. First, bilinguals may have more experience resolving within-language competition, as words tend to have more within-language than between-language competitors due to phonological differences across languages. Second, because within-language competition does not increase activation of the non-target language, it may require fewer resources to resolve. There were also no significant differences in brain activation when participants heard English cues and faced competition from Spanish, compared to baseline. This finding could potentially be explained by the source of linguistic competition. Because English is the participants’ more dominant language, facing competition from the less dominant language, Spanish, may be cognitively less taxing and does not require additional neural resources to resolve<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par25">Additionally, correlations between bilinguals’ activation of the basal ganglia and Simon inhibition scores indicate that bilinguals with lower cognitive control may compensate by increasing basal ganglia recruitment during more difficult tasks (i.e., between-language competition). This suggests that bilinguals are able to flexibly deploy the necessary neural resources to meet the needs of more complex tasks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par26">In conclusion, bilinguals differ in how they respond to spoken-word competition, depending on whether the source is between- or within-language, or from the more proficient or less proficient language. Specifically, <italic>between</italic>-language competition recruits a larger network of frontal control and basal ganglia regions than <italic>within</italic>-language competition, and competition from the dominant language recruits more neural resources than competition from the less dominant language. Additionally, during more taxing language tasks, bilinguals compensate for lower inhibitory control ability by increasing their activation of the basal ganglia. These findings demonstrate the considerable neural plasticity that enables bilinguals to process speech in spite of linguistic competition from multiple sources.</p>

                <p id="Par36">During the fMRI session, participants were familiarized with the fMRI scanner and all procedures. Participants were given sound-dampening headphones to reduce scanner noise, a squeeze ball to signal the fMRI technician, and a four-button button box. A display of four images was projected onto a mirrored screen, and participants heard auditory instructions to locate one of the four images.</p>

A four-item visual search display was shown for 500 ms before participants heard an auditory target word (spoken by a male Spanish-English bilingual) at 48 Khz, amplitude-normalized. Following the auditory token, the search display remained on the screen for 2500 ms; participants used the button box to indicate target location. Each visual quadrant corresponded to a single button (the bottom left button corresponded to the bottom left quadrant, etc.). Stimuli were presented using E-Prime 2.0 software (Psychology Software Tools, Pittsburgh, PA) in an event-related design with an inter-stimulus interval between 4.5–11.7 seconds.</p>
                <p id="Par38">Following the search task, participants named all competitor pictures in English and Spanish while seated at a computer outside the scanner. Trials in which participants failed to provide a name, or provided an incorrect name were removed from all analyses (6.72% of English trials, 13.6% of Spanish trials).</p>

A 2 (condition: between-language, within-language) × 2 (language: English, Spanish) within-subject ANOVA assessed main effects of condition and language on phonological competition.

Based on cortical activation during linguistic competition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>, analyses were restricted to an ROI including bilateral inferior frontal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, superior frontal gyrus, inferior parietal lobule, superior parietal lobule, anterior cingulate, and basal ganglia using anatomical definitions in the AAL template<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>.

                  <p id="Par43">The relationship between proficiency, inhibitory control, and cortical activation in response to phonological competition was examined using individual effect sizes in task-identified regions of interest (ROIs) following a leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) approach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. Sixteen separate LOSO GLMs were performed, each with n = 15. Task-activated ROIs were identified in each model using the same procedure as the full analysis (ROIs identified in less than a third of LOSO GLMs were not analyzed further). For each participant, mean beta weights for within-English, between-English, within-Spanish, and between-Spanish competition effects were calculated in each ROI from the LOSO GLM that excluded that participant, preserving independence of ROI selection and measured task activation. Mean beta weights were correlated with participants’ language proficiency, Simon inhibition scores (RT on incongruent trials minus RT on neutral trials) and overall Simon task RTs. Simon inhibition scores were used instead of the classic Simon effect (i.e., incongruent minus congruent), as the former provides a more targeted measure of interference suppression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>.</p>
