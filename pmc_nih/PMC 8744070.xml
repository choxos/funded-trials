              <abstract id="ABS1">
                <p id="P2">Ibrutinib has superior progression-free survival compared with bendamustine plus rituximab (BR) in older CLL patients, however differences in treatment duration, 6 monthly BR cycles versus continuous ibrutinib, complicate adverse event (AE) comparisons. We introduce the AE burden score (<italic>AE</italic><sub><italic>sc</italic></sub>) to compare AEs, calculated for each patient by summing over products of reporting period length and grade for each all-cause grade 1–4 AE and dividing by the length of time over which AEs are assessed. 176 patients received BR and 361 ibrutinib alone or with 6 cycles of rituximab. At 38 months median follow-up, 64% remained on ibrutinib. Median <italic>AE</italic><sub><italic>sc</italic></sub> was higher with BR versus ibrutinib in the first 6 cycles (7.2 versus 4.9, p&lt;0.0001). Within ibrutinib arms, median <italic>AE</italic><sub><italic>sc</italic></sub> decreased significantly to 3.7 after 6 cycles (p&lt;0.0001). 10% and 14% of BR and ibrutinib patients discontinued treatment for AEs. In ibrutinib arms, cumulative incidence of grade 3 or higher atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and infection (AEs of clinical interest) at 12 months was 4.5%, 17.5%, and 12.8%, respectively, and increased more slowly thereafter to 7.7%, 25.4%, and 20.5% at 36 months. Analytical tools including the <italic>AE</italic><sub><italic>sc</italic></sub> and cumulative incidence of AEs can help to better characterize AE burden over time.</p>

              <p id="P3">Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a disease of older patients, with a median age of diagnosis of 72 years.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Older patients often present with co-morbidities and have increased risk of adverse events (AEs) with therapy, leading to delays or discontinuation of treatment, and worse clinical outcomes than their younger counterparts.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> A common side effect with chemotherapy and chemo-immunotherapy, such as chlorambucil or bendamustine plus rituximab (BR) for older patients, is myelosuppression,<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> which in addition to CLL-associated immune dysfunction places patients at high risk for infection.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p>
              <p id="P4">Ibrutinib is an oral Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor that has altered the natural history of CLL in both younger and older patients. Specific to previously untreated patients with CLL aged ≥ 65 years and without high-risk del(17p), the RESONATE-2 study showed that ibrutinib significantly extended progression-free survival (PFS; p&lt;0.001) and overall survival (OS; p=0.001) compared with chlorambucil, and significantly improved quality of life (p=0.0013).<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> In the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology (Alliance) A041202 study of newly diagnosed patients with CLL aged ≥ 65 years with or without high-risk del(17p), ibrutinib (with or without rituximab) significantly extended PFS compared with BR (p&lt;0.001).<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p>
              <p id="P5">Unlike chemotherapy and chemo-immunotherapy regimens that are administered for a fixed duration (e.g. six 28-day cycles), ibrutinib is standardly administered continuously until disease progression. Although ibrutinib is well-tolerated by most previously untreated older patients, concerns for cardiotoxicity including atrial fibrillation and hypertension and risk of serious infections has emerged. Among 135 patients on the RESONATE-2 trial and with a median time on ibrutinib of 28.5 months, grade 3 or higher all-cause atrial fibrillation was reported in 4%, hypertension in 5%, and infections in 23%. In that study, cardiotoxicity improved or resolved within days or a few weeks, rarely leading to discontinuation of therapy, and infections occurred most frequently in the first year of ibrutinib.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> On A041202 and with a median time on ibrutinib of 32 months, grade 3 or higher all-cause atrial fibrillation and hypertension rates were 7% and 32% in 361 patients versus 3% and 14% in 176 patients receiving a fixed duration of BR.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> The rates of grade 3 or higher all-cause infections were not significantly different in those receiving ibrutinib regimens versus BR (20% versus 15%).<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p>
              <p id="P6">On A041202, differences in treatment duration for BR versus ibrutinib regimens complicated AE comparisons. Further, the common practice of reporting the highest grade of an AE and focusing on grade ≥3 AEs could mask the global AE burden of a particular therapy in which persistent but low-grade AEs are not considered, thereby potentially confounding AE comparisons. In this manuscript, additional safety analyses for patients treated on A041202 are performed, specifically by: 1) defining a global AE score and comparing the AE score across treatment groups and time; 2) providing a comprehensive assessment of the cumulative incidence of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and infections; and 3) describing outcomes following ibrutinib discontinuation due to AEs.</p>

                <p id="P7">Alliance A041202 was a randomized, open-label, phase 3 trial in adults aged 65 years or older with previously untreated CLL for whom treatment was indicated. Patients were randomized (1:1:1) to receive six 28-day cycles of BR (arm A) followed by observation until disease progression, ibrutinib 420 mg daily until disease progression (I, arm B), or ibrutinib 420 mg daily until disease progression with rituximab for the first 6 cycles (IR, arm C). Patients randomized to arm A could cross over to receive ibrutinib within 1 year after documented disease progression. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), defined and reported previously.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p>

                <p id="P8">AEs were routinely assessed and graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Mild, moderate, severe, or life-threatening AEs were assigned grades 1 to 4, respectively, with grade 5 indicating death. Each AE had an attribution assigned ranging from definitely unrelated to definitely related to treatment. AEs were assessed every 28 days during cycles 1–6 of treatment and then every 3 cycles (84 days), either in observation or on treatment, until disease progression. The highest grade of each AE type occurring during an assessment period was captured. All-cause AEs (regardless of attribution) are used in these analyses.</p>

To illustrate the comparison of <italic>AE</italic><sub><italic>sc</italic></sub> across time, we calculated scores using AEs assessed during the first 6 cycles and after 6 cycles of treatment.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="P22">In this analysis of older patients with previously untreated CLL, patients receiving BR had a significantly higher AE burden in the first 6 cycles of treatment compared to those receiving IBR. After 6 cycles of treatment, the AE burden within the IBR group decreased significantly. These data were supported when evaluating AEs of clinical interest, in which the cumulative incidence of grade 3 or higher atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and infections increased more slowly after the first 6–12 months of IBR. Importantly, there was no significant difference in the treatment discontinuation rate due to AEs between BR and IBR groups.</p>
              <p id="P23">The AE score characterizing an AE burden experience is easily calculated by summing over the products of reporting period length and grade recorded for each AE and dividing by the length of time over which AEs are assessed. The AE score is flexible and can incorporate lower grade AEs, some which might persist over long time periods. It can also be used to summarize the AE burden related to certain body systems, types of AEs, or to compare the AE burden of a treatment regimen between subgroups. Standardizing the AE score by length of time over which AEs are assessed provides a simple mechanism to compare and contrast the AE burden between time periods. We used the AE score to better depict the AE burden during a period of planned active therapy for all patients. This is more desirable than the secondary AE analysis in the original publication of A041202 that included standard AE summary tables for patients during active treatment, which was confounded by the different lengths of treatment for each group.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> We also used the AE score within the IBR group to depict the decrease in AE burden between the first 6 cycles and after 6 cycles of therapy. Considering the element of time in AE reporting is advocated to help provide a more complete assessment of AEs.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup></p>
              <p id="P24">A number of AE scores have been proposed in an effort to quantify the global toxicity burden of patients treated on clinical trials. Carbini, Suárez-Fariñas, and Maki developed a weighted toxicity score (WTS),<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> that correlated with dose reduction rates. Trotti and colleagues proposed a score combining AEs (TAME), but only considered high-grade AEs.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Lee and colleagues developed a toxicity burden score (TBS) using a weighted sum to define dose-limiting toxicity in phase 1 trials.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> The novel AE score proposed by us and others is different in that it considers all grades of individual AEs and all occurrences of individual AEs, not just the highest grade of an individual AE that represents a single occurrence.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> This is relevant since a recent study in colon cancer showed that a cumulative toxicity score for all grades predicted quality of life measures better than a score considering only higher grades.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup></p>
              <p id="P25">For AE scores and AE tabulations to be useful, AE reporting must be reliable and standardized across institutions and studies. The definitions and grading of AEs in cancer clinical trials has been standardized through the use of the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE).<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> However, the current 5-tier attribution system for assigning causality of study treatment to AEs (definitely related, probably related, possibly related, unlikely related, and unrelated) is subjective with great variability in assignments from person-to-person, site-to-site.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> For this reason, we included all-cause AEs in the calculation of AE scores and in the analysis of individual AEs. As a result of the complexity of AE data and the heterogeneous collection and reporting of AE data, a toxicity-attribution workshop convened and published guidelines, including simplification of the attribution system, reporting of all-cause AEs in addition to or in place of treatment-related AEs.<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup></p>
              <p id="P26">Data from A041202 illustrated how every piece of AE data collected could be summarized and used to make comparisons in AE burden between treatment groups and across time. However, we recognize limitations in comparisons due to differences in AE collection between groups. For BR and IBR groups, decreased neutrophil or platelet count, rash maculo-papular, fatigue, cough, diarrhea, edema limbs, dizziness, dyspepsia, anemia, hypertension, and bruising were solicited, and unsolicited AEs of any grade or attribution were captured during the first 6 cycles of treatment. After 6 cycles of treatment, solicited and unsolicited AEs were captured for patients continuing ibrutinib treatment, but only unsolicited, treatment-related grade 1–2 and all-cause grade 3–4 AEs were captured for patients in observation after BR. The most meaningful comparison of <italic>AE</italic><sub><italic>sc</italic></sub> is therefore between BR and IBR groups during the first 6 cycles of treatment. Within the IBR group, we showed a decrease in <italic>AE</italic><sub><italic>sc</italic></sub> after 6 cycles compared to the first 6 cycles. This decrease might be more pronounced if AE start and end dates were used to calculate reporting lengths, but only AE reporting periods were available (approximately 1 cycle for each of the first 6 cycles and 3 cycles after 6 cycles) which resulted in an AE occurring after 6 cycles receiving more weight. Conversely, it is possible that patients treated with IBR for extended periods of time fail to continue to report the same AE repeatedly, which would result in a seemingly lower <italic>AE</italic><sub><italic>sc</italic></sub> after 6 cycles. <italic>AE</italic><sub><italic>sc</italic></sub> (grades 1–4) comparisons between BR and IBR groups after 6 cycles of treatment and overall are less meaningful, since in the BR group, few grade 1/2 events were captured after cycle 6 resulting in an <italic>AE</italic><sub><italic>sc</italic></sub> biased low. This bias is likely mitigated for comparisons of <italic>AE</italic><sub><italic>sc</italic></sub> (grades 3–4), since these AEs were captured in a more similar manner between groups after cycle 6, and indeed there was no significant difference in the overall <italic>AEsc</italic> (grades 3–4) between BR and IBR groups. In general, the use of <italic>AE</italic><sub><italic>sc</italic></sub> may be best suited to compare the AE burden of therapies more similar in nature, such as continuous administration of BTK inhibitors, rather than the more divergent treatment regimens of fixed duration BR and continuous IBR.</p>
              <p id="P27">With respect to AEs of clinical interest, the estimated 3-year cumulative incidence of grade 3 or higher atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and infection for patients receiving IBR (n=361) were 7.7%, 25.4%, and 20.5%, respectively. The number of patients who crossed over to ibrutinib following progression with BR was small (n=30), but the rates of grade 3 or higher atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and infection were consistent. For reasons unclear, event rates reported in A041202 are higher than in RESONATE-2 (n=135),<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> but ibrutinib discontinuation rates as a result of AEs were similar, 14% in A041202 and 12% in RESONATE-2, suggesting that global AEs were likely similar between studies.</p>
              <p id="P28">Few patients treated on A041202 had fungal infections, but one patient treated on IBR had aspergillus identified. Fungal infections, specifically aspergillus, have been seen with BTK inhibitors, highlighting the importance of macrophage BTK in clearance of aspergillus.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Among heavily pre-treated patients in a large single-institution cohort,<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> 12 aspergillus infections were identified among 566 patients with a median onset of 4 months. No infections were seen in previously untreated patients. These data from A041202 support that the risk of fungal infections with ibrutinib is exceedingly low in previously untreated CLL patients.</p>
              <p id="P29">This study also demonstrates that after ibrutinib discontinuation for AEs, many patients will experience prolonged response durations. This has been suggested in the E1912 study of ibrutinib and rituximab versus fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab, with similar remission duration after ibrutinib between the trials.<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> This is significant because it demonstrates that after discontinuation for AEs, physicians do not need to rush to institute second-line therapy in the majority of patients. It also suggests that despite measurable disease remaining at ibrutinib discontinuation in the majority of patients, ibrutinib has likely cleared the bulk of disease-driving CLL cells, potentially leaving residual disease that does not have capacity to rapidly expand or has changed the microenvironment such that rapid progression is inhibited.</p>
              <p id="P30">In summary, while tabulated summaries of individual AE types by grade are important in understanding AE and toxicity profiles, analytical tools such as the AE score and the cumulative incidence of AEs are also useful. The AE score is easy to calculate and incorporates all AEs, including persistent lower-grade AEs that might not be captured with standard reporting of the highest grade AE. Cumulative incidence curves show the onset of AEs, characterizing the timing of AE occurrences in a way that simple rates do not. In this <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis of older patients with CLL treated on A041202, the AE burden was significantly higher with BR than IBR during the first 6 cycles of therapy. Among patients who completed 6 cycles of therapy with IBR, AE burden subsequently decreased with continued treatment. We also show that the onset of grade 3 or higher atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and infection is highest in the first year of IBR, and diminishes thereafter based on a cumulative incidence analysis. Even though overall conclusions regarding toxicity of the treatment regimens are unchanged from the original publication of results for A041202,<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> the AE score provides a standardized framework for understanding the global AE burden and can serve as an important tool in future studies to summarize and identify differences in AE data.</p>

                <p id="P36">The AE score (AE<sub>SC</sub>) is calculated for an individual patient by summing over the products of reporting period length and grade recorded for each AE and dividing by the length of time over which AEs were assessed. If AEs were assessed during a particular reporting period but the grade for an AE was blank, the grade of the AE was equal to 0. If AEs were not assessed during a particular reporting period, AEs from that reporting period were not used in the calculation of the AE<sub>SC</sub>. For the purposes of this study, the AE reporting length is the difference between reporting period start and end dates divided by 28, to represent the number of 28-day cycles. In general, reporting period lengths are approximately 1 for the first 5 AE assessments, 1 or 3 for AE assessment 6 depending on whether the patient received BR or ibrutinib regimens, and 3 for assessments 7 and higher.</p>
