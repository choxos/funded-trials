                  <title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title>
                  <p>The main diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) outcome was assessed using clinical symptoms, signs, and nerve conduction study results during DCCT and repeated in EDIC year 13/14. Cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN) was assessed by R-R response to paced breathing, Valsalva ratio, and blood pressure response to standing during DCCT and in EDIC years 13/14 and 16/17. Additionally, symptoms reflecting neuropathic pain and autonomic function (including hypoglycemia awareness) were collected yearly in EDIC using standardized questionnaires; peripheral neuropathy was also assessed annually using the Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument. Assessments of genitourinary function were collected at EDIC year 10.</p>

                  <title>RESULTS</title>
                  <p>Intensive therapy during the DCCT significantly reduced the risk of DPN and CAN at DCCT closeout (64% and 45%, respectively, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01). The prevalence and incidence of DPN and CAN remained significantly lower in the DCCT intensive therapy group compared with the DCCT conventional therapy group through EDIC year 13/14.</p>

                  <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
                  <p>The persistent effects of prior intensive therapy on neuropathy measures through 14 years of EDIC largely mirror those observed for other diabetes complications. DCCT/EDIC provides important information on the influence of glycemic control, and the clinical course of diabetic neuropathy, and, most important, on how to prevent neuropathy in type 1 diabetes.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) enrolled 1,441 patients with type 1 diabetes between 1983 and 1989 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). At study entry, participants were randomly assigned to intensive insulin therapy (INT), targeting near-normal glycemia, or conventional insulin therapy (CON) according to the standard of care at that time. Microvascular diabetes complications were assessed during the DCCT, including the development and progression of the peripheral and cardiovascular autonomic manifestations of diabetic neuropathy. In 1993, after an average of 6.5 years of follow-up, the DCCT investigators reported that INT significantly reduced the incidence of diabetic neuropathy, similar to findings for diabetic retinopathy and nephropathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). INT was subsequently widely accepted as the standard of care for type 1 diabetes. At DCCT end, DCCT CON participants were taught INT, and all participants were encouraged to adhere as closely as possible to an intensive diabetes treatment regimen and were returned to their prior health care providers for ongoing care. The observational Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (EDIC) follow-up was established to monitor the long-term effects of prior INT compared with prior CON treatment on the development and progression of more advanced microvascular complications and cardiovascular disease in the DCCT cohort.</p>
              <p>Diabetic neuropathy represents a clinically diverse group of disorders having differing anatomic distribution, clinical course, and underlying pathophysiology, but ultimately thought to reflect metabolic and microvascular factors that result in axonal degeneration of large- and small-nerve fibers. The specific presentation of diabetic neuropathy reflects the distribution and size of nerve fibers involved, most commonly presenting as a distal symmetric sensory or sensorimotor neuropathy (diabetic peripheral neuropathy [DPN]). Manifestations of autonomic neuropathies, including cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN), may also develop. Although the specific clinical manifestations are heterogeneous, diabetic neuropathy is a major cause of disability, associated with reduced quality of life and high mortality. In this article, we detail and discuss the diabetic neuropathy outcomes, including DPN and CAN, during DCCT/EDIC.</p>

                <title>DPN</title>
                <p>DPN was assessed by board-certified neurologists using a standardized evaluation to identify symptoms, signs, and nerve conduction abnormalities consistent with distal symmetrical peripheral neuropathy. These assessments were done at DCCT baseline, after 5 years of DCCT participation and/or at the end of the DCCT, and again during EDIC year 13/14. Vibration perception threshold testing was performed at EDIC year 13/14 using a forced-choice algorithm of decreasing vibration intensity at the dominant index finger and great toe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). An annual neuropathy assessment was performed in EDIC using the Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument (MNSI), a 15-item symptom questionnaire and a structured examination for foot ulcers, deformities, infections, excessive dryness, and calluses, plus ankle reflexes and distal vibration perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>).</p>

                <p>A structured medical history was obtained annually in EDIC including questions regarding the presence of painful or noxious symptoms of peripheral neuropathy, use of medications to treat painful neuropathic symptoms, symptoms of postural hypotension, gastroparesis, diarrhea, colonic atony, genitourinary dysfunction, and hypoglycemic unawareness.</p>
                <p>The Uro-EDIC ancillary study was conducted at EDIC year 10 as a cross-sectional evaluation to describe the prevalence of diabetic genitourinary complications, including erectile dysfunction, lower urinary tract symptoms, and urinary incontinence, and to investigate relationships between these and other diabetes complications. Erectile dysfunction was defined as an erectile function domain score of &lt;20 using the International Index of Erectile Function and by response to a single questionnaire item regarding “confidence to get and keep an erection” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Lower urinary tract symptoms were assessed using the American Urological Association Symptom Index with moderate to severe lower urinary tract symptoms defined by scores &gt;7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Urinary incontinence in women was measured using a standardized questionnaire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>).</p>

                <p>One explanation for the finding of a persistent benefit of INT for confirmed DPN at EDIC year 13/14 could be the presence of different levels of subclinical neuropathy in the INT and CON groups at DCCT closeout, as any significant group difference in the nerve conduction results could influence the subsequent development of confirmed DPN during EDIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). This possibility was addressed using analytic models of incident neuropathy that adjusted for nerve conduction study results at DCCT closeout. These additional models negated the treatment group differences in development of neuropathy observed during EDIC. Specifically, after correction for difference in nerve conduction study results at DCCT closeout, no significant risk reduction was associated with former INT at EDIC years 13/14 (OR 1.17 [95% CI 0.84 –1.63]) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>).</p>
                <p>Logistic regression models were used to evaluate the effect of glycemic control on prevalent and incident DPN in EDIC. The odds of clinically evident DPN, abnormal nerve conduction studies, and confirmed DPN in EDIC (prevalence) each increased per unit (%) increase in DCCT mean HbA<sub>1c</sub> and EDIC mean HbA<sub>1c</sub>. The incidence of any of the three DPN outcomes during EDIC was increased with each unit increase in mean EDIC HbA<sub>1c</sub>. The DCCT mean HbA<sub>1c</sub> was associated only with increased odds for incident confirmed DPN in EDIC (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>).</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>The clinical burdens of diabetic neuropathic complications are well recognized and result in significant morbidity. Painful symptoms are frequently refractory to treatment, and loss of protective sensation heightens the risk for foot ulceration and lower-extremity amputations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). While symptoms associated with painful DPN and advanced autonomic dysfunction are often particularly troublesome, the earliest manifestations of CAN are silent and easily overlooked in clinical practice. Yet, CAN is an independent predictor of mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>), possibly by promoting life-threatening arrhythmias and sudden death in response to a variety of insults including drug side effects, hypoglycemia, hypokalemia, hypotension, or ischemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>).</p>
              <p>DPN and CAN were uncommon at the start of the DCCT, partly due to the intentional exclusion of people with neuropathy sufficiently severe to require treatment, but were increasingly prevalent over the DCCT/EDIC follow-up. INT during the DCCT decreased the development and progression of confirmed DPN and CAN relative to CON. Remarkably, treatment group differences were still measurable through 14 years of EDIC follow-up despite similar levels of glycemic control during EDIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>).</p>
              <p>The durable impact of prior treatment, even after disappearance of prior glycemic separation, first observed for retinopathy and nephropathy, has been described as “metabolic memory” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Confirmed DPN increased in both INT and CON participants by EDIC year 13/14, but the treatment group differences observed for confirmed DPN at that time were eliminated by adjusting for nerve conduction variables at the end of the DCCT. Viewed differently, among subjects who did not have neuropathy at DCCT completion, those in the CON group were shown to have greater degrees of subclinical neuropathy than subjects in the INT group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). This subclinical neuropathy represented an asymptomatic neuropathy that had not yet produced clinical signs or sufficiently abnormal electrophysiology and could partially explain the findings of continued difference in the development of DPN in the INT and CON groups during EDIC. Whether an additional influence of early intensive glucose control might have been apparent earlier during EDIC is unknown, but a persistent metabolic effect was not required to explain the durable beneficial effects on confirmed DPN in EDIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>).</p>
              <p>In contrast, a long-term beneficial influence of early intensive glucose control, first observed for retinopathy and nephropathy, was observed for CAN in EDIC. Modeling that adjusted for R-R variation at DCCT closeout did not negate the INT-associated risk reduction for development of CAN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). The risk reduction for CAN is consistent with the “metabolic memory” effect observed for retinopathy and nephropathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). This apparent discordance in the impact of prior DCCT treatment group effect on longer-term outcomes for DPN and CAN may reflect differences in susceptibility of small- and large-nerve fibers to glycemic exposure.</p>
              <p>In general, findings from studies of diabetic neuropathies have to be interpreted with caution, given the broad range of diagnostic methods employed and lack of consistency in the criteria used to define neuropathy. In the Wisconsin Epidemiologic Study of Diabetic Retinopathy (WESDR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>), DPN was assessed by tactile or temperature sensitivity; and they reported abnormalities in 19–25% and 11–19% of participants, respectively, after 10 years of follow-up. In the Pittsburgh Epidemiology of Diabetes Complications Study (EDC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>), the cumulative incidence of DPN over a period of 5.3 years was 29%. In the EURODIAB Prospective Complications Study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>), an observational study that included 1,172 subjects with type 1 diabetes from 31 centers across Europe, neuropathy was defined by the presence of neuropathic symptoms, absence of ankle or knee reflexes, and abnormal vibration perception threshold as assessed by biothesiometers. EURODIAB reported that after only 7.3 years of follow-up, neuropathy developed in 24% of subjects, considerably higher than the 9% overall incidence of confirmed DPN reported over 5 years of follow-up in DCCT, which arguably used more stringent criteria that included nerve conduction studies. Although the differences in study design do not allow for precise comparisons between the true incidence of neuropathy in the DCCT/EDIC and the EURODIAB cohorts, EURODIAB also reported that HbA<sub>1c</sub> was an important determinant of neuropathy incidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>).</p>
              <p>The DCCT/EDIC is the first large study to concurrently obtain high-quality, standardized cardiac MRI and CAN evaluations, allowing for additional analyses regarding clinical implications of CAN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Although these cross-sectional findings prevent analysis of any causal relationship between CAN and ventricular dysfunction, other studies have demonstrated a relationship between sympathetic activation and left ventricular hypertrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>).</p>
              <p>Genitourinary problems associated with diabetes, with the likely exception of impotence, are frequently overlooked in clinical practice and are rarely considered in the context of diabetic neuropathies. The Uro-EDIC study affords an opportunity to define the extent of genitourinary complications of diabetes and to explore the relationships of these to well-defined micro- and macrovascular complications, including neuropathy. In cross-sectional analyses, both erectile dysfunction and lower urinary tract symptoms in men were associated with DPN, perhaps due to shared or overlapping mechanisms of neuronal damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). These cross-sectional findings of associations between male genitourinary complications and DPN must be interpreted cautiously. Uro-EDIC data are being collected longitudinally and this may, in the future, shed light on shared pathophysiologic mechanisms between genitourinary and neuropathic complications.</p>
              <p>The EDIC study continues to evaluate risk factors for neuropathic complications in a large number of well-characterized patients with type 1 diabetes and continues to demonstrate the value of optimizing glucose control as early as possible in the course of the disease to ameliorate the long-term effects of hyperglycemia. The DCCT and EDIC confirm that glycemic control is a significant and robust predictor of neuropathy. However, they also show that for most patients with type 1 diabetes, current strategies for optimizing glucose control are insufficient to fully prevent or delay the development of neuropathic complications, as 25% of subjects in the former INT group and 35% of subjects in the former CON group had confirmed DPN by 14 years of EDIC follow-up.</p>
              <p>The reproducible, standardized DPN and CAN testing protocols, the robust and consistent definitions of neuropathy outcomes, the large sample size, and, most important, the commitment of DCCT/EDIC participants have allowed the DCCT/EDIC to provide invaluable lessons on the clinical course and the means of ameliorating DPN and CAN in patients with type 1 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>).</p>
