                <p id="Par1"><italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> (CT) and <italic>Mycoplasma genitalium</italic> (MG) are two highly prevalent bacterial sexually transmitted infections (STIs) with a significant rate of co-infection in some populations. Vaginal metabolites are influenced by resident vaginal microbiota, affect susceptibility to sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and may impact local inflammation and patient symptoms. Examining the vaginal metabolome in the context of CT mono (CT+) and CT/MG co-infection (CT+/MG+) may identify biomarkers for infection or provide new insights into disease etiology and pathogenesis. Yet, the vaginal metabolome in the setting of CT infection is understudied and the composition of the vaginal metabolome in CT/MG co-infected women is unknown. Therefore, in this analysis, we used an untargeted metabolomic approach combined with 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to characterize the vaginal microbiota and metabolomes of CT+, CT+/MG+, and uninfected women. We found that CT+ and CT+/MG+ women had distinct vaginal metabolomic profiles as compared to uninfected women both before and after adjustment for the vaginal microbiota. This study provides important foundational data documenting differences in the vaginal metabolome between CT+, CT+/MG+ and uninfected women. These data may guide future mechanistic studies that seek to provide insight into the pathogenesis of CT and CT/MG infections.</p>

              <p id="Par2">Vaginal metabolites are influenced by resident vaginal microbiota, affect susceptibility to sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and impact local inflammation and symptoms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. An “optimal” vaginal microbiota is dominated by <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> species, which produce the metabolite lactic acid. Lactic acid lowers the pH of the vaginal microenvironment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, and, through immunomodulatory and direct inhibitory effects, may protect against acquisition of STIs, including <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> (CT) and HIV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. In contrast, women with non-optimal microbiota, as epitomized by the clinical condition of bacterial vaginosis (BV), have vaginal microbial communities that are low in <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> spp.; and are instead colonized by a variety of anaerobes which generally produce very little or no lactic acid. Some of these bacteria produce metabolites such as biogenic amines and short chain fatty acids that may be pro-inflammatory and have been linked with symptoms such as vaginal malodor and discomfort<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. These metabolites may also increase susceptibility to STIs, including bolstering chlamydial persistence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Women with low<italic>-Lactobacillus</italic> non-optimal vaginal microbiota have an increased risk for acquisition of STIs and ascending infection (including pelvic inflammatory disease [PID])<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par3">CT is the most prevalent bacterial STI in the United States, and causes significant morbidity, including PID and infertility in young women<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. <italic>Mycoplasma genitalium</italic> (MG) is an emerging, highly drug resistant STI, which appears to be more prevalent than gonorrhea, and has been linked to cervicitis and PID in women<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, though current CDC guidelines recommend consideration for testing and treatment only in women with persistent cervicitis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par4">Interestingly, rates of co-infection with CT and MG are high in many female populations (36% of CT infected women had MG co-infection in one study done in Baltimore, MD,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, nearly 38% of CT infected women were found to have MG co-infection in a second study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> and 70.7% of women with MG in a high risk cohort were found to have CT co-infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Endometrial MG infection has been associated with endometritis and endometrial CT infection, suggesting that these infections may co-locate or perhaps affect PID risk in some women<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>; however the impact of co-infection on patient outcomes is understudied<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par5">New molecular techniques have enabled a higher resolution understanding of BV, the vaginal microbiota, and associations with STI, including CT and MG infections. 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing techniques have identified several different kinds vaginal microbiota, or “community state types” (CSTs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> based on bacterial composition and relative abundance. Four are dominated by different <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> species (CST I, <italic>Lactobacillus crispatus</italic>; CST II, <italic>L. gasseri</italic>; CST III, <italic>L. iners</italic>; CST V, <italic>L. jensenii</italic>).

CST IV and CST III have been associated with increased risk of CT acquisition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>.

              <p id="Par6">Associations between the vaginal microbiota and enhanced risk of CT and MG infection are likely mediated, at least in part, through vaginal metabolites. CT and MG may also independently influence the vaginal metabolome through direct, host-mediated or microbiota-mediated mechanisms, perhaps impacting clinical outcomes. Therefore, examining the vaginal metabolome in the context of these infections may identify biomarkers for infection or provide new insights into disease etiology and pathogenesis. Yet, to date, only one study has examined the vaginal metabolome in the setting of CT infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, and the composition of the vaginal metabolome in CT/MG co-infected women is unknown. Therefore, in this study, we utilized untargeted gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to characterize the vaginal metabolome of CT mono-, CT/MG co-infected, and uninfected women.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par19">We found that numerous vaginal metabolites distinguished CT+ and CT+/MG+ from uninfected women, with and without adjustment for the composition of the vaginal microbiota. When comparing CT+/MG+ to CT+ women, we observed significant overlap of vaginal metabolome profiles.</p>
              <p id="Par20">Previous literature suggests that women with BV are at increased risk for acquisition of CT and MG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, and women with CT infection are most likely to be in CST IV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Consistent with this, a larger proportion of the CT+ and CT+/MG+ as compared with the uninfected women in our study cohort had CST IV microbiota. Since biogenic amines (thought to be produced by BV-associated bacteria) are known to be higher in women with CST IV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, it is not surprising, therefore, that the biogenic amines putrescine and cadaverine were higher in CT mono- and CT/MG co-infected as compared to uninfected women prior to, but not after adjustment for CST. Biogenic amine production involves specific amino acid decarboxylation reactions, and is a well-described bacterial acid resistance and mitigation mechanism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. This reduction of vaginal acidity may promote colonization by other BV-associated bacteria or further overgrowth of existing BV-associated bacteria. Additionally, the production of biogenic amines may increase the virulence of various pathogens, and may protect pathogens from innate immune defenses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Biogenic amines may reduce the host’s immune defenses against STIs, including CT or MG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par21">While some of the differences in vaginal metabolites between infection groups (such as putrescine and cadaverine, above) may relate to the higher proportion of infected women with CST IV, we cannot discount the possibility that these CST-related metabolites are important to the infection process. Differences in other metabolites remained consistent even after adjustment for CST, suggesting a role for the infecting pathogen(s) (or perhaps an interaction between the host, pathogen and underlying microbiota) in impacting the metabolome. For example, we observed significantly higher concentrations of most LCFAs and fatty alcohols when comparing the vaginal metabolites of CT+ and CT+/MG+ to uninfected women both before and after adjustment for CST. This effect, however, appeared to be attenuated by MG co-infection: CT+/MG+ women had several LCFAs and fatty alcohols that were lower compared to CT+ women.</p>
              <p id="Par22">It is possible that the higher levels of LCFAs are related to CT survival, growth, and/or pathogenesis. Chlamydiae are obligate intracellular organisms that are auxotrophic for a variety of essential metabolites, including many lipids that they acquire from the host cell. Lipids are trafficked from various sources within the host cell into the inclusion and to the envelope of the reticulate bodies. The acquisition of lipids from host stores is thought to be critical for chlamydial replication and development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. In eukaryotic cells, cholesterol esters, which are formed by the addition of a LCFA to the hydroxyl group of cholesterol, are the main transport and storage form of cholesterol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. The enzyme acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) catalyzes the production of these esters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. This process is important because in the un-esterified form, cholesterol can be toxic to the cell. A recent report<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup> showed that chlamydial growth can be inhibited by blocking ACAT with a specific inhibitor, 4-hydroxycinnamic acid amide. Addition of a cholesterol ester (cholesterol esterified with a LCFA) rescued ACAT dependent inhibition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par23">These data raise the question of whether CT may be upregulating host production of LCFAs and cholesterol esters as part of a survival or growth mechanism. The relatively lower levels of lipid and lipid derivatives in CT/MG co-infected women versus uninfected women may reflect a direct or indirect competition between CT and MG for host lipids. Alternatively, the higher fatty alcohols and LCFAs may reflect greater wax ester production. Wax esters, a type of neutral lipid, are formed by the esterification of a fatty alcohol with a fatty acid derived from either acyl-CoA or acyl-ACP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Neutral lipids are commonly found in vaginal fluid, along with secretions from the cervix, squamous epithelial cells and material from the sebaceous, apocrine and Bartholin’s glands<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Thus, it is possible that the higher abundance of fatty acids, LCFAs and fatty alcohols reflects greater vaginal discharge associated with chlamydial infections, whether due to increased polymorphonuclear leukocytes or increased secretions from host cells. These questions are intriguing, but speculative. Larger, mechanistic studies will be required to further explore them.</p>
              <p id="Par24">No studies have examined the vaginal metabolome in the context of MG mono- or CT/MG co-infection, and only one other report<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> has examined the vaginal metabolome in the context of CT infection. That study found fewer distinguishing metabolites but had a number of important differences from ours, including a smaller sample size, the use of 1H-NMR rather than GC-MS to detect a total of only 54 metabolites and a lack of testing for MG. Furthermore, the study design was quite different: CT infected women in the Parolin study were specifically selected not to have BV. Importantly, by controlling for CST rather than eliminating subjects with CST IV microbiota, our results may capture important changes that occur as a result of complex interactions between the host, CT and dysbiotic vaginal microbiota which would be missed by an approach that excludes CT mono-infected women with BV.</p>
              <p id="Par25">There are several limitations to our study. First, while we have the largest group of CT+ women studied to date in a metabolomic analysis, the CT+/MG+ co-infected group was small, limiting our ability to control for other potential confounders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Secondly, these data are cross-sectional, with samples taken at the time of CT and CT/MG infection. Therefore, causal inferences (e.g. regarding the impact of the vaginal metabolome on susceptibility to CT or CT/MG co-infection) are not possible; nor is it possible to account for short term fluctuations in the vaginal microbiota. We do not have information on whether these represented first infections or re-infections. Cases were younger, less likely to use condoms, and reported more recent sexual partners than controls. While these factors were not found in univariate analysis to influence our outcome (i.e. the vaginal metabolome), we cannot completely exclude the possibility that these differences (or other unmeasured factors, such as <italic>Candida</italic> colonization) may impact the relationship between infection status and the metabolome. A large number of samples had to be excluded due to insufficient sample for metabolomics testing, unavailable 16S rRNA gene sequencing data or co-infection with <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> or <italic>Trichomonas vaginalis</italic>, and there may have been unmeasured differences in these excluded samples. Batch effects could have introduced bias. Although we took a broad, untargeted GC-MS based approach, the library of identified metabolites does not reflect all the small metabolites present within the vaginal environment, and we may have missed crucial metabolites in our analysis. Importantly, the use of untargeted GC-based mass spectrometry excluded the detection of volatile fatty acids such as trimethylamine, acetate, or butyrate. The vaginal samples were stored in Amies transport medium. A number of metabolites, including lactic acid, were found in the transport medium and therefore had to be removed from analysis. Given limited sample size, we were not able to assess associations between relative abundance of specific bacterial species and vaginal metabolites. Finally, given the limitations of study design, we are only able to identify broad associations - it is not possible to untangle from this data what specific factors, or interaction between factors (i.e. host, vaginal microbiota and pathogen) are impacting metabolites and ultimately how this may affect susceptibility to, clearance of, or morbidity from CT and MG infections.</p>
              <p id="Par26">Despite these limitations, our study shows that a distinct vaginal metabolic profile distinguishes CT+ and CT+/MG+ from uninfected women, with significant overlap between CT+ and CT+/MG+ women. This study provides important foundational data documenting cross-sectional differences in the vaginal metabolome. Larger, mechanistic studies will be needed to explore the complex interactions between host, vaginal microbiota and pathogens, in order to better understand the pathogenesis of CT and CT/MG co-infection.</p>

                  <p id="Par29">Genomic DNA was extracted from 300 µl aliquots of re-suspended Amies solution as previously reported for the respective papers: (CT+ and CT+/MG+ cases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>), (controls recruited from Alabama<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>), and (controls recruited from Maryland<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>). For the QS DSP Midi kit extraction, samples were thawed on ice and a 500 µl aliquot from the vaginal swab was used as input<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. For the MagAttract kit, samples were thawed on ice and a 200 µl aliquot from the vaginal swab was used as input following the manufacturer protocol. Cells were lysed via shaking with 1.0 mm glass beads on the TissueLyser (Qiagen) at 20 Hz for 20 minutes and the final elution volume was 110 µl. Negative controls of water were extracted in the same manner as samples.</p>
                  <p id="Par30">The vaginal microbiota was characterized by sequencing the V3-V4 regions of the 16S rRNA gene. Library construction was performed using either a 1-step protocol with sequencing carried out on the Illumina MiSeq platform for 600 cycles, resulting in 2 ×300 bp read lengths, or a 2-step PCR protocol, sequencing was carried out on the Illumina HiSeq. 2500 platform using Rapid Run Chemistry, and sequence data were processed according to Holm <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. Amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) generated by DADA2 were classified taxonomically using the RDP Naïve Bayesian Classifier<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup> trained with the SILVA v128 16S rRNA gene database<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. ASVs of major vaginal taxa were assigned species-level annotations using speciateIT (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ravel-lab.org/speciateit/">http://ravel-lab.org/speciateit/</ext-link>). Taxonomic data from a pool of over 12,000 vaginal samples were used to assign community state types (CSTs). Low-abundant taxa present at less than 10<sup>−5.5</sup> abundance across the project were removed and samples with fewer than 5,000 reads were removed from analysis. Hierarchical clustering based on Jensen-Shannon distances between samples and Ward linkage was used to determine clusters for CST assignment. Four CSTs dominated by <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> spp. were identified: CST I (<italic>L. crispatus</italic>), CST II (<italic>L. gasseri</italic>), CST III (<italic>L. iners</italic>), and CST V (<italic>L. jensenii</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. CST IV contained more diverse organisms with low levels of <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> spp., (See Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref> for heatmap of 25 most abundant taxa with CST groupings).</p>

                <p id="Par32">289 samples were tested for MG: 157 CT+ cases from CHARM and 132 race matched CT- controls from HCL and HMP. Two control (i.e. CT-) samples tested positive for MG and were excluded. After exclusion of additional samples due to insufficient sample for metabolomic testing, unavailable 16S rRNA gene sequencing data, or co-infection with GC or <italic>Trichomonas</italic>, samples from 145 women were available for analysis (77 uninfected, 54 CT+ and 14 CT+/MG+ samples). N = 25 of the controls were recruited in Alabama, the remaining cases and controls were recruited from Maryland.</p>
                <p id="Par33">For quality control, an aliquot of 10 μl was taken from each sample and mixed in 10 replicates. Additionally, two samples of sterile Amies transport medium (controls) were run in duplicate. Samples, Amies controls, and QC supernatants were dried in a vacuum and derivatized with 50 μl methoxyamine hydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA) (40 mg/mL<sup>−1</sup> in pyridine) for 60 min at 50 °C, then with 50 μl MSTFA + 1%TMCS (Thermo, MA, USA) at 70 °C for 120 min, followed by a 2-hour incubation at room temperature. 30 μl of 1 mg/ml hentriacontanoic acid was added to each sample prior to derivatization for use as an internal standard for normalization.</p>
                <p id="Par34">Metabolite profiles were acquired using a gas-chromatography mass-spectrometry (GC-MS) system (Agilent Inc, CA, USA) consisting of an Agilent 7890 gas chromatograph, an Agilent 5975 MSD and 7683B autosampler, as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. Briefly, gas chromatography was performed on a ZB-5MS (60 m × 0.32 mm I.D. and 0.25 mm film thickness) capillary column (Phenomenex, CA, USA). The inlet and MS interface temperatures were 250 °C, and the ion source temperature was adjusted to 230 °C. An aliquot of 1 ml was injected with the split ratio of 10:1. The helium carrier gas was kept at a constant flow rate of 2.4 ml/min. The temperature program was: 5-min isothermal heating at 70 °C, followed by an oven temperature increase of 5 °C/min to °C after which a final 10 min incubation at 310 °C was performed. The mass spectrometer was operated in positive electron impact mode (EI) at 69.9 eV ionization energy at m/z 30–800 scan range. The spectra of all chromatogram peaks were evaluated using the AMDIS 2.71 (NIST, MD, USA) using a custom-built database (460 unique metabolites) of the University of Illinois Carver Metabolomics Center. Throughout the sample preparation, data-acquisition and data-preprocessing, samples were compared to the QCs to evaluate potential variation that may have arisen in the dataset throughout the analytical study. All known artificial peaks were identified and removed prior to data mining. To allow comparison between samples, all data were normalized to the internal standard in each chromatogram and sample volume. The instrument variability was within the standard acceptance limit (5%).</p>

                <p id="Par35">Metabolites detected in Amies (See Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5</xref>) were removed from analysis. Metabolites were excluded from analysis if they were undetected in ≥90% of samples in all biological groups (CT+, CT+/MG+ and uninfected). Remaining missing values were assumed to be below the level of detection and were imputed (across all samples, irrespective of biological groups) using one half the minimum value obtained for a given metabolite<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>. The final dataset available for analysis consisted of 163 metabolites. Following imputation of missing values, data were mean-centered, and a generalized log-transformation was applied to meet assumptions of linearity and normality required for regression models. Mean centering and generalized log-transformations were performed using MetaboAnalyst 4.0<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>. Metabolic super and sub pathways were identified using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database.</p>

A Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrix was constructed following normalization of the 163 metabolites, and a permutational multivariate analysis of variances (PERMANOVA) was performed to evaluate the association of potential sources of variation, including demographic and behavioral factors, with the vaginal metabolome.

Metabolite fold changes were calculated for (1) CT mono-infected vs. uninfected women, (2) CT/MG co-infected vs. uninfected women, and (3) CT/MG co-infected vs. CT mono-infected women. We additionally subset the data and calculated the metabolite fold change between infection states within CST III and CST IV. CSTs I, II, and V were not included as only two CT mono-infected, and no CT/MG co-infected women had vaginal microbiota corresponding to these CSTs, limiting our ability to make comparisons to uninfected women.</p>
