                  <title>Background:</title>
                  <p id="P3">Cancer survivors over the age of 65 have unique needs due to the higher prevalence of functional and cognitive impairment, comorbidities, geriatric syndromes, and greater need for social support after chemotherapy. In this study, we will evaluate whether a Geriatric Evaluation and Management-Survivorship (GEMS) intervention improves functional outcomes important to older cancer survivors following chemotherapy.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="S2">
                  <title>Methods:</title>
                  <p id="P4">A cluster-randomized trial will be conducted in approximately 30 community oncology practices affiliated with the University of Rochester Cancer Center (URCC) National Cancer Institute Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) Research Base. Participating sites will be randomized to the GEMS intervention, which includes Advanced Practice Practitioner (APP)-directed geriatric evaluation and management (GEM), and Survivorship Health Education (SHE) that is combined with Exercise for Cancer Patients (EXCAP©®), or usual care. Cancer survivors will be recruited from community oncology practices (of participating oncology physicians and APPs) after the enrolled clinicians have consented and completed a baseline survey. We will enroll 780 cancer survivors aged 65 years and older who have completed curative-intent chemotherapy for a solid tumor malignancy within four weeks of study enrollment. Cancer survivors will be asked to choose one caregiver to also participate for a total up to 780 caregivers. The primary aim is to compare the effectiveness of GEMS for improving patient-reported physical function at six months. The secondary aim is to compare effectiveness of GEMS for improving patient-reported cognitive function at six months. Tertiary aims include comparing the effectiveness of GEMS for improving: 1) Patient-reported physical function at twelve months; 2) objectively assessed physical function at six and twelve months; and 3) patient-reported cognitive function at twelve months and objectively assessed cognitive function at six and twelve months. Exploratory health care aims include: 1) Survivor satisfaction with care, 2) APP communication with primary care physicians (PCPs), 3) completion of referral appointments, and 4) hospitalizations at six and twelve months.

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="P7">The population of older cancer survivors is increasing. These are older patients who have completed curative-intent (i.e., adjuvant) chemotherapy for any solid tumor malignancy. Currently, 64% of cancer survivors are aged 65 years and older; by 2040, approximately 50% will be aged 75 years and older with approximately 18% aged 85 years and older [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Older cancer survivors are at a higher risk for adverse outcomes and experience physical and cognitive impairments following curative-intent chemotherapy [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and the Cancer and Aging Research Group (CARG) [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] recommend aging-sensitive interventions for older cancer survivors and their caregivers.</p>
              <p id="P8">The National Academy of Medicine (NAM; previously Institute of Medicine) reported that older cancer survivors have unique needs due to the higher prevalence of functional and cognitive impairment, comorbidities, geriatric syndromes, and greater need for social support following treatment [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Older patients report more interference with function from symptomatic toxicities (e.g., fatigue, pain) than younger patients and are at higher risk for unplanned hospitalizations and mortality [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Hence, older patients with cancer consistently place a high priority on the recovery of their physical and cognitive function after chemotherapy [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>–<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Yet, the majority of older patients with cancer are treated based on extrapolations of evidence derived from clinical trials enrolling mainly younger adults or fit older adults (e.g., those without other health status conditions). Extrapolating data on the safety and efficacy from these trials for use in vulnerable or frail older adults increases their risks for long-term complications in survivorship [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p>
              <p id="P9">The ASCO guidelines recommend survivorship care plans (SCPs) for all older adult patients transitioning out of active treatment [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. However, a recent systematic review [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] found: 1) Current SCPs do not adequately improve physical and psychosocial outcomes, 2) few studies facilitated follow-up with advanced practice practitioners (APPs) or other clinicians, 3) only two studies included a significant number of cancer survivors over age 65 [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], and 4) none of these studies addressed aging-related conditions through the use of specialized assessment and management of problems for older adults. Research suggests that, for SCPs to be effective, in addition to survivorship care plan summaries, cancer survivors need explicit help to implement the survivorship care plan recommendations (e.g., to schedule and attend referral appointments, modify lifestyle via health education) [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>–<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The survivorship care plans need to be individually tailored and feasible for older cancer survivors and incorporate their caregivers.</p>
              <p id="P10">Caregivers experience distress and low satisfaction with care when the cancer survivor’s function is poor [<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The NCI and experts recommend that interventions engage caregivers as partners in survivorship care [<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>–<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. When cancer survivors experience physical and cognitive impairment, caregivers become distressed and less satisfied with the survivors’ care because they are burdened with increased caregiver work, more responsibility to communicate with providers, and increased need to access services necessary for the cancer survivors [<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p>
              <p id="P11">Team-based care (by at least two clinicians), where clinicians work collaboratively with patients and caregivers to accomplish shared goals within and across settings to achieve coordinated high quality care, is recommended for the provision of health services to older adults and families [<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. As shown in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, interventions guided by physical and/or occupational therapists [<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>–<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], clinical exercise physiologists [<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], cognitive specialists [<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>–<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], psychologists [<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>–<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], and pharmacists [<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>–<xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] are associated with improved outcomes in older patients with cancer. However, a standardized approach to surveillance and management of aging-related conditions by teams is not often employed [<xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>].</p>
              <p id="P12">An APP is a health care provider who has completed advanced training and education that qualifies them to 1) manage medical problems and 2) prescribe and manage treatments within their scope of training. In the United States regulations, licensure and scope of practice vary based on state law and regulations. It most commonly refers to a nurse practitioner (NP) or physician assistant (PA), as well as other licensed, nonphysician providers, including certified clinical nurse specialists and certified nurse anesthetists. NPs are registered nurses with additional education and clinical training at the master’s or doctoral degree level. Nurses must complete at least 1000 h of clinical practice in a focused area, such as pediatric, adult, or geriatric medicine, to earn an NP degree. A PA, on the other hand, trains for two years—frequently alongside medical students. Physician assistant students complete at least 2000 h of supervised practice before graduation [<xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Despite differences in training and licensure, APPs in oncology clinics play an essential role in the transition period after chemotherapy by facilitating surveillance and management of symptomatic toxicities and coordination of care [<xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>–<xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. In geriatric medicine, APPs direct shared care and train other disciplines in aging [<xref rid="R67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>–<xref rid="R70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. While experts have advocated for APPs to play a key role in oncology [<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>,<xref rid="R71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>], gaps remain regarding the efficacy of aging-sensitive APP-directed survivorship interventions [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p>
              <p id="P13">To our knowledge, this is the first cluster randomized trial evaluating whether a standardized intervention—APP-directed Geriatric Evaluation and Management (GEM) combined with Survivorship Health Education (SHE) and Exercise for Cancer Patients (EXCAP©®)—can optimize outcomes important to older cancer survivors and their caregivers following curative-intent chemotherapy. We hypothesize that Geriatric Evaluation and Management-Survivorship (GEMS), compared to usual care, will significantly improve physical function and, secondarily, cognitive function at six months. We also hypothesize that GEMS, compared to usual care, will improve satisfaction with care, completion of referral appointments, and hospitalizations in older cancer survivors, and will improve oncology APP communication with primary care physicians (PCPs) as well as reduce distress and improve satisfaction with care in caregivers.</p>

                  <p id="P15">This clinical trial uses a cluster-randomized design and will be conducted in at least 30 community oncology practice clusters within the NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) Research Base network; the University of Rochester Cancer Center (URCC) NCORP Research Base will serve as the coordinating site.</p>
                  <p id="P16">The NCI’s Central Institutional Review Board approved the study on June 11, 2021. All participants will provide informed consent. We will enroll all groups (practice clusters, oncologists, APPs, SHE instructors, older cancer survivors, caregivers) using inclusion and exclusion criteria (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, see Appendix) until the target cancer survivor enrollment number is met (See <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p>

                  <title>Description of Arms and Intervention</title>
                  <p id="P17">Practices will enroll, on average, 26 cancer survivors per practice cluster for a total of 780 cancer survivors and up to 780 caregivers (estimated number of caregivers is 500). A practice cluster is defined as any practice location where staff (oncology physician, APPs, coordinators) work independently and do not cross over into another practice location. Each practice cluster will be randomly assigned to the GEMS intervention arm or the usual care arm in a 1:1 ratio.</p>
                  <p id="P18">In the intervention arm, the APPs, cancer survivors, and caregivers will complete and review GA-guided management recommendations. Cancer survivors and caregivers will also participate in the SHE combined with EXCAP©® sessions. In the usual care arm, cancer survivors and caregivers will participate in routine follow-up care without restrictions at their practices. Coordinators will capture routine survivorship care practices.</p>

                  <title>Geriatric Evaluation and Management for Survivorship (GEMS) Intervention</title>
                  <p id="P19">This is an innovative, standardized intervention based on the ASCO guidelines [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and expert consensus for evaluating and managing the care of older cancer survivors. GEMS intervention triages and manages the critical aging- and treatment-related medical, physical, and psychosocial issues that arise for older cancer survivors at the end of chemotherapy as they transition into long-term survivorship. The intervention engages the caregiver to foster better outcomes for both the cancer survivor and caregiver [<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. GEMS is a multi-level intervention that facilitates coordination of care between the older cancer survivor, caregiver, APPs, oncology physicians, PCPs, and other relevant clinicians to effectively address aging-related conditions and survivorship needs.</p>
                  <p id="P20">The APP-directed GEMS intervention consists of three major components: 1) geriatric assessment (GA) that evaluates the medical, physical, and psychosocial effects of treatment; 2) specific GA-guided management recommendations including referrals to relevant clinical disciplines/services; and 3) SHE program combined with an individually tailored exercise program EXCAP©® for cancer survivors and caregivers. All intervention components will be offered in-person (or via tele-health, if it is not convenient or feasible to participate in-person).</p>

Scores signifying impairment to trigger management recommendations are summarized in <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. The measures were selected based upon extensive data in the geriatric literature demonstrating predictive value as well as feasibility data in multiple studies of older patients with cancer as well as the ASCO guidelines. In the intervention arm, either the coordinator or the APP can administer a standardized GA to the cancer survivor, which includes patient-reported and objective measures to evaluate eight geriatric domains (<xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>).</p>

                    <p id="P22">The APPs and/or coordinators can enter cancer survivors’ test results into a password-protected portal, which automatically generates a summary that includes tailored evidence-based management recommendations and suggestions for referrals. Then, APPs will review the results with the cancer survivors and caregivers during a one-hour clinic visit in-person (or via tele-health); in collaboration with the cancer survivors and caregivers, the referrals will be prioritized and the top three scheduled. The APPs will provide the summary of the cancer survivors’ GA results and management recommendations and referrals to cancer survivors, caregivers, and PCPs. In addition, APPs will have 30-min visits in-person (or via tele-health) with cancer survivors and caregivers at three and six months to determine if referrals and SHE- EXCAP<italic toggle="yes">©®</italic> sessions are being completed. The APPs will triage and facilitate ongoing completion of management recommendations as needed, as well as discuss management plans with oncology physicians and PCPs and document communications in the medical chart. The cancer survivor and caregiver (if available) will meet with the APP in-person (or via tele-health) at three and six months (30 min minimum) to review the completion of referrals and provide ongoing symptom management. After each visit, the APP will send all information (including the GA summary and list of management recommendations) to the cancer survivor’s PCP and also call the primary care team to provide updates.</p>

The SHE program consists of eight face-to-face, 75-min group sessions delivered twice a week over four weeks by a SHE instructor. All SHE participants will receive the “<italic toggle="yes">ASCO® Answers Cancer Survivorship</italic>” booklet in the first session. The participants will attend SHE sessions in a group setting either in-person or virtually via tele-health. Each participating NCORP practice cluster will be responsible for identifying qualified SHE instructors and medical interpreters for Spanish-speaking participants. All qualified SHE instructors will complete a one-on-one interview, go through training, and use the provided SHE materials as a guide for delivering SHE group sessions.

Once the practice cluster has been approved by the URCC NCORP Research Base to participate, APPs and oncology physicians will complete a questionnaire that provides an overview of the study and captures information on demographics and Comfort with Survivorship Care Practices for Older Adults. Once at least one APP is enrolled and coordinators complete training, the practice cluster will be randomized.

                  <p id="P33">Coordinators, with oversight from the oncology team, can screen for patients aged 65 and older who are either currently receiving or have recently completed curative-intent (i.e., adjuvant) chemotherapy for any solid tumor malignancy. Eligible cancer survivors will undergo informed consent (in-person or via tele-health). Run-in study procedures can occur during the last four weeks of adjuvant chemotherapy but no later than four weeks after the completion of adjuvant chemotherapy. After the cancer survivor has consented, the first assessment that the coordinator will administer is the Blessed-Orientation-Memory-Concentration test (BOMC) [<xref rid="R73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]; cancer survivors with a BOMC score of ≥11 will not move forward with study procedures. Cancer survivors with BOMC score of &lt;11 can continue participation and can identify one caregiver to participate; cancer survivors without an available caregiver are still eligible if approved by URCC NCORP. The coordinator will enroll the eligible cancer survivor and caregiver and provide them the patient-reported assessments to complete; all can be completed via tele-health or in-person. The cancer survivor’s patient-reported assessments should be completed prior to baseline registration. At the baseline visit, coordinator-administered assessments will be completed for the cancer survivor and caregiver. The Six Minute Walk Test (6MWT) [<xref rid="R74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>,<xref rid="R75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>] and Trail Making Tests (TMT A/B) [<xref rid="R76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>] will be completed in-person, while the Mini-Cog [<xref rid="R77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>–<xref rid="R79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>], Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) [<xref rid="R80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>,<xref rid="R81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>], and Controlled Oral Word Association (COWA) [<xref rid="R82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>–<xref rid="R84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>] can be completed via tele-health or in-person. If assessments that require in-person data collection are unable to be completed due to COVID-19, other health-related concerns, or personal factors, they will be documented as missing.</p>
                  <p id="P34"><italic toggle="yes">In the GEMS intervention arm,</italic> APPs will deliver GEM. The APPs and/or coordinators will provide cancer survivors with the GA forms to be completed during run-in/baseline and will schedule a clinic visit (baseline, one hour minimum) to occur in-person to be conducted within four weeks of completing chemotherapy. At the baseline visit, APPs will complete and score the GA and enter the scores into a password-protected web portal to create a tailored summary and list of management recommendations, including referrals to relevant clinicians. The APP will review this information with the cancer survivor and their caregiver in conjunction with a review of the medical and treatment history. The APP will review the recommendations for GA impairments, symptom management, and health education. In collaboration with the cancer survivor and caregiver, the APP will triage the referrals so the top three referrals will be completed first; referrals will be prioritized by the APP through discussions with the cancer survivor and caregiver. The APP will oversee scheduling of all referrals, including the SHE and EXCAP sessions, andwill discuss a care plan with the oncology physician and ensure that appropriate clinical documentation is completed and disseminated. All intervention components, including all SHE sessions, will be completed by the six-month assessment. To collect data to inform future scalability efforts, the URCC NCORP Research Base team will conduct focus groups with staff in the intervention arm at baseline, six, and twelve months.</p>

                  <title>Statistical Analysis for Aims</title>
                  <p id="P39">To estimate the intervention effects, we will use an ANCOVA model with an additional random effect term to account for clustering. The model will include PWB at six months as the outcome and study arm, baseline value of PWB, and rural vs. non-rural practice cluster (stratification factor in randomization) as fixed effects. Practice cluster will be included as a random effect. Estimation will be performed using the restricted maximum likelihood (REML) method, and fixed effects inferences will be performed using an F-test. To compare long-term effects of the intervention on PWB at twleve months we will use a longitudinal linear mixed model (LMM). The model outcome (dependent variable) will be PWB with measures repeated at three, six, and twelve-month assessments. We will apply the same analytical approach as for the primary aim to assess the intervention effect on other patient-reported outcome measures, for example perceived cognitive impairment measured using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cognitive Function (FACT-COG) questionnaire, Perceived Cognitive Impairment subscale (secondary outcome). To compare the effect of the GEMS intervention vs. usual care arm on survivor care satisfaction, APP communication with PCPs, cancer survivor completion of referral appointments, and health care utilization, we will use LMM for continuous outcomes or generalized LMMs (GLMM) for binary outcome measures. For all models we will evaluate goodness of fit and, if necessary, apply a transformation. To explore the efficacy of the GEMS intervention for improving caregiver distress and care satisfaction and communication, caregiver quality of life and caregiver burden, we will follow a similar statistical plan. In addition, we will collect hypothesis-generating data to inform future scalability efforts. Open-ended questions on the participant feedback forms and the RE-AIM tool, and audio-recorded interviews will be transcribed and coded by study team members, using a qualitative content analysis approach to interpret the content of text data through the systematic classification process of coding and identifying themes or patterns.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="P40">A growing population of older cancer survivors are at a higher risk for poor functional outcomes following curative-intent chemotherapy, and current survivorship care plans are not tailored to address the unique needs and health disparities among older cancer survivors and their caregivers [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Using large data sets, we have shown that curative-intent chemotherapy leads to a high prevalence of toxicity in older patients [<xref rid="R89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. GA-identified impairments in domains including function, nutrition, comorbidity, mental health, and cognition are associated with increased hospitalizations and mortality, suggesting the need for better management. Studies of GA-guided management recommendations in older patients with cancer demonstrate a trend toward improved function and more appropriate healthcare utilization [<xref rid="R90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. Our APP-directed GEMS intervention provides an opportunity to go beyond routine survivorship care plans to improve physical and cognitive function, increase satisfaction of care, and reduce hospitalizations, and may be efficacious for improving outcomes important to older cancer survivors and caregivers.</p>
              <p id="P41">While studies have shown GEM is valued by oncologists [<xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>,<xref rid="R90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>], without leadership from APPs, adherence to management recommendations is not optimal [<xref rid="R91" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>–<xref rid="R94" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. Research shows that providing older adults with survivorship care plan summaries does not improve functional outcomes [<xref rid="R95" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]; older patients need additional help from APPs to implement aging-sensitive referrals and services (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) as part of their transition to long-term survivorship. Using expert consensus and guidelines [<xref rid="R96" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>,<xref rid="R97" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>], we developed and tested the GEM intervention with community oncology practices in two large trials (URCC 13070, “Communicating about Aging and Cancer Health” or “COACH” and URCC 13059, “Geriatric Assessment for Patients 70+” or “GAP”), demonstrating feasibility and benefits for older patients with cancer and their caregivers [<xref rid="R89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. In COACH [<xref rid="R89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>], among 541 eligible patients (mean age 77; 48.8% female) and 414 caregivers (mean age 67; 74.9% female), we showed that there were more aging-related conversations in the intervention arm (difference 3.59 conversations, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.001), and more conversations were higher quality and led to higher number of recommendations. On average, there were four GA-guided referrals per patient (range 0–6). In COACH [<xref rid="R89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>], aging-related conditions and symptom burden independently explained variance in FACIT-PWB [<xref rid="R98" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>–<xref rid="R100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. Also, older patients reported that their preference would be to forego survival benefits if treatment would impair function (42%) or memory (57%) [<xref rid="R89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>].</p>
              <p id="P42">ASCO recommends that cancer survivors receive comprehensive information regarding their diagnosis, treatments, and health education [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The Cancer and Aging Research Group provided information related to COVID-19 and cancer care delivery for older patients with cancer [<xref rid="R101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. Based on the existing data, it is clear that older adults with cancer, especially those with comorbidities and perhaps those who have had recent treatment, are at much higher risk for adverse outcomes (including hospitalization, intubation, intensive care unit admission, and death). During COVID-19, we optimized our ability to conduct GEM through tele-health using a team-based approach [<xref rid="R102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>].</p>
              <p id="P43">These data suggest that older cancer survivors have a high prevalence of aging-related impairments and physical and functional decline, which persist into long-term survivorship after curative-intent chemotherapy. Caregivers experience distress and dissatisfaction with care when older patients with cancer have functional impairments [<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. We hypothesize that our APP-directed GEMS intervention will be beneficial for improving outcomes important to older cancer survivors and caregivers. Hence, with this study, we will evaluate whether providing the GEMS intervention to older cancer survivors (within four weeks of completing curative-intent chemotherapy) and their caregivers can improve the physical and cognitive functions of cancer survivors, when compared to usual care. We hypothesize that providing a multidimensional, interdisciplinary, aging-sensitive survivorship care intervention focused on triaging and managing an older cancer survivor’s medical, physical, and psychosocial need will optimize outcomes for older cancer survivors and their caregivers during the period immediately following chemotherapy.</p>

                <title>Strengths and Potential Limitations</title>
                <p id="P44">There are number of strengths to this study. This is one of the few studies [<xref rid="R89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>] that includes older cancer survivors aged 65 years and older and the first study to address the unique needs and health disparities among older cancer survivors (especially those aged 75 years and older). We combined our two previously successful interventions, GEM and SHE-EXCAP©® to create GEMS, and herein will test its efficacy to improve physical and cognitive functions among older cancer survivors. Second, we include caregivers as study participants. Over 60% of the individuals caring for older cancer survivors are older themselves and have a high prevalence of their own comorbid conditions. Caregivers experience additional distress and low satisfaction with care when the cancer survivor’s function is poor [<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The NCI and other experts recommend that survivorship interventions should be tailored and feasible not only for older cancer survivors, but also should engage their caregivers as partners in survivorship care [<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>–<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In addition, this is the first study to challenge the current survivorship care paradigm by using an APP-directed intervention to guide team-based care with other clinicians and engage caregivers. Last, but not least, this study will be conducted in community practices (including those that are rural), where the majority of older adults receive care, as opposed to academic medical centers, and therefore the results will be generalizable to the majority of older American adults.</p>
                <p id="P45">While this study uses an innovative approach to create aging-sensitive “personalized pathways” for survivorship care that is tailored for two vulnerable groups—older cancer survivors and their caregivers—there are several limitations worth noting. Potential limitations include limited generalizability as we are aiming to enroll a specific population of older cancer survivors who are commonly seen in community oncology practices and are underrepresented in research studies. In addition, there is a risk of selection bias inherent in cluster randomization. Oncologists and APPs in both intervention arms (GEMS vs. usual care) are not blinded to the study conditions, and simply being part of the study may lead to increased incorporation of GA recommendations and discussion of aging-related concerns in both arms.</p>

              <p id="P46">The results of this study will be used to determine the efficacy of GEMS intervention for improving physical and cognitive function among older cancer survivors and their caregivers. If the intervention is shown to be effective, it may lead to increased use of GEMS as a standardized survivorship care intervention, promoting the identification and management of aging-related concerns that are not captured by routine oncology assessments, and lead to improved functional outcomes and more appropriate healthcare utilization among older cancer survivors, especially those are aged 65 years and older.</p>

The measure has been studied and validated in older patients. Similar to other studies that adapt satisfaction scales to capture specific clinical criteria (e.g., satisfaction with physician regarding communication about chemotherapy), the HCCQ has also been modified for this study to specifically address patient satisfaction with physician behaviors and communication regarding age-related issues and concerns in order to specifically address satisfaction with the intervention (Geriatric Assessment summary) rather than satisfaction with other aspects of cancer care (e.g., communication about cancer treatment). The HCCQ (both original and modified for communication) is available only in English. It is offered both in-person and via tele-health.</td>
