                  <title>Question</title>
                  <p>Does a mindfulness-based intervention reduce comorbid chronic pain and opioid misuse in the primary care setting more than supportive psychotherapy?</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="ab-ioi220002-2">
                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>In this randomized clinical trial that included 250 adults with both chronic pain and opioid misuse, 45.0% of participants receiving Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement (MORE) were no longer misusing opioids after 9 months of follow-up compared with 24.4% of participants receiving supportive group psychotherapy. Participants receiving MORE also reported significant improvements in chronic pain symptoms compared with those receiving supportive psychotherapy.</p>

                  <title>Meaning</title>
                  <p>In this study, MORE appeared to be an efficacious treatment for opioid misuse among adults with chronic pain.</p>

                  <title>Importance</title>
                  <p>Successful treatment of opioid misuse among people with chronic pain has proven elusive. Guidelines recommend nonopioid therapies, but the efficacy of mindfulness-based interventions for opioid misuse is uncertain.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Among 250 participants (159 women [63.6%]; mean [SD] age, 51.8 [11.9] years), 129 were randomized to the MORE group and 121 to the supportive psychotherapy group. Overall, 17 participants (6.8%) were Hispanic or Latino, 218 (87.2%) were White, and 15 (6.0%) were of other races and/or ethnicities (2 American Indian, 3 Asian, 1 Black, 2 Pacific Islander, and 7 did not specify). At baseline, the mean duration of pain was 14.7 years (range, 1-60 years), and the mean (SD) morphine-equivalent opioid dose was 101.0 (266.3) mg (IQR, 16.0-90.0 mg). A total of 203 participants (81.2%) received the minimum intervention dose (mean [SD], 5.7 [2.2] sessions); at 9 months, 92 of 250 participants (36.8%) discontinued the study. The overall odds ratio for reduction in opioid misuse through the 9-month follow-up period in the MORE group compared with the supportive psychotherapy group was 2.06 (95% CI, 1.17-3.61; <italic>P</italic> = .01). At 9 months, 36 of 80 participants (45.0%) in the MORE group were no longer misusing opioids compared with 19 of 78 participants (24.4%) in the supportive psychotherapy group. Mixed models demonstrated that MORE was superior to supportive psychotherapy through 9 months of follow-up for pain severity (between-group effect: 0.49; 95% CI, 0.17-0.81; <italic>P</italic> = .003) and pain-related functional interference (between-group effect: 1.07; 95% CI, 0.64-1.50; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). Participants in the MORE group reduced their opioid dose to a greater extent than those in the supportive psychotherapy group. The MORE group also had lower emotional distress and opioid craving.</p>

              <p>Long-term opioid therapy (LTOT; ≥90 days of opioid use<sup><xref rid="ioi220002r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>) for the treatment of chronic pain is common in primary care settings,<sup><xref rid="ioi220002r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> despite risks including opioid misuse and opioid use disorder (OUD). Approximately 25% of individuals receiving LTOT misuse opioids,<sup><xref rid="ioi220002r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> which is defined as aberrant drug-related behaviors<sup><xref rid="ioi220002r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> (eg, use of opioids to alleviate negative emotions) inconsistent with prescription directions.<sup><xref rid="ioi220002r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Escalation from chronic pain to opioid misuse and OUD is thought to be propelled by effects of prolonged opioid use on stress and reward circuitry in the brain.<sup><xref rid="ioi220002r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> These neurobiological changes increase sensitization to emotional distress and pain and decrease sensitivity to pleasure derived from natural rewards,<sup><xref rid="ioi220002r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="ioi220002r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> promoting opioid dose escalation as a means of preserving a dwindling sense of well-being.<sup><xref rid="ioi220002r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Because of these complex pathogenic mechanisms as well as a dearth of studies in this area, successful treatment of opioid misuse among people receiving LTOT has proven elusive. Reviews<sup><xref rid="ioi220002r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="ioi220002r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> have identified a lack of full-scale interventional clinical trials examining approaches to mitigate the risk of high-dose opioid use and misuse among people with chronic pain. With few exceptions,<sup><xref rid="ioi220002r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="ioi220002r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> this evidence gap remains.</p>
              <p>To combat the opioid crisis, guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention<sup><xref rid="ioi220002r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> have encouraged clinicians to consider nonpharmacologic therapies, such as mindfulness. Yet, absent large clinical trials, the impact of mindfulness techniques on patients with co-occurring pain and opioid misuse is uncertain.<sup><xref rid="ioi220002r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement (MORE)<sup><xref rid="ioi220002r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> unites mindfulness training, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and principles from positive psychology into an integrative group therapy to target the reward dysregulation underpinning chronic pain and opioid misuse.<sup><xref rid="ioi220002r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Given preliminary evidence of the efficacy of MORE in pilot studies with short follow-up periods,<sup><xref rid="ioi220002r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="ioi220002r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="ioi220002r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> this full-scale clinical trial with 9 months of follow-up evaluated the efficacy of MORE delivered in a primary care setting compared with a supportive group psychotherapy control condition (validated in previous studies<sup><xref rid="ioi220002r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="ioi220002r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="ioi220002r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>) designed to control for nonspecific therapeutic factors (eg, social support and therapeutic relationships).<sup><xref rid="ioi220002r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> We hypothesized that implementation of the MORE intervention among adults with both chronic pain and opioid misuse who were receiving LTOT would result in significant reductions in opioid misuse, pain severity, and pain-related functional interference (primary outcomes) as well as decreases in opioid dosing, emotional distress, and opioid craving (secondary outcomes) compared with supportive psychotherapy.</p>

                <title>Interventions</title>
                <p>The MORE and supportive psychotherapy interventions were delivered in primary care clinics to groups of 6 to 12 participants across 8 weekly 2-hour sessions. The same set of clinical social workers (A.K.B., S.E.R., M.R.R., and another nonauthor clinician; mean [SD], 6.5 [2.6] years of experience) provided both MORE and supportive psychotherapy.</p>
                <p>The manualized MORE intervention<sup><xref rid="ioi220002r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> provided sequenced training in mindfulness, reappraisal, and savoring skills (eMethods 1 in <xref rid="note-IOI220002-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 2</xref>). Mindfulness consisted of meditation on breathing and body sensations to strengthen self-regulation of compulsive opioid use and to mitigate pain and opioid craving by reinterpreting these experiences as innocuous sensory information. Reappraisal consisted of reframing maladaptive thoughts to decrease negative emotions and engender meaning in life. Savoring consisted of training in focusing awareness on pleasurable events and sensations to amplify positive emotions and reward. Sessions provided psychoeducation to address opioid misuse and chronic pain. Participants were asked to engage in daily 15-minute audio-guided mindfulness, reappraisal, and savoring practices and to log practice minutes daily via their smartphones. In addition, participants were instructed to practice 3 minutes of mindfulness before taking opioid medications to clarify whether opioid use was due to craving or the need for pain relief and to foster an opioid-sparing effect by providing a nonpharmacologic pain management approach. The minimum intervention dose of MORE (and supportive psychotherapy) was defined a priori as 4 or more treatment sessions based on treatment completion thresholds established in other mindfulness clinical trials.<sup><xref rid="ioi220002r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="ioi220002r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup></p>
                <p>The supportive psychotherapy intervention involved discussions about coping with pain, the adverse effects of opioids, and the use of opioids to alleviate negative emotions. To match the homework requirement in the MORE group, participants in the supportive psychotherapy group were asked to write on weekly session topics in a journal for 15 minutes per day and to log minutes spent writing in their journal each day via their smartphones. During supportive psychotherapy, social workers used empathic responding techniques, elicited emotional expression from participants, and promoted a supportive climate but eschewed discussions about mindfulness and did not provide therapeutic skill training. Participants were guided via reflective listening techniques to express emotions and thoughts about group topics and to provide advice and emotional support to their peers. Supportive psychotherapy interventions, which typify a widely available form of conventional process-oriented client-centered therapy,<sup><xref rid="ioi220002r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> have been shown to reduce chronic pain.<sup><xref rid="ioi220002r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> Our supportive psychotherapy intervention was validated as a control condition in previous mindfulness clinical trials,<sup><xref rid="ioi220002r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="ioi220002r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="ioi220002r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> which found no significant difference in treatment credibility ratings between mindfulness interventions and supportive psychotherapy.</p>

                <p>Outcomes were collected at baseline, after treatment, and at 3, 6, and 9 months of follow-up. Our prespecified coprimary opioid misuse outcome was assessed using the Drug Misuse Index (DMI), a validated composite measure.<sup><xref rid="ioi220002r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Because no single criterion-standard opioid misuse measure exists, the DMI uses 3 levels of data to characterize opioid misuse: (1) self-reports from the COMM (score range, 0-68 points, with higher scores indicating greater likelihood of current opioid misuse); (2) clinical assessments of opioid misuse with the Addiction Behaviors Checklist (score range, 0-20, with higher scores indicating more aberrant drug-related behaviors),<sup><xref rid="ioi220002r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> which were rated by clinical staff (ie, psychologists, social workers, and nurses) who were blinded to treatment assignment; and (3) urine toxicologic screening results. Participants were informed that reports of opioid misuse and OUD symptoms would not be disclosed to their physicians and were protected by a National Institutes of Health Certificate of Confidentiality. Scores of 9 or greater on the COMM and 2 or greater on the Addiction Behaviors Checklist were considered positive results. Positive ratings on the urine screening were given when participants received positive results for illicit drugs or nonprescribed opioid medications. Participants with positive COMM scores were given a positive rating on the DMI (ie, a score of 1). If COMM scores were inconsistent with opioid misuse (ie, scores &lt;9 points), then positive results on both the Addiction Behaviors Checklist and urine screening were needed for a positive DMI rating because urine screening can be inaccurate as a result of false-positive results and variable drug metabolites, and clinician ratings may be unreliable. Otherwise, participants were given a negative DMI rating (ie, a score of 0). Multiple studies have used this DMI scoring method.<sup><xref rid="ioi220002r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="ioi220002r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="ioi220002r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="ioi220002r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="ioi220002r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup></p>

                <title>Statistical Analysis</title>
                <p>Based on dichotomous classification of opioid misuse in a pilot study<sup><xref rid="ioi220002r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> (63% improvement among individuals receiving MORE vs 32% improvement among individuals receiving supportive psychotherapy), we determined that 200 participants (after 30% attrition) would provide power greater than 0.90 to detect DMI differences of this extent. Assuming moderately correlated repeated measures, this sample size would also provide power greater than 0.90 to estimate small clinical effects on the BPI pain severity and pain-related functional interference measures and other continuous outcomes (Cohen <italic>d</italic> in pilot studies of MORE were 0.50-0.84<sup><xref rid="ioi220002r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>). We planned to enroll 260 participants to account for unavailability for follow-up; the actual number of participants enrolled was 250.</p>
                <p>Following prespecified analysis plans, intention-to-treat analyses were performed using full information maximum likelihood estimation, which yielded unbiased population estimates based on missing at random mechanisms. The primary dichotomous DMI outcome was analyzed using a generalized linear mixed model with a logistic link and random intercept. By design, all participants began the clinical trial with a positive DMI rating, so there was no baseline adjustment for this outcome. Primary BPI outcomes were analyzed (conditioned on prerandomization baseline values) using mixed-effects repeated-measures analyses of covariance. The primary fixed effect of interest was the adjusted (unadjusted for DMI rating) treatment main effect, which estimated the mean overall benefit of MORE vs supportive psychotherapy across all follow-up visits. Results of supplementary treatment-by-time interaction tests are available in eMethods 2 in <xref rid="note-IOI220002-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 2</xref>. To model serial dependence, maximum likelihood models specified random intercepts, which generated compound symmetry covariances with autoregressive error if needed to improve model fit. We examined clinic and group cohort as random effects; because of minimal variance, these random effects left all model estimates essentially unchanged, so we omitted them from the final models for statistical parsimony (eMethods 3 in <xref rid="note-IOI220002-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 2</xref>). Opioid dose (log transformed to reduce skew) and emotional distress outcomes were analyzed similarly. Continuous outcomes were reported as model-based estimates in the original scale measurement. Sample proportions of participants achieving clinically important outcomes for opioid misuse, pain, and opioid dose measures at 9 months were reported. Ecological momentary assessments of opioid craving were analyzed using a similar mixed model, in which the primary effect of interest was the difference in craving trajectory across the 270 possible ecological momentary assessments per participant. To control for false discovery in coprimary outcomes, we compared the unadjusted <italic>P</italic> values with Bonferroni-adjusted (α = .05 divided by 3) <italic>P</italic> = .0167. To control for false discovery in secondary outcomes, we conducted a global hypothesis test (with significance threshold of α = .05) of no treatment difference on any measure using a multivariate mixed-effects linear model. Data were analyzed using SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc), and MPlus software, version 8.5 (Muthen &amp; Muthen).</p>
                <p>Participants who missed follow-up visits were permitted to participate at later time points. No missing data were imputed. Likelihood methods provided consistent estimates of quantities of interest when data were missing at random. Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess possible departures from the missing at random assumption (eMethods 4 in <xref rid="note-IOI220002-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 2</xref>). Data cannot be considered not missing at random when the probability of missingness depends on the underlying extent of the outcome (such as study withdrawal due to a disinclination to report opioid misuse or nonresponse to the study interventions). We used a simple selection model for data not missing at random<sup><xref rid="ioi220002r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="ioi220002r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> to incorporate dependence into likelihood estimation. Sensitivity to data missing at random was also evaluated using full information maximum likelihood estimation multivariate analyses that introduced a larger set of auxiliary demographic and clinical variables expected to correlate with missingness (designated as the expanded missing at random model), an alternative to multiple imputation that often produces more accurate and precise parameter estimates.<sup><xref rid="ioi220002r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> We also conducted pattern mixture models in which participants in the MORE group who withdrew from the study were assumed to respond similarly to participants receiving supportive psychotherapy, providing a conservative lower-bound estimate of the treatment effect based on the assumption that MORE conferred no benefit after discontinuation.</p>

Moreover, the global multivariate test was highly significant (change in χ<sup>2</sup> = 27.9; df = 5; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001).

The consistency of these findings suggested that the inferential conclusions were robust over a range of missing data mechanisms and scenarios.</p>
                <p>With regard to secondary outcomes, the MORE intervention reduced the morphine-equivalent daily dose to a greater extent than supportive psychotherapy (between-group effect: 0.15 log mg; 95% CI, 0.03-0.27 log mg; <italic>P</italic> = .009) (<xref rid="ioi220002t2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). These effects remained significant after excluding participants who were prescribed methadone or buprenorphine. By the 9-month follow-up visit, 22 of 62 participants (35.5%) in the MORE group had decreased their opioid dose by at least 50% compared with 11 of 69 participants (15.9%) in the supportive psychotherapy group (<italic>P</italic> = .009) (<xref rid="ioi220002f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>In this randomized clinical trial, among participants with chronic pain who were misusing opioids at the beginning of the study, the MORE intervention led to large and statistically significant decreases in opioid misuse compared with supportive psychotherapy. In addition, MORE led to greater improvements in pain severity and functional interference than supportive psychotherapy; these therapeutic effects were larger than the effect size of CBT (the current criterion standard for treatment of psychological pain) reported in a meta-analysis.<sup><xref rid="ioi220002r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> Participants in the MORE group also reduced their daily opioid dose to a greater extent than those in the supportive psychotherapy group. Finally, compared with supportive psychotherapy, MORE decreased emotional distress, depressive symptoms, and real-time reports of opioid craving in daily life.</p>
              <p>Although opioid misuse decreased in the supportive psychotherapy group, possibly reflecting the therapeutic activity of this approach, the effects of the MORE intervention were substantially greater than those of this active control condition. Unlike many interventions with effects that are greatest immediately after treatment but gradually diminish, MORE’s effect was sustained, likely a function of the intervention’s unique mechanisms of action, including enhanced neurophysiologic responsivity to natural, healthy rewards and improved self-regulation of reactivity to opioid-related cues (eg, craving and brain reward responses elicited by the sight of one’s opioid pill bottle).<sup><xref rid="ioi220002r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="ioi220002r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="ioi220002r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="ioi220002r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="ioi220002r44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="ioi220002r45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> By integrating mindfulness with reappraisal and savoring techniques, the MORE intervention aimed to restructure reward processing from valuing drug-related rewards to valuing natural rewards,<sup><xref rid="ioi220002r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> a therapeutic focus that is distinct from that of other mindfulness-based interventions, such as mindfulness-based stress reduction.</p>
              <p>Before this clinical trial, in addition to pilot studies of MORE,<sup><xref rid="ioi220002r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="ioi220002r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="ioi220002r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> only 3 other small studies evaluated behavioral therapies for comorbid chronic pain and opioid misuse.<sup><xref rid="ioi220002r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="ioi220002r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> A large clinical trial<sup><xref rid="ioi220002r46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> recently found that CBT reduced pain but did not reduce opioid use among people receiving LTOT. In contrast, the current full-scale clinical trial demonstrated that MORE could reduce opioid use and misuse while alleviating chronic pain and emotional distress. The MORE intervention’s broad-spectrum effects were noteworthy given that many participants in the sample presented with multiple chronic pain conditions, were taking high opioid doses, and had co-occurring psychiatric disorders. Nonetheless, MORE is an intensive intervention, and brief CBT interventions have been shown to improve chronic pain and emotional distress among individuals who do not misuse opioids.<sup><xref rid="ioi220002r47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Furthermore, although not an inclusion criterion, more than 50% of participants met the criteria for OUD on the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Opioid use disorder is often unrecognized in primary care settings,<sup><xref rid="ioi220002r48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="ioi220002r49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup> and most patients with OUD in primary care settings are not receiving medications for OUD.<sup><xref rid="ioi220002r50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup> Although not all patients who misuse opioids have OUD, opioid misuse is a risk factor for OUD.<sup><xref rid="ioi220002r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="ioi220002r51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup> In this clinical trial, the MORE intervention decreased opioid misuse and craving among individuals with comorbid pain and OUD, a population that is especially difficult to treat given that OUD increases pain sensitivity, and pain promotes OUD relapse.<sup><xref rid="ioi220002r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Unlike outpatient addiction specialty care that primarily focuses on treating OUD symptoms, the MORE intervention was delivered in a primary care setting and simultaneously addressed pain and addictive behavior. The MORE approach may be efficacious for the treatment of this challenging comorbidity, as shown in the current clinical trial and reported in previous pilot studies<sup><xref rid="ioi220002r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="ioi220002r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>; however, additional clinical trials are needed.</p>

                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p>This study has several limitations. The clinical trial was limited by its discontinuation rate, which was similar to that of other clinical trials of psychosocial treatment for individuals using opioids (mean discontinuation rate of 42%<sup><xref rid="ioi220002r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>) and not unexpected given the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic during the final study year (4% of participants completed 9-month follow-up visits in the final study year compared with 74% of participants in the year before the pandemic). Some participants declined to provide follow-up data during the height of the pandemic, and COVID-19–related research restrictions also resulted in missing data. The transient and vulnerable nature of the study sample, who had chronic medical and psychiatric comorbidities, substance use disorders, and poverty status, also contributed to study discontinuation. However, our discontinuation rate was better than that of clinical trials of medications for OUD that had shorter durations of 24 weeks (eg, discontinuation rates of 43% in the study by Haight et al<sup><xref rid="ioi220002r52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup> and 55% in the study by Krupitsky et al<sup><xref rid="ioi220002r53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup>). Because study withdrawal rates did not differ between the MORE and supportive psychotherapy groups, missing data were unlikely to bias the outcome analyses toward 1 group vs the other. Sensitivity analyses accounting for data not missing at random continued to show the superiority of the MORE intervention over supportive psychotherapy.</p>
                <p>The clinical trial may have been limited by the lack of stratified randomization by LTOT duration or the use of medications for OUD. However, LTOT duration and the proportion of participants receiving medications for OUD did not differ by intervention group, and sensitivity analyses including these covariates did not substantively change the findings. Although we used the DMI, a composite measure that combines data from clinical interviews and urine screening with self-reported opioid misuse scores on the COMM, the COMM is a major component of the DMI, which is a limitation given that it was impossible to conceal treatment assignment from participants. This inability to conceal treatment assignment may have biased participants’ responses on the self-reported COMM measure. Nonetheless, the study was presented to participants as a comparison of 2 behavioral treatments, and no indication was given that participants receiving MORE were in the experimental group.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>In this randomized clinical trial, MORE demonstrated sustained efficacy for improving opioid misuse, opioid dosing, and chronic pain symptoms across 9 months of follow-up. Future comparative-effectiveness clinical trials are needed to determine the impact of MORE relative to other empirically supported interventions (eg, CBT or mindfulness-based stress reduction), and implementation clinical trials are needed to determine the extent to which MORE can be effectively implemented at scale in the context of standard medical care. Integrated health care teams comprising social workers, psychologists, nurses, and/or physicians could potentially deliver MORE in primary care settings via group medical visits.</p>
