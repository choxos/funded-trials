                <p id="Par1">Cardiac radiotherapy (RT) may be effective in treating heart failure (HF) patients with refractory ventricular tachycardia (VT). The previously proposed mechanism of radiation-induced fibrosis does not explain the rapidity and magnitude with which VT reduction occurs clinically. Here, we demonstrate in hearts from RT patients that radiation does not achieve transmural fibrosis within the timeframe of VT reduction. Electrophysiologic assessment of irradiated murine hearts reveals a persistent supraphysiologic electrical phenotype, mediated by increases in Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 and Cx43. By sequencing and transgenic approaches, we identify Notch signaling as a mechanistic contributor to Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 upregulation after RT. Clinically, RT was associated with increased Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 expression in 1 of 1 explanted heart. On electrocardiogram (ECG), post-RT QRS durations were shortened in 13 of 19 patients and lengthened in 5 patients. Collectively, this study provides evidence for radiation-induced reprogramming of cardiac conduction as a potential treatment strategy for arrhythmia management in VT patients.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="Par3">Sudden cardiac arrest, occurring in the setting of impaired cardiac function and structural heart disease that lead to ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation, is a leading cause of death in the world<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Implantable cardioverter defibrillators improve survival in at-risk populations at the cost of reduced quality of life from shocks and potential for worsening heart failure (HF). Anti-arrhythmic drugs (AADs) have considerable side effects and modest efficacy. Invasive radiofrequency catheter ablation (CA) identifies electrically reentrant regions within scar and delivers ablative thermal energy to homogenize scar and eliminate VT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. However, CA is time-consuming, technically challenging, and highly operator-dependent. Rates of acute VT cessation and durable control are high in favorable individuals, especially first-time CA patients with preserved ventricular function and ischemic cardiomyopathy with focal scar<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Success rates are considerably lower in patients with severely impaired ventricular function, diffuse scar, or prior CA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Failure of CA may occur in part due to anatomical factors or limitations in the properties of heat transfer physics to create full-thickness, gap-free ablations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par4">Radiotherapy (RT) noninvasively delivers high-dose radiation to volumes of target tissue anywhere in the body, with minimal off-target exposure, and is well established for treating malignancies. Hypothetically, ablative doses of radiation could noninvasively replicate effects of CA, with a fibrotic response expected over months to years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Recent clinical evidence has demonstrated the safety and efficacy of cardiac RT for treatment of refractory VT in patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. The first case series reported a 99.9% reduction in VT burden after treatment with 25 Gray (Gy) ionizing radiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. More recently, a prospective Phase I/II trial of 19 patients who had either previously failed or were not eligible for CA reported a 94% reduction in episodes of VT or premature ventricular contractions and a 12-month survival rate of 72% in this very sick population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Similar outcomes have since been replicated by several independent medical centers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. In all cases, the therapeutic effect was observed within days to weeks, well before RT-induced fibrosis is expected to occur. As such, the mechanisms by which radiation reduces VT remain unknown.</p>
              <p id="Par5">Early preclinical studies that investigated the therapeutic potential for cardiac RT attempted to create transmural fibrosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. In these models, higher doses between 40 and 160 Gy were sufficient to induce late-stage cardiac fibrosis and cause subacute atrioventricular block<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, while lower doses did not achieve these effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Importantly, these prior studies have not explained how doses in the range of 25 Gy can reduce VT burden acutely.</p>
              <p id="Par6">The presence of structural or electrical heterogeneity in the heart increases the probability of unidirectional block and reentrant tachycardia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. For sustained reentry, the conduction wavelength, defined as distance traveled by an electrical impulse while the myocardium is refractory, must be shorter than the path of conduction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. This wavelength is equal to the mathematical product of the effective refractory period (ERP) and conduction velocity (CV). Hence, the presence of long, tortuous substrates, fast repolarization, and slowed CV all predispose to reentry. CA prevents reentry by terminating conduction substrates, while management with Class III AADs prolongs the action potential duration (APD) and ERP to increase wavelength<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. To date, there are no approved VT therapies that act through increasing CV. Though radiation is presumed to prevent arrhythmia by creating fibrosis in arrhythmogenic scar, the antiarrhythmic effects preventing reentry could potentially act through effects on ERP and/or CV.</p>
              <p id="Par7">In this study, we evaluated effects of ionizing radiation on the heart. Using explanted specimens from cardiac RT patients, we show that 25 Gy photon radiation, used in all clinical studies to date, was not sufficient to achieve CA-like scar. In mice and patients, we find that 25 Gy persistently increases levels of cardiac conduction proteins and enhances ventricular conduction. Through gain- and loss-of-function approaches, we identify cardiomyocyte Notch signaling as a potential mechanism whereby radiation may reprogram conduction. We also report a statistically nonsignificant difference in QRS intervals, with a tendency toward QRS shortening, in 19 patients treated with RT. Here we further discuss therapeutic strategies for reprogramming ventricular cardiomyocytes to a pro-conduction phenotype to prevent electrical reentry.</p>

Specimens targeted with 25 Gy radiation were stained with Masson’s trichrome to visualize fibrosis, and targeted regions were compared with nontargeted remote specimens within the same hearts (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a, b</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Across samples, remote specimens received &lt;5 Gy exposure.

                <p id="Par9">At baseline, individual hearts exhibited distinct levels of underlying fibrosis. Given that anatomic scarring is important for prescribing treatment locations and volumes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, greater fibrosis is expected in radiation-targeted regions even prior to treatment. Using image-segmented analysis, we observed only minor differences in fibrosis between matched targeted and nontargeted regions of patients’ hearts, and fibrosis was lower in all radiation-targeted myocardium when compared to CA myocardium (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). Independent of fibrosis, all four patients experienced substantial reductions in VT episodes in the 6 months following RT (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>). Representative contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of Patient E revealed no change in gadolinium enhancement and preserved myocardial tissue between baseline and at 3-month follow-up in the RT-targeted region (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>), and there was no evidence of increased fibrosis on MRI post-RT in any patient. These clinical findings are consistent with previous preclinical studies that required doses in excess of 40 Gy to produce scar<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Collectively, these data strongly suggest that fibrosis alone cannot explain the clinical timeline and magnitude of reduced VT burden observed after RT.</p>

                <p id="Par10">To further evaluate effects of 25 Gy irradiation (IR) to the heart, we assessed for structural and physiologic changes to the murine heart post-IR. To test whether post-mitotic mammalian cardiomyocytes recover from 25 Gy radiation-induced DNA damage, murine hearts were stained at 30 min, 3 h, and 24 h post-IR for phosphorylated histone H2AX (γH2AX), a marker of double-stranded DNA breaks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Both percentages of γH2AX-positive nuclei and mean γH2AX intensity decreased with respect to time (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>), a property of radioresistant tissues that demonstrates DNA repair and survival<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. At 6 weeks post-IR, we performed Masson’s trichrome staining to assess for gross evidence of fibrosis and did not detect significant collagen staining in either treatment condition after 6 weeks (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3a</xref>). Furthermore, we observed no difference in collagen content between treated and untreated murine ventricles 6 weeks post-IR, as determined by quantitative hydroxyproline assay (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3b</xref>).</p>
                <p id="Par11">Electrophysiologic and structural remodeling both contribute to arrhythmogenic substrates in the setting of disease. Because RT reduces VT in the absence of profound CA-like structural change, we evaluated electrophysiologic mechanisms by which IR may prevent reentry. We tested the effects of 25 Gy IR on adult murine cardiac electrophysiology at the clinically efficacious timepoint of 6 weeks post-IR, when a 99.9% reduction in VT burden was reported in patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. While previous preclinical studies reported heart block in the 40–160 Gy dose range<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, 25 Gy radiation did not cause atrioventricular delay as measured by PR interval on electrocardiogram (ECG; Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a, b</xref>). However, a significantly shortened QRS interval was observed in IR mice compared to sham controls (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a, c</xref>), while heart rate and other ECG intervals were unchanged (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4a–c</xref>). To measure functional effects associated with QRS shortening, we optically mapped Langendorff-perfused mouse hearts. Ventricular CVs were significantly increased in IR mice compared to sham controls (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d, e</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4d</xref>), while APD at 80% repolarization (APD<sub>80</sub>) and ERP were unchanged (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f, g</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4e</xref>). Together, these results suggest that 25 Gy radiation increases CV in the absence of profound changes to electrical repolarization, which favorably alters conditions against electrical reentry.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>Cardiac RT persistently increases adult murine ventricular conduction.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Representative ECGs from control (top) and IR mice (bottom) highlighting PR and QRS intervals. <bold>b</bold>, <bold>c</bold> Effect of radiation on PR (<italic>P</italic> = 0.39) and QRS (**<italic>P</italic> = 0.00043) intervals in control (black) versus IR (red) mice (<italic>n</italic> = 6 biologically independent animals per condition). <bold>d</bold> Representative ventricular activation maps from control and IR mice.

                <p id="Par12">To understand how radiation increases CV, we quantified the major molecular determinants of cardiac conduction: cell size, the cardiac sodium channel, and cardiac gap junctions. We detected no differences in cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area between the treatment groups (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3c</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">d</xref>), and furthermore, the heart weight-to-tibia length ratio, a surrogate marker of hypertrophy, was unchanged (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3e</xref>). Next, we performed western blots to assess for relative amounts of Na<sub>V</sub>1.5, the pore-forming subunit of the cardiac voltage-gated sodium channel responsible for phase 0 depolarization.

To better understand the chronic implications of single-fraction radiation for VT therapy, we asked whether CV, Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 levels, and Cx43 levels remain persistently elevated. At 42 weeks, IR mice continued to express increased Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 and Cx43 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2l, m</xref>), and in this aged cohort, the QRS also remained shortened (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2n</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5a–d</xref>).

This dose was selected based on data from preclinical studies that attempted to create radiation-induced fibrosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Given that the mechanism of RT could be mediated through electrophysiologic reprogramming, we asked whether doses &lt;25 Gy are sufficient to achieve radiation-induced electrical changes to improve cardiac RT safety while maintaining efficacy. Using a dose de-escalation approach, we observed significantly faster CVs and shorter QRS durations in IR hearts treated with 20 and 15 Gy, while doses of 10 or 5 Gy did not result in significant differences (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a, b</xref>). As expected, ECG intervals were comparable among treatment groups prior to IR treatment (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>), and we did not observe dose-dependent differences in other ECG intervals or heart rate at 6 weeks post-IR (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>). Overall, the magnitude of conduction increase measured by CV and QRS tended to be greater in the 20 Gy group than in the 15 Gy group, though our study was not designed to detect differences between these two groups. Consistent with the functional dose response, western blotting of protein lysates revealed dose-dependent responses on expression of Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 and Cx43 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c, d</xref>).

Border zone (BZ) myocardium above the LAD ligation was stimulated and CV through viable myocardium was quantified, including the anatomic BZ region defined as the 2 mm segment of tissue scar junction, but these impulses did not further propagate into the scar region (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>, gray region, and Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8a</xref>). In conducting myocardium, 25 Gy radiation significantly increased both longitudinal and transverse CVs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a, b</xref>), which included isochrones in the anatomic BZ near the scar.

                <p id="Par23">Next, we analyzed serial surface ECGs of patients who received cardiac RT. In contrast to the mouse, where the whole heart is irradiated, only the arrhythmogenic region of a patient’s heart is targeted. Thus, not all RT patients would be expected to exhibit a shortened QRS duration. Even still, we observed a statistically nonsignificant difference in QRS durations within the 19-patient cohort by 6 weeks post-RT (149 ± 34 ms pre-RT versus 139 ± 32 ms post-RT, <italic>n</italic> = 19, <italic>P</italic> = 0.072, Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8d</xref>). Overall, compared to baseline intervals, post-RT QRS durations were shorter in 13 patients and longer in 5 patients (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8d</xref>). We also present examples of robust RT-associated QRS shortening, defined strictly as a decrease in the QRS duration by ≥25 ms on serial ECGs, in at least 4 out of the 19 patients (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8e</xref> and Supplementary Figs. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">12</xref>–<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">14</xref>). As an example, Patient G’s QRS shortened from 165 ms with left bundle branch block (LBBB) to a QRS interval of 130 ms without LBBB, and this QRS remained shorted for at least 6 months (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8e</xref>).

              <p id="Par24">Cardiac RT is an emerging treatment option for patients with refractory VT. The objective of this study was to define the structural, functional, and molecular effects of focused, single-fraction RT in the adult mammalian heart. Our findings suggest that radiation may be used therapeutically to modulate cardiac electrophysiology for VT management.</p>
              <p id="Par25">Through histologic examination and MRI scans of the hearts from patients who received cardiac RT, we provide evidence from a cohort of human RT patients to show that 25 Gy transmural radiation does not create transmural scar. These findings are consistent with preclinical studies that required doses in excess of 40 Gy to produce lesions that interrupted conduction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Importantly, emerging preclinical and clinical reports continue to cite fibrosis and scar homogenization as the preferred biologic effect after RT and often discuss whether 25 Gy treatments result in underdosing to the target. Yet, clinical VT reductions occur within weeks following 25 Gy RT, and radiation-induced fibrosis alone cannot account for the magnitude and timing of these effects. Indeed, our study further contributes to the growing body evidence to suggest that, for cardiac RT, dose strategies may not necessarily be chosen based on the anticipated effects of late-stage, radiation-induced fibrosis to achieve therapeutic effect.</p>
              <p id="Par26">Previous preclinical studies have reported increases in global levels and lateralization of Cx43 after carbon radiation to the heart<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>, and increased gap junction formation was reported after radiation to other tissue types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. In these studies, the mechanism of Cx43 upregulation and the functional consequences of lateralization remain unclear. In the current study using photon-based IR, we also observed IR-associated increases in Cx43 protein; however, we did not observe changes in Cx43 lateralization or conduction anisotropy. Future studies are warranted to determine whether there are differences in Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 and Cx43 responses, as well as dosing considerations, among different radiation modalities, including X-ray, carbon ion, and proton beam cardiac RT.</p>
              <p id="Par27">Reduced sodium channel expression and availability frequently occur in the setting of heart disease or injury and are major causes of acquired arrhythmias<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Slowed conduction due to reduced sodium current density is a critical factor in sustaining reentry in regions of fibrosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. Previous large animal studies have demonstrated feasibility of gene therapy delivery of skeletal muscle sodium channel SkM1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup> and connexins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup> to increase cardiac conduction and prevent VT. Here we observe acute, persistent increases in electrical propagation within IR-treated hearts mediated by increases in Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 and Cx43. Indeed, increases in either sodium channel expression or gap junction coupling are expected to prevent reentrant arrhythmias<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup> via restoration of cardiac conduction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par28">Previously, reactivation of developmental signaling pathways, including Notch, was sufficient to epigenetically reprogram cardiomyocytes to produce a conductive “Purkinje-like” electro-phenotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Furthermore, Notch signaling is known to play a role in the radiation response and radio-resistance of several tissue types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. Through RNA-seq and transgenic approaches, we identify cardiomyocyte-specific Notch activation as one potential cell signaling mechanism that may contribute to the pro-conductive effect of radiation via upregulation of the cardiac sodium channel. In this study, we utilized murine model systems to allow for genetic manipulation and testing of direct causality of radiation-induced conduction reprogramming. Specifically, we demonstrate that cardiomyocyte Notch activation is both sufficient to increase cardiac conduction and necessary to achieve the full effects of radiation-induced conduction reprogramming through gain- and loss-of-function approaches.</p>
              <p id="Par29">The functional effects of increased Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 and Cx43 may act through several electrical mechanisms to prevent conduction block and reentry and explain the antiarrhythmic effect conferred to patients after 25 Gy RT. In the setting of heart disease and conduction heterogeneity, homogenization of conduction through restoration of either membrane excitability or intercellular coupling would reduce the vulnerable window that allows unidirectional block to occur<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. Additionally, increased intercellular coupling alone may prevent aberrant conduction by increasing the functional sink and reducing the safety factor to terminate arrhythmic conduction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. However, this phenomenon requires Cx43 upregulation that exceeds the effect size observed our study. Finally, data from our current study suggests that, within surviving cardiomyocytes in the peri-infarct region, upregulation of Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 and Cx43 results in local increases in CV to functionally rescue regions of conduction delay necessary for sustained reentry and tachycardia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. Future studies are warranted to determine which molecular effects can be best leveraged in the setting of RT to prevent reentry and tachycardia.</p>
              <p id="Par30">Our study presents findings to suggest that an antiarrhythmic therapy, successfully used in patients with refractory VT, may increase levels of the cardiac sodium channel and improve conduction. Indeed, explanted cardiac specimens obtained from a treated patient with refractory VT revealed threefold higher Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 protein levels in the radiation-targeted region when compared to a nontargeted region of the same heart, restoring Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 to levels within the range of nonfailing myocardium. As an observation of the potential effect of RT on human physiology, we also report a nonsignificant decrease in mean QRS duration in the Electrophysiology-guided Noninvasive Cardiac Radioablation for Ventricular Tachycardia (ENCORE-VT) patient cohort, as well as robustly shortened QRS intervals in at least 4 of the 19 patients.</p>
              <p id="Par31">Our findings have direct relevance for patient care. Most surviving patients continue to exhibit reduced VT burden 24 months after a single RT treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Our results demonstrate that the functional and molecular effects of RT and Notch reactivation are persistent and expected to directly translate into long-term durability of therapy. A dosage of 25 Gy was prescribed in previous clinical studies to minimize cardiotoxic effects of radiation. Although this current dose is proven to be safe and effective<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, there are rare cases of pericardial effusion and a single adverse event of gastropericardial fistula that occurred 2 years after treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Here we show that radiation-induced electrical reprogramming can also occur at lower doses in the range of 15–25 Gy in mice. Indeed, Notch signaling has been reported to activate in a variety of tissue types following lower doses of radiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>. These data could warrant future clinical studies of careful downward dose titration to find the lowest effective dose that minimizes risk of late-stage toxicity. Lower dosages may be particularly favorable in instances when the prescribed treatment volume is large or when the prescribed treatment location is adjacent to nearby radiosensitive organs.</p>
              <p id="Par32">There are several limitations to our present study. Most patients who received cardiac RT survive with reduced VT burden for years after treatment. Because of the durability of this emerging therapy, available postmortem samples remain limited, and results consequently remain difficult to generalize. This limitation further emphasizes the need for preclinical cardiac RT studies. Given that each patient is prescribed a target volume and location specific to the individual’s scar-related VT, we also acknowledge that global electrophysiologic changes reflected by changes to the QRS interval is neither observed nor expected in every patient. Although we observed 13 patients with shortened QRS durations after RT, these QRS changes were statistically nonsignificant in our 19-patient cohort and at least 5 patients exhibited lengthened QRS durations. Overall, these changes in QRS duration cannot be excluded as an unrelated phenomenon in the absence of additional analyses, and a comprehensive analysis of all ECG parameters is outside of the current scope of our study. This study’s clinical results are also limited by the trial’s single-arm design, low number of patients enrolled, narrow patient selection, and recruitment and treatment conducted at a single academic center, which currently limit generalization of results to other patient populations. In our preclinical study, we profiled radiation response after whole-heart radiation, while, clinically, RT is limited to select arrhythmogenic regions. Indeed, future studies are expected to elucidate relationships among treatment target volume, isodoses, local changes in conduction protein expression, and global changes in ECG intervals. Additionally, we implemented a surgical infarct model of HF, which does not represent the subset of patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy. Furthermore, while humans and large animals have exhibited HF-associated decreases in conduction proteins, rodent models of HF have smaller conduction substrates, exhibit remodeling of repolarizing currents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>, and thus make reentrant tachycardia difficult to demonstrate. Future studies in large animal models of VT are warranted. We also acknowledge that there are important differences between the ionic currents that make up the action potentials of human and murine cardiomyocytes. While excitatory sodium current <italic>I</italic><sub>Na</sub> is well conserved among mammals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>, there are several differences in the expression of repolarizing potassium currents across species. For example, the rapidly (<italic>I</italic><sub>Kr</sub>) and slowly (<italic>I</italic><sub>Ks</sub>) activating delayed rectifier potassium channels responsible for repolarization of the human cardiomyocyte action potential do not exist in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>. Although we do not observe effects of IR on ERP, our study does not rule out an effect of radiation on human cardiomyocyte repolarization. Finally, we highlight cardiomyocyte Notch signaling as a mechanism by which Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 is upregulated after radiation, while acknowledging that the mechanisms of post-RT reprogramming are likely multifactorial. Future studies will undoubtedly further define the cellular mechanisms underlying these effects.</p>
              <p id="Par33">In summary, this study supports a model whereby a single-fraction dose of 25 Gy radiation persistently restores electrical propagation in diseased hearts without causing transmural fibrosis and scar. Mechanistic insights such as these are expected to lead to refinements in the cardiac radiation clinical protocol and ultimately greater adoption of cardiac RT. The ability to noninvasively and functionally eliminate VT circuits, by modulating cardiac electrophysiology in a localized way and without tissue destruction, may allow for safer treatments and prevention of arrhythmias for individuals with myocardial scarring.</p>

To this end, we utilized several experimental approaches. In fibrosis studies, we characterized levels of fibrosis in irradiated human and murine myocardium. In electrophysiologic studies, we studied the effects and mechanisms of cardiac ventricular conduction increase following 25 Gy ionizing radiation in healthy and diseased murine myocardium and following doxycycline-induced activation of Notch signaling and tamoxifen-induced loss of Notch signaling in cardiomyocytes.

At the time of heart transplant or death (autopsy), whole-heart specimens were obtained from patients who previously underwent noninvasive cardiac radiation for treatment of refractory VT and consented to specimen collection. Each specimen was compared with its corresponding radiation treatment plan to identify regions of the heart that were either treated with 25 Gy (targeted) or anatomically distant from radiation (remote).

In one explanted heart collected from transplant, targeted and nontargeted tissue were flash frozen immediately at the time of explant for molecular experiments and protein measurements.

In the aged, long-term murine IR cohort, 2 sham control mice (each at 35 weeks and 42 weeks after sham treatment) and 4 IR mice (each at 18 weeks, 19 weeks, 31 weeks, and 41 weeks post-IR) spontaneously died after treatment. On necropsy, there was no evidence of direct cardiac damage or gross structural differences in either treatment group. Of note, 3 of the 4 cadaveric IR mice appeared notably cachexic compared to surviving littermates.</p>

                <p id="Par45">Adult mice were anesthetized with ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) administered intraperitoneally. Under artificial ventilation, a left thoracotomy was performed to expose the left ventricle and LAD artery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. The proximal portion of the LAD was ligated with a 9-0 silk suture. After closure of the surgical incision, mice were recovered on a warmer and returned to their cage. The mean time for each surgical procedure was approximately 10 min. From 29 mice surviving the initial surgery, 8 died before the end of the 2-week postoperative period, and surviving mice were randomly assigned to receive either 25 Gy IR or sham treatment. During the 6-week period following radiation treatment, one sham mouse and zero IR mice died. At the time of optical mapping (8 weeks post-MI, 6 weeks post-IR), hearts from three mice (one control and two IR) were covered in excess surgical adhesions and/or adhered to the anterior thoracic wall and these hearts could not be dissected without causing ventricular wall rupture and were excluded from downstream optical mapping experiments. In both treatment groups, stimulation of myocardium outside the scar region resulted in optical action potentials within the scar region that had &lt;50% upstroke velocity and peak optical voltage when compared to regions of viable myocardium (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8a</xref>), and thus isochrones below the surgical ligation are omitted.</p>

Specifically, hearts were perfused and immersed in an oxygenated Tyrode’s solution (128.2 mM NaCl, 4.7 mM KCl, 11.1 mM glucose, 1.19 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 20 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1.05 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.3 mM CaCl, pH 7.4) maintained at 37 °C. Briefly, the potentiometric dye Di-4-ANEPPS (Life Technologies) and the excitation–contraction uncoupler blebbistatin (Cayman Chemical) were added to the Langendorff perfusate to allow for fluorescent detection of membrane potential changes and to eliminate motion artifacts, respectively. Murine hearts were electrically stimulated at 10 Hz to measure CV or with S1–S2 stimulation protocols of decreasing cycle lengths to determine ERP. A green 524 nm light source was used to excite the voltage-sensitive dye. The emitted fluorescence was filtered by a single long-pass 650 nm filter and recorded by CMOS camera (BrainVision LLC). Data were collected through the MiCAM Ultima software (v.2011.11, BrainVision LLC). Data analysis was performed on MATLAB using the open source Rhythm software (Rhythm2014b, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://efimovlab.org/research/resources/rhythm">http://efimovlab.org/research/resources/rhythm</ext-link>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup>. With surface coordinate distances and the time of action potential upstroke, defined as maximum voltage derivative (d<italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub>/d<italic>t</italic>)<sub>max</sub> of optical signals, activation maps were generated for calculations of longitudinal and transverse CVs. Velocities were calculated by using isochrone distances and times of action potential upstroke originating from the site of stimulation.
