                <p>COVID-19 serological test must have high sensitivity as well as specificity to rule out cross-reactivity with common coronaviruses (HCoVs). We have developed a quantitative multiplex test, measuring antibodies against spike (S) proteins of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and common human coronavirus strains (229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1), and nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV viruses. Receptor binding domain of S protein of SARS-CoV-2 (S-RBD), and N protein, demonstrated sensitivity (94% and 92.5%, respectively) in COVID-19 patients (n = 53), with 98% specificity in non-COVID-19 respiratory-disease (n = 98), and healthy-controls (n = 129). Anti S-RBD and N antibodies appeared five to ten days post-onset of symptoms, peaking at approximately four weeks. The appearance of IgG and IgM coincided while IgG subtypes, IgG1 and IgG3 appeared soon after the total IgG; IgG2 and IgG4 remained undetectable. Several inflammatory cytokines/chemokines were found to be elevated in many COVID-19 patients (e.g., Eotaxin, Gro-α, CXCL-10 (IP-10), RANTES (CCL5), IL-2Rα, MCP-1, and SCGF-b); CXCL-10 was elevated in all. In contrast to antibody titers, levels of CXCL-10 decreased with the improvement in patient health suggesting it as a candidate for disease resolution. Importantly, anti-N antibodies appear before S-RBD and differentiate between vaccinated and infected people—current vaccines (and several in the pipeline) are S protein-based.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Coronaviruses have long been recognized as important pathogens that cause both mild and severe respiratory diseases in humans [<xref rid="pone.0254367.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0254367.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. So far, seven HCoVs that can invade humans have been identified, including 229E, NL63, HKU1, OC43, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, causing the present pandemic [<xref rid="pone.0254367.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0254367.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0254367.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. NL63 and 229E are α-coronaviruses and OC43 and HKU1 are β-coronaviruses that frequently infect and cause a mild common cold-like illness [<xref rid="pone.0254367.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Antibodies to these common cold HCoVs are present in most individuals (&gt;90%) [<xref rid="pone.0254367.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV are zoonotic β-coronaviruses that have recently crossed into humans and caused severe illness [<xref rid="pone.0254367.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Even with antivirals available, the key to controlling the spread and preventing more virulent strains is rapid detection and isolation of suspect cases. Serological methods for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection will enable the evaluation of several important aspects in the fight against COVID-19: sub-clinical disease missed by molecular diagnostic methods, testing contacts of COVID-19 positive individuals, proof of previous infection, making links between clusters to help epidemiological investigations, assessment of COVID-19 vaccine efficacy, and prevalence information to develop effective measures to lower the rate of new infections [<xref rid="pone.0254367.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0254367.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p>
              <p>Although molecular diagnostic tests have been developed to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection, serological assays are important as a complement to PCR in the diagnosis of infection. PCR tests can detect SARS-CoV-2 during the period of viral shedding but the duration of viral shedding is not well understood [<xref rid="pone.0254367.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Importantly, RT-PCR may yield up to 29 percent false-negative results globally; 10 percent in the USA [<xref rid="pone.0254367.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p>
              <p>It has been reported that COVID-19 patients seroconvert and develop antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 antigens after 6 to 21 days of clinical symptoms [<xref rid="pone.0254367.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Hence serological tests have generated substantial interest as an alternative and/or complement to RT-PCR. However, serological tests may have high false-positive results due to cross-reactivity with common coronaviruses. Therefore, carefully developed and validated serologic assays are critical for patient contact tracing, identifying the viral reservoir hosts, and epidemiologic studies [<xref rid="pone.0254367.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Serologic assays are also needed for the evaluation of results of vaccine trials and monitoring therapeutic antibodies.</p>
              <p>A key limitation of conventional serological assays is that they can detect only a single coronavirus antigen in each serum sample resulting in an inefficient testing system. A substantial number of the new commercial COVID-19 antibody serological tests are lateral flow assays, which provide a simple positive or negative result, with no quantitative information and lack the desired sensitivity and specificity [<xref rid="pone.0254367.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. To circumvent this limitation, well-characterized multiplexed serological assays are needed. We have previously demonstrated the diagnostic validity of a bead-based multi-analyte serological assay in tuberculosis (TB) based on testing for plasma antibodies to specific <italic toggle="yes">Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> antigens [<xref rid="pone.0254367.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0254367.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. We have successfully implemented a multiplex antibody assay for 17 mouse pathogens including a mouse coronavirus for routine sentinel screening at the Comparative Pathology Laboratory (University of California Davis) and Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, Maine, USA) [<xref rid="pone.0254367.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0254367.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p>
              <p>Here, we report the development and validation of a multiplex bead assay to simultaneously and specifically detect antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and common human coronavirus strains (229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1). Furthermore, multiplex serological assays enabled the investigation of the dynamics of immune responses (antibodies including immunoglobulin subtypes, and cytokines/chemokines) in COVID-19 patients.</p>

(Wayne, PA) (Described in detail in the section Recombinant Proteins under Materials and Methods) Carboxylated microbeads were purchased from Luminex Corp. (Austin, TX). Various antigen preparations were covalently conjugated to the microbeads as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0254367.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Briefly, an aliquot of 2.5 ×10<sup>6</sup> beads was removed and resuspended in 80 μl of activation buffer (100 mM monobasic sodium phosphate; pH 6.2) by vortexing and sonication. To activate the beads for cross-linking to proteins, 10 μl of 50-mg/ml sulfo-N-hydroxysulfosuccinamide (Pierce, Rockford, IL) and 1-ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropylcarbodiimide (EDC; Pierce, Rockford, IL). The bead mixture was shaken on a rotary shaker at room temperature for 20 min and washed twice with 250 μl phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4. The beads were resuspended in the relevant antigen preparation diluted in PBS buffer and incubated by mixing on a rotator for 2 h at room temperature. Beads were washed twice with 250 μl PBS, resuspended in 250 μl of blocking buffer (1% BSA; 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS, pH 7.4; 0.05% sodium azide), and mixed on a rotator at room temperature for 30 min. After blocking, beads were resuspended in 1 ml of blocking buffer and stored at 2–8°C in dark. The optimal concentration for each antigen was determined by coupling different microbead sets with 6.25ug/ml and 25μg/ml for each HCoV antigen. Bead sets were also coated with bovine serum albumin (BSA, 100 μg/ml) as a negative control protein (Pierce, Rockford, IL) and goat anti-Human IgG (20ug/ml) as a positive control (Bethyl, TX).</p>

Two separate assays were used to evaluate the IgG and IgM response to antigens from SARS-CoVs, MERS, and common cold HCoVs. In brief, a mixture of microbead sets, one for each of the coated antigens described above, were incubated with the participants’ plasma specimens, which were diluted 1:200 in 2% Prionex (bio-WORLD, Dublin, OH) for 1 hour at room temperature in a 96-well plate. After incubation, the beads were washed twice by adding 100 μl of wash buffer (PBS-tween) per well and drained under vacuum using a vacuum manifold (Millipore Corporation, Bedford, MA). For detection of human and NHP IgG, phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-human IgG was used (Jackson ImmunoResearch, Pennsylvania) at a 1:500 dilution in PBS-tween, and incubated at room temperature for 15 min.

                <p>We also developed an in-house assay for the quantitation of CXCL-10 in human plasma samples and validated using the Luminex platform. CXCL-10 capture and detection antibodies and purified protein were purchased from R&amp;D systems, MN. Optimal parameters for quantitation were first determined, including capture and detection antibody concentrations, buffers, and matrix effects. Briefly, beads coupled to 200ug/ml capture antibody (Cat# MAB266) were incubated with plasma samples diluted 1:4 in 1% BSA/PBS for 1 hour at room temperature. A standard curve was generated using recombinant human CXCL-10 Protein (Cat# 266-IP) ranging from 10,376 pg/mL to 3 pg/mL. The beads were washed two times by adding 100 μl of PBS-tween per well and draining under vacuum. Biotinylated anti-CXCL-10 (Cat# BAF266) was used at 0.8ug/ml in 1% BSA/PBS and incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. Beads were washed two times and 50 μl of streptavidin-phycoerythrin (SA-PE) (CalTag, Burlingame, CA) was added at a dilution of 1:500 in wash buffer. The assay was incubated at room temperature for 15 min, beads were washed two times with wash buffer, resuspended in 100 μl of wash buffer per well, and analyzed in the Magpix instrument. The concentration (pg/ml) of CXCL-10 was measured based on a 7-point standard curve using xPONENT 4.3 software (Luminex, TX). The sensitivity and specificity of the in-house assay were compared to CXCL-10 multiplex kit from Biorad (Hercules, CA) and the correlation coefficient R<sup>2</sup> was 0.82. We used this in-house assay to measure the CXCL-10 concentrations in COVID-19 patients from Pakistan.</p>

All animals had visual and auditory access to other macaques 24 hours per day and were fed a balanced commercial macaque chow (Purina Mills, Gray Summit, MO) twice daily with fresh produce twice weekly, and free access to water 24 hours per day. Supplemental food was provided when clinically indicated. Environmental enrichment was provided daily, including manipulanda (forage boards, mirrors, puzzle feeders) and novel foodstuffs. Veterinarians, animal health technicians, and staff technicians conducted daily health/clinical assessments of animals. For vaccinations and blood collections, animals were anesthetized by intramuscular injection (i.m) of ketamine-HCl (Parke-Davis, Morris Plains, NJ) at 10 mg/kg of body weight. For virus inoculation and nasal secretion sample collection, animals were additionally anesthetized with 15–30 ug/kg dexmedetomidine HCl inject i.m. and anesthesia was reversed with 0.07–0.15 mg/kg atipamezole HCl injected i.m. Analgesics were given to minimize pain and discomfort at the discretion of the veterinary staff and nutritional supplements were administered, as necessary. When euthanasia was necessary, animals were humanely euthanized at the end of the study by a barbiturate overdose and necropsy procedures were performed by veterinary pathologists and support staff. Criteria for assessments of health and well-being of the animals were as follows: no signs of injury, distress or pain that cannot be alleviated by analgesics, weight loss, hypothermia, persistent anemia, chronic dehydration, lethargy, severe dyspnea, neurological deficits, coagulopathies, motor retardation etc. If an animal’s physical condition deteriorated prior to the scheduled endpoint, clinical veterinary staff would have euthanized the animal following the Guidelines for Humane Euthanasia of Animals on Projects (GHEAP) at the CNPRC. In this study, none of the macaques were euthanized for welfare reasons before completion. Animals infected with SARS-CoV-2 were euthanized at the end of the study and animals in the vaccine group were returned to their home colony since the study was not terminal.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Detection of blood-based immune biomarkers is generally practical and minimally invasive for health monitoring. We have developed a novel multiplex immunoassay to detect IgM and IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 with high sensitivity (94%) and specificity (98%) (≥10 days post-symptoms). This multiplex panel, in addition, profiles antibodies against six other coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, MERS, and four common coronaviruses). The assay can be used to complement current detection platforms for SARS-CoV-2 infection and provide information regarding several baseline serological parameters such as infection with other coronaviruses and their impact on COVID-19, course of maturation of antibody responses in infection, optimal antigen selection for vaccine development, and vaccine efficacy, including the degree of cross-reactivity with emerging strains.</p>
              <p>We compared the MFI values for antibodies against individual antigens generated by single-plex assays and multiplex assay for HCoV S protein antigen to investigate the possible change in MFI values when the antigens are multiplexed. We found no change in MFI between single-plex and multiplex assay formats.</p>

                <p>The multiplex assay was validated using samples from animal models: rabbits and nonhuman primates.

In rabbits, antisera developed against SARS-CoV S protein were found to be cross-reactive with SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD in the multiplex assay, as expected (<xref rid="pone.0254367.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>) [<xref rid="pone.0254367.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].

                <title>Human subjects</title>
                <p>Our assay was validated using well-characterized human plasma samples. None of the healthy individuals or patients suffering from respiratory diseases other than COVID-19 contained antibodies to the S-RBD of SARS-CoV-2 (p&lt;0·0001) (<xref rid="pone.0254367.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>).</p>
                <p>Limited cross-reactivity with the SARS-CoV S protein and strong cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV N protein for IgG in COVID-19 patients was observed. These results are expected because the two viruses are closely related [<xref rid="pone.0254367.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. N-protein of SARS CoV-2 and SARS-CoV share 90% amino acid identity [<xref rid="pone.0254367.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p>
                <p>Our assay differentiates between vaccinated and non-vaccinated individuals by measuring antibodies against the N protein; the current vaccines, and several in the pipeline, are all based on the S protein (in various formats). Our current multiplex assay contains N antigen of SARS-CoV with 92.5% sensitivity and 98% specificity; inclusion of N protein of SARS-CoV-2 is in progress. None of our study subjects containing antibodies against the S proteins of common HCoVs contained antibodies against N protein of SARS-CoV, demonstrating there is no cross-reactivity with common coronaviruses.</p>
                <p>SARS-CoV S-RBD and full-length S protein contain 74% and 76% amino acid identity, respectively [<xref rid="pone.0254367.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 S were cross-reactive to S protein of SARS-CoV but not MERS S-RBD. S protein of MERS shares only 34% amino acid identity with that of SARS-CoV-2 which likely explains the lack of cross-reactivity [<xref rid="pone.0254367.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p>
                <p>As expected, healthy controls contained antibodies against the 4 common coronaviruses, and similarly, so did COVID-19 patients [<xref rid="pone.0254367.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. HCoV reactive antibodies were present in a majority of adults while SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD cross-reactivity was rare (3 of 129; 2.3%). In pre-pandemic healthy controls from the USA (n = 75) and Pakistan (n = 54), low levels of IgG cross-reactive antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD were detected in two and one plasma sample, respectively. Antibodies against SARS-CoV S Protein and MERS S-RBD were detected in six healthy individuals in Pakistan. We speculate that these are not cross-reactive antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD and these healthy individuals may contain antibodies to SARS CoV and MERS. This may be because of the proximity of Pakistan to the Middle East where the MERS outbreak started [<xref rid="pone.0254367.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p>
                <p>The above results show that a majority of healthy individuals are devoid of cross-reactive antibodies to the recombinant proteins of SARS-CoVs. However, in contrast to our findings, a recent study reported antibody cross-reactivity between seasonal HCoVs and SARS-CoV-2 [<xref rid="pone.0254367.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The second study comparing pre-pandemic blood samples from the United States, Tanzania, and Zambia identified antibodies against the 4 common coronaviruses that also reacted to SARS-CoV-2 and showed the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 serological cross-reactivity was significantly higher in samples from sub-Saharan Africa compared to that in the USA [<xref rid="pone.0254367.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p>
                <p>Cross-recognition of SARS-CoV-2 by pre-existing memory helper T cells against common cold coronaviruses in individuals who had never been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 has been reported [<xref rid="pone.0254367.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Common coronaviruses such as the NL63 RBD exhibit 20% sequence identity and HKU1 harbors a 2% sequence identity with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD [<xref rid="pone.0254367.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. However, the hypothesis of cross-reactive immunity between SARS-CoV-2 and common cold HCoVs still awaits experimental trials.</p>
                <p>We measured the IgG and IgM antibodies in six COVID-19 patients where plasma samples were available at several time points over many weeks. Our results indicate that these patients seroconvert between 5 to 10 days post-symptoms. We also studied the dynamics of IgG subtype development in six patients where plasma samples were available at several time points over many weeks. We found elevated IgG3 antibodies in 5 out of 6 patients and IgG1 in 4 out of 6 patients as early as 9 to 13 days post-symptoms. Our results, although derived from a small group of subjects, are in line with previous findings by Amanat and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0254367.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In one patient IgG2 antibodies emerged after 19 days post-symptoms. None of the patients contained IgG4 antibodies which is anticipated given that this subtype develops largely in nonviral diseases [<xref rid="pone.0254367.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p>
                <p>Our assay is relatively quantitative and measures titers of SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD IgG antibodies (<xref rid="pone.0254367.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>). The results also show a strong correlation between MFI values and sample dilution series (<xref rid="pone.0254367.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>), showing either relative antibody titers or direct MFI values, can be used for antibody quantitation. This flexibility is afforded by the fact that MFI values as reported by the Luminex platform have a high dynamic range; from 0 to 20,000 MFIs. Unlike standard ELISA (limited to upper end of optical density of 2.0) a majority of samples with high levels of antibodies do not require dilution to fall within an acceptable dynamic range (<xref rid="pone.0254367.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>).</p>
                <p>Longitudinal analysis was performed to monitor the dynamics of cytokine and chemokine production in six COVID-19 patients where plasma samples were available over several time points post-symptoms. Samples were taken at the time of hospital admission (5 to 9 days post-symptoms; Time 0) and over several days/weeks. Plasma levels of CXCL-10 decreased over time compared to Time 0, (<xref rid="pone.0254367.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref>). Cytokines/chemokines are fragile molecules and their concentrations in blood stream reduce in the absence of constant production. Therefore, progressive reduction in plasma concentration overtime may reflect reduction in inflammatatory conditions, thus indicating improvement in patient health, for example, in TB [<xref rid="pone.0254367.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. On the other hand, antibodies are more stable, and their levels may continue to remain high for many weeks to months after a patient has recovered. CXCL-10, the most prominently elevated cytokine in COVID-19 patients in this study may be useful as an inflammatory marker related to COVID-19 [<xref rid="pone.0254367.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0254367.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In this report, we describe a temporal kinetic analysis of cytokines/chemokines. We speculate that the above alterations in plasma concentration of CXCL-10 are due to the treatment success in these patients indicating resolution of disease. Similar results in the progressive decline of plasma concentrations of CXCL-10 with positive patient outcome has been reported in COVID-19 by others [<xref rid="pone.0254367.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], and in TB patients by our group [<xref rid="pone.0254367.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In contrast, chemokine RANTES levels displayed an upward trend suggesting a protective role of this chemokine in disease progression. RANTES is one of the major chemokines produced by CD8+ T cells in HIV infection to suppress the virus [<xref rid="pone.0254367.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. A recent study showed that RANTES has been elevated in longitudinal samples from subjects with mild COVID-19 [<xref rid="pone.0254367.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p>
                <p>In COVID-19 patients with severe disease (intubated), as compared to those with mild to moderate disease, the median CXCL10 concentration was twice as high. However, this increase was not statistically significant. It is possible that in a larger population of patients the difference may turn out to be significant. Our studies, currently in progress, with enlarged sets of patients in different categories are designed to address this.</p>
                <p>Additionally, to facilitate specimen collection and transport our multiplex immunoassay assay works with dried blood spots collected on filter paper tested in several infectious disease models (mouse, monkey, human–unpublished data; these authors) in addition to serum and plasma. Dried blood spots from a finger prick are easily obtained and can be sent through regular mail or courier service even from remote areas to diagnostic test centers.</p>
                <p>In light of these, several questions remain to be investigated: what proportion of patients develop antibody responses, post-infection time to seroconversion, differences between patients with short and long incubation periods, and correlation between antibody responses and viral load. Our ongoing studies attempt to address the above issues. The limitations of the current study include the following: 1) only symptomatic infections were enrolled; antibody responses in asymptomatic infection remain to be determined; 2) long-term antibody responses (over several months) were not studied; 3) only a modest patient population was studied. Future studies should explore how the immunity to one coronavirus affects another coronavirus and whether the level of immunity is related to other factors such as age, gender, etc.</p>

                <p>This approach can complement the current diagnostic testing platforms that are in use and may show utility in various clinical settings as follows: 1) Antibody responses to vaccination with S protein (in various formats); 2) antibody responses to distinguish between natural infection (N antigen of SARS-CoV-2 inclusion in the multiplex assay is in progress)) and vaccination (S antibodies); 3) ability to identify response to therapy by CXCL-10 measurements; 4) disease severity etc. Further studies are required to support these findings and in light of the complexity of the immunologic profiles noted, the use of predictive analytics tools may also become of value in future studies.</p>

                  <p>The standard curve for SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD antibodies was prepared by two-fold serial dilutions of a plasma sample starting at 1:100 to 1:12,800. The MFI (median fluorescent intensity) values were plotted again the dilution and a 5-parameter logistic (5PL) regression analysis was carried out using GraphPad Prism.</p>
