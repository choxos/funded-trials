                  <p>This multisite clinical trial enrolled 258 adolescents aged 13 to 16 years with type 1 diabetes for 1 or more years, who had literacy in English, HbA<sub>1c</sub> percentage of total hemoglobin from 8.0% to 13.0%, a participating caregiver, and no other serious medical conditions. From January 5, 2014, to April 4, 2016, 258 adolescents were recruited. The post hoc analysis excluded adolescents missing outcome measures at 18 months (2 participants [0.8%]) or continuous glucose monitoring data at baseline (40 participants [15.5%]).

                  <p>Data from 216 adolescents in the FLEX trial were reanalyzed (166 [76.9%] non-Hispanic white; 108 teenaged girls [50.0%]; mean [SD] age, 14.9 [1.1] years; mean [SD] diabetes duration, 6.3 [3.7] years). For the univariate outcomes, a large proportion of FLEX participants had equivalent predicted outcomes under intervention vs usual care settings, regardless of randomization, and were assigned to the muted group (HbA<sub>1c</sub>: 105 participants [48.6%]; QoL: 63 participants [29.2%]; BMIz: 136 participants [63.0%]). Regarding the BMIz univariate outcome, mean baseline BMIz of participants assigned to the muted group was lower than that of those assigned to the intervention and control groups (muted vs intervention: mean difference, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.21 to 0.75; <italic>P</italic> = .002; muted vs control: mean difference, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.61 to 1.11; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001); this group also had a higher proportion of individuals with underweight or normal weight using weight status cutoffs (95 [69.9%] in muted group vs 24 [54.6%] in intervention group and 11 [30.6%] in control group; χ<sup>2</sup><sub>4</sub> = 24.67; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). The approach identified subgroups estimated to benefit based on HbA<sub>1c</sub> percentage (54 participants [25.0%]), QoL (89 participants [41.2%]), and BMIz (44 participants [20.4%]). Regarding the HbA<sub>1c</sub> percentage outcome, participants expected to benefit from the intervention did not have significantly higher baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> percentages than those expected to benefit from usual care (9.4% vs 9.2%; difference, 0.2%; 95% CI, −0.16% to 0.56%; <italic>P</italic> = .44). However, participants in the muted group had higher mean HbA<sub>1c</sub> percentages at baseline than those assigned to the intervention or control groups (muted vs intervention: 9.9% vs 9.4%; difference, 0.5%; 95% CI, 0.13% to 0.89%; <italic>P</italic> = .02; muted vs control; 9.9% vs 9.2%; difference, 0.7%; 95% CI, 0.34% to 1.08%; <italic>P</italic> = .001). No significant differences were found between subgroups estimated to benefit in terms of the composite outcome from the FLEX intervention (91 participants [42.1%]) vs usual care (125 participants [57.9%]).</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>The Flexible Lifestyles Empowering Change (FLEX) trial, a National Institutes of Health–funded 18-month randomized clinical trial, tested the efficacy of an adaptive behavioral intervention to promote self-management and improve measures of blood glucose control in 258 adolescents aged 13 to 16 years with type 1 diabetes. The goal of the FLEX intervention was to increase adherence to type 1 diabetes self-management through a behavioral counseling strategy that integrated motivational interviewing and problem-solving skills training.<sup><xref rid="zoi190214r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Despite high retention and fidelity, the FLEX study did not show efficacy with respect to the primary outcome of hemoglobin A<sub>1c</sub> (HbA<sub>1c</sub>) percentage 18 months after randomization.<sup><xref rid="zoi190214r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> However, the intervention was associated with improvements in several secondary psychosocial outcomes, including motivation, problem-solving skills, diabetes self-management, and health-related and general quality of life (QoL).<sup><xref rid="zoi190214r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Within any randomized clinical trial, the average treatment effect across all participants may mask important heterogeneous treatment effects that exist among different study participants or subgroups of participants.<sup><xref rid="zoi190214r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Therefore, in the setting of significant heterogeneity in response, aggregate reporting of average treatment can also obfuscate whether some strategies helped some participants while harming others.<sup><xref rid="zoi190214r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190214r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> For this reason, statistical analyses that estimate aggregate effects over time for all participants are limited because they do not account for the fact that treatment responders and nonresponders can exhibit vastly divergent patterns of response.<sup><xref rid="zoi190214r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Analysts who wish to account for treatment effect heterogeneity have several available tools. Analysis of differential response observed in a completed trial may take the form of an effect modification analysis, in which the observed effect of an intervention is examined across levels of a third, prespecified effect modifier variable. For example, effect modification analyses of the FLEX trial showed that the intervention effect was stronger among participants with high vs low baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> percentages at 12 months (effect, 0.69%; 95% CI, 0.07%-1.31%; <italic>P</italic> for interaction = 0.03) and for female vs male participants at the 18 months (difference, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.03-1.21; <italic>P</italic> for interaction = 0.04).<sup><xref rid="zoi190214r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p>
              <p>In settings where more complex heterogeneity in participant profiles reliably predicts differential response to the efficacy of treatment, the precision medicine approach offers particular promise and addresses certain limitations of traditional effect modification.<sup><xref rid="zoi190214r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> The precision medicine approach seeks to develop an individualized treatment rule (ITR), a mathematical function that gives recommendations for whether a participant should receive intervention or not. In the FLEX trial, treatment conditions (intervention vs usual care) were assigned at baseline, so an ITR could base its recommendations solely on participant characteristics available at baseline. As the goal of the FLEX trial was to optimize a participant’s improvement over the full 18-month course of the study, the ITR was estimated based on those 18-month improvements in outcome, also called <italic>clinical rewards</italic>. Once an ITR is estimated, it can be used to target intervention to those participants whom it estimates will benefit most. An ITR can be summarized based on its value, which is the average expected clinical reward that results from applying the ITR. That is, the value of an ITR represents the average clinical reward the participant cohort would have received if that ITR were followed rather than the observed randomization scheme. Individualized treatment rules that deliver the best achievable clinical reward are termed <italic>optimal</italic>. Estimating and applying optimal ITRs may lead to increases in efficiency of prevention and treatment while simultaneously reducing costs of care.<sup><xref rid="zoi190214r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190214r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> As such, gaining a deeper understanding of the subgroups defined by an optimal ITR—ie, understanding which participants receive improved outcomes under an intervention and which do not—is critical to inform future tailoring of interventions.</p>
              <p>In this study, we describe a method for the post hoc analysis of randomized clinical trials that leverages the full data set to identify subgroups defined by an estimated optimal ITR. We demonstrate how this method may be applied to data from the FLEX trial to quantify and describe the subgroups where key clinical outcomes were improved with the intervention, the subgroups where outcomes were improved with usual care, and the subgroups where outcomes were the same between intervention and usual care. To be consistent with the primary and secondary outcomes of the parent study, we characterized the effect of the FLEX intervention in terms of 18-month changes in HbA<sub>1c</sub> percentage (primary outcome) as well as perceived QoL and body mass index <italic>z</italic> score (BMIz), a significant cardiovascular disease risk factor. We focused on baseline predictors, including sociodemographic characteristics, clinical variables, or psychosocial and behavioral measures, as these can serve as markers to clinicians in the future to guide optimal treatment recommendations regarding the FLEX intervention using the data available at that time.</p>

                <p>We analyzed data from the baseline visit of the FLEX trial. This randomized clinical trial tested an adaptive, 18-month intervention that included interventions to improve behavioral skills and problem solving for adolescents with type 1 diabetes, with respect to HbA<sub>1c</sub> percentage of total hemoglobin (primary outcome), glycemic variability, cardiovascular disease risk factors, health-related QOL, and cost-effectiveness.<sup><xref rid="zoi190214r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190214r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Eligible participants were adolescents aged 13 to 16 years with type 1 diabetes for 1 or more years with literacy in English, HbA<sub>1c</sub> percentage of total hemoglobin of 8.0% to 13.0% (to convert to proportion of total hemoglobin, multiply by 0.01), at least 1 primary caregiver available to participate, and no other serious medical conditions or pregnancy.<sup><xref rid="zoi190214r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Those randomized to the control arm received usual diabetes care. All participants were mailed a health summary, a brief report of key clinical measures, including body mass index, laboratory values (HbA<sub>1c</sub> and lipid levels), blood pressure, and select behavioral self-reported results, such as physical activity/inactivity, dietary intake, self-monitoring of blood glucose, and missed insulin. The full trial protocol is available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-ZOI190214-1-s">Supplement 1</xref>.

The FLEX study was reviewed by institutional review boards at all participating institutions. All participants and their caregivers provided informed written assent and consent, respectively. Detailed considerations of the FLEX design and baseline participant characteristics have been described elsewhere.<sup><xref rid="zoi190214r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> As a randomized clinical trial, all reporting was standardized to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/consort/">CONSORT</ext-link>) reporting guideline.

For each univariate outcome, we considered changes from baseline to the 18-month visit. For HbA<sub>1c</sub> percentage and QoL, this change was directly equal to the difference between baseline and 18-month outcomes.

                <p>To assess the intervention’s effect on all outcomes of interest simultaneously, we considered a composite outcome of change in HbA<sub>1c </sub>percentage, QoL score, and BMIz between baseline and 18-month study visits. The composite outcome approximates constrained optimization based on a hierarchy of the univariate outcomes, with HbA<sub>1c</sub> percentage prioritized the highest and BMIz prioritized the lowest. In essence, participants with elevated HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels would receive a low composite outcome regardless of their QoL score and BMIz; participants with acceptable HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels but unacceptably low QoL scores would receive slightly higher composite outcomes regardless of their BMIz; and participants would receive the highest composite outcomes if they had acceptable HbA<sub>1c</sub> and QoL levels, with the magnitude determined by their BMIz. Sensitivity analyses explored different hierarchies of the composite outcome; the final definition was selected based on consensus from the FLEX study team to be most consistent with the goals of the FLEX intervention (data not shown). For a full discussion of the composite outcome’s definition and properties, see eAppendix 1, eAppendix 2, eAppendix 4, eTable 1-6, and eFigures 1-3 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-ZOI190214-1-s">Supplement 2</xref>.</p>

                  <p>We estimated the optimal ITR in our sample with reinforcement learning trees (RLT). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="zoi190214f2">Figure 2</xref> visualizes a conceptual overview of our use of ITR estimation to determine subgroups. An extension of the random forest model, RLT uses reinforcement learning to better discriminate between signal and noise variables among the covariates.<sup><xref rid="zoi190214r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190214r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> According to convention and to ensure numerical stability, continuous covariates were transformed to have a mean of 0 and an SD of 1 before analysis, and outcomes were transformed to range from 0 to 1 (univariate outcomes) or 0 to 3 (composite outcome), with higher values indicating better clinical outcomes. A noteworthy aspect of RLT is its numerical tendency to mute covariates, ie, to set their effect to 0, in subsets of the covariate space. The details of how and why muting occurs are best left for the technical discussion in the article by Zhu et al<sup><xref rid="zoi190214r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>; for this analysis, we simply note that the predicted outcome under the different values of a binary variable, such as intervention status, can be different for some patients but equal for others, representing either a lack of sufficient information to distinguish between levels of the binary variable or a differential effect of this binary variable that is small and difficult to distinguish from 0. Using RLT allowed us to pose a nonparametric model between the baseline covariates, <italic>X</italic>, and the observed clinical rewards, <italic>R</italic>, within each imputed data set. Using this model, we estimated the expected clinical reward for a given participant under both intervention and usual care. The ITR specific to the data set assigned a patient to 1 of 3 groups: (1) the intervention group, (2) the control group, or (3) the muted group. If the expected clinical reward was higher in the intervention group, then intervention was expected to benefit that participant and they were assigned to the intervention group. If the expected clinical reward was higher in the usual care group, then usual care was expected to benefit that participant and they were assigned to the control group. Finally, if the expected clinical reward did not differ between the intervention and usual care groups, then intervention status was not expected to have any large effect for that participant and they were assigned to the muted group. For each participant, we obtained 11 assignments, 1 assignment per imputed data set. The estimated optimal ITR assigned each patient to the group designated by a plurality vote of these 11 assignments. Once the groups were defined by the ITR, we examined their baseline demographic, clinical, and psychological and social characteristics.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>In this article, we presented a method to identify subgroups of participants in a randomized clinical trial for whom the intervention would have been beneficial, for whom usual care would have been beneficial, and for whom neither option would have made a difference regarding key clinical outcomes. We then applied this method to reanalyze data from the FLEX trial, which initially showed no effects of the intervention on the primary and secondary study outcomes, to demonstrate that there are distinct subgroups with different optimal treatment assignments. The discussion focuses first on the findings from the post hoc analysis of the FLEX trial and then turns to a more general discussion of the method itself.</p>
              <p>The application of a method to find distinct subgroups (intervention, control, and muted) within a single randomized clinical trial sample is appropriate given previous reports of heterogeneity in response to behavioral interventions,<sup><xref rid="zoi190214r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> including heterogeneity of response to the same intervention in different samples of adolescents with type 1 diabetes.<sup><xref rid="zoi190214r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190214r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> The relative proportions of these subgroups, especially regarding the large muted group for HbA<sub>1c</sub> percentage as a univariate outcome, highlight the challenges of glycemic control in this age range.<sup><xref rid="zoi190214r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> By contrast, a larger group was estimated to benefit from the FLEX intervention regarding QoL, which agrees with the main trial’s findings that the FLEX intervention had a positive aggregate effect on multiple measures of psychosocial well-being.<sup><xref rid="zoi190214r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> The large proportion of participants assigned to the muted group for the univariate BMIz outcome likely reflects both the relatively short time period of follow-up (18 months) as well as the challenges of using BMIz to evaluate change in adiposity.<sup><xref rid="zoi190214r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup></p>
              <p>The results also reveal interesting dynamics in the interplay among the 3 univariate outcomes. Clinical markers that link interventions to subgroups of participants that are likely to benefit take a central role in precision application of interventions;<sup><xref rid="zoi190214r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> as such, it would be ideal to have a large variety of markers corresponding to differential estimated response patterns.<sup><xref rid="zoi190214r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190214r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Although we considered a range of participant characteristics, only a limited subset of characteristics emerged to distinguish the ITR-assigned subgroups in the FLEX study. Furthermore, the markers were not consistent across the 3 univariate outcomes, in which no markers emerged that were consistent across different outcomes.</p>
              <p>A finding of interest was the lack of baseline features to distinguish groups based on estimated response patterns. We believe the antagonistic associations among the univariate outcomes may contribute to the paucity of reliable factors for the subgroups governed by the composite outcome, even among covariates that helped predict subgroups for subgroups governed by univariate outcomes. This finding speaks to the importance of using and optimizing a composite outcome according to the study of interest and research question. Using a composite outcome may help avoid logical inconsistencies that occur from considering univariate outcomes in isolation, as it has here. In this analysis, the composite outcome was designed to reflect the primary and secondary goals of the trial, but additional analyses could explore other outcomes, such as improvement in glycemic control constrained by the incidence of hypoglycemia, which represents a major, potentially life-threatening adverse effect of insulin intensification.</p>
              <p>The results suggest that RLT estimated an optimal ITR that performed well for the FLEX data. As <xref rid="zoi190214t2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> shows, the estimated optimal ITR achieved a high <italic>V̂</italic> for each outcome. For each outcome, the estimated optimal ITR nominally outperformed the 2 fixed treatment effects. All bootstrapped 95% CIs corresponding to these fixed treatment comparisons except 1 were greater than 0, suggesting that the estimated ITRs outperformed the fixed treatment regimes. The size of the differences in <xref rid="zoi190214t2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> suggests the treatment effect in this trial is generally small, although this table may slightly overstate the situation owing to the scaling of outcomes.</p>
              <p>While we chose RLT to estimate the optimal ITR for the FLEX data because of its performance, an additional philosophical advantage of using RLT is its specification of a muted group. Conceptually, this group represents a phenomenon that is distinct from the other 2 assignments; the muted group can be thought to contain true nonresponders because they do not show a response to the intervention or control conditions (which in this case was usual care). Alternatively, this group may represent adolescents for whom the estimated response was significant but equivalent under intervention and control conditions. In this study, the large size of the muted group for each univariate outcome is likely a reflection of a marginal treatment effect, combined with noise in the data. It is interesting that the muted group showed significant differences from the other 2 groups, particularly with the HbA<sub>1c</sub> percentage univariate outcome, where this subgroup comprised participants with the highest mean HbA<sub>1c</sub> level and incidence of hypoglycemia and could be interpreted as the patients at the highest risk with the poorest glycemia at baseline, defined by both high and low blood glucose excursions. These characteristics suggest that adolescents for whom diabetes management is particularly challenging or outcomes are particularly poor may require more intensive interventions than the FLEX intervention. More work is needed to understand the subgroup of adolescents with type 1 diabetes who fall into this category, as they represent the population who may be the most difficult to reach via intervention work and may be at the highest risk of long-term complications of the disease.</p>
              <p>Despite the nonparametric nature of the ITR estimation, the ITR-assigned subgroups are generally consistent with findings from effect modification analyses of the FLEX trial showing that baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> percentage and sex were markers of differential response to the intervention. However, the existence of the muted group, in addition to other differences in methodology, such as exclusion criteria not shared between the present analysis and the effect modification analysis, obscures direct comparisons. Moreover, this analysis is conceptually and analytically distinct from standard subgroup analysis methods, representing a novel approach to subgroup determination with several main differences. First, the proposed method is more directly prescriptive than traditional methods—subgroups are based on a participant’s assignment according to an ITR built to maximize the overall average clinical reward in the entire participant sample. Second, the proposed method places very few restrictions compared with many traditional methods. Common ITR estimation methods, including our choice of RLT, are free of distributional assumptions, giving the proposed approach a level of robustness to model misspecifications. There are several related advantages to this method for post hoc analysis of randomized clinical trial data. As the response subgroups are not prespecified based on a hypothesized mechanism of disease, they may represent previously uncharacterized subgroups that are nevertheless relevant to the optimal delivery of intervention. Moreover, the data-driven nature of this method may help remove researcher degrees of freedom that can hinder reproducibility.<sup><xref rid="zoi190214r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190214r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Third, estimating an optimal ITR pools information from the entire study sample, not just the arm randomized to intervention. Additionally, the use of RLT allows us to model the intervention effect with a remarkably small number of assumptions, and the ability of RLT to handle high dimensionality allows us to consider a broad range of participant characteristics as suitable clinical markers, including aspects of clinical care, sociodemographic characteristics, and behavioral measures at baseline that may reinforce or challenge the efficacy of a given therapy over time.<sup><xref rid="zoi190214r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190214r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Finally, a salient advantage of the ITR-based approach is its ability to translate directly to clinical implementation. Consider an ITR that is estimated in a diverse and representative patient population and externally validated in a similarly diverse and representative patient population. Once estimated, the ITR can be applied as follows: a medical professional gathers a patient’s demographic, clinical, and psychosocial covariates at the time of treatment decision, enters them into a computer program that stores the ITR decision rule, and then receives a group assignment of intervention, control, or muted. In the former 2 cases, the ITR gives a clear recommendation; in the latter case, the 2 are estimated to be equivalent in value based on the outcomes used to estimate the ITR, suggesting that other factors that were not represented in the ITR, such as cost, might be considered. Additionally, assignment to the muted group may signal that a patient belongs to a group for which the standard intervention options may not be particularly effective, flagging these patients as key candidates for future studies exploring novel intervention options.</p>

                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p>This study had limitations. A significant limitation is the lack of data available for external validation purposes. We suggest that the present analysis offers proof of principle for the feasibility and application of the analytic method, and future studies are warranted in larger trials with greater intervention effects. In addition, the limitations of this analysis include the small sample size and high degree of noise in the data, especially compared with the small effect size of the intervention. Future work may explore the application of ITR-based subgroups to other trial data of different sample sizes with a range of intervention effect magnitudes.</p>

              <p>The results of this post hoc analysis of the FLEX trial are important groundwork to expand the available tools for matching participants and subgroups of participants to existing and newly studied interventions. There remains a lack of consensus about the best approach to promote adherence and improve glycemic control among adolescents with type 1 diabetes. The precision delivery of interventions, based on a diverse breadth of data, as modeled in this study, offers a promising approach.</p>
