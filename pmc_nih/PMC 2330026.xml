                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Cognate immunity against neoplastic cells depends on a balance between effector T cells and regulatory T (Treg) cells. Treg cells prevent immune attack against normal and neoplastic cells by directly suppressing the activation of effector CD4<sup>+ </sup>and CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells. We postulated that a recombinant interleukin 2/diphtheria toxin conjugate (DAB/IL2; Denileukin Diftitox; Ontak) may serve as a useful strategy to deplete Treg cells and break tolerance against neoplastic tumors in humans.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>We administered DAB/IL2 (12 Î¼g/kg; four daily doses; 21 day cycles) to 16 patients with metastatic melanoma and measured the effects on the peripheral blood concentration of several T cell subsets and on tumor burden.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>We found that DAB/IL2 caused a transient depletion of Treg cells as well as total CD4<sup>+ </sup>and CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells (&lt; 21 days). T cell repopulation coincided with the <italic>de novo </italic>appearance of melanoma antigen-specific CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells in several patients as determined by flow cytometry using tetrameric MART-1, tyrosinase and gp100 peptide/MHC conjugates. Sixteen patients received at least one cycle of DAB/IL2 and five of these patients experienced regressions of melanoma metastases as measured by CT and/or PET imaging. One patient experienced a near complete response with the regression of several hepatic and pulmonary metastases coupled to the <italic>de novo </italic>appearance of MART-1-specific CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells. A single metastatic tumor remained in this patient and, after surgical resection, immunohistochemical analysis revealed MART1<sup>+ </sup>melanoma cells surrounded by CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells.</p>

                  <p>Taken together, these data indicate that transient depletion of T cells in cancer patients may disrupt the homeostatic control of cognate immunity and allow for the expansion of effector T cells with specificity against neoplastic cells. Several T cell depleting agents are clinically available and this study provides strong rationale for an examination of their efficacy in cancer patients.</p>

            <sec>
              <title>Background</title>
              <p>Of the common adult-onset cancers, melanoma is widely held to be the most amenable to immunotherapeutic intervention. This perception is based on the following: (i) several melanoma-specific antigens have been identified; (ii) melanoma antigen-specific CD4<sup>+ </sup>and CD8<sup>+ </sup>T lymphocytes are increased in melanoma patients and have anti-tumor activity; (iii) immune-enhancing agents can cure mice of established melanomas; and (iv) spontaneous melanoma regressions in humans with the simultaneous onset of vitiligo have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Additionally, the immune-enhancing agent, interferon-Î±, increases survival in melanoma patients with intermediate or high risk of recurrence, and high-dose interleukin 2 (IL-2), a potent stimulator of T cell proliferation, causes durable remissions in a small subset of patients with metastatic melanoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p>
              <p>Cognate immune reactions against tumor cells depend on a balance between activated tumor antigen specific CD4<sup>+ </sup>and CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells and suppressive regulatory T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>HI </sup>regulatory T (Treg) cells directly suppress the activation of anti-tumor effector T cells in a contact-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Depletion of these immunosuppressive Treg cells using anti-CD25 monoclonal antibodies enables a CD8<sup>+ </sup>and CD4<sup>+ </sup>T cell dependent immune rejection against the progression of melanoma in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. This anti-tumor activity is not exclusive to melanoma since it has been observed against several transplantable mouse tumor cell lines in multiple disparate mouse strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Furthermore, down-regulation of Treg cell function can be accomplished with certain stimulatory antibodies (<italic>e.g</italic>. anti-GITR [DTA-1]) and this treatment confers concomitant tumor immunity against remote tumors even in poorly immunogenic mouse melanomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Treg cells thus may function to tolerize or deactivate cognate effector CD4<sup>+ </sup>and CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells to neoplastic cells that express tumorigenic antigens. Accordingly, the selective depletion of these cells may have clinical utility for the induction of anti-tumor immunity.</p>
              <p>A multitude of successful treatment strategies in tumor-bearing mice have failed when examined in human clinical trials, and correlative data that provide additional rationale for clinical trials in humans is essential. Viguier <italic>et al</italic>. reported the results of an immunohistochemical examination for the presence of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>HI </sup>Treg cells in lymph nodes with and without metastasic melanoma seeds extracted from twelve patients with metastatic melanoma (Stage IIIb/IIIc) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. They observed that the frequency of Treg cells in melanoma-positive lymph nodes was 11.06% whereas the frequency was only 6.2% in melanoma-free lymph nodes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The over-representation of Treg cells in metastatic lymph nodes suggests that these cells may be recruited and/or expanded at the tumor site. Treg cells isolated from the metastatic lymph nodes were found to inhibit CD4<sup>+ </sup>and CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cell proliferation <italic>in vitro </italic>via a contact-dependent mechanism and thus appear to function similarly to the well characterized mouse Treg cells. Taken together, these data provide correlative evidence that CD25<sup>+ </sup>Treg cells may be functioning to suppress anti-tumor immunity in melanoma patients.</p>
              <p>Denileukin diftitox (DAB/IL2; Ontak) is a recombinant DNA-derived cytotoxic protein composed of diphtheria toxin fragments A and B and the full-length IL-2 molecule. DAB/IL2 binds to CD25 (the Î± chain of the IL-2 receptor) and, following internalization, inhibits protein synthesis, causing cell death within hours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. DAB/IL2 is FDA-approved for the treatment of patients with persistent or recurrent cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL) whose malignant cells express CD25. CTCL malignant proliferation is driven by interaction with cutaneous dendritic cells (termed Langerhans cells), and this epidermal association of CTCL cells with Langerhans cells is a hallmark of the malignancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In recent studies, purified human CTCL cells were incubated with dendritic cells and found to adopt a Treg phenotype, including: (i) expression of the negative T cell regulator, cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4); (ii) expression of the Treg specific transcription factor, Foxp3; and (iii) the ability to suppress CD4<sup>+ </sup>T cell activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Based on these findings, CTCL has been postulated to be a malignant proliferation of Treg cells and, coupled to the observation that Treg cells express high surface CD25, these data provide rationale for the testing of DAB/IL2 as a selective Treg-depleting agent.</p>
              <p>In the current study, we have found that DAB/IL2 administration to stage IV melanoma patients depletes peripheral blood Treg cells and causes the regression of metastatic tumors in a subset of patients. We also observed a significant depletion of the total T cell population including CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>- </sup>T cells that was reversed within 21 days of DAB/IL2 administration. We speculate that transient depletion of T cells in cancer patients may disrupt the homeostatic control of cognate immunity and allow an expansion of CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells with increased specificity for the peptide/MHC complexes expressed by neoplastic cells.</p>

                <title>DAB/IL2 enzyme linked immunosorbent assay</title>
                <p>Human plasma samples were tested for the presence of IgG specific for DAB/IL2 by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The assay was carried out as follows: 96-well microtest polystyrene assay plates (BD) were coated (100 Î¼L/well) with either Tris-NaCl pH 8.5 solution (30 mL 5 M NaCl + 50 mL 1 M Tris + 920 mL water) or DAB/IL2 (Ligand) diluted to 2 Î¼g/mL in Tris-NaCl solution. After incubating overnight at 37Â°C, the plates were washed two times with Tris-NaCl solution. 300 Î¼l PBS/BSA (30 mL PBS + 300 mg BSA; Sigma) was then added to each well and the plates were incubated for one hour at 37Â°C, followed by three washes with Tris-NaCl solution. 100 Î¼l of test sera, diluted 1:500 in PBS/BSA solution, was then added to each well. After incubating at 37Â°C for two hours, the plates were washed three times with Tris-NaCl + 0.05% Tween (300 mL Tris-NaCl + 150 Î¼l Tween). 100 Î¼l of rabbit anti-human IgG HRP-conjugated antibody (Pierce), diluted 1:50,000 in PBS/BSA, was then added to each well and the plates incubated at 37Â°C for one hour, followed by three washes with Tris-NaCl + 0.05% Tween and two washes with DH<sub>2</sub>O. 100 Î¼l of TMB substrate (Pierce) was added to each well. After five minutes, the reaction was stopped with 1N HCL (100 Î¼l/well) and the plates were read at 450 nm.</p>

                <p>Five Î¼m sections of formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tumor tissue were mounted on charged glass slides and dried at 58Â°C for 60 minutes. Slides were first deparaffinized with xylene then incubated with a high temperature epitope retrieval solution (20 min) and hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) (for 10 min) to block endogenous peroxidases. The sections were incubated with primary antibody (anti-CD8, 1:50, Dako; anti-CD4, 1:50, Novocastra; anti-HLA Class I [HLA-A, B, C], 1:500, clone EMR8-5, MBL International) for 15 min, followed by a post-primary antibody and a polymer horse-radish-peroxidase linked detection system (each for 8 min, Define, Leica Microsystems). The sections were developed with 3,3'-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB) solution (Invitrogen) for 10 min and nuclei counterstained with hematoxylin (Dako) for 7 min. PBS washes were performed between all steps. The slides were neutralized in ammonia water, dehydrated in graded alcohols (100%, 95%, and 80% ethanol [vol/vol] in H<sub>2</sub>O), cleared in xylene and coverslips attached with Permount (Fisher Scientific).</p>
                <p>For MART-1 staining, slides were deparaffinized (with xylene), hydrated with distilled water and then placed in citrate buffer (Dako) in a 72Â°C oven overnight for antigen retrieval. Following treatment with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, slides were incubated in MART-1 primary antibody (1:40, Signet) for 25 min then in LSAB2 biotinylated link antibody (Dako) for 20 min followed by a streptavidin-peroxidase reaction using DAB as a chromogen. Slides were finally counterstained in hematoxylin and then neutralized, dehydrated and coverslips attached as above. Double staining was accomplished by first staining for CD8 (as above) using DAB as the chromogen followed by washing and staining for MART-1 using the alkaline phosphatase system (Leica) omitting the deparaffinization and retrieval steps. Brown staining from the DAB indicated CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells and red staining from the alkaline phosphatase indicated MART1<sup>+ </sup>cells. Both positive and negative controls were stained with the specimens.</p>

                <p>We administered DAB/IL2 (12 Î¼g/kg daily Ã four days) to stage IV melanoma patients and measured the peripheral blood concentration of lymphocytes, granulocytes and monocytes on days 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 and 21 using an automated hematology analyzer (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>; n = 10). We observed a reduction in the absolute lymphocyte concentration and an increase in granulocytes and monocytes within 48 hours of DAB/IL2 administration. Next, the absolute concentration of several T cell subsets was quantified by multiplying the percentage of fluorescence-positive cells within the lymphocyte forward/side scatter gate determined using flow cytometric analyses by the absolute lymphocyte concentration determined using an automated hematology analyzer. We quantified the absolute CD4<sup>+ </sup>and CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cell concentration in the peripheral blood and found that both T cell subsets were reduced to ~ 50% of control within 24â48 hours of DAB/IL2 administration (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>; n = 10). We co-stained for CD4, CD25 and Foxp3 expression and found that DAB/IL2 depleted the CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>HI</sup>Foxp3<sup>+ </sup>cell percentage in the lymphocyte gate within 72 hours but that these CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>HI</sup>Foxp3<sup>+ </sup>cells repopulated the peripheral blood within 21 days (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> for a representative example; CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>HI </sup>cells [left panels] were gated and examined for Foxp3 expression [right panels]). Co-staining for CD4, CD25 and Foxp3 allowed us to gate on several distinct T cell populations and calculate peripheral blood concentrations (based on the absolute lymphocyte concentrations) in order to identify the T cell phenotypes that are most sensitive to DAB/IL2 administration. We were surprised that the peripheral blood CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>- </sup>T cell concentration was depleted by DAB/IL2 albeit to a lesser extent than CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+ </sup>and CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>HI </sup>T cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>; n = 10; <italic>p </italic>value &lt; 0.05 for each comparison). Given that the targeting mechanism of DAB/IL2 is through CD25, we can only speculate that the depletion of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>- </sup>cells is due to unidentified indirect consequences of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+ </sup>T cell depletion. Interestingly, Foxp3 expression did not significantly alter sensitivity to DAB/IL2 since the depletion of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>HI</sup>Foxp3<sup>+ </sup>and CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>HI</sup>Foxp3<sup>- </sup>was not statistically different (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>; <italic>p </italic>value = 0.424).</p>

These data support the hypothesis that transient depletion of T cells in melanoma patients may disrupt the homeostatic control of cognate immunity and allow for the expansion of effector T cells with specificity against melanoma cells.</p>

Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> details the characteristics of the patients and the observed responses as per RECIST criteria. We observed reductions in tumor burden in five patients and stabilization of disease in one patient. Patient P3 had developed rapidly progressing subcutaneous, hepatic and mesenteric metastases but after 4 cycles of DAB/IL2, experienced regression of 7 tumors as measured by PET/CT imaging (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>). Interestingly, the two largest metastases at baseline grew during treatment. Patient P5 experienced regression of two large melanoma metastases, a right hilar and a right colonic mass (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>). Patient P8 had several palpable subcutaneous and intramuscular metastases in her right lower extremity decrease in volume by physical exam after the first cycle of DAB/IL2. She completed four cycles of DAB/IL2, and CT imaging confirmed a decrease in the size of all metastases (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A</xref>). Patient P9 developed swelling in his right inguinal basin and CT imaging confirmed the development of a large right inguinal mass over a 3 month interval. He experienced decreased swelling after two cycles which was confirmed by CT imaging after a total of four cycles of DAB/IL2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8B</xref>). This mass did not change in size for the next 3 months and, after its surgical resection, the patient had no further evidence of disease. The oldest patient enrolled (79 years old; patient P12), developed two right hilar metastases which became less prominent by PET imaging after two cycles of DAB/IL2 (designated Stable Disease; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>).</p>

                <p>Patient P14 developed widespread melanoma involving the lungs, liver, subcutaneous compartment and adrenal glands over a six month period (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>). Clinically, he was suffering from appetite and weight loss, fatigue, nausea and shortness of breath. After four cycles of DAB/IL2, PET/CT imaging revealed the complete regression of all hepatic metastases and the majority of pulmonary metastases (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>). Follow-up PET/CT imaging three months after completion of the fourth cycle of DAB/IL2 demonstrated resolution of the residual pulmonary metastases but a persistently enlarged peri-aortic lymph node. Surgical resection of this residual metastasis was conducted and H&amp;E staining revealed a mononuclear infiltrate within a metastatic melanoma. Double immunohistochemistry for the melanoma protein MART1 and CD8 demonstrated that the melanoma cells (red staining) were surrounded by infiltrating CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells (brown staining; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11A</xref>) but not CD4<sup>+ </sup>T cells (<italic>data not shown</italic>). These remaining melanoma cells were completely devoid of HLA-A, B or C expression as determined using a monoclonal antibody specific for a non-polymorphic portion of these HLA molecules (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11B</xref>; compare positive controls, pancreas and unrelated melanoma, to P14 residual metastasis). Coincident with this objective response, the patient reported decreased pigmentation in his hair and skin consistent with the development of vitiligo, an autoimmune disease against melanocytes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11C</xref>).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Melanoma incidence has risen by 25â31% over the last decade and is now the 5<sup>th </sup>most common cancer in men and the 6<sup>th </sup>most common cancer in women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Melanoma causes a disproportionate mortality in young and middle-aged individuals and, as such, displays one of the highest "loss of potential life" rates among the adult-onset cancers (18.6 years per melanoma-related death) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In the United States, over 8000 adults die of melanoma annually, and 84% of melanoma patients with distant metastases succumb to their disease within 5 years of diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p>
              <p>The treatment options for patients with metastatic melanoma are limited to palliation or to aggressive therapy with high dose IL-2 or biochemotherapy using cisplatin, vinblastine, dacarbazine, IL-2 and interferon Î±-2b. The response rate to high dose IL-2 is low (16%) but durable cures have been observed in approximately 6â10% of the patients that can tolerate the systemic toxicity (<italic>i.e</italic>. hypotension, capillary leak syndrome, sepsis and renal failure) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Although biochemotherapy has been reported to yield a 35â50% partial response rate and up to a 20% complete response rate, median survival duration is only 12.2 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Early published reports of clinical trials of humanized anti-CTLA4 monoclonal antibodies have indicated a 10â20% partial response rate in melanoma patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In the current study, we observed a 31% partial response rate after treatment with DAB/IL2 (5/16 patients) which is clinically significant given the low toxicity of this agent. Importantly, the majority of patients who are treated with high dose IL-2, biochemotherapy and/or anti-CTLA4 ultimately experience progression and few efficacious alternative treatments are currently available.</p>
              <p>We found that transient depletion of CD4<sup>+ </sup>and CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells in melanoma patients via targeting of IL-2 receptor-expressing cells resulted in T cell repopulation in the peripheral blood and the <italic>de novo </italic>appearance of CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells with specificity for melanoma antigens (in 4/7 HLA-A2*0201 patients). We had anticipated that the detection of peripheral blood MART1-, gp100- and tyrosinase-specific CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells in these HLA-A2*0201<sup>+ </sup>patients might correlate with tumor regressions. The three HLA-A2*0201<sup>+ </sup>patients who did not develop any detectable MART1-, gp100- and tyrosinase-specific CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells also did not experience regression of their melanoma metastases (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). However, we observed the regression of melanoma metastases in only 2/4 HLA-A2*0201<sup>+ </sup>patients who developed melanoma antigen-specific CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). We can only speculate that the two patients who developed melanoma antigen-specific CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells but did not experience tumor regressions may have melanomas that express low class I MHC or effector CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells that are compromised by low affinity T cell receptors and/or the tumor microenvironment. Importantly, the peptide/MHC tetramers used in this study can only detect a miniscule fraction of the possible CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells that have specificity for MART1, gp100, tyrosinase or other melanoma antigens.</p>
              <p>Intriguingly, patients P3 and P14 experienced the regression of multiple metastastic melanomas simultaneously with the persistence and even growth of other metastatic melanomas (<italic>i.e</italic>. a mixed response). The residual peri-aortic mass in patient P14 was confirmed to express the melanoma antigen, MART1, and this patient developed peripheral blood MART1-specific CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells within 21 days of transient T cell depletion. Despite immunohistochemical evidence that CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells appeared to surround the MART1<sup>+ </sup>melanoma cells, this residual metastatic melanoma was not cleared. Interestingly, the melanoma cells did not express the class I MHC proteins HLA-A, B or C which may partly explain the lack of regression of this particular metastasis. We suspect that differences in melanoma antigen expression and/or additional tumor immunoevasion tactics also may explain such differential anti-tumor effects within a single host and future studies will be directed at further examination of the phenotypes of melanoma cells and infiltrating immune cells in growing and regressing melanomas within a single host.</p>
              <p>DAB/IL2 administration transiently decreased CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>-</sup>, CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>, CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>HI</sup>Foxp3<sup>-</sup>, CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>HI</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup>, CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells and, in certain patients, melanoma antigen-specific CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells. These data suggest that DAB/IL2 is not selectively cytotoxic to T regulatory cells which may be due, in part, to the high IL-2 receptor expression of activated effector T cells. We found that all examined T cell subsets repopulated the peripheral blood and presume that this repopulation is due either to a proliferative expansion or re-trafficking of T cells from lymph nodes. Interestingly, CD4<sup>+ </sup>or CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cell depletion in mice has been found to cause a proliferative expansion of the residual T cells that restores the original T cell pool size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. This peripheral expansion has been termed homeostatic proliferation and can prevent the induction of tolerance to transplanted organs and cause anti-tumor responses against melanomas and colon cancer in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Although the mechanisms for these effects are not well established, homeostatic proliferation of CD4<sup>+ </sup>and CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells is, in part, driven by MHC/peptide recognition. We postulate that transient T cell depletion in cancer patients may cause a rebound expansion of T cells with a shifted TCR repertoire that includes increased melanoma antigen-specific CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells. On-going studies that examine the relative effects of Treg depletion and transient total T cell depletion on melanomas in mice and the consequences of adding back Treg cells or total lymphocytes on these effects should improve our understanding of the precise mechanisms for the observed tumor regressions in melanoma patients.</p>
              <p>The effect of DAB/IL2 on both peripheral blood Treg cell concentration and tumor burden has been previously examined in 4 patients with metastatic breast, lung or ovarian cancer (single infusion; 9 Î¼g/kg or 12 Î¼g/kg) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Prior to infusion, the mean Treg cells/mm<sup>3 </sup>was found to be 126 (26.8% of total CD4+ Tcells) and, after DAB/IL2 infusion, the mean Treg cells/mm<sup>3 </sup>was reduced to 78 (19.0% of total CD4+ Tcells) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. A patient with Stage IIIC, relapsed ovarian cancer received the highest dose of DAB/IL2 (12 Î¼g/kg) and experienced a marked reduction in the ovarian cancer marker, CA-125, four weeks after a single infusion (from 121 U/ml to 38 U/ml) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. This patient was then administered 6 additional doses of DAB/IL2 weekly (12 Î¼g/kg) and, two months after the final dose, a PET/CT fusion scan revealed a dramatic reduction in metastatic burden. In a second study, twelve stage IV melanoma patients were administered DAB/IL2 at a lower dose (9 Î¼g/kg) and a higher dose (18 Î¼g/kg) daily Ã 5 days every three weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The investigators reported that none of the patients experienced an objective clinical response and that the expression of the Treg-specific transcription factor Foxp3 and the suppressive ability of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>HI </sup>cells did not decrease significantly. The disparity in clinical results between this study and the current study of melanoma patients may be due to differences in: (i) the dosing (9 or 18 versus 12 Î¼g/kg); (ii) the duration of treatment in each cycle (5 daily versus 4 daily doses per cycle); (iii) the low sample size in both studies; (iv) the extent of disease in the examined human subjects; (v) the methods used to measure T regulatory cells (real-time PCR for Foxp3 versus three color flow cytometry for CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>HI</sup>Foxp3<sup>+ </sup>cells); and (vi) the extent of prior immunotherapeutic treatments that had been administered to the patients in each study (<italic>e.g</italic>. IL-2). Importantly, in a recent study, DAB/IL2 was found to significantly reduce the peripheral blood Treg cells in metastatic renal cell carcinoma patients and to abrogate Treg-mediated immunosuppressive activity <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. This study also demonstrated that DAB/IL2-mediated depletion of Tregs followed by vaccination with RNA-transfected DCs increased the activation of tumor-specific T cell responses compared to vaccination alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>In conclusion, we have demonstrated that T cell depletion with DAB/IL2 in melanoma patients is followed by a T cell repopulation of the peripheral blood, the <italic>de novo </italic>appearance of CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells specific for melanocyte differentiation antigens and regression of melanoma metastases. This single site, investigator-initiated phase II clinical trial has been expanded to provide further evidence for the efficacy of DAB/IL2 against melanoma. Future clinical studies that are conceptually appealing include an examination of the efficacy of DAB/IL2 in several cancer types and the potential utility of combination therapy with vaccines or other immune enhancing agents such as interferon-Î±. Last, we anticipate that the limited or pulsed administration of alternative T cell depleting agents may prove useful for the activation of cognate immunity against neoplastic cells in cancer patients.</p>
