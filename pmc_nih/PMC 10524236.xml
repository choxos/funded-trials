                  <p id="P3">Long-segment tracheal defects require tissue replacement for successful reconstruction. Rapid revascularization is imperative to maintain graft function. We previously showed that partially decellularized tracheal grafts (PDTG) and composite tracheal grafts (CTG; PDTG supported by a 3-dimensionally printed external splint) regenerate respiratory epithelium and may support the regeneration of endothelial cells (CD31+). However, the capability of graft endothelial cells to organize or contribute to tracheal revascularization remains unclear. In this study, we quantified endothelial cells (CD31+) and neovessel formation in PDTG and CTG. We hypothesize that PDTG and CTG support tracheal neovascularization to a similar extent as surgical (syngeneic tracheal graft [STG]) and native trachea (NT) controls.</p>

            <p id="P9">Long-segment tracheal defects may arise from autoimmune disease, congenital anomalies, malignancy, or intubation trauma and ultimately require tissue replacement for reconstruction.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> A challenge behind tracheal replacement and reconstruction is the restoration of its blood supply since the trachea is vascularized mainly by small perforators along the posterolateral airway.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Rapid neovascularization has been identified as the key predictor of successful surgical intervention in tracheal replacement, and failure of neovascularization has been identified as one of the major factors leading to graft failure.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Recent solutions have focused on allograft transplantation as a means of rapidly restoring perfusion to tracheal grafts, with reported success with local tissue flaps<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> and microvascular free flaps<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> in preserving ciliated epithelial cell viability, maintaining chondrocyte survival, and promoting anastomotic healing.</p>
            <p id="P10">Allogenic transplantation can often require long-term immunosuppressive medications with numerous potential adverse effects to avoid rejection.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Due to the life-threatening implications of unmanageable tracheal disease without autologous tissue and the risks associated with immunosuppressive treatments, partially decellularized tracheal grafts (PDTG) that contains an epithelial extracellular matrix similar to the native trachea (NT) while remaining nonimmunogenic have been developed.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> PDTG supports rapid regeneration of a host-derived epithelium. Anticipating mechanical changes in vivo when scaling these PDTG for human use, a composite tracheal graft (CTG) composed of PDTG and a 3-dimensionally (3D) printed external splint have been developed to confer stable mechanical properties during regeneration.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup></p>
            <p id="P11">In our previous work,<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> we suggested that PDTG may support the formation of new endothelial cell populations in the lamina propria, by the presence of the endothelial cell marker CD31.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> However, the capability of these endothelial cells to organize or contribute to tracheal revascularization remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to detect the formation of graft neovessels by quantifying microvessels based on endothelial cell population and gross morphology in the lamina propria and determine the effect of the composite airway splints on neovessel formation in a murine model of orthotopic tracheal transplantation.</p>
            <p id="P12">We hypothesized that the number and size of neovessels in tracheal grafts with (CTG) or without (PDTG) an airway splint would be similar to NT and syngeneic controls (syngeneic tracheal graft [STG]) at 1 month.</p>

                <p id="P14">As previously described, tracheal grafts were harvested from 6- to 8-week-old C57BL/6J female mice.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> A 5 mm segment of the proximal trachea was excised. Syngeneic grafts were implanted in genetically identical mice following harvest without additional processing. PDTG was prepared as described previously.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> In brief, tracheal segments were rinsed with 1X phosphate-buffered saline with 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and treated with 0.01% (wt/vol) sodium dodecyl sulfate solution (SDS; Sigma-Aldrich) for 5 minutes. They were then washed with 0.9% sodium chloride (NaCl; Thermo Fisher Scientific) solution in 10-, 15-, and 20-minute sessions sequentially. Segments were then treated with 0.01% (wt/vol) and 0.1% (wt/vol) SDS solutions for 24 hours followed by 0.2% and 0.1% SDS for 3 hours each. Nucleic acids were cleared with 30 minutes of 1% Triton X-100 solution. Overnight, tracheas were immersed in 0.9% NaCl solution at 4°C. All procedures were performed on a shaking platform at 48 rounds/minute.</p>

                <p id="P15">3D-printed airway splints were manufactured as previously described.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Briefly, microcomputed tomography images of a mouse trachea were segmented to create a 3D model of the tracheal anatomy. Solidworks (Solidworks 2021; Dassault Systemes) was used to design splints that encircled 270° of the external anterior trachea without overlying the posterior wall and span a 3 mm defect and overlap the NT at each end. A 3 × 3 scaffold design supported radial traction and facilitated suturing the splint with the graft and NT. The thickness of the splint was 250 μm.</p>
                <p id="P16">Splints were then manufactured via stereolithography 3D Printing (Form3B; FormLabs) using BioMed Amber Resin (FormLabs), and postprocessed as per standard protocols. Prior to implantation, splints were sterilized using an autoclave according to resin requirements.</p>

Neovessels were identified as fully formed tubular vessels in the tracheal lamina propria with intraluminal red blood cells. Of each cohort, 3 animals from each surgical group (9 samples) had adjacent CD31 and H&amp;E sections that were used to correlate blood vessels to endothelial cells. Blood vessels were marked and measured using ImageJ (US National Institutes of Health) for quantification. Neovessel formation was quantified as the number of blood vessels (blood vessel number/graft area (number/mm<sup>2</sup>) and the size of the blood vessels (area of the vessels/graft area (mm<sup>2</sup>) on H&amp;E slides.</p>

              <p id="P22">Successful graft decellularization was confirmed on H&amp;E and immunofluorescence prior to implantation, as there was no evidence of extracartilaginous cells and CD31 staining was negative in all grafts. Out of the animals listed above, 9 had adjacent slides of both CD31 IF and H&amp;E staining, making them appropriate for the correlation of blood vessels to endothelial cells. After 1-month postimplantation, all animals in the PDTG and CTG groups demonstrated spatially appropriate endothelial regeneration as evidenced by the presence of CD31-positive cells and findings on H&amp;E.</p>
              <p id="P23">All tracheal grafts demonstrated the presence of neovessels at 1 month (representative images, <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Gross examination of grafts illustrated overlying blood vessels at the time of explantation (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Quantification of blood vessels on H&amp;E staining demonstrated equivalent numbers of blood vessels per mm<sup>2</sup> between PDTG (33.6 ± 15.5), CTG (16.9 ± 8.60), NT (51.0 ± 33.1), and STG (41.3 ± 5.78) (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = .5821 for PDTG vs NT; <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = .1029 for CTG vs NT; <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = .9390 for PDTG vs STG; <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = .3125 for CTG vs STG). Additionally, the size of blood vessels over the entire graft (%vessel area/graft area) was equivalent between groups (NT: 0.998 ± 0.579; STG: 1.00 ± 0.391; PDTG: 1.18 ± 0.900; CTG: 0.785 ± 0.604; <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = .9774 for PDTG vs NT; <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = .9647 for CTG vs NT; <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = .9782 for PDTG vs STG; <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = .9637 for CTG vs STG), and CD31 quantification was equivalent between groups (STG: 49.4 ± 9.85; PDTG: 54.6 ± 11.1; CTG: 52.0 ± 12.6, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &gt; .05 for each comparison), which suggests that both PDTG and CTG undergo neovessel formation and that these vessels are not different in number, size, or CD31 positivity than surgical and nonsurgical controls.</p>
              <p id="P24">Before PDTG and CTG implantation, the CD31 staining was negative in all grafts and there was no evidence of any cellular DNA. Furthermore, CD31 immunofluorescence of endothelial cells formed tubular blood vessels and appeared to be distributed along the patterns of blood vessels on H&amp;E at low power (representative images, <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>) and high-powered fields (representative image, <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>), demonstrating regeneration of endothelial cells.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="P25">Long-segment tracheal defects present a reconstructive challenge and ultimately warrant tissue replacement for defects greater than 30%.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> We previously developed a nonimmunogenic tracheal graft using partial decellularization that is able to produce tracheal neo-tissue in 1 month. One critical component to successful tracheal replacement is the restoration of perfusion, which we previously attempted to measure using IF quantification of the endothelial cell marker CD31, but this does not provide information on whether or not these endothelial cells organize or contribute to the process of neovascularization.</p>
              <p id="P26">Endothelial cells have been known to lead to neovascularization which encompasses both angiogenesis and vasculogenesis to support nutrient delivery and perfusion.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> We found no effect of an external airway splint on endothelial regeneration. This quantification was equivalent to NT and surgical control, suggesting that both PDTG and CTG support neovascularization. Functional vascularization is critical for tracheal regeneration since it promotes the circulation of nutrients and cytokines required for effective tissue regeneration and ensures re-epithelialization on the basement membrane.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> In the current study, we also showed that PDTG and CTG undergo neovascularization, as evidenced by neovessel formation on histology 1 month after implantation. We confirmed this with both quantitative immunofluorescence and gross morphologic assessment. We also found that IF assessment of endothelial cells with CD31 consistently identified newly formed blood vessels observed on H&amp;E, thus validating this measurement to quantify neovessel formation.</p>
              <p id="P27">There were several limitations to this study. First, a murine model of orthotopic tracheal transplant may not be as clinically translatable due to the small size of the airway, may have less space for blood vessel infiltration, and therefore may not translate to humans. We are addressing these limitations through ongoing work with large animal models. Also, the characterization of blood vessel formation may have been skewed due to slight variations in histologic sectioning, which is compounded by the small size of the airway and small sample size. Ongoing work will include perfusion studies to confirm vessel functionality, which we will pursue in our tracheal grafts with further studies.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p id="P28">PDTG not only demonstrates regeneration of a functional epithelium but also supports neovessel formation similar to NT, which is known to be a key metric of success in tracheal replacement. Further research is needed to fully characterize the perfusion of tracheal grafts as we move closer to clinical translation.</p>
