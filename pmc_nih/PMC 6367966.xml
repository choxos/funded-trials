              <p>Linear growth restriction continues to be a major public health challenge globally for poor communities in low- and middle-income countries (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1‚Äì3</xref>). Stunting before 2 y of age is prominent among the nutrition factors related to disease burden and mortality in early childhood (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Longer-term associations of early linear growth faltering include impairment of motor development, cognition, educational and economic achievement, chronic disease, and low offspring birth size (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Fetal growth restriction is another major predictor of adverse outcomes beyond the neonatal period, including mortality, stunting, and impaired neurodevelopment (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7‚Äì10</xref>). Recognition of the unique and compelling opportunities for optimizing the environment of both the fetus and young child has given prominence to the concept of ‚ÄúThe First 1000 Days‚Äù (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) and has prompted numerous trials directed either to early postnatal life or, by means of improving maternal nutrition, to life during gestation. The environmental factors underlying stunting and adverse birth outcomes are undoubtedly complex and potentially synergistic, but maternal undernutrition can clearly result in deficits of nutrients required for physical growth. Trials of maternal supplements, typically initiated during the second trimester of gestation, consisting of iron and folate, multimicronutrients with or without lipids, or protein-energy supplements, have frequently had some positive effect on offspring birth size, including length. However, the effect sizes of such maternal interventions have typically been quite modest (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12‚Äì15</xref>).</p>
              <p>Advantages of initiating maternal nutrition supplements before conception have been suggested, particularly to correct both maternal underweight and micronutrient deficiencies before conception (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16‚Äì18</xref>). Evidence of a beneficial effect of improved nutrition during the periconceptional period is supported by animal and epigenetic studies (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Currently, however, information is too limited to reach definitive conclusions regarding the potential benefits to the offspring of prevention or treatment of maternal undernutrition before conception in resource-poor settings (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21‚Äì24</xref>).</p>
              <p>To address this gap in knowledge, we undertook a trial known as Women First. The broad goal of the trial was to evaluate the potential benefits on birth outcomes of promoting optimal maternal nutrition for ‚â•3 mo before conception (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). We hypothesized that for women living in poor environments with high rates of stunting, starting a comprehensive nutrition supplement during the preconception period would result in significantly greater newborn length than starting the same intervention at the junction of the first and second trimesters or not being provided this supplement at all. In addition, we report here the impact of the intervention on other birth outcomes.</p>

                <title>Study design</title>
                <p>This was an individually randomized, nonmasked, multisite controlled efficacy trial (NCT01883193, initial release 18 June 2013) to determine the effect of a preconception nutrition supplement on birth length and other anthropometry outcomes at birth. The trial included 3 arms: one that started the supplement ‚â•3 mo before conception and continued through delivery (Arm 1); a second arm that started the same intervention late in the first trimester (Arm 2); and a third that received no nutrition supplements besides those self-administered or prescribed through local health services (Arm 3).</p>
                <p>The trial was conducted in rural or semirural locations in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC; Equateur), Guatemala (Chimaltenango), India (Belagavi, North Karnataka), and Pakistan (Thatta, Sindh Province). Each of these 4 sites is a member of the <italic>Eunice Kennedy Shriver</italic> National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Global Network (GN) for Women's and Children's Health Research. Trial participants were recruited from a total of 53 GN clusters, which were geographic catchment areas, each of which has ‚àº300 deliveries/y. Communication between the investigators based at the University of Colorado and study partners in the 4 sites was facilitated by the Data Coordinating Center (DCC) at RTI International (Durham, NC) and included monthly data monitoring reports and conference calls and periodic site visits by the lead investigators to review study progress, share strategies, and conduct refresher training as needed.</p>

                <title>Participants</title>
                <p>Women were identified through the GN Maternal and Newborn Health Registry (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), household surveys, local health centers, word-of-mouth, and local advertising. Community sensitization meetings were held to explain the study to prospective participants and families. All women were screened for the following inclusion criteria: age 16‚Äì35 y; parity 0‚Äì5, with site-specific strategies to include nulliparous participants; no current or planned contraceptive use; and expectation to conceive during the following 18 mo. Consent of parous women was delayed until ‚â•2 mo postpartum. Women with a known history of obstetric complications or those who were unwilling to deliver in hospital were excluded (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). If an otherwise eligible woman had a hemoglobin concentration of ‚â§8 g/dL at screening, enrollment was delayed until successfully treated, if at all. No women were excluded on the basis of height, weight, or BMI (kg/m<sup>2</sup>). Diets were predominantly based on staple foods, including grains and tubers, and were generally low in dietary diversity (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>).</p>

                <title>Randomization</title>
                <p>The DCC created the randomization scheme, centrally generating the allocation sequence for each site. To ensure geographic balance, a permuted block design stratified by GN clusters was used for assigning individual participants to a trial arm. The allocation ratio was 1:1:1 within blocks which randomly varied between sizes of 3, 6, or 9 for each site. Once the responsible home visitor research assistant identified an eligible participant, they received the random assignment generated by the site data manager from the centralized computerized data management system maintained by the DCC.</p>

                  <title>Intervention.</title>
                  <p>The nutrition intervention, termed <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplement 1</xref>, has been described in detail in the published protocol (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplemental Table 1</xref></bold>). Briefly, it was a lipid-based micronutrient supplement (Nutriset) and provided micronutrients, polyunsaturated fats in a favorable balance, and modest quantities of protein and energy (2.6 g protein and 118 kcal) (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). For Arm 1, the duration of the primary supplement was from the time of random assignment until delivery; participants were required to be on the primary supplement for ‚â•3 mo before conception. For Arm 2, the primary supplement covered the second and third trimesters of pregnancy and was also stopped at delivery. Participants in Arm 3 were not provided any nutrition supplement by the study.</p>
                  <p>In addition, in Arms 1 and 2, women were provided a second daily lipid-based protein-energy supplement (termed <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplemental Table 1</xref>) if they had a BMI¬†&lt;20 at any time while receiving <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplement 1</xref>, or had weight gain in the second or third trimesters of pregnancy less than the Institute of Medicine's guidelines (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). If consumed completely, this supplement provided 300 kcal and 11 g protein (‚àº15% of energy) without additional supplemental micronutrients (Nutriset). <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplement 2</xref> was initiated before conception on the basis of BMI for participants in Arm 1 as well as for gestational weight gain during pregnancy (1.7‚Äì2.0 kg/mo). For Arm 2, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplement 2</xref> was started after the initiation of <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplement 1</xref> when either of the criteria became evident. For both arms, once initiated, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplement 2</xref> was provided until delivery. Unlike the primary supplement, high compliance was not required for the second supplement because of our intention to minimize reduction in habitual food intake and for participants to consume a quantity ‚Äúto appetite.‚Äù Recipients were encouraged to consume ‚â•50% of the protein-energy supplement (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplement 2</xref>) on a daily basis. Participants in Arms 1 and 2 were cautioned not to take other micronutrient supplements or fortified food products while taking the trial supplements.</p>

                  <p>Participants in all 3 arms were visited by the home visitor research assistants every 2 wk to record interim health history and to administer a urine pregnancy test. The pregnancy testing was combined with calendar records of menses to ascertain last menstrual period and to guide the timing of ultrasounds to be obtained between 10 and 12 weeks of estimated gestation. For Arms 1 and 2, these visits were also used to replenish the supply of trial supplements. Compliance with use of supplements was documented by inspection of calendars the women completed daily and by collection of empty, partially eaten, and unused intervention sachets. Compliance was calculated for <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplement 1</xref> as the total number of sachets fully eaten divided by the number of days between starting <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplement 1</xref> and delivery. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplement 2</xref> compliance was calculated similarly; however, the numerator was the total number of <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplement 2</xref> sachets fully or partially eaten.</p>

                  <p>Maternal height and weight measurements were obtained at enrollment, and maternal weight was obtained at ‚àº12 and 32 wks of gestation for all arms. Additionally, monthly weights were obtained once <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplement 1</xref> was initiated (e.g., at enrollment for Arm 1 and after the 12 wk gestation measurement for Arm 2). Newborn anthropometry was obtained within 48 h of delivery (neonatal stadiometer, Ellard Instrumentation, Ltd; seca 334 electronic scale and seca 201 measurement tape, seca North America). All anthropometry was performed by trained assessment teams who were not involved in the biweekly home visits. Assessment teams were extensively trained by study coordinators to use standardized anthropometric methods and were certified before data collection. The assessment teams‚Äô procedures were observed by study coordinators at each site on a monthly basis and were recertified at least quarterly. Infant recumbent length and weight measurements were obtained in triplicate and entered into the database; the median value was used for analysis.</p>

In addition, the calendars and pregnancy testing were not reliably implemented to determine women's last menstrual period. Thus, plausible GA determinations were not possible for this site.</p>

                <title>Statistical methods</title>
                <p>Sample size determination was based on testing 2 co-primary hypotheses (comparison of Arm 1 with Arm 2 and Arm 1 with Arm 3), for the primary outcome of LAZ at birth. The sample size was based on also having 80% power within each site and maintaining a study-wide Type I error rate of 0.05 across all planned primary hypothesis tests (2 tests at each of 4 sites, for a total of 8 tests). Thus, an Œ±-level of 0.00625 for single-site outcomes was specified to account for the 8 planned primary comparisons. Assuming an Œ±-level of 0.00625, a 2-sided test, and an SD of 1.0 for the primary outcome, 192 evaluable women per arm in each site were needed to detect an effect size of 0.37 with 80% power. To account for 20% attrition during pregnancy required that 240 women per arm enter Phase 2 (pregnancy) within each site. The assumption that 50% of women randomly assigned at Phase 1 would get pregnant and move to Phase 2 required 480 women per arm to be enrolled in each site. Given 192 evaluable women per arm in each site for a total of 768 women per arm over all 4 sites, an Œ±-level of 0.025 for each primary hypothesis test across all sites would allow detection of an effect size of 0.18 with 90% power for each pooled comparison of Arm 1 with Arm 2 and Arm 1 with Arm 3.</p>
                <p>For the primary and secondary outcomes, newborn LAZ, WAZ, HCAZ, and BMIZ were based on the WHO Child Growth Standards (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), which account for infant sex and age at measurement but are not adjusted for GA at delivery. Owing to the lack of GA determinations in the DRC, we applied these standards to all births in all sites in the same manner across the 3 arms. Rates of LBW were also determined for the 4-site data set. In addition, for the 3 sites with GA determination (Guatemala, India, Pakistan), the INTERGROWTH-21st fetal growth standards were also applied to birth measurements and binary outcomes (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). These GAA analyses are a post hoc exploration, with <italic>P</italic> values provided for descriptive purposes.</p>
                <p>We assessed the study outcomes using a modified intention-to-treat approach. The overall treatment effect and pairwise comparisons for the primary outcome and continuous secondary outcomes were obtained from linear models for the outcome of interest. Model-generated measures of effect size with 95% CIs and <italic>P</italic> values were adjusted for site and cluster-nested within site. For binary secondary outcomes, generalized linear models with generalized estimating equations were utilized to calculate RRs with 95% CIs and <italic>P</italic> values after adjusting for site while controlling for cluster correlations. The comparisons of Arm 1 with Arm 2 and Arm 1 with Arm 3 were prespecified in the protocol. The comparison of Arm 2 with Arm 3, also presented in this article, is a post hoc comparison. <italic>P</italic> values from chi-square tests for categorical variables and ANOVA analysis of means were calculated to assess differences between maternal baseline characteristics by treatment arm. In addition, for the primary outcome, we investigated potential confounding by baseline maternal factors by first assessing differences in the maternal factors by treatment arm and then adjusting the aforementioned models for any factor which varied by treatment at an Œ±-level of 0.10. These maternal factors included age, parity, education, BMI, height, and socioeconomic status.</p>
                <p>As a statistical check to ensure that evaluating only a subset of those randomly assigned (women who became pregnant and delivered a live birth, with birth length evaluated) was not unexpectedly skewing the results, we constructed a composite binary secondary outcome that was evaluated alongside the primary outcome. Among the randomly assigned women who became pregnant, this outcome is defined as live birth free of growth failure. Specifically, the outcome compared women who delivered a live birth with LAZ ‚â•‚àí1 to all other women who became pregnant (i.e., delivered a live birth with LAZ &lt;‚àí1 and women who did not deliver a live birth due to medical termination of pregnancy, miscarriage, stillbirth, and intrapartum death). Women without birth outcome data, including women (all 3 arms) who became pregnant too soon (i.e., enrolled in the study for &lt;3 mo before conception), were excluded from this analysis. For this composite outcome, <italic>P</italic> values for the overall treatment effect and pairwise comparisons were obtained from a generalized estimating equation model adjusting for country and controlling for cluster correlations. All analyses were performed by the DCC using SAS/STAT software version 9.4 (SAS Institute).</p>

If the ultrasound was not conducted during the GA previously mentioned, then the GA at birth is missing. <sup>5</sup>LAZ, WAZ, HCAZ, and weight to length-ratio-for age (WLRAZ) <italic>z</italic> scores and percentiles based on measurements within 48 h of delivery are calculated using the INTERGROWTH-21st International Standards for Newborn Size (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>) and International Standards for Newborn Size for Very Preterm Infants (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), which provide <italic>z</italic> scores by sex and GA at birth for infants between 33 wk¬†+¬†0 d and 42 wk¬†+¬†6 d GA at birth and between 24 wk¬†+¬†0 d and 32 wk¬†+¬†6 d GA at birth, respectively.

                <p>There were 520 miscarriages or medical terminations of pregnancy before 20 weeks of gestation (15.0% Arm 1; 16.7% Arm 2; 17.2% Arm 3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Eighty-two stillbirths (‚â•20 wk) accounted for 2‚Äì3% of births across each arm. Of the 2586 live births, 2459 (95.1%) had newborn measurements within 48 h of delivery; 2451 (99.7%) had <italic>z</italic> scores within the biologically plausible range according to WHO standards and were included in the primary analysis. Among live births, 68 newborns died within 48 h of birth; of these newborns, 30 were measured before death.</p>
                <p>Sixty percent of those with newborn primary outcome measurements (<italic>n</italic>¬†=¬†1465) also had CRL ultrasound measurements between 6 weeks, 0 days and 13 weeks, 6 days of gestation and were available for analysis, including 85.8% from India, 80.3% from Guatemala, 68.5% from Pakistan, and none from DRC. Numbers were equally distributed among arms. Mean¬†¬±¬†SD GA at the time of the ultrasound measurements was 11.73¬†¬±¬†1.13 wk with minimal differences between arms and with a slightly higher mean GA of 12.2 wk for India.</p>

              <p>The results of this 4-site trial add substantially to the evidence that poor fetal growth, including linear growth, in low-resource countries can be improved with maternal nutrition supplementation. Specifically, the intervention initiated before conception or late in the first trimester resulted in greater mean birth size (LAZ, WAZ, WLRAZ) and improved rates of stunting, underweight, wasting (WLRAZ¬†&lt;¬†‚àí2), and SGA in comparison with the control arm. Moreover, these benefits are evident in women who were selected without regard for anthropometric or biochemical evidence of malnutrition other than exclusion for severe anemia at baseline. Furthermore, overall improvements in fetal growth occurred despite the wide heterogeneity of the participating sites. With the exception of Guatemala, the mean effect sizes compare favorably with overall results of reported maternal nutrition interventions with either multimicronutrients alone, lipid-based nutrient supplement preparations, or a similar lipid-based protein-energy supplement commencing in mid-gestation (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14, 15</xref>,<xref rid="bib41_275_234518" ref-type="bibr">35‚Äì38</xref>). However, starting the supplement before conception did not result in significantly greater newborn LAZ than starting the same intervention late in the first trimester.</p>
              <p>The RRs for binary outcomes and some of the effect sizes for continuous variables reported here were not included in the original proposal and should be regarded as exploratory. In this context, however, there are informative differences illustrating the heterogeneity between sites. Effect sizes for comparison of LAZ between the preconception and control arms were substantial in both Pakistan and DRC where they approached the effect size hypothesized in the original proposal (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). A similar pattern was evident for RRs of binary measures of linear growth, especially for stunting (LAZ¬†&lt;‚àí2) and also to a lesser degree for impaired linear growth (LAZ¬†&lt;‚àí1), which has predictive value for postnatal growth (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Corresponding responses to the intervention compared with controls were observed for weight-related outcomes, both continuous and binary. SGA was especially high in India, and substantial reductions in RRs for both SGA and WLRAZ were associated with the intervention, most notably with the preconception intervention (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Consistent with this, effects of the intervention on LBW were also observed for the 4 sites combined (NGAA data). In Guatemala, no positive outcomes were observed for either continuous or binary variables for Arm 1 and Arm 3 comparisons.</p>
              <p>The primary intervention for which we have detailed information on compliance was similar to a widely used small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplement with modest protein and energy content and micronutrient amounts appropriate for pregnancy and lactation (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). An additional protein-energy supplement was provided to women who were underweight or had low gestational weight gain. The latter reason accounted for provision of the second supplement to &gt;90% of women in both Arms 1 and 2 (except for Guatemala) starting at some stage in the second or third trimester and continuing until delivery. Participants were encouraged to consume this second supplement but the actual amount was left to the woman's discretion in order to minimize interference with consumption of the habitual diet. That this guideline was effective for Arm 1 was indicated by the lack of any difference in energy consumption from local food between Arms 1 and 2 during the first trimester in a random subsample (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Despite provision of the protein-energy supplement, the average gestational weight gain through 32 wk remained low relative to international recommendations (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Both low prepregnancy weight and gestational weight gain &lt;8¬†kg have been associated with LBW and SGA rates, and these factors may have been relevant to outcomes in the current trial (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>).</p>
              <p>This trial coincided with growing interest in the potential value of preventing or correcting maternal undernutrition before conception (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). One trial of preconception multimicronutrient maternal supplements conducted in Vietnam demonstrated a modest improvement in iron stores but no impact on birth outcomes (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Results of an a priori secondary analysis from a food-based intervention trial targeting a poor urban population in India were consistent with an increase in birth weight if the supplement was commenced ‚â•3 mo before conception. The results of that trial also differed by maternal prepregnancy weight status, with no overall impact of the intervention on birth weight, the primary outcome, but a significant interaction such that birth weight, birth length, and rates of LBW were improved in women with BMI¬†&gt;21.8 at baseline (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).</p>
              <p>A major weakness of the trial was the inability to determine GA in the DRC with the resultant loss of the sub-Saharan African site for the GAA data. This loss detracted from the global scope of the trial. Moreover, the DRC had the most favorable Arm 1 compared with Arm 3 improvement in mean LAZ based on the NGAA data. Subject numbers were further reduced for GAA data, both combined and in the other 3 sites, especially in Pakistan, due to failure to obtain a first-trimester ultrasound in all participants. Final numbers for this post hoc GAA analysis were thus well below those available for the trial primary outcome analysis predicated on NGAA LAZ at birth. Another factor adversely affecting effect sizes and RRs for combined sites was the negative Arm 1 result for the Guatemala site. We speculate that this outcome was attributable, in part, to the high proportion of Arm 3 preterm infants who did not have primary outcome measures. These losses were for diverse reasons apparently unrelated to the trial. Support for this explanation has been derived from disappearance of the negative Arm 1 compared with Arm 3 results for LAZ for Guatemala newborns delivered at term only (data not presented). However, it remains disappointing and unexplained that there was no indication of a positive effect on fetal linear growth in this indigenous population with exceptionally high rates of stunting but with a substantially lower proportion of maternal underweight than in the other 3 sites (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). It is possible that potential benefits of the Arm 1 intervention to the linear growth of this population may be discernible in the next generation [i.e., those born to the female infants in the current study (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>)]. Primary reliance on participants‚Äô reported consumption of the supplements represents a potential weakness. This was mitigated by the biweekly home visits which provided opportunities for the field staff to work closely with mothers to identify palatable ways to consume the supplements and frequently to observe consumption.</p>
              <p>Notable features of this trial included the diverse low-resource sites in which it was conducted, in 4 countries across 3 continents. The participating women, who had wide differences in diet, culture, socioeconomic status, and education, were not selected on the basis of current evidence of undernutrition except for at least temporary exclusion if hemoglobin was &lt;8 g/dL. The trial was unusual in testing the effects of a relatively comprehensive combination of nutrition products (i.e., those containing micronutrients as well as a protein-energy supplement). Finally, the trial is one of very few that have addressed the huge potential challenge of preventing or correcting undernutrition of both micronutrients and macronutrients in females of reproductive age before conception.</p>
              <p>In resource-poor rural or semirural populations in which there is a high prevalence of stunting, fetal growth was improved with maternal nutrition supplements commenced either before conception or late in the first trimester and provided to women irrespective of their own nutritional status. This improvement was achieved without the support of nutrition education and without any attention to other environmental factors associated with impaired fetal and early postnatal growth. Results for sites were heterogeneous with improvements in newborn LAZ, the primary outcome, ranging from zero to more than one-third of deficits. Results were more favorable than most reported data for maternal nutrition supplements initiated during pregnancy, which could be attributable to the timing of the initiation of the supplements. Despite the trial's failure to achieve optimal maternal gestational weight gain and to support its principal primary hypothesis, the results of data analyses undertaken within a hypothesis-generating framework suggest that further work is needed. Meanwhile, the results are strongly supportive of strategies to improve inadequate nutrition in women, commencing before conception or very early in gestation.</p>
