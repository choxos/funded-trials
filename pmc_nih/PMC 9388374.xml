                <p id="Par1">Oncogenic <italic>RET</italic> fusions occur in diverse cancers. Pralsetinib is a potent, selective inhibitor of RET receptor tyrosine kinase. ARROW (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03037385">NCT03037385</ext-link>, ongoing) was designed to evaluate pralsetinib efficacy and safety in patients with advanced <italic>RET</italic>-altered solid tumors. Twenty-nine patients with 12 different <italic>RET</italic> fusion–positive solid tumor types, excluding non-small-cell lung cancer and thyroid cancer, who had previously received or were not candidates for standard therapies, were enrolled. The most common <italic>RET</italic> fusion partners in 23 efficacy-evaluable patients were <italic>CCDC6</italic> (26%), <italic>KIF5B</italic> (26%) and <italic>NCOA4</italic> (13%). Overall response rate, the primary endpoint, was 57% (95% confidence interval, 35–77) among these patients. Responses were observed regardless of tumor type or <italic>RET</italic> fusion partner. Median duration of response, progression-free survival and overall survival were 12 months, 7 months and 14 months, respectively. The most common grade ≥3 treatment-related adverse events were neutropenia (31%) and anemia (14%). These data validate RET as a tissue-agnostic target with sensitivity to RET inhibition, indicating pralsetinib’s potential as a well-tolerated treatment option with rapid, robust and durable anti-tumor activity in patients with diverse <italic>RET</italic> fusion–positive solid tumors.</p>

              <p id="Par4">Pralsetinib (formerly known as BLU-667, Blueprint Medicines Corporation) is a selective RET inhibitor that potently targets RET kinases, including RET fusion proteins. The recommended phase 2 dose of 400 mg once daily (QD) orally administered pralsetinib was determined in phase 1 of the ARROW study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Pralsetinib has low affinity for off-target kinases. In a biochemical assay, pralsetinib was 88-fold more selective for RET than for vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), a tyrosine kinase receptor that is targeted by multi-kinase inhibitors such as cabozantinib and vandetanib<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>.

She had two muscular masses on her right upper arm, and the initial pathologic diagnosis after resection was pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS). Given this diagnosis, the patient received imatinib as first-line therapy but progressed, with locoregional recurrence with at least four macroscopic tumor nodules in the right arm that were considered inoperable. In parallel to RNA sequencing analysis that confirmed a <italic>RET</italic><italic>–</italic><italic>CCDC6</italic> fusion, transcriptomic analysis suggested that the diagnosis was not PVNS but, rather, an undifferentiated histiocytic tumor. Other mutations in the whole-exome RNA sequence included an in-frame fusion of type FN1-PRG4 as well as the reciprocal transcript (also in-frame) and mutations in exon 43 of <italic>ATM</italic> (p.R2105G) and exon 5 of <italic>PDGFRB</italic> (p.R251H). These three mutations were variants of unknown significance. At the time of treatment initiation, a total of seven nodules (8–50 mm) were found on pre-treatment magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the soft tissue of the right arm as well as two right axillary lymph nodes (10 mm and 12 mm). As of October 2021, the CR was ongoing after 19.6 months of follow-up.</p>

              <p id="Par19">In this phase 1/2 study of pralsetinib in patients with advanced or metastatic <italic>RET</italic> fusion–positive solid tumors, almost all of whom were previously treated with systemic therapy, pralsetinib showed robust and durable anti-tumor activity regardless of tumor type or <italic>RET</italic> fusion partner. <italic>RET</italic> fusions have been identified as oncogenic drivers in multiple tumor types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, and, generally, standard therapies that are effective in tumors without oncogenic drivers are less effective than targeted therapies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Precision oncology paradigms that comprise identification of oncogenic alterations through clinical NGS and subsequent application of genomically targeted therapies are applicable to multiple malignancies. Herein, <italic>RET</italic> fusions defined a unique subset of alterations across multiple tumor types (&gt;15 including NSCLC and multiple subtypes of thyroid cancer) targeted by pralsetinib, validating RET as a tissue-agnostic target.</p>
              <p id="Par20">In this patient group, whose disease was resistant to prior treatments where available, treatment with pralsetinib resulted in an ORR of 57% across seven tumor types, and clinical benefit was reported in 70% of patients by blinded independent central review (BICR). This compares to an ORR of 61% and 70% in patients with <italic>RET</italic> fusion–positive NSCLC who received prior platinum therapy and no prior systemic treatment, respectively, and an ORR of 89% for patients with <italic>RET</italic> fusion–positive thyroid cancer in previously published data on the ARROW study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Despite the small number of patients, responses were seen in all four patients with pancreatic cancer (including an ongoing CR with treatment duration of 33.1 months) as well as in two of the three patients with cholangiocarcinoma (including a patient who received treatment for over 20 months after a best response of PD on all three prior lines of therapy). These are encouraging findings because these tumor types are difficult to treat, and the unmet need for better treatments to improve clinical benefit is high. Indeed, response rates for standard-of-care therapies are 26% in biliary cancers (cisplatin plus gemcitabine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>) and 23–32% (first-line oxaliplatin-based combination chemotherapy and first-line gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel) in pancreatic cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. In ARROW, responses were seen in treatment-naive patients who were not candidates for standard therapies and in patients who had received several prior lines of therapy, highlighting the need for targeted therapies across a range of tumor types for patients who currently have no standard of care and for those who have exhausted all other options. The strategy of treating patients with <italic>RET</italic> fusion–positive solid tumors with targeted therapies is also supported by results with selpercatinib: in an analysis that included adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic <italic>RET</italic> fusion–positive non-lung/non-thyroid solid tumors who received selpercatinib twice daily, the ORR was 47%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. The efficacy-evaluable population comprised patients who were enrolled long enough to allow a 6-month follow-up from their first dose.</p>
              <p id="Par21">The safety profile reported in this analysis is consistent with previously reported results in patients with <italic>RET</italic> fusion–positive NSCLC and thyroid cancer from the ARROW study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, with no new safety signals identified, and no effect of pralsetinib on QT interval was observed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. The most common TRAEs were increased ALT/AST and neutropenia. Common TRAEs seen with selpercatinib include increased ALT/AST, dry mouth, diarrhea and fatigue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. For patients with other solid tumors who received selpercatinib in the LIBRETTO-001 study, a grade ≥3 TRAE of QT interval prolongation was reported in 4% of patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par22">ARROW is a single-arm study with no comparator group. The safety population for the cohort analyzed here included a small heterogeneous number of patients (<italic>n</italic> = 29); despite this, all but two patients included in the efficacy-evaluable population (<italic>n</italic> = 23), a subset of the safety population, experienced a tumor shrinkage. In combination with the robust activity seen in patients with NSCLC and thyroid cancer in the ARROW study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, these data further support the potential of pralsetinib to address the unmet medical need across a broad range of <italic>RET</italic>-altered tumor types with differing histology.</p>
              <p id="Par23">Overall, these data highlight the need for broad <italic>RET</italic> testing, preferably by NGS, to identify candidates who may benefit from treatment with pralsetinib.

              <p>The anonymized derived data from the registrational ARROW study (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03037385">NCT03037385</ext-link>) that underlie the results reported in this article may be made available after Roche and/or Blueprint Medicines have received regulatory approval for pralsetinib in the United States and the European Union in the tumor-agnostic setting described herein or upon terminating its clinical development in this setting. Qualified researchers can then request access to individual patient-level clinical data through a data request platform. At the time of writing, this platform is Vivli (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://vivli.org/ourmember/roche/">https://vivli.org/ourmember/roche/</ext-link>). As <italic>RET</italic> fusions are rare alterations, the anonymization of patient-level data in patient subgroups or trial cohorts of fewer than 50 patients may be difficult to achieve. As a result, Roche will assess the feasibility of anonymization and, therefore, data release as part of the review of inquiries. For up-to-date details on Roche’s Global Policy on the Sharing of Clinical Information and how to request access to related clinical study documents, see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://go.roche.com/data_sharing">https://go.roche.com/data_sharing</ext-link>.</p>
