              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="Par3">The RTS,S/AS01E is the most advanced malaria vaccine, consistently providing partial protection against clinical malaria in African children<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, although the duration of its moderate vaccine efficacy is limited<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Vaccine efficacy against clinical malaria over a 12-month follow-up period estimated in the African phase 3 randomised controlled trial was 55.8% in children (5–17 months old at study start)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> and 31.3% in infants (6–12 weeks old at study start)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. The vaccine is composed of virus-like particles consisting of the hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) and the malarial target antigen, a fragment of the <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> circumsporozoite protein (CSP) spanning the central region containing blocks of four amino acid repeats (NANP) and the C-terminal (C-term) part and formulated with AS01E adjuvant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Previous paediatric phase 1/2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> and the phase 3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> clinical trials in Africa have shown that RTS,S in its various adjuvant formulations induces high IgG antibody titres to CSP NANP repeat that remain above naturally-acquired levels for years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Presently, it is unclear how the vaccine protects against clinical malaria, and why and how the immune mechanism of protection might be affected by age at first immunisation and malaria transmission intensity (MTI)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par4">Thus far, vaccine immunogenicity measurements have focused mainly on the NANP repeat as the immunodominant B cell epitope<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Humoral responses to the subdominant C-term domain have been evaluated in healthy malaria-naïve adults but not in malaria-pre-exposed populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. The C-term domain is structurally conserved<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> and B cell epitopes in this region have not been characterized. Upon immunisation with <italic>P. falciparum</italic> irradiated sporozoites, monoclonal antibodies against the C-term are rarely induced in malaria naïve volunteers and thus far have not demonstrated to mediate protection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. The C-term domain contains a well-known promiscuous CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell epitope that is conserved among all parasite isolates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par5">Although the magnitude of anti-NANP repeat antibodies elicited by RTS,S has been associated with vaccine efficacy in some studies, including the phase 3 trial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, others have shown that this response is not associated with protection against clinical malaria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. The biological function of IgG against the dominant and subdominant CSP epitopes differs, which subsequently could have an impact on protection. Analyses of RTS,S/AS01-induced antibodies in phase 1/2a trials suggested that protected individuals had higher anti-NANP-specific IgG titres but of low opsonisation activity. In contrast, antibodies targeting the C-term in humans were associated with phagocytic activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Loss of C-term specificity in the overall antibody response to CSP greatly impaired protective efficacy to <italic>P. berghei</italic> in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. The C-term has been shown to take part in the initial entry of sporozoites into hepatocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> and therefore, antibodies to this CSP fragment may play a role in protection. There is recent evidence from ongoing studies in our group of an association between post-vaccination HBsAg IgG levels and malaria protection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> unreported in previous RTS,S field trials. This might be explained partly by correlation with CSP IgG levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> thus further investigation is required.</p>
              <p id="Par6">In addition to understand epitope fine-specificity of RTS,S/AS01E-induced IgG, it is essential to evaluate quality and quantity of these IgG as a possible indicator of their biological function. Studies conducted in prior phase 2 trials evaluated the avidity of anti-NANP IgG responses in RTS,S vaccinees and found no correlation between avidity post-third dose and vaccine efficacy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Changes in NANP IgG avidity and concentration following second and third doses, however, were associated with reduction in clinical malaria risk. A recent phase 2a trial in malaria naïve adults showed that a delayed fractional dose boosting regimen increased antibody avidity and sustained higher protection upon rechallenge<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Therefore, these outcomes merit further evaluation as surrogate markers for RTS,S efficacy. Prior phase 2b trials suggested that IgG avidity was higher in children with high malaria exposure compared to those with low malaria exposure one-month post third vaccine dose<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. The phase 3 trial conducted under a wide range of MTI provides a unique opportunity to address knowledge gaps of RTS,S immunogenicity, immune mechanisms mediating protection, and their determinants.</p>
              <p id="Par7">This study aims to search for antibody correlates of RTS,S/AS01E vaccine-induced protection against malaria by analysing IgG concentrations and avidity to two CSP epitopes (NANP and C-term), and IgG concentrations to HBsAg while considering the effect of age at first vaccination, MTI, and malaria IgG concentrations at baseline. We hypothesise that vaccine efficacy also relies on the contribution of anti-C-term domain binding IgG. Here we show that the magnitude of IgG responses to CSP NANP and C-term and HBsAg, and CSP antibody avidity, are significantly associated with RTS,S/AS01E vaccine efficacy. Our data show that IgG avidity to CSP C-term is important for RTS,S-induced protection against clinical malaria.</p>

The majority of subjects (94%) completed the 12-month post-vaccination follow-up time. The median time to drop out of the study was 118 days ranging from 5 to 340 days. Most early terminations were due to migration (33 subjects) or lost to follow-up (26 subjects). A total of 669 malaria clinical events were recorded during the follow-up time (24 in Bagamoyo, 241 in Kintampo and 404 in Nanoro). Of those, 48% were recorded in children and 66% first events occurred within the first six follow-up months. Vaccine efficacy within the first 12 months of follow-up for first (40%; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 29, 49%) and all (27%; 95% CI = 20, 33%) malaria events decreased with time (<italic>p</italic>-Schonfeld test = 0.04) and, as in the phase 3 RTS,S/AS01E trial, varied across age groups (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>).

                <p id="Par9">RTS,S/AS01E vaccination induced significant increase of IgG concentrations (EU mL<sup>−1</sup>) binding to CSP NANP and C-term at M3 compared to M0 (adjusted-<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001 comparing logarithm of RTS,S:comparator ratios estimated through mixed models) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). Percentage of responders was significantly higher in RTS,S-vaccinees (98% NANP, 99% C-term) when compared to comparators (9% NANP, 12% C-term) (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001, Pearson Chi-squared test). The concentration of CSP IgG in RTS,S compared to comparators at post-vaccination (M3) was on average 6000 times higher for NANP and 1600 times higher for C-term (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001 for both ratios). IgG concentration (geometric mean [GM]) and avidity index (AI) at M3 were 1652 and 0.39 for CSP NANP, respectively, and 1241 and 0.10 for C-term.

The magnitude of the change in antibodies from M0 to M3 was significantly greater in children than infants (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>): in infants IgG concentrations post-RTS,S vaccination increased from 4750 to 6300 while in children from 6470 to 25,353. Moreover, the changes from pre-vaccination to post-vaccination in children were approximately 10 times larger for NANP and 2.5 times larger for C-term responses than what was observed in the infants cohort. At M0, infants had significantly higher IgG concentrations of CSP NANP and C-term compared to children, most likely attributable to maternally-transferred antibodies (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3c</xref>). Higher baseline concentrations of CSP IgG were associated with lower M3 antibody concentrations and lower changes from pre-RTS,S to post-RTS,S vaccination (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>). Percentage sero-positivity did not differ significantly between age groups (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Effect of age cohort and site on RTS,S/AS01E immunogenicity.

              <p id="Par19">We demonstrate here that anti-CSP IgG concentrations and avidity are correlates of RTS,S induced-protection and that these are affected by age, site and baseline. Our findings confirm data from previous phase 3 analyses showing that RTS,S/AS01E vaccination elicits a potent IgG response to the immunodominant NANP and at higher concentrations in children than infants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Importantly, our study was designed and powered to detect immune correlates of protection and to assess the role of age at first vaccination and MTI on immunogenicity. We confirmed that anti-NANP CSP antibodies contribute to protection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> against first or recurrent malaria events during 12-months post-immunisation, adjusted by age, site, and also baseline antibodies. This is relevant because correlation between CSP IgG titres and protection against malaria has not always been consistent in previous phase 2b trials, as this association has been dependent on age and/or malaria endpoint (infection vs disease), among other factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par20">We expanded the analysis of CSP epitope targets by including the C-term domain. We demonstrated that RTS,S/AS01E vaccination induces IgG to this subdominant region and that despite their lower concentrations compared to anti-NANP, these antibodies were also associated with vaccine efficacy.</p>
              <p id="Par21">In addition, we assessed not only the magnitude but also the quality of vaccine-induced antibodies and their relevance to protection. Two field studies of RTS,S evaluated the avidity of anti-NANP CSP IgG in African children and found no correlation between M3 avidity and vaccine efficacy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. A challenge study in naïve adults showed an association between higher avidity and protection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Here, we showed that malaria-exposed children generated vaccine-induced antibodies with higher AI than infants. This suggests that, in addition to high concentrations, affinity matured antibodies that probably exert better biological functions confer protection against malaria. When multivariable Cox models were adjusted for the other CSP construct and/or the other metric (concentration or AI), the relationship between IgG recognising NANP and malaria protection was different from that of IgG to C-term. Notably, the association between C-term AI and malaria protection remained significant even after adjusting for NANP IgG concentration. Taken together, data indicated that for the NANP region, antibody concentration might be more important in protection than avidity, whereas for the C-term region, the opposite was observed. Indeed, exploratory data analyses pointed to different response patterns in concentrations vs avidities for C-term and NANP. Therefore, the association of one metric with malaria risk was not necessarily confounded by the other metric/antigen.</p>
              <p id="Par22">The magnitude of the HBsAg IgG response was also correlated with time to malaria event, in the first six months after vaccination. This finding could either reflect vaccine take as HBsAg is a component of RTS,S/AS0E, thus related to the correlation of anti-CSP and anti-HBsAg IgG titers (rho ≅ 0.7 in this and other studies)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, or might also reflect an impact of the HBsAg antigen on the affinity maturation of CSP-specific antibodies resembling the carbohydrate-based conjugate vaccines. As the biological relevance of such association remains unclear, mechanisms and implications for potential interactions between HBsAg and CSP specific responses will be the focus of future studies.</p>
              <p id="Par23">We confirmed that RTS,S/AS01E immunogenicity was higher in the children than in infants. Previous correlates analyses within the phase 3 trial found an association between high tertile M3 NANP IgG titres and vaccine efficacy over the long term follow-up (M30) in infants but not in children<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Here, in the analysis of factors affecting the association between antibody concentrations and malaria events, infants had an increased risk compared to children to acquire malaria. The higher antibody concentrations and AI in children compared to infants could partially explain why RTS,S is more efficacious in older ages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. The nature and kinetics of IgG affinity maturation to dominant (NANP) vs subdominant (C-term) epitopes could be different, and this may also impact the age-related pattern of association between antibodies and malaria protection.</p>
              <p id="Par24">Furthermore, we assessed if the concentration of baseline antibodies to RTS,S antigens affected the outcome of vaccination at the individual level. Presence of CSP antibodies at time of first vaccination due to maternally-transferred antibodies during the first months of life and/or to malaria exposure could impact RTS,S immunogenicity, and this may affect infants and children differentially. Indeed, baseline concentrations of anti-CSP IgG were higher in subjects from Nanoro than those in Kintampo or Bagamoyo. We have shown previously that baseline levels of CSP IgG in infants aged less than 10 months (thus presumably transferred in utero from the mother) correlate positively and significantly with baseline levels of IgG to <italic>P. falciparum</italic> antigens—therefore representing markers of malaria exposure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. In children older than 10 months, baseline CSP IgGs would likely be acquired upon infection and increase with age and MTI. A prior analysis of the effect of anti-NANP CSP IgG within the phase 3 trial reported that pre-vaccination titres were associated with lower RTS,S immunogenicity in infants and higher immunogenicity in children<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. We confirm a significant correlation between higher M0 and lower M3 CSP NANP IgG concentrations and expand this for C-term IgG. These associations were significant when infants and children were analysed together, but they were more prominent for NANP IgGs and for infants. Subjects who developed malaria during the 12-month follow-up period had higher concentrations of IgG CSP at baseline and induced lower concentrations of IgG at M3, thus the increments from M0 to M3 in the non-protected subjects were lower than in protected volunteers. Thus, naturally-acquired CSP antibodies (at M0, and at M3 in comparator vaccinees) were markers of exposure, while RTS,S/AS01E-induced CSP (M3) are markers of protection. Malaria episodes during the vaccination period were also associated with increased malaria risk post-vaccination. As malaria exposure may affect the phenotype and function of immune cells needed for antibody production, less exposed children at M0 appear able to generate higher responses at M3, and may benefit most from RTS,S vaccination. This may be important for the deployment of vaccines in general as prior parasite clearance may increase vaccine take.</p>
              <p id="Par25">Finally, we explored the effect on vaccination and protection of other anthropometric variables not analysed thus far. We found some associations for sex and WAZ, but patterns were not consistent to draw conclusions. The impact of nutrition on vaccine take merits further investigation in larger studies in case an intervention could improve effectiveness.</p>
              <p id="Par26">One limitation of our study design was that some baseline sera were missing, particularly for children from Nanoro, and thus we could not evaluate the baseline effects at the individual level in the whole study population. In addition, only 5–17-months-old children were enrolled at Bagamoyo for the immunology study as per local protocol. Thus, the findings related to site could be confounded by the effect of age. Therefore, further studies are warranted to assess in more depth the effect of maternally-transferred antibodies and exposure to other <italic>P. falciparum</italic> antigens at baseline in relation to M3 peak and long-term maintenance of responses.</p>
              <p id="Par27">In conclusion, we generated data on RTS,S/AS01E immunogenicity including the C-term of CSP and evaluated antibody avidity as a quality index essential for immune effector mechanisms. While our current efforts are devoted to better define the type and subclasses of antibodies elicited by RTS,S vaccination, next steps include the assessment of the functionality of CSP-specific IgGs in regards to protection, and the evaluation of the response kinetics with and without a fourth booster dose at month 20. The elucidation of the mechanisms underlying RTS,S/AS01E-induced partial protection is essential for guiding rational development and deployment of next generation vaccines.</p>

                <p id="Par28">This ancillary immunology study (MAL067) was nested in the phase 3 RTS,S/AS01E randomised controlled trial (MAL055, ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00866619) conducted between 2009 and 2014 in sub-Saharan African countries with differing MTIs, including two age cohorts: infants aged 6–12 weeks and children aged 5–17 months at first vaccine dose. Volunteers were vaccinated with either a comparator vaccine or a course of three doses of RTS,S/AS01E given at study months 0, 1 and 2 (M0, M1, and M2). Serum or plasma was collected at baseline (M0), and approximately 30 days after the third vaccine dose (M3). Samples selected were from a subset of 1028 subjects enrolled in 3 out of 7 trial sites participating in the MAL067 study (Kintampo-Ghana, Nanoro-Burkina Faso, Bagamoyo-Tanzania) and had (i) one-year cumulative incidence high enough to yield 80% power to detect moderate HRs, (ii) available M3 samples from infants and children (only children in Bagamoyo as per local protocol), and (iii) varying MTI (Kintampo moderate-high, Nanoro high-seasonal, Bagamoyo low)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. These three sites were prioritized because they collectively fulfilled the above criteria due to availability of sufficient numbers and volumes of samples to address the study objectives. The follow-up by passive case detection (PCD) for clinical malaria events (fever ≥ 37.5 °C and parasitaemia of any density) was defined for the 12 months starting 14 days after the third vaccine dose.

The C-term peptide covered 66 amino acids (Ahx-EPSDKHIKEYLNKIQNSLSTEWSPCSVTCGNGIQVRIKPGSANKPKDELDYANDIEKKICKMEKCS-NH<sub>2</sub>).

                <title>ELISA assays</title>
                <p id="Par30">IgG titration and avidity assays were performed on the same plate at IAVI-HIL. Each plate included 6 samples run in two sets of duplicates and 2-step 12-fold serial dilutions (1:50, 1:600, 1:7200). Antigen-specific standard curves were implemented using monoclonal antibodies of known concentration (μg mL<sup>−1</sup>) (provided by PATH-MVI) specific to either C-term or NANP. Curves were assayed in duplicate and 9-step 3-fold serial dilutions starting at 1:200. Positive, negative and blank controls were assayed in each plate in duplicate. Negative control sera were obtained from healthy adults living in non-endemic malaria areas (seronegative for CSP). The positivity threshold was defined as the mean + 2 standard deviations (SD) of the negative controls (C-term = 2.95 EU mL<sup>−1</sup>, NANP = 1.78 EU mL<sup>−1</sup>). Positive controls were a pool of serum samples from RTS,S/AS01-vaccinated individuals (provided by GSK). Acceptance limits were established prior to processing samples based on Westgard rules for this positive control.</p>
                <p id="Par31">The indirect ELISA was performed using 1:6000 rabbit anti-human IgG HRP conjugate (DAKO, Cat No P0214), Sureblue TMB Peroxidase substrate (KPL, Cat No 52-00-02) and TMB Stop Solution (KPL, Cat No 50-85-06). For the avidity assay, 1 set of test samples and positive control duplicate wells were incubated for 30 min with a chaotropic agent (1 M Ammonium thiocyanate, Cat No 12960594, Fisher Scientific, UK), whilst the 2nd set of the same samples in duplicate wells on the plate were incubated with buffer alone. IgG concentration was reported in EU mL<sup>−1</sup> units. The AI was defined as the ratio of interpolated IgG EU mL<sup>−1</sup> after incubating with chaotropic agent divided by the equivalent value from the ELISA assay without chaotropic agent and multiplied by 100. Standards, negative controls and blanks were also incubated in buffer and were not treated with chaotropic agent. For the analysis of AI, we only included samples which anti-CSP IgG concentrations were above the assay lower limits of quantification (LLOQ) provided by IAVI-HIL (for NANP &gt; 1.43 EU mL<sup>−1</sup> and for C-term &gt; 2.79 EU mL<sup>−1</sup>).</p>

                <title>Data analysis</title>
                <p id="Par32">For the descriptive analysis of demographic, clinical, and other characteristics of subjects between RTS,S/AS01E and comparator vaccinees, categorical variables were compared through summary statistics, Pearson Chi-square or Fisher tests, and continuous variables through <italic>t</italic>-tests or Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, as appropriate. Graphical and basic exploratory comparisons between vaccination groups were done through boxplots and <italic>t</italic>-tests (Welch corrected). Associations between antibodies to different antigens were sought through linear regression and correlation coefficients.</p>
                <p id="Par33">Mixed linear models investigated the effect of the vaccine on the logarithm<sub>10</sub>-transformed IgG concentrations for each antigen at M3 and change of concentrations from M0 to M3 through tests of the corresponding fixed effects (via combinations of the estimated coefficients), including random intercept and interaction terms. Additionally, in those models, we considered adjustments for age cohorts and sites and compared the effect of vaccination on changes of IgG concentrations from M0 to M3 and on concentrations at M3 across age cohorts and sites through interaction tests.</p>
                <p id="Par34">The impact of age cohort and site on AI focused on antibodies at M3, only in RTS,S vaccinees with anti-CSP IgG concentrations greater than the LLOQ. Analysis was based on correlation, linear regression, and <italic>t</italic>-tests of log<sub>10</sub> AI.</p>
                <p id="Par35">Assessment of the impact of IgG concentration and AI on protection was primarily based on time to first clinical malaria event following the parent trial main endpoint but, as a secondary endpoint, recurrent malaria events were analysed. First, Kaplan–Meier time-to-event estimates were compared across tertile-based categories of antibody responses within vaccination groups through log-rank tests. In Kaplan–Meier analysis of AI, only samples with IgG concentration above the LLOQ were included. Second, the effect of each M3 continuous IgG response (CSPs and HBsAg concentrations; AI CSPs) on the prevention of clinical malaria was assessed by proportional hazard models that used Anderson and Gill approach when including recurrent events as the outcome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Given prior publications suggesting that vaccine efficacy started declining 3–6 months after vaccination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, we were concerned that the protection conferred by IgGs could wane and be time-varying, assuming that antibodies mediated the effect of RTS,S/AS01E vaccine efficacy (or were surrogates). Therefore, the assumption of proportional hazards or constant hazard ratio over follow-up time was assessed through tests of Schoenfeld residuals. When the proportional hazards assumption was rejected, the functional representation of the hazard over time that resulted in the best model fitness was chosen. Optimality of model fitness was based on Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). In analysis of time to first event, only IgG C-term concentration would require use of time-varying hazards and, thus, for simplicity of reporting, a constant hazard was forced in. In analyses of recurrent events, an exponential hazard over time attained the lowest AIC and, thus, yielded optimal model fitness. Moreover, the HR between age cohort and recurrent clinical malaria as a function of time categorized at 167–186 days, attained an optimal fit. We chose to adjust models for age categorized at 180 days or 6 months in all models, for simplicity. We reported graphically the time-varying hazard ratio for recurrent events of increased antibody responses.</p>
                <p id="Par36">Concentration of IgG to HBsAg from participants with M3 samples available (162 [52%] from Kintampo and 277 [62%] from Nanoro) was obtained from the MAL055 trial database and used to analyse the association between HBsAg antibody titres and malaria vaccine efficacy in this study. Analyses of the hazard of recurrent clinical malaria episodes attained optimal fitness per AIC with HBsAg as a piecewise exponential function split at around 180 follow-up days, depending on the model. Again, for simplicity and given reports of waning vaccine efficacy at about 180 days, we chose to standardize models in a split at 180 follow-up days.</p>
                <p id="Par37">In all regression models we considered adjustments for candidate confounders: sex, WAZ, height-for-age <italic>Z</italic>-score (HAZ), reported clinical malaria prior to vaccination, and malaria transmission season, defined according to the rainy months at the time of M3 sample collection: high for Bagamoyo March–May and November–December, for Nanoro July–December, and for Kintampo April–October. Linearity of associations with continuous covariates was evaluated through penalized splines in generalized additive models (GAM) and no variable was deemed non-linearly associated. Covariates statistically significant to a 0.05 level or that impacted the coefficient of IgG concentration or AI were retained in final adjusted models. As a result, no covariate other than age and site, were kept in proportional hazards models. All analyses were stratified by vaccination group and, in regression models we considered stratification by age cohorts and site when interaction terms were significant to a 0.05 alpha-level. When analysing immunogenicity and comparing sites, <italic>p</italic>-values were corrected for multiple testing through Benjamini-Hochberg and considered significant if &lt;0.05. Analyses were conducted using R v3.4.0 using the functions detailed under code availability below. Further statistical methodological details are provided in the Supplementary Methods.</p>
