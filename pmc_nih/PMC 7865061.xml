                <p id="Par1">Sarcomatoid and rhabdoid (S/R) renal cell carcinoma (RCC) are highly aggressive tumors with limited molecular and clinical characterization. Emerging evidence suggests immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) are particularly effective for these tumors, although the biological basis for this property is largely unknown. Here, we evaluate multiple clinical trial and real-world cohorts of S/R RCC to characterize their molecular features, clinical outcomes, and immunologic characteristics. We find that S/R RCC tumors harbor distinctive molecular features that may account for their aggressive behavior, including <italic>BAP1</italic> mutations, <italic>CDKN2A</italic> deletions, and increased expression of <italic>MYC</italic> transcriptional programs. We show that these tumors are highly responsive to ICI and that they exhibit an immune-inflamed phenotype characterized by immune activation, increased cytotoxic immune infiltration, upregulation of antigen presentation machinery genes, and PD-L1 expression. Our findings build on prior work and shed light on the molecular drivers of aggressivity and responsiveness to ICI of S/R RCC.</p>

              <p id="Par3">Sarcomatoid and rhabdoid (S/R) renal cell carcinoma (RCC) are among the most aggressive forms of kidney cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Sarcomatoid and rhabdoid features represent forms of dedifferentiation of RCC tumors and can occur in the same tumor or independently of each other<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. These features can develop over any background RCC histology, including clear cell, papillary, and chromophobe RCC. These tumors account for 10–15% of RCC and most patients with S/R RCC present with metastatic disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. While classic RCC therapies such as VEGF and mTOR targeted therapies are largely ineffective for these tumors, multiple clinical studies suggest that immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) may have significant clinical activity in sarcomatoid and rhabdoid RCC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Prior studies have hinted that these tumors may harbor distinctive molecular features, although these studies were limited by small sample sizes, restricted molecular analyses, leading to discordant conclusions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par4">To define the molecular properties underlying the S/R clinical subtype and determine their relationship to potentially enhanced response to ICI, we perform an expanded clinical and molecular integrated characterization of S/R RCC in both clinical trial and real-world cohorts, assessing clinical outcomes on ICI, genomic and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for PD-L1, immunofluorescence (IF)-based assessment of immune infiltration, and transcriptomic evaluation of sarcomatoid cell lines (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Genomic characterization of S/R RCC reveals distinctive genomic features.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Overview of the clinical, molecular, and cell line data.

                <title>S/R RCC tumors harbor distinctive genomic features</title>
                <p id="Par5">We first evaluated the genomic landscape of S/R RCC (total <italic>N</italic> = 208) in three distinct cohorts (two whole exome sequencing [WES] and 1 gene panel sequencing cohort [OncoPanel]) and compared it to that of non-S/R RCC (total <italic>N</italic> = 1565; Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">1</xref>). This DNA-sequencing cohort included one clinical trial WES cohort (CheckMate cohort; 69 S/R and 342 non-S/R), a retrospective analysis of an institutional panel-based sequencing cohort (OncoPanel cohort; 79 S/R and 395 non-S/R), and a retrospective pathologic review and analysis of a publicly available cohort (TCGA cohort; 60 S/R and 828 non-S/R). The most commonly altered genes in S/R RCC (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>) were generally similar to those previously reported for RCC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. We subsequently compared the genomic features of S/R RCC tumors to background histology-matched non-S/R RCC tumors across the three cohorts. Tumor mutational burden (TMB), total indel load, and frameshift indel load were overall similar between S/R RCC and non-S/R RCC tumors (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2a–c</xref>). While the frameshift indel load was significantly increased (<italic>p</italic> = 0.024) in S/R vs. non-S/R RCC in the OncoPanel cohort, the absolute difference was small (S/R vs. non-S/R means: 1.32 vs. 0.85 frameshift indels/Mb) and was not corroborated in the two WES cohorts (CheckMate and TCGA; Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2c</xref>).</p>
                <p id="Par6">Next, gene-specific alteration rates were compared between S/R and non-S/R RCC in each of the three cohorts independently and in combination (Methods). <italic>BAP1</italic> and <italic>NF2</italic> somatic alterations were significantly and consistently enriched in S/R compared to non-S/R RCC, whereas <italic>KDM5C</italic> somatic alterations were significantly less frequent in S/R compared to non-S/R RCC (Fisher’s exact <italic>q</italic> &lt; 0.05; Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref> and Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>CDKN2A</italic> and <italic>CDKN2B</italic> deep deletions as well as <italic>EZH2</italic> and <italic>KMT2C</italic> high amplifications were significantly enriched in S/R compared to non-S/R (Fisher’s exact <italic>q</italic> &lt; 0.05 and consistent across at least two of the three included datasets; Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref> and Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Other genes that were significantly amplified (low or high amplification) included <italic>MYC</italic> and <italic>CCNE1</italic>, whereas those that were significantly deleted (shallow or deep deletion) included <italic>RB1</italic> and <italic>NF2</italic> (Fisher’s exact <italic>q</italic> &lt; 0.05). Although recent reports have suggested that genes in the 9p24.1 locus (including <italic>CD274</italic>, <italic>JAK2</italic>, and <italic>PCD1LG2</italic> genes) were more frequently amplified in RCC tumors with sarcomatoid features<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, we did not observe focal amplifications to be enriched at this locus in these cohorts (Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Moreover, differences between S/R and non-S/R RCC were generally consistent regardless of background histology (clear cell or non-clear cell; Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">2</xref>).</p>
                <p id="Par7">Since the analyses in this study are based on single region sampling of S/R RCC tumors and since such sampling has been shown to affect the detection rate of mutations in RCC tumors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, we next compared the intra-tumoral heterogeneity (ITH) index between S/R and non-S/R RCC tumors (Methods). We found that the ITH index was not significantly different between these two groups of tumors in the CheckMate cohort (<italic>p</italic> = 0.48). Furthermore, this observation was corroborated in a re-analysis of the TRACERx Renal study, whereby the ITH index did not differ between S and non-S RCC tumors (<italic>p</italic> = 0.21; Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3a</xref>). Moreover, among 71 S/R RCC tumors in the OncoPanel cohort (of a total of 79 S/R RCC tumors) for which the portion of the tumor that was sequenced was assessable, 44 tumors had the S/R (mesenchymal) regions sequenced and 27 had the non-S/R (epithelioid) regions of the tumor sequenced. These two subsets of tumors were compared and no significant overall mutation/indel load (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3b</xref>) or gene-level mutational (Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">3</xref>) differences were found, other than a marginal but statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> = 0.042) increase in the number of frameshift indels in mesenchymal regions. In addition, panel sequencing mutation data from 23 sarcomatoid tumors that had been laser micro-dissected (into sarcomatoid and epithelioid components) and sequenced separately from the study by Malouf et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> was re-analyzed. In accordance, with the above findings no significant overall mutation/indel load (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3c</xref>) or gene-level mutational (Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">3</xref>) differences were found. However, it should be noted that alteration frequency for certain genes differed between mesenchymal and epithelioid portions of S/R RCC tumors (Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">3</xref>). While certain mutations may be enriched in these tumors (in particular <italic>TP53</italic> mutations, as has been previously suggested<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>), none rose to the level of statistical significance in our cohort. Overall, our results suggest that the mutational differences between S/R and non-S/R RCC tumors are more pronounced than intra-tumoral mutational differences between mesenchymal and epithelioid portions of a given S/R RCC tumor. S/R RCC tumors have a distinctive genomic profile characterized by an enrichment for genomic alterations previously associated with poor prognosis in RCC (such as <italic>BAP1</italic> and <italic>CDKN2A</italic>) and genomic alterations that may represent therapeutic targets in S/R RCC (<italic>CDKN2A</italic> and <italic>CDKN2B</italic> deletions, <italic>EZH2</italic> amplifications, and <italic>NF2</italic> mutations).</p>

                <title>Transcriptomic programs of S/R RCC underpin their poor prognosis</title>
                <p id="Par8">We next assessed transcriptomic programs in S/R RCC and their relationship to the known poor prognosis of this subtype. We compared RNA-seq data between S/R (total <italic>N</italic> = 98) and non-S/R RCC (total <italic>N</italic> = 1077) in the TCGA (publicly available; 59 S/R and 830 non-S/R) and CheckMate (39 S/R and 247 non-S/R) cohorts independently (Methods; Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">4</xref>) using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Twelve gene sets were upregulated (GSEA <italic>q</italic> &lt; 0.25) in S/R compared to non-S/R RCC in the two cohorts independently, including cell cycle programs, genes regulated by <italic>MYC</italic>, and apoptosis programs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>; Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">5</xref>). Specific upregulated gene sets may account for their morphological features including their mesenchymal appearance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> (upregulation of epithelial-mesenchymal-transition [EMT]) and frequent co-occurrence of necrosis (endoplasmic reticulum [ER] stress and apoptosis-caspase pathway)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, and rapid progression (E2F targets, G2/M checkpoint, mitotic spindle assembly). Moreover, high <italic>MYC</italic> targets version 1 (v1) expression as quantified by single sample GSEA (ssGSEA) scores<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> significantly correlated with worse clinical outcomes in both the subset of patients with S/R in the anti-PD-1 (nivolumab) arm of the CheckMate cohort as well as the subgroup of stage IV S/R RCC patients in TCGA independently (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>; Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>; Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">6</xref>). Of note, the majority of founder gene sets of both the <italic>MYC</italic> v1 and v2 “Hallmark” gene were enriched in S/R RCC (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5a</xref>), further corroborating the fact that <italic>MYC</italic>-regulated transcriptional programs are enriched in S/R RCC. Moreover, the correlation with outcomes within S/R RCC of the <italic>MYC</italic> v1 score was consistent when the <italic>MYC</italic>-regulated transcriptional program was measured using the separate but related <italic>MYC</italic> v2 “Hallmark” gene set (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5b, c</xref>). Patients with non-S/R RCC and <italic>MYC</italic> v1 scores similar to those of S/R RCC (above the median of the S/R RCC group for <italic>MYC</italic> v1) had significantly worse outcomes in both the TCGA and CheckMate PD-1 cohorts (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>; Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>; Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">6)</xref>.

                <p id="Par9">Extending from the Hallmark GSEA analysis, 243 genes had significantly increased expression in S/R compared to non-S/R RCC independently across the two cohorts, including multiple cell cycle and proliferation (<italic>CCNB1, CDC45, CDC6, CDCA3, CDCA7, CDCA8, CDK6</italic>, and <italic>MKI67</italic>), immune <italic>(HIVEP3, IFI16, IFI35, IL15RA, and LAG3)</italic>, and metastasis-implicated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> (<italic>ACTB, ANLN, ARPC1B, ARPC5</italic>, and <italic>ARPC5L, CD44)</italic> genes as well as chemokine (<italic>CXCL9</italic>) and antigen presenting machinery (<italic>TAP1, TAP2, CALR, PSMA5, PSMB10, PSMB4, PSMC2, PSME2</italic>) genes that may be driving the immune infiltration in these tumors (Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM10" ref-type="media">7</xref>). Since the overexpression of antigen presentation machinery genes has been found to correlate with increased cytotoxic immune infiltration and ICI responsiveness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, we further explored the antigen presentation machinery genes using four dedicated REACTOME<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> and KEGG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> gene sets and found all four to be significantly increased in both the CheckMate and TCGA cohorts independently (Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">5</xref>).

                <p id="Par11">Given the significant sensitivity of S/R RCC to ICI as reflected by improved responses and survival outcomes, we examined molecular features that may drive this phenotype.

CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell infiltration, CD8<sup>+</sup>/CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell ratio, activated/resting NK cell ratio, M1 macrophages, M1/M2 macrophage ratio, as well as the Th1 score were all significantly increased (Mann–Whitney <italic>q</italic> &lt; 0.05) in S/R RCC in both cohorts independently (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S6a</xref>; Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM12" ref-type="media">9</xref>).

                <p id="Par12">The immune-inflamed phenotype of S/R RCC tumors was further corroborated by an immunohistochemistry (IHC; N of S/R = 118 and N of non-S/R = 691) assay showing significantly increased PD-L1 (cut-off of ≥1%) expression on tumor cells in S/R compared to non-S/R tumors (43.2% vs. 21.0%; Fisher’s exact <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001; Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref> and Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM13" ref-type="media">10</xref>) in the CheckMate cohort. To evaluate whether the elevated PD-L1 expression in S/R RCC is driven by PD-L1 gene amplification, as previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, we compared IHC-based PD-L1 expression by <italic>CD274</italic> (or PD-L1) gene copy number status (<italic>N</italic> = 63 patients in the S/R CheckMate cohort). We found that S/R tumors had increased PD-L1 expression (relatively to non-S/R RCC) independent of <italic>CD274</italic> copy number status (any deletion, amplification, or neither; all deletions were one-copy deletions); although the three S/R patients with <italic>CD274</italic> gene amplification (1 patient with high amplification and 2 with low amplifications) all expressed PD-L1 by IHC above the cut-off of ≥1%. Moreover, <italic>CD274</italic> copy number status did not correlate with clinical outcomes in patients treated with a PD-1 inhibitor (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S10a–c</xref>). The immune-inflamed phenotype of S/R RCC tumors was also evaluated by IF staining for CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in a subset of the CheckMate cohort (N of S/R = 29 and N of non-S/R = 186; Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S6b, c</xref> and Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM13" ref-type="media">10</xref>). CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell infiltration at the tumor invasive margin, which had been reported to be associated with response to ICI-based therapies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, tended to be increased in these tumors (although the difference was not statistically significant, Mann–Whitney <italic>p</italic> = 0.14). To further evaluate the immune microenvironment of S/R RCC tumors, we used immune/stroma signatures that are specific to RCC (empirical tumor microenvironment [eTME] signatures), as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. In accordance with our other analyses, we found the eTME signatures tended to be enriched in S/R compared to non-S/R RCC (statistically significant for both the 20-fold and 3-fold signatures in the TCGA cohort and not significant in the CheckMate cohort; Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S6d, e</xref>). Since <italic>BAP1</italic> mutations are enriched in S/R RCC tumors in this study and have been previously associated with immune infiltration and inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, we evaluated whether the immune findings reported in this study are only driven by <italic>BAP1</italic> mutations. In a sensitivity analysis excluding all <italic>BAP1</italic> mutants (from the S/R and non-S/R RCC) groups, the immune findings reported in this study were found to be largely consistent with the results of the primary analysis, suggesting that the immune findings of the current study in S/R RCC tumors are not solely driven by <italic>BAP1</italic> mutations (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S11</xref>). Taken together, S/R RCC tumors are highly responsive to ICI-based therapies and an immune-inflamed microenvironment in S/R RCC may be driving these responses in a manner that is not completely dependent on BAP1, leading to improved survival on ICI.</p>

                <title>Sarcomatoid cell lines recapitulate the biology of S/R RCC tumors</title>
                <p id="Par13">To evaluate which transcriptomic programs enriched in S/R RCC tumors were attributable to sarcomatoid cancer cells rather than the microenvironment, we compared baseline RNA-seq data from 6 distinct sarcomatoid kidney cancer cell lines and 9 distinct non-sarcomatoid kidney cancer cell lines (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S12a, b</xref>; Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM14" ref-type="media">11</xref>). The transcriptional profile observed from the bulk profiling of tumors was partially recapitulated in the cell lines, with EMT and apoptosis-caspase pathway genes significantly enriched in sarcomatoid cell lines compared with non-sarcomatoid cell lines (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S12b</xref>). Given the shared transcriptional programs between sarcomatoid tumors and cell lines, we then sought to nominate candidate pathways that might reflect selective dependencies of sarcomatoid tumor cells. For this exploratory analysis, we interrogated publicly available data from 20 kidney cancer cell lines with both baseline RNA-seq and cell line drug response data. Among this group of 20 kidney cancer cell lines screened with 437 compounds of diverse mechanisms of action, we found EMT and apoptosis-caspase pathway ssGSEA scores most strongly correlated with sensitivity to cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKi; Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S12c</xref>; Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM14" ref-type="media">11</xref>) and compared favorably to other classic therapeutic targets in RCC such as VEGF and mTOR inhibitors, consistent with the poor response of S/R RCC tumors to these agents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. In an attempt to corroborate these findings we focused on two CDKi agents, SNS-032 and alvocidib, that displayed a strong correlation of their sensitivity profiles with the EMT and apoptosis-caspase signature scores in CTRP (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S12</xref>; Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S13a, b</xref>; Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM14" ref-type="media">11</xref>). In an independent in silico analysis of the recently published PRISM cell line drug screen dataset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>, a similar relationship between sensitivity to CDKi and the EMT and apoptosis signatures was found for alvocidib and other CDKi (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S13a</xref>; Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM13" ref-type="media">10</xref>; SNS-032 was not tested in the PRISM dataset). SNS-032, alvocidib, and a VEGF inhibitor control agent (axitinib) were also separately evaluated in two sarcomatoid RCC cell lines (UOK127 and RCJ41-T2; not included in the CTRP or PRISM screens) and three non-sarcomatoid RCC cell lines (Caki-2, KMRC-20, and KMRC-2; included in the CTRP or PRISM screens). Although the relative sensitivities for the non-sarcomatoid cell lines determined in CTRP/PRISM globally mirrored relative sensitivities upon validation, we did not observe marked differential sensitivity between sarcomatoid and non-sarcomatoid cell lines for any of the 3 agents tested (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S14</xref>).</p>

              <p id="Par14">The current study represents a large integrative molecular and clinical characterization of S/R RCC, including clinical outcomes on ICI therapies and non-ICI controls from both clinical trial and retrospective cohorts, DNA and RNA-sequencing data, IHC and IF-based assessment of the immune microenvironment, and the molecular profiling of cell line models of the disease. We show that S/R RCC tumors are highly responsive to ICIs, harbor distinctive genomic alterations, a characteristic transcriptional program characterized by the enrichment of <italic>MYC</italic>-regulated genes that correlates with poor outcomes, and a heavily inflamed microenvironment enriched in features that have been associated with ICI responses.</p>
              <p id="Par15">Our genomic findings corroborate those of prior studies that reported significant enrichment of Hippo pathway (which includes the <italic>NF2</italic> gene) mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> in S vs non-S RCC tumors and <italic>BAP1</italic> mutations in S and R RCC tumors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. While <italic>CDKN2A</italic> alterations have been reported in S RCC tumors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, these alterations are also present in non-S/R RCC tumors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. However, the current study established <italic>CDKN2A/B</italic> deep deletions as specifically enriched in S/R compared to non-S/R RCC tumors as well as depletion in <italic>KDM5C</italic> mutations and enrichment in <italic>EZH2</italic> amplifications in S/R RCC tumors. Moreover, S/R RCC tumors were not found to consistently harbor a significantly increased rate of mutations, indels, or frameshift indels compared with non-S/R RCC tumors.</p>
              <p id="Par16">S/R RCC tumors are rapidly proliferating tumors that are associated with poor prognosis and rapid clinical progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. While prior studies had identified multiple clinical and pathological factors that are associated with prognosis in patients with S/R RCC tumors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>, the molecular drivers of aggressivity of S/R RCC tumors had largely been unexplored. Here, we show that multiple molecular pathways implicated in cell cycle regulation and invasiveness as well as <italic>MYC</italic>-regulated genes are enriched in S/R RCC tumors and that the enrichment in <italic>MYC</italic>-regulated genes correlates with poor prognosis. These results suggest that <italic>MYC</italic>-regulated transcriptional programs are key factors driving the aggressivity and poor prognosis associated with S/R RCC tumors.</p>
              <p id="Par17">A previous study in genetically engineered mouse models had found that <italic>MYC</italic> activation with <italic>CDKN2A</italic> deletion and <italic>VHL</italic> deletion together produce kidney tumors that closely resemble human clear cell RCC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. While the authors of that study did not report histological patterns that resembled sarcomatoid and rhabdoid features, it is likely that these features are necessary but not sufficient to produce S/R features, and that other genomic and epigenomic features are needed to produce these aggressive tumors.</p>
              <p id="Par18">While prior studies have largely reported on tumors with sarcomatoid features, the different cohorts of this study highlight that rhabdoid features frequently co-occur with sarcomatoid features (10-20% of S/R RCC tumors). In addition, tumors harboring rhabdoid features alone are also relatively frequent (5-25% of S/R RCC tumors). In this study, the molecular features of S, R, and S + R (harboring both features concurrently) tumors were not found to be significantly different (Figure <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref> and Figures <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S7</xref>-<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S9</xref>). However, detecting smaller effect sizes in these comparisons was limited by the relatively small sample sizes of the R and S + R groups.</p>
              <p id="Par19">The preliminary clinical outcomes of the subgroups of patients with S RCC from four large randomized clinical trials of the first line treatment of metastatic RCC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> reported ORRs ranging between 46.8% and 58.8% for patients with S RCC treated with first line ICI combinations, with a significant clinical benefit compared to the non-ICI control arms (sunitinib in all four trials). These results for ICI arms are numerically superior to those reported in the current study (ORR range 24.1-36.1% in ICI arms). Multiple potential factors could account for the increased effectiveness observed in these subgroup analyses of phase III randomized controlled trials, compared to the findings in the three cohorts included in the current study. Indeed, the ICI arms in these studies were combination therapies (either PD-1 inhibitor + CTLA-4 inhibitor or PD-(L)1 + VEGF inhibitor) and all patients were being treated in the first line setting (and therefore not previously refractory to other therapies). In the current study, patients with S/R RCC derived significant clinical benefit from ICI regimens while having been treated by various different ICI regimens (entirely ICI monotherapy in the CheckMate cohort and with a large proportion of ICI monotherapy in the IMDC and Harvard cohorts; Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM10" ref-type="media">7</xref>) and across different lines of therapy in each of the three cohorts (with a substantial proportion in the second line and beyond). Our findings, derived from three independent cohorts, suggest that S/R RCC tumors derive benefit from ICI regimens even outside of the setting evaluated in the subgroup analyses of the above-mentioned phase III trials (first line ICI combination regimens).</p>
              <p id="Par20">These recent data indicating that S RCC tumors are highly responsive to ICI have generated interest in determining the underpinnings of this responsiveness. Prior studies had suggested that S RCC tumors had increased tumor PD-L1 expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup> and infiltration by CD8+ T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. These findings contrasted with another study that had reported that TGFβ signaling, which has been associated with immune exclusion and resistance to ICIs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>, was significantly increased in S RCC tumors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. More recently, two studies found that <italic>CD274</italic> (or PD-L1) gene amplifications are present in S RCC tumors and suggested that this genomic alteration may be underlying the increased PD-L1 tumor expression in these tumors and hypothesized that this genomic amplification may be underlying the immune responsiveness of S RCC tumors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. In the present study, the integrative analysis of WES, RNA-seq, tumor PD-L1 expression by IHC, tumor CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell infiltration by IF, and clinical outcomes on ICI monotherapy from pre-treatment samples of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma on two clinical trials (CheckMate 010 and CheckMate 025) allowed the in-depth examination of the immune characteristics of these tumors. The present study corroborated the finding of increased PD-L1 tumor cell expression in S/R RCC and found that CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell infiltration tended to be increased in these tumors. We did not find <italic>CD274</italic> gene focal amplification to be enriched in these tumors compared to non-S/R RCC tumors. The small number of S/R RCC tumors that harbored <italic>CD274</italic> gene amplification and had PD-L1 expression data available all expressed tumor cell PD-L1. However, the increased expression of tumor cell PD-L1 in S/R RCC tumors and the responsiveness of these tumors to PD-1 inhibitor monotherapy appeared to be independent of <italic>CD274</italic> gene amplification (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S10a–c</xref>). In addition, the analysis of two independent cohorts of RCC with RNA-seq (CheckMate and TCGA), revealed multiple previously unreported characteristics of the immune contexture of these tumors. First, all 8 “Hallmark” immune gene sets (but not the “Hallmark” TGFβ gene set), including IL6-JAK-STAT3 signaling and interferon gamma response, were enriched in S/R RCC tumors. Second, immune deconvolution revealed that multiple immune subsets that have previously been associated with an immune responsive microenvironment are significantly increased in S/R RCC tumors, including M1 macrophages, activated NK cells, and the Th1 T cell subset. These findings were also found to be largely consistent across S and R RCC subsets (Supplementary Figs. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S8-9</xref>). Third, the expression of antigen presentation machinery genes, which has been found to correlate with increased cytotoxic immune infiltration and ICI responsiveness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, were significantly increased in S/R RCC tumors (Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">5</xref> and Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM10" ref-type="media">7</xref>).</p>
              <p id="Par21">In order to evaluate whether sarcomatoid cell line models recapitulate the biology of S/R RCC tumors, we compared the transcriptional profiles of 6 sarcomatoid cell lines to 9 non-sarcomatoid cell lines. Although less statistically powered to detect similar effect sizes to those observed in the bulk tumor S/R vs. non-S/R RCC comparison (due to a smaller sample size), the transcriptional programs of these cell lines partially recapitulated the biology of S/R RCC tumors. In particular, EMT and apoptosis-caspase pathway gene sets were significantly enriched in both S/R RCC tumors and sarcomatoid cell lines. These results suggest that at least some of the transcriptional findings reported in this study for S/R RCC are driven by the sarcomatoid tumor cells themselves and that sarcomatoid cell lines could serve as adequate models for these tumors in future therapeutic development efforts for this RCC subtype. Since the transcriptional programs of cell lines have been suggested to be most predictive of their sensitivity profiles (as opposed to other molecular features)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>, these two signatures were then projected into two independent cell line drug screen datasets (CTRP and PRISM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. Sensitivity to CDK inhibitors appeared to correlate strongly with EMT and apoptosis-caspase pathway signatures in both datasets independently (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S12-13</xref> and Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM14" ref-type="media">11</xref>). The CDK inhibitors that scored in these analyses target multiple CDKs, including those involved in transcription and cell cycle progression. We tested two CDKi (SNS-032 and alvocidib) along with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor control (axitinib) in two sarcomatoid and three non-sarcomatoid cell lines. The two sarcomatoid cell lines displayed decreased sensitivity to axitinib (a VEGF pathway inhibitor) as compared with the non-sarcomatoid cell line with the lowest EMT ssGSEA score, KMRC-20 (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S12b</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S14c</xref>), underscoring the limited response to this inhibitor of this canonical clear cell RCC pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup> in these sarcomatoid cell lines. Sarcomatoid and non-sarcomatoid RCC cell lines showed globally similar sensitivities to the two CDKis tested in our assay. The overall sensitivity of both sarcomatoid and non-sarcomatoid RCC lines to the two CDKis tested may be explained by the specificities of the particular drugs tested as well as the plasticity in EMT gene expression program, even among non-S/R RCCs, that may modulate sensitivity to this class of agents. Study of the precise molecular determinants of response to these and other classes of therapeutic agents in S/R RCC is a ripe area for future investigation.</p>
              <p id="Par22">A limitation of this study is the potential bias induced by the inherent heterogeneity of S/R RCC tumors. Foci of sarcomatoid and rhabdoid features can be present anywhere within RCC tumors. When these tumors are being evaluated by pathologists, these foci of S/R features can be missed and S/R RCC tumors could be mis-classified as non-S/R RCC. In this study, we reviewed the pathology reports and slides of tumors (Methods) to attempt to minimize such misclassifications. Moreover, any biases due to misclassification would be expected to decrease the power of this study to detect an effect, thereby potentially increasing the risk of false negative but not false positive findings. In addition to misclassification, intra-tumoral histological heterogeneity (sarcomatoid/rhabdoid vs epithelioid foci within the same S/R RCC tumor in a patient) could also be associated with intra-tumoral molecular heterogeneity. In this study, using data from the present study and previously published studies, we find that the intra-tumoral mutational heterogeneity of S/R RCC tumors seems to be largely similar to that of non-S/R RCC tumors. In accordance with prior studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, we find that mutations in certain genes (in particular <italic>TP53</italic>) may be enriched in S/R components of S/R RCC tumors. However, our overall analysis results suggest that mutational differences between S/R and non-S/R RCC tumors are greater than intra-tumoral mutational differences within S/R RCC tumors. The drivers of intra-tumoral histological heterogeneity require further evaluation and could be further investigated using novel single cell (DNA and/or RNA) and spatial transcriptomic methods. We additionally acknowledge that the data used in this study originated from cohorts that differed in the types of samples used (such as frozen tissue vs. formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded) and sequencing platform (panel vs. WES). Despite this heterogeneity, the differences between S/R and non-S/R RCC tumors were found to be consistent across the different cohorts.</p>
              <p id="Par23">In conclusion, our findings suggest that sarcomatoid and rhabdoid renal cell carcinoma tumors have distinctive genomic and transcriptomic features that may account for their aggressive clinical behavior. We also established that these tumors have significantly improved clinical outcomes on immune checkpoint inhibitors, which may be accounted for by an immune-inflamed phenotype; itself driven in part by upregulation of antigen presentation machinery genes in S/R RCC. Finally, our results suggest that sarcomatoid cell lines recapitulate the transcriptional programs of S/R RCC tumors and could serve as reasonably faithful models for these tumors, fueling the engine for future therapeutic discovery in this aggressive subtype of RCC. Further work is needed to determine whether other solid tumors with similar histological dedifferentiation components exhibit comparable molecular and clinical characteristics.</p>

For all cohorts, the definition of sarcomatoid and rhabdoid RCC tumors was based on the ISUP 2013 consensus definitions: tumors were classified as harboring sarcomatoid features if they had any percentage of sarcomatoid component and as harboring rhabdoid features if they had any percentage of rhabdoid component (regardless of the background histology)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. For the Harvard and IMDC cohorts, sarcomatoid and rhabdoid status were determined by retrospective reviews of pathology reports. For the CheckMate cohort, sarcomatoid and rhabdoid features were retrospectively identified by review of pathology reports and of pathology slides by a pathologist. For the TCGA cohort, all pathology reports were first reviewed. Candidate sarcomatoid and/or rhabdoid cases were then reviewed by a pathologist. Cases that were unequivocal by the ISUP 2013 consensus definitions by pathology report and/or slide review were included. The TCGA cohort also included a subset of sarcomatoid RCC patients that had been previously retrospectively identified<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. All pathology slides and reports for TCGA were accessed using cbioportal (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cbioportal.org">https://www.cbioportal.org</ext-link>). Specifically, the following datasets were used: Kidney Renal Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (TCGA, Provisional), Kidney Chromophobe (TCGA, Provisional), Kidney Renal Papillary Cell Carcinoma (TCGA, Provisional). The sarcomatoid and rhabdoid annotations for the samples identified in TCGA are reported in Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM15" ref-type="media">12</xref>.

For samples where RNA-seq was performed in duplicates, the run with a higher interquartile range of log2(TPM + 1), considered a surrogate for better quality data, was used. We subsequently filtered genes that were not expressed in any of the samples (in each cohort independently) then UQ-normalized the TPMs to an upper quartile of 1000, and log2-transformed them. Since the CheckMate cohort had been sequenced in 4 separate batches, principal component analysis (PCA) was used to evaluate for batch effects and 4 batches were observed.

In order to evaluate whether such relationships held in patients with non-S/R RCC, the same analysis was conducted in non-S/R RCC using the ssGSEA scores that were found to be related to outcomes in S/R RCC.

All analyses were done in the R programming environment version 3.6.1. For boxplots, the upper and lower hinges represent the 75<sup>th</sup> and 25<sup>th</sup> percentiles, respectively. The whiskers extend in both directions until the largest or lowest value not further than 1.5 times the interquartile range from the corresponding hinge. Outliers (beyond 1.5 times the interquartile range) are plotted individually. Continuous variables were summarized by their means and standard deviations (SD) or medians and interquartile ranges (IQR) or ranges. Categorical variables (such as gene alterations) were summarized by their percentages. For survival outcomes, the Kaplan-Meier methodology was used to summarize survival distributions in different groups; 18-month PFS (or TTF) and 2-year OS were provided with 95% confidence intervals. For survival outcomes, multivariable Cox regression models were used for the comparison of ICI and non-ICI regimens and adjusted hazard ratios (HR) with their 95% confidence intervals were reported. Specifically, the IMDC risk groups<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref></sup> (Poor vs. Intermediate/Favorable), line of therapy (2nd line and beyond vs. 1st line), and background histology (clear cell vs. non-clear cell) were adjusted for in the Harvard and IMDC cohort analyses and the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) risk groups<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref></sup> (Poor vs. Intermediate vs. Favorable) were adjusted for in the CheckMate cohort analysis. Similarly, the ORR was compared between the ICI and non-ICI using multivariable logistic regression models adjusting for the same covariates (except for the CheckMate cohort, in which only one patient had had a response in the everolimus arm and therefore the adjusted odds ratio was not estimable). For all multivariable analyses, patients with missing data in any of the variables were excluded from the analysis. For ORR analyses, only patients who were evaluable for response were included in the analysis. The Kaplan–Meier methodology for assessing point estimates of survival was computed using the “landest” package in R. All heatmaps were created using the R package “pheatmap” and were computed using Z-score transformations. When multiple cohorts were represented in the same heatmap, the Z score normalization was done within each cohort separately (in order to account for batch effects in visualization). All tests were two-tailed and considered statistically significant for <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 or <italic>q</italic> &lt; 0.05 unless otherwise specified.</p>
