                <p>Itraconazole, an FDA-approved antifungal, has antitumor activity against a variety of cancers. We sought to determine the effects of itraconazole on esophageal cancer and elucidate its mechanism of action. Itraconazole inhibited cell proliferation and induced G<sub>1</sub>-phase cell-cycle arrest in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma cell lines. Using an unbiased kinase array, we found that itraconazole downregulated protein kinase AKT phosphorylation in OE33 esophageal adenocarcinoma cells. Itraconazole also decreased phosphorylation of downstream ribosomal protein S6, transcriptional expression of the upstream receptor tyrosine kinase HER2, and phosphorylation of upstream PI3K in esophageal cancer cells. Lapatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets HER2, and siRNA-mediated knockdown of HER2 similarly suppressed cancer cell growth <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic>. Itraconazole significantly inhibited growth of OE33-derived flank xenografts in mice with detectable levels of itraconazole and its primary metabolite, hydroxyitraconazole, in esophagi and tumors. HER2 total protein and phosphorylation of AKT and S6 proteins were decreased in xenografts from itraconazole-treated mice compared to xenografts from placebo-treated mice. In an early phase I clinical trial (NCT02749513) in patients with esophageal cancer, itraconazole decreased HER2 total protein expression and phosphorylation of AKT and S6 proteins in tumors. These data demonstrate that itraconazole has potent antitumor properties in esophageal cancer, partially through blockade of HER2/AKT signaling.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Esophageal cancer is the sixth leading cause of cancer-related death and the eighth most common cancer worldwide (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). A rising incidence of esophageal cancer has led to an increasing burden on global health care systems. Because the majority of esophageal cancer patients present with advanced stage disease, the 5-year overall survival rate for patients of all stages is below 20% (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). There are two main histologic subtypes of esophageal cancer: esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), which is predominantly found in the upper and middle thirds of the esophagus, and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), which typically arises in the lower third of the esophagus. The incidence of EAC has increased dramatically in Western countries in the last few decades, coinciding with changes in the prevalence of its known risk factors. Whereas concomitant tobacco and alcohol consumption (risk factors for ESCC) has steadily decreased, gastroesophageal reflux disease, Barrett's esophagus, and obesity (risk factors for EAC) have rapidly increased (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3, 4</xref>). Despite the different risk factors and pathobiology of ESCC and EAC, the clinical treatment of both is similar. Standard treatment for resectable esophageal cancer often involves a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Two molecularly targeted therapies, trastuzumab (anti-HER2 antibody) and ramucirumab (anti-VEGFR2 antibody), and immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) are commonly used in combination with chemotherapy to treat advanced esophageal cancer (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6–10</xref>).</p>
              <p>The repurposing of existing medications for cancer treatment is becoming increasingly attractive because it can greatly reduce the cost and time required to develop novel therapeutics. Itraconazole is an antifungal drug with an established safety record. Over the last three decades, it has been widely used in the prevention and systemic treatment of a broad range of fungal infections. Early studies of the anticancer activity of itraconazole revealed its ability to inhibit the multidrug resistance associated protein P-glycoprotein at a low micromolar concentration (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11, 12</xref>). Using a human endothelial cell proliferation assay, Liu and colleagues first identified itraconazole as an anti-angiogenic agent in 2007 through screening of a large panel of FDA-approved drugs (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Kim and colleagues later showed that itraconazole is a potent antagonist of Hedgehog signaling (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). To date, a combination of <italic toggle="yes">in vitro, in vivo</italic>, and patient data in different tumor types has demonstrated that itraconazole possesses antitumor activity via diverse mechanisms including the aforementioned and initiation of cell cycle arrest, induction of autophagy and inhibition of PI3K/mTOR signaling (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15, 16</xref>). On the basis of these observations and its well-established pharmacokinetic and toxicity profile, itraconazole has been tested in a number of human cancers. Clinical trials in basal cell carcinoma (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), prostate cancer (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), and non–small cell lung cancer (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19, 20</xref>) have shown that itraconazole can increase progression-free survival in these patients. Retrospective studies further support the clinical benefits of itraconazole treatment in refractory malignancies including triple-negative breast cancer (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), ovarian cancer (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), and pancreatic cancer (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Finally, itraconazole has multiple molecular targets so a potential added benefit is that it may have less acquired resistance than other drugs that target a single protein or pathway.</p>
              <p>Few data are available on whether itraconazole has antitumor activity in esophageal cancer. A recent study showed that itraconazole inhibited growth of ESCC through activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK; ref. <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Using a rat model of surgically-induced bile reflux that leads to Barrett's metaplasia, another study demonstrated that itraconazole significantly prevented progression of Barrett's esophagus to invasive EAC through targeting of the Hedgehog signaling pathway (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Despite this, itraconazole's effects on human EAC have not been previously reported. In this study, we investigated whether itraconazole has antitumor effects on ESCC and EAC, and elucidated the underlying molecular mechanism. Using human esophageal cancer cell lines, xenografts in immunodeficient mice, and primary tumors from patients, we found itraconazole effectively inhibits esophageal cancer by targeting the HER2/AKT signaling pathway.</p>

Up to eight posttreatment biopsies were collected at staging EUS (if pretreatment biopsies were obtained at diagnostic EGD) or a research EGD (if pretreatment biopsies were obtained at staging EUS) at the time of J-tube placement or laparoscopy for ischemic preconditioning (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Pretreatment and posttreatment tumor biopsies were stained for phospho-S6 protein as described above. HER2 expression was determined by clinical assay using IHC and reflex FISH testing.</p>

                <p>Xenograft tumors and esophagi from NOD-SCID mice were collected and flash frozen on dry ice. The frozen tissue was homogenized by adding 4× volume of water using DPS-20 dual processing homogenizing system. A variable, measured volume of water was added to achieve smooth homogenate. Following homogenization, 20 μL of 2 mol/L ammonium acetate buffer was added to 50 μL of the tissue homogenate and the suspension was briefly vortexed. Extraction solvent (600 μL) containing 100 ng/mL posaconazole [Internal Standard (IS)] was added and vortexed for 30 minutes at 2,500 rpm. Following vortex mixing, the suspension was centrifuged 12,000 rpm for 5 minutes. Five-hundred microliters of the clear supernatant was removed, placed in a clean Eppendorf tube, and evaporated to dryness using a Labconco centrifugal vacuum concentrator. Samples were reconstituted using 200 μL of acetonitrile:water (70:30). Itraconazole and hydroxyitraconazole were quantified on a Sciex 5500 QTRAP LC/MS-MS system interfaced with a Shimadzu Nexera series UHPLC. Chromatographic separation was achieved by using a Kinetex C18 (1.7 μm, 2.1 × 50 mm) column with an injection volume of 5 μL using gradient elution. Quantitation was achieved by employing electrospray ionization in positive ion mode for the analytes in multiple-reaction monitoring mode. The analytic data obtained were processed using Sciex's Analyst software (version 1.7.1). Additional details are provided in the Supplementary Methods section.</p>

                <title>Itraconazole inhibits proliferation of esophageal cancer cells</title>
                <p>To evaluate the effects of itraconazole on esophageal cancer, we utilized two different methods to measure cell growth. First, cell proliferation assays were performed on the representative EAC cell line OE33 and ESCC cell line KYSE510. The cells were treated with 2.5 μmol/L itraconazole or DMSO as vehicle control for 6 days. Cell numbers at the indicated timepoints were counted. As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>, itraconazole started to exhibit a potent inhibitory effect by 48 hours after drug treatment, and this effect lasted until the end of the experiment in both OE33 and KYSE510 cells. The inhibitory effect of intraconazole on OE33 and KYSE510 cell proliferation was then confirmed by AlamarBlue assay (Supplementary Fig. S2). Second, we assessed the effects of itraconazole on the cell cycle in esophageal cancer cell lines because inhibition of cell proliferation often accompanies changes in cell-cycle progression. OE33 and KYSE510 cells were treated with 2.5 μmol/L itraconazole or DMSO for 24 hours, and cells were then collected for flow cytometric analysis based on propidium iodide staining of DNA content. The proportion of cells in G<sub>0</sub>–G<sub>1</sub>, S and G<sub>2</sub>–M phases of the cell cycle was estimated using FlowJo software. After treatment with itraconazole for 24 hours, the cell-cycle distribution significantly changed with an increase in cell population in G<sub>0</sub>–G<sub>1</sub> phase and a decrease in cell population in S-phase (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). In OE33 cells, the G<sub>0</sub>–G<sub>1</sub> phase fraction increased from 37.5% (DMSO treated) to 60.9% (itraconazole treated). A similar trend was observed in KYSE510 cells with an increase in G<sub>0</sub>–G<sub>1</sub> phase fraction from 29.9% (DMSO treated) to 46.4% (itraconazole treated). The itraconazole-induced cell growth inhibition and cell-cycle arrest at the G<sub>1</sub>–S phase has been observed in other cancer types including gastric and breast cancer (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31, 32</xref>). Together, our results demonstrate a potent inhibitory effect of itraconazole on esophageal cancer cell proliferation.</p>

                <title>Itraconazole suppresses AKT activity in esophageal cancer</title>
                <p>Oncogenic signaling mediators regulate cancer cell proliferation and cell-cycle progression. Thus, we postulated that itraconazole-mediated esophageal cancer cell growth might be due to suppression of key oncogenic signaling mediators. To test this hypothesis, we used an antibody-based phospho-kinase array to analyze the activation status of important signaling mediators in OE33 cells treated with 2.5 μmol/L itraconazole or DMSO for 48 hours. We chose 48 hours into treatment because itraconazole showed clear inhibitory activity on OE33 cell proliferation at this timepoint as shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>. Of the over 40 proteins evaluated, dramatic reduction of phosphorylation of AKT protein was observed (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). AKT is a serine/threonine kinase also known as protein kinase B (PKB), which plays a crucial role in major cellular functions including cell proliferation, cell-cycle progression, cell survival, transcription, and protein synthesis (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33, 34</xref>). AKT can be phosphorylated at Thr308 and Ser473 in response to growth factor stimulation. Phosphorylation at both sites is required to achieve maximal activation of AKT and thus are considered markers of AKT activity (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Notably, we found the phosphorylation status at both sites were reduced upon itraconazole treatment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Aberrant activation of AKT is a prevalent phenomenon in numerous cancer types. To examine the AKT status in esophageal cancer, we measured the level of phospho-AKT protein in two telomerase immortalized human esophageal squamous cell lines (NES-G2T, NES-B10T), two telomerase immortalized nondysplastic Barrett's esophagus cell lines (BAR-T and BAR-10T), two ESCC cell lines (KYSE70 and KYSE510), and two EAC cell lines (FLO-1 and OE33). The phosphorylation of AKT protein was increased in both ESCC and EAC cells compared with esophageal squamous or Barrett's esophagus cell lines (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>).</p>

                <p>To investigate whether itraconazole-mediated downregulation of AKT phosphorylation occurs in other esophageal cancer cell lines, we treated two EAC cell lines (OE33 and FLO-1) and two ESCC cell lines (KYSE70 and KYSE510) with 2.5 μmol/L itraconazole for 48 hours. Cell extracts from each cell line were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot for AKT protein. Consistent with the antibody-based phospho-kinase array, itraconazole treatment reduced phosphorylation of AKT at both Thr308 and Ser473 sites in all four cell lines examined (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). After AKT is phosphorylated and activated, it executes diverse biological actions by phosphorylating a range of downstream proteins including the substrate mTOR. mTOR is a key component of the AKT signaling pathway, and it acts by directly phosphorylating and activating p70S6 kinase (p70S6K). Activated p70S6K phosphorylates the ribosomal protein S6, leading to initiation of protein synthesis (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Ribosomal protein S6 is one of the best-characterized downstream effectors of AKT signaling, and it is required for cell-cycle progression at the G<sub>1</sub>–S transition. To determine whether the itraconazole-mediated reduction of AKT phosphorylation affects downstream AKT signaling proteins, we examined the phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6. We found itraconazole inhibited the phosphorylation of S6 protein in all four cell lines, indicating reduced AKT phosphorylation and activation had functional consequences in esophageal cancer cells, including the cell-cycle arrest observed in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>.</p>

                <p>In response to growth factors, PI3K is the major activator of AKT. Because aberrant activation of PI3K/AKT signaling regulates cancer cell survival and proliferation, we next investigated whether the activity of PI3K is affected by itraconazole treatment.

                <p>It is well established that the canonical pathway leading to AKT activation is initiated by the stimulation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) leading to plasma membrane recruitment and activation of PI3K family proteins. HER2 is one of the RTK associated with the development, progression, and metastases of several solid tumors including esophageal cancer. Next, we investigated whether HER2 status is responsible for the decreased level of PI3K phosphorylation. Indeed, our results indicated that itraconazole treatment led to downregulation of HER2 protein in OE33, FLO-1, KYSE70, and KYSE510 cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Moreover, we also compared <italic toggle="yes">ERBB2</italic> mRNA levels in OE33, FLO-1, KYSE70, and KYSE510 cells treated with itraconazole or DMSO for 48 hours. RT-qPCR revealed that <italic toggle="yes">ERBB2</italic> mRNA levels were significantly decreased following itraconazole treatment in all four esophageal cancer cell lines (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). Next, we found that the level of tumor suppressor PTEN, a major negative regulator of PI3K, was unchanged (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). A recent study suggested that activation of AMPK is involved in the inhibitory effects of itraconazole in ESCC (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). AMPK is a crucial energy sensor that regulates energy metabolism and mitochondrial homeostasis. AMPK can also be rapidly phosphorylated and activated in response to changes in the ATP-to-AMP ratio (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Therefore, we also examined AMPK status in these four cell lines by Western blot. In contrast to the previous report, we did not see itraconazole activate AMPK as its phosphorylation did not increase (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). In fact, AMPK phosphorylation was even slightly reduced after itraconazole treatment for 48 hours particularly in KYSE70 and KYSE510 cells.</p>
                <p>Finally, we decided to determine whether targeting HER2 has any effects on AKT activation status. Lapatinib is a HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that has clinical activity in HER2-amplified breast cancer. We found that 2.5–5.0 μmol/L lapatinib decreased AKT phosphorylation at S473 in OE33, KYSE510, FLO-1, and KYSE70 cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>; Supplementary Fig. S3A). Next, we sought to determine whether inhibition of HER2 via lapatinib treatment could suppress esophageal cancer cell proliferation. OE33, KYSE510, FLO-1, and KYSE70 cells were treated with 2.5 μmol/L lapatinib for six days. Similar to itraconazole treatment, lapatinib reduced cell proliferation in OE33, KYSE510, FLO-1, and KYSE70 cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>; Supplementary Fig. S3B). To confirm these findings, we then performed siRNA-mediated knockdown of HER2 in OE33 EAC and KYSE510 ESCC cells. After 72 hours, HER2 expression was decreased in cells transfected with HER2-specific siRNAs versus nontargeting siRNAs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>). We also found decreased downstream AKT phosphorylation. Cells treated for 72 hours with HER2 and nontargeting siRNAs were then analyzed using AlamarBlue assay, which demonstrated that HER2 knockdown decreased OE33 and KYSE510 cell proliferation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>). Taken together, itraconazole inhibits AKT activity via a HER2–PI3K–AKT axis in esophageal cancer cells.</p>

To confirm the direct contribution of itraconazole to the tumor suppressive effect on OE33-derived xenografts, we measured the levels of itraconazole and hydroxyitraconazole in the xenografts from mice treated with itraconazole. Using an established method, we detected itraconazole and hydroxyitraconazole in the tumors treated with itraconazole, but not in the mice treated with placebo (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). Because our ultimate goal is to treat patients with esophageal cancer, we also measured the concentration of itraconazole and hydroxyitraconazole in the normal esophagus of mice using the same method. Similar to the tumor xenografts, both itraconazole and hydroxyitraconazole were detected in the esophagus of mice treated with itraconazole. In contrast, they were not detected in the esophagus and tumor xenografts from the mice treated with placebo (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). The underlying molecular mechanism of esophageal cancer inhibition <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> was assessed by measuring the expression levels of HER2-AKT signaling pathway components in the tumor xenografts. In comparison to placebo-treated tumors, we noticed markedly reduced levels of HER2 total protein and AKT and downstream S6 protein phosphorylation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). In addition, we did not see an increased level of AMPK activation as indicated by its phosphorylated protein levels. These results are consistent with our previous observations <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic>. Phosphorylated S6 protein as a marker of AKT activity was also evaluated in xenografts treated with placebo or itraconazole by IHC. Consistent with the Western blot results, phosphorylated S6 protein positive cells were markedly reduced in itraconazole-treated xenografts compared with placebo (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>). Together, these data further support that suppression of HER2/AKT signaling plays an important role in itraconazole-mediated antitumor activity in esophageal cancer.</p>

                <title>Itraconazole inhibits AKT activity in primary esophageal tumors in patients</title>
                <p>We initiated a window-of-opportunity early phase I study to evaluate the feasibility of using itraconazole to treat resectable esophageal cancer patients in the neoadjuvant setting before CROSS trial based chemoradiation and surgery (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Patients were given itraconazole 300 mg twice daily for 2 weeks prior to the initiation of standard-of-care chemoradiation (Supplementary Fig. S1). We chose two weeks because this was the typical time between diagnosis and either completion of a staging PET/CT scan or staging EUS and completion of radiation planning/simulation. Patients underwent endoscopic research biopsies of their tumor before and after itraconazole treatment, with one or both of the endoscopic procedures considered standard of clinical care. Of 18 patients who provided written informed consent and enrolled in the trial, 11 patients failed screening for the treatment phase and one did not complete the full course of treatment. Tumors from the remaining six patients, white males between the ages of 61 and 72 with adenocarcinoma of the distal esophagus or gastroesophageal junction, who received the full course of itraconazole were analyzed (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). None of the six patients experienced either a related serious adverse event or a related adverse event during their itraconazole treatment course. We assessed the HER2-AKT signaling axis in paired pre- and post-itraconazole treated tumor biopsies by Western blot. Notably, we observed a marked decrease in the phosphorylation of AKT and its downstream effector S6 protein in five of six patients following itraconazole treatment (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). In addition, total HER2 protein was also decreased post itraconazole treatment in the five patients with decreased AKT and S6 protein phosphorylation. To demonstrate that decreased signaling occurred in tumor cells, biopsies were analyzed by immunohistochemistry for phosphorylated S6 protein expression. In patients A and B, the phosphorylated S6 protein staining was decreased after a 14-day course of itraconazole treatment (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). These positive results show that a short course of orally administered itraconazole inhibits HER2–AKT signaling in esophageal cancer tissue in human patients.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>In this report, we found that itraconazole effectively inhibited the proliferation of both ESCC and EAC cells by arresting them at the G<sub>1</sub>–S transition of the cell cycle. This effect was mediated through downregulating <italic toggle="yes">ERBB2</italic> mRNA and downstream PI3K, AKT, and S6 phosphorylation and activation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>). To our knowledge, this is the first time the anti-tumor activity of itraconazole against human EAC has been shown. In mouse xenografts of EAC, itraconazole significantly decreased tumor growth along with total HER2 and phosphorylated AKT expression levels. Finally, we report the results of a pilot clinical trial (NCT02749513) testing the feasibility of administering oral itraconazole to patients with resectable EAC and the molecular effects on their primary esophageal tumors. Analysis of esophageal cancer specimens from patients with EAC treated with itraconazole confirmed itraconazole's efficacy in targeting HER2/AKT signaling within intact esophageal tumors. HER2 is amplified in roughly 30% of EAC, and in these patients trastuzumab can be beneficial (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). However, HER2 as a member of the EGFR family of RTK can be expressed in normal esophageal epithelium, ESCC, and EAC. In a Japanese study of 142 ESCC cases, 52.8% of the tumors expressed HER2 as determined by IHC (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). We found that pharmacologic inhibition of HER2 activity by lapatinib or siRNA-mediated knockdown of HER2 significantly reduced cell proliferation in ESCC and EAC cells.</p>
              <p>Esophageal cancer is diagnosed in nearly half a million people worldwide each year and is the eighth leading cause of cancer-related death globally (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5, 40, 41</xref>). Despite recent improvements in surgical technique, chemotherapy regimens, and radiation therapy, long-term survival of esophageal cancer remains poor (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Thus, the development of novel molecularly targeted therapies could substantially improve survival. Currently only two molecularly targeted agents, trastuzumab (anti-HER2 antibody) and ramucirumab (anti-VEGFR2 antibody), are routinely used clinically in patients with advanced esophageal cancer (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6, 7</xref>). Itraconazole, a commonly used antifungal agent, is a promising candidate as a molecularly targeted therapy in esophageal cancer. It was shown to reverse P-glycoprotein–mediated drug resistance associated with chemotherapy agents in the 1990s (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11, 12</xref>). Itraconazole was later identified as a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis and Hedgehog signaling, both of which likely play a role in esophageal carcinogenesis, through screening a panel of more than 3,000 FDA-approved drugs (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13, 14</xref>). Since then, a number of new clinical trials have been initiated to study its antitumor activity in a variety of solid tumors including basal cell carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer, prostate cancer, and ovarian cancer (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17–20, 22</xref>). A theoretical concern is that neoadjuvant itraconazole administration could induce antifungal resistance in patients who later develop systemic fungal infections in the peri-operative period. In general, postoperative invasive fungal infections are uncommon, with one study finding an incidence of 1.7% in ICU patients (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). While itraconazole resistance can occur in <italic toggle="yes">Candida</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Aspergillus</italic>, this required nine months of therapy, a much longer treatment duration than used in our early phase I trial (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). Finally, in cases of fungal resistance to a specific azole antifungal drug, cross resistance does not necessarily occur with newer generation azole drugs or other classes of antifungals. While previous phase II studies administered itraconazole for longer times than we did (e.g., 2.3 months and 23.6 weeks), the number and severity of adverse events observed increased as treatment duration increased (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17, 18</xref>). In addition, itraconazole interacts with many common drugs, in particular those metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4. Thus, long-term use of itraconazole as an antineoplastic should be conducted under the direction of a knowledgeable healthcare provider and preferably in a clinical trial setting.</p>
              <p>Serine/threonine kinase AKT is located at the crossroads of cell death and survival. It plays an essential role in multiple interconnected cell signaling pathways involved in cell proliferation and division, metabolism, epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), genome stability, gene transcription, and protein synthesis. Studies have demonstrated that AKT signaling dysfunction occurs in various types of cancer and, in some cases, is associated with tumor metastases (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33, 34</xref>). In recent years, aberrant signaling of this pathway and its involvement in the initiation and progression of esophageal cancer has been explored. Whole exome sequencing of esophageal cancer specimens has identified <italic toggle="yes">AKT</italic> gene amplification in approximately 20% of patients with ESCC (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44, 45</xref>). Another study found activated <italic toggle="yes">AKT</italic> was increased in highly invasive esophageal cancer cell lines and that AKT signaling contributed to ESCC metastases (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). A clinical study found <italic toggle="yes">AKT</italic> mRNA was markedly overexpressed in tumor tissue compared with adjacent normal cells (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). Here, our results showed that phospho-AKT expression was increased in both ESCC and EAC cell lines compared with benign esophageal cell lines. We found that pharmacological inhibition of AKT activity significantly reduced cell proliferation in esophageal cancer cells. AKT target genes <italic toggle="yes">CDK1, CDK2, CDK4</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">E2F1</italic> were significantly decreased following itraconazole treatment. A recent study in ESCC showed that itraconazole treatment led to the inhibition of cancer cell growth through activation of AMPK (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Surprisingly, we did not observe increased phosphorylation of AMPK either in four cell lines or in xenografts following itraconazole treatment. This may be due to innate differences found in ESCC cell lines. In our study, we clearly demonstrated that the reduced phosphorylation of AKT was due to decreased activity of its upstream kinase PI3K. Moreover, we provided evidence that itraconazole decreased expression of HER2/ERBB2 at both the messenger RNA and protein level, which resulted in decreased activity of PI3K. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that itraconazole also targets other RTKs to downregulate PI3K and AKT activity. Future studies should investigate the molecular mechanism by which itraconazole represses <italic toggle="yes">ERBB2</italic> expression at the transcriptional level. Together, our data along with others suggest that HER2/AKT is a promising and viable therapeutic target in esophageal cancer.</p>
              <p>Esophageal cancer is known to be a highly angiogenic tumor. VEGFR2 binds VEGF to mediate tumor angiogenesis. The human IgG1 recombinant mAb ramucirumab that targets VEGFR2 is FDA-approved for use in metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer, and clinical guidelines include its use in EAC. Zhang and colleagues previously demonstrated the existence of a VEGF autocrine signaling loop, in which VEGF binds to VEGFR2 activating signaling in esophageal cancer cell lines (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). Our finding that itraconazole inhibits esophageal cancer cell growth via an AKT-dependent mechanism does not exclude the possibility that itraconazole also suppresses other signaling pathways including VEGFR2. In cancer therapy, there is a general agreement that molecules interfering simultaneously with multiple signaling pathways might be more effective than agents that have a single molecular target. Thus, itraconazole has great potential to be repurposed as a molecularly targeted therapy for esophageal cancer. A better understanding of whether and how receptor tyrosine kinases and angiogenic signaling contribute to itraconazole-dependent antitumor activity in esophageal cancer is an important area for future study.</p>
              <p>Finally, based on the results of our pilot study demonstrating that orally administered itraconazole inhibits HER2/AKT signaling in intact esophageal tumors with an absence of adverse events in our patients, we have launched a phase II trial (NCT04018872) to evaluate the therapeutic effect of itraconazole on esophageal tumors. Following the completion of neoadjuvant chemoradiation, patients with resectable esophageal cancer will be given itraconazole 300 mg twice daily for 6–8 weeks before undergoing esophagectomy. At the time of esophagectomy, esophageal tissue will be harvested to determine itraconazole and hydroxyitraconazole levels. We hypothesize that itraconazole will improve pathologic complete response rates in esophageal cancer based on the results from our early phase I trial.</p>
