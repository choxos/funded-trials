                  <p><italic toggle="yes">The-Optimal-Lymph-Flow</italic> (TOLF) intervention aims to promote
lymph flow through therapeutic lymphatic exercises to relieve lymphatic
pain, swelling, lymphedema symptoms, and to decrease lymph fluid levels
among breast cancer survivors. To enhance the efficacy of the TOLF
intervention, an innovative, intelligent, Kinect-enhanced lymphatic exercise
intervention (Kinect-TOLF) was developed to teach patients to perform the
lymphatic exercises correctly.</p>

                  <p>A single-arm feasibility trial with a pre- and post-test design was employed
to recruit 30 breast cancer survivors with persistent lymphatic pain or
swelling. Patients received a single training session to learn how to
perform the lymphatic exercises using the Kinect-TOLF program. Descriptive
statistics, Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-test, Spearmanâs

                  <title>Conclusions:</title>
                  <p>The Kinect-TOLF is safe, feasible, and effective in reducing lymphatic pain,
swelling, lymphedema symptoms, and in decreasing lymph fluid levels. Future
research should focus on a randomized clinical trial to confirm the unique
or synergistic efficacy of the Kinect-TOLF in comparison with current
lymphedema treatment and other forms of exercises or movement therapy. This

leads to a chronic and co-occurring variety of pain sensations (i.e.,
pain/aching/soreness) in the ipsilateral upper limb or body defined as lymphatic
pain and other symptoms related to fluid accumulation defined as lymphedema

              <p>While lymphatic pain, swelling, and lymphedema symptoms are most common in patients
with a diagnosis of lymphedema,<sup><xref rid="bibr7-15347354211026757" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> more than 50% of breast cancer survivors without a diagnosis of lymphedema
also report daily co-occurring lymphatic pain, swelling, and lymphedema
symptoms.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-15347354211026757" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="bibr8-15347354211026757" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr9-15347354211026757" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> For breast
cancer survivors without a diagnosis of lymphedema, the experience of lymphatic
pain, swelling, and lymphedema symptoms is a cardinal sign of an early stage of
lymphedema because these symptoms often precede changes in limb size or girth and a
lymphedema diagnosis.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-15347354211026757" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="bibr9-15347354211026757" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>
Breast cancer survivors who report pain on the affected ipsilateral upper limb or
body are nearly twice as likely to develop lymphedema.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-15347354211026757" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Without timely intervention in this early stage, lymphedema can progress into
a chronic condition that no surgical or medical interventions can cure.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-15347354211026757" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="bibr11-15347354211026757" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Thus, the
effective management of lymphatic pain, swelling, and lymphedema symptoms is needed
for breast cancer survivors with or without a diagnosis of lymphedema.</p>
              <p>Pharmacological interventions (eg, NSAIDs, opioids) and behavioral strategies are
commonly used for pain control in cancer patients.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-15347354211026757" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="bibr12-15347354211026757" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr13-15347354211026757" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr14-15347354211026757" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr15-15347354211026757" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr16-15347354211026757" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Lymphedema treatments (e.g.,

(TOLF) intervention, a patient-centered and nurse-led self-care program, aims to
promote lymph flow through the performance of therapeutic lymphatic exercises and

              <p>To enhance the efficacy of the TOLF intervention, we developed and tested a
Kinect-enhanced lymphatic exercise intervention system (Kinect-TOLF) that uses a
Microsoft Kinect sensor to capture both color and depth information while the
patient is performing the lymphatic exercises following an avatar on a screen (<xref rid="fig1-15347354211026757" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).<sup><xref rid="bibr20-15347354211026757" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="bibr21-15347354211026757" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr22-15347354211026757" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> The Kinect-TOLF accurately
aligns a userâs motion sequence with the standard motion sequence and evaluates the
âcorrectnessâ of the userâs movements in real time. This approach facilitates
instantaneous feedback to the user while the user is performing each exercise.</p>

              <p>We conducted a single-arm feasibility clinical trial with a pre- and post-test design
to assess the feasibility and usability of the Kinect-TOLF to deliver a therapeutic
lymphatic exercise intervention to breast cancer survivors. The objectives of this
trial were to: (1) evaluate the Kinect-TOLF in breast cancer survivors in terms of
feasibility (i.e., study accrual and protocol adherence) and usability (i.e.,
ratings of training quality, system quality, and behavioral intention of using the
Kinect-TOLF); and (2) test the efficacy of the Kinect-TOLF on reductions in
lymphatic pain, swelling, lymphedema symptom occurrence (i.e., number and severity
of symptoms), and lymph fluid levels. We hypothesized that a single session of
Kinect-TOLF intervention would lead to significant reductions in lymphatic pain,
swelling, lymphedema symptom occurrence (i.e., number and severity of symptoms), and
lymph fluid levels. This study was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov with US

Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to identify whether the data fit a normal
distribution. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize study variables,
stratified by time-point of pre- and post- Kinect-TOLF intervention. Continuous
variables were summarized in terms of means, medians, standard deviations (SD),
ranges, and quantiles. Categorical variables were summarized using frequencies
and proportions. Confidence intervals were reported to quantify the precision of
estimates. The alpha level was set at .05 and 95% confidence intervals [CI] were
reported for all of the statistical tests when appropriate. We used R version
3.6.2 for all of the statistical analyses.</p>
                <p>For ordinal outcomes (i.e., lymphatic pain, hand/arm swelling) as well as for the
continuous outcome of total swelling, Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were performed
to test median differences in patientsâ scores between pre- and post-
Kinect-TOLF intervention. Spearmanâs rank correlation coefficients
(<italic toggle="yes">Ï<sub>Spearman</sub></italic>) were calculated to assess
whether pre-intervention symptom levels were associated with symptom change

                <p>Changes in L-Dex values, the total number of symptoms and total symptom severity

difference in patient outcomes between the pre-intervention values and the
slope. Significant intercept suggests a relationship between pre-intervention
values and the amount of within-person change observed at post-intervention
(e.g., patient with higher pre-intervention pain scores may experience a greater
degree of relief at post-intervention than patients with lower pain scores at
pre-intervention). We report Cohenâs <italic toggle="yes">d</italic> as an indicator of

43.3% of the patients had a lumpectomy, 60% had a mastectomy, 56.7% had breast
reconstruction, 83.3% had chemotherapy, and 90% had radiation therapy. While
23.3% of the patients underwent axillary lymph node dissection, 30% had only
sentinel lymph node biopsy. The mean number of lymph nodes removed was 11.4.
Fifty percent of the patients were diagnosed with and treated for lymphedema.
The mean years elapsed since the breast cancer diagnosis was 7.54 (SDâ=â6.24;
medianâ=â5.16, rangeâ=â2-23âyears). Among the 30 patients, 10 (33%) patients had

                <p>Feasibility of the study was demonstrated by timely study accrual (Nâ=â30) in
less than 3âmonths, ahead of the planned 6âmonths recruitment. The study
achieved 100% protocol adherence with no patient withdrawal and protocol
deviation. Of the 50 patients who were eligible for the study, only 8 patients
declined the study without giving a reason. Twelve patients were eager but not
able to participate in the study due to unexpected family events, time
conflicts, and long-distance travel.</p>

major usability problems or usability catastrophes; 24 (80%) reported no
usability problem; 4 (13.3%) reported minor usability problems (ie, minor
mis-synchronization of the motion performed and what the screen displayed); and
2 (6.7%) reported cosmetic problem (ie, dislike the computer-generated voice and
display of the catalog of the exercises). The heuristic evaluation demonstrated
that the iterative process of refinement of the Kinect-TOLF was effective. By
the last 10 participants, no usability problems were reported.</p>

                <p>The most salient theme was that patients felt that the Kinect-TOLF was effective
in teaching them how to do the lymphatic exercises correctly by providing them
with a standardized format for each exercise that was âeasy to follow.â Patients
appreciated that the Kinect-TOLF provided immediate feedback on âwhere [they
were] making errors.â As 1 patient remarked, the Kinect-TOLF helped her to
adjust her shoulder to the correct position for the exercises, which is a
âdifficult task for me.â Patients noted that the Kinect-TOLF increased their
sense of self-efficacy because the program allowed them to learn and perform the
exercises independently and that they could repeat them as often as they wanted
to do so. Patients felt that the lymphatic exercises had immediate effects to
âstretch out tightness and relieve pain,â and have a âpositive difference within
minutes of doing the exercises.â Finally, patients concluded that the
Kinect-TOLF was âeasy to useâ and âstraightforward.â</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>The efficacy of self-care exercise interventions relies on accurate body movements.
Findings from this study demonstrated that the Kinect-TOLF intervention is feasible
and efficacious in training patients to perform lymphatic exercises accurately.
Feasibility of the study was supported by 100% of study accrual ahead of time (i.e.,
more than 3âmonths ahead of the planned 6âmonths of recruitment) and 100% of
protocol adherence without any protocol deviation and patient withdrawal from the
study. The majority of our patients reported no usability problems and agreed that
the system was easy to learn and operate, flexible to use, clear, and
understandable. As expected, some patients reported that it took a lot of mental
effort to learn the lymphatic exercises. However, over 80% of them indicated that
the Kinect-TOLF made it easy for them to remember how to correctly perform the
exercises. Nearly every patient expressed how much they appreciated the real-time
feedback, which enabled them to perform each exercise correctly. Overall, our
findings provide preliminary evidence that the Kinect-TOLF is a simple and
efficacious system that patients can use to learn self-care therapeutic exercises
correctly.</p>
              <p>The goal of the TOLF lymphatic exercises is to relieve lymphatic pain, swelling, and
lymphedema symptoms.<sup><xref rid="bibr17-15347354211026757" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="bibr18-15347354211026757" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> In face-to-face<sup><xref rid="bibr17-15347354211026757" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> and avatar-based coaching<sup><xref rid="bibr18-15347354211026757" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> studies, the TOLF intervention was safe, feasible, and efficacious in
relieving lymphatic pain and reducing lymphedema symptoms as well as in decreasing
the risk of objective lymph fluid accumulation by limb volume using infrared
perometer. The current study extends these findings and suggests that the
Kinect-TOLF is safe, feasible, and have immediate effects on lymphatic pain,
swelling, lymphedema symptoms, and lymph fluid level after a single training session
of the Kinect-TOLF. Significant reductions were found in lymphatic pain
(<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>â=â.004), arm/hand swelling (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>â=â.004),
total swelling (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>â=â.003), number of lymphedema symptoms
(<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>â&lt;â.001), and symptom severity scores
(<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>â=â.016). In addition, patients who had the greatest severity of
lymphatic pain, arm/hand swelling, and total swelling prior to intervention had the
greatest improvements in these symptoms. Taken together, these findings suggest that
the effects of a single session of Kinect-TOLF intervention were immediate to
relieve lymphatic pain, arm/hand swelling, total swelling, and lymphedema symptoms.
Patientsâ immediate therapeutic responses are also supported by the qualitative
data. Patients reported positive effects within minutes of performing the lymphatic
exercises. These perceptions of immediate effects of the Kinect-TOLF are important
because sustained behavior change is more easily maintained if patients perceive
that an intervention is effective and easy to integrate into their daily lives.<sup><xref rid="bibr35-15347354211026757" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup></p>
              <p>The TOLF lymphatic exercises were designed to decrease lymph fluid levels.<sup><xref rid="bibr17-15347354211026757" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="bibr18-15347354211026757" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> In a previous study,<sup><xref rid="bibr17-15347354211026757" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> 97% of the 134 patients who received the face-to-face TOLF intervention
maintained or decreased their preoperative limb volumes assessed using an infrared
perometer at 12âmonths after surgery. In the current study, all of the patients had
significant reductions in lymph fluid levels assessed using bioimpedance immediately
after a single training session of Kinect-TOLF. In addition, greater reductions in
lymph fluid levels were found in patients with abnormal lymph fluid levels (i.e.,
their scores decreased by 5.1âpoints). Given these results, it is reasonable to
hypothesize that daily or weekly use of the Kinect-TOLF intervention may help
patients to achieve normal lymph fluid levels.</p>

and subjective measures for efficacy testing. While not a randomized trial, this
study provides an effect size for each outcome variable for future trials. As
Kinect-TOLF lymphatic exercises can be used alone or as an adjuvant therapy to
current lymphedema treatment (e.g., compression therapy, manual lymph drainage, or
other forms of exercises), a randomized clinical trial with a larger sample is
warranted to confirm the unique or synergistic efficacy of the Kinect-TOLF in
comparison to current lymphedema treatment and other forms of exercises or movement
therapy. Future studies should also consider what constitutes a clinically
meaningful difference in using the Kinect-TOLF to reduce lymphatic pain, swelling,
lymphedema symptoms, and decrease lymph fluid levels. In terms of limitations,
patients were highly educated and had familiarity with computers and mobile
devices.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>The Kinect-TOLF is an easy-to-use, low-cost intervention that enables patients to
perform the therapeutic lymphatic exercises in a standardized way. This intelligent
Kinect-enhanced lymphatic exercise intervention enhances intervention fidelity and
insures that each patient receives the same quality of intervention. Importantly,
findings from this study suggest that a single session of Kinect-TOLF intervention
immediately reduces lymphatic pain, swelling, and lymphedema symptoms, as well as
decreases lymph fluid levels. The findings of this study should be further evaluated
in a large randomized clinical trial. If the results are replicated, the Kinect-TOLF
intervention will be relatively easy to implement in clinical practice or at home to
relieve lymphatic pain, swelling, and lymphedema symptoms, as well as to decrease
lymph fluid level, ultimately to improve the QOL of breast cancer survivors.</p>
