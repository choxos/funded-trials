                <p>Richter transformation (RT) is a rare complication of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) that has dismal outcomes. Upregulation of PD-1/PD-L1 drives immunological evasion in patients with RT. We hypothesized that combining nivolumab, a PD-1 blocking antibody, with the BTK inhibitor (BTKi) ibrutinib could potentiate tumor-cell killing. We conducted an investigator-initiated phase 2 clinical trial to assess the efficacy of combined nivolumab and ibrutinib in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) RT and CLL. Patients included were ≥18 years of age with adequate hepatic and renal function. Patients received nivolumab every 2 weeks of a 4-week cycle for a maximum of 24 cycles. A standard dose ibrutinib was initiated from cycle 2 onward and continued daily until progression. For patients who were already on ibrutinib at the time of study entry, the same was continued while nivolumab was initiated. A total of 24 patients with RT with a median age of 64.5 years (range, 47-88) were enrolled. Ten patients (42%) had received prior treatment for RT and 13 patients (54%) had received a prior BTKi. A total of 10 patients (42%) responded with a median duration of response of 15 months. The median overall survival was 13 months. Four of 24 (17%) patients had checkpoint inhibition–related immunological toxicities. In the CLL cohort, 10 patients were enrolled, of whom 3 patients converted from partial to complete remission; 1 patient had a grade 2 immunological toxicity. Combined nivolumab and ibrutinib is an active regimen for patients with DLBCL RT with an overall response rate of 42%. Given the limited treatment options for patients with RT, checkpoint inhibition provides a potential therapeutic option.

The primary efficacy end point, the conversion rate, was defined as the conversion from PR to CR/CRi that occurred during the first 12 months of treatment.</p>
                  <p id="p0080">For both CLL cohorts, like the DLBCL RT cohort, the optimal 2-stage design proposed by Simon was implemented.

If 1 or more of the first 9 patients attained BR, accrual had to continue until a total of 24 patients had been enrolled. We had to suspend accrual if, at the end of the first stage, all 9 patients had been enrolled and no response had been observed.

                  <p id="p0085">All patients who received at least 1 dose of any of the study drugs constituted the efficacy and safety population. For both DLBCL RT and CLL groups, toxicity monitoring was performed in cohorts of 6 patients using a Bayesian approach and the trial had to be stopped early if, at any point, there was an 80% possibility of toxicity (defined as any grade 3 or higher nonhematologic toxicity, which is at least possibly related to the treatment) rate being &gt;30%. Summary statistics are provided for continuous variables. Frequency tables were used to summarize categorical variables. OS and duration of response (DOR) probabilities were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. DOR was calculated from the time of response (CMR/PMR for DLBCL RT; CR/CRi or conversion from PR to CR/CRi for CLL) to relapse/progression or death from any cause. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 9, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA.</p>

The median age was 64.5 years (range, 47-88 years). The median number of prior therapies received for CLL and/or RT was 3 (range, 0-10). Only 1 patient had not received any prior therapy for CLL and/or RT and was enrolled with high-risk genetics [del(17p)], per protocol. A total of 14 of 24 (58%) were previously untreated for RT and had received a median of 2 (range, 0-5) prior therapies for CLL. The remaining 10 of 24 (42%) patients had received a median of 1 prior therapy for RT (range, 1-5) and a median of 4.5 prior therapies for both CLL and/or RT (range, 1-10). Three patients (13%) had undergone prior stem cell transplantation for their RT (2 allo- and 1 autologous SCT) and 1 patient had an allo-SCT for CLL. Thirteen patients (54%) had prior exposure to BTKi (ibrutinib, n = 12; acalabrutinib, n = 1). No patient had received prior PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor for CLL and/or RT. A total of 6 of the 24 (25%) patients had bone marrow involvement with RT.

                  <p id="p0125">From December 2015 to January 2017, 10 patients with CLL with a median age of 57 years (range, 42-70 years) were enrolled: 7 patients to the first cohort and 3 patients, already on ibrutinib, to the second cohort. Four patients (40%) had del(17p)/<italic>TP53</italic> mutation and 4 patients (40%) had unmutated immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region gene. The median lines of prior therapy in the 7 patients in the first cohort was 1 (range, 1-3); 3 patients in the second cohort had only received prior ibrutinib for their CLL for 13, 26, and 32 months. Two patients (29%) in the first cohort had a protocol-specified response of CR after 9 and 24 cycles of therapy. One of 3 patients (33%) in the second cohort had a conversion to CR from PR after 3 cycles of nivolumab therapy. The median number of cycles on trial was 20 (range, 3-24). One patient in the second cohort developed grade 2 bilateral anterior uveitis after 21 cycles of therapy. The episode resolved on withholding nivolumab and treatment with topical steroids.</p>

              <p id="p0130">In our cohort of heavily pretreated patients with DLBCL RT, with a median number of prior therapies received for CLL/RT of 3, we noted an encouraging response rate of 42% with combined nivolumab plus ibrutinib. The median DOR was 15 months and OS was 25 months for the responding patients.</p>
              <p id="p0135">The standard first-line treatment for RT generally includes traditional chemoimmunotherapy regimens (such as R-CHOP, O-CHOP, R-DHAP, R-EPOCH, and OFAR) and these lead to responses in 30% to 60% of previously untreated RT with a median survival of less than 1 year.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> In a recent phase 2 study of venetoclax with dose-adjusted R-EPOCH (VR-EPOCH) in 26 patients with RT (24 of 26 were previously untreated for RT) with a median of 1 prior line of therapy for CLL, the overall response rate was 62% with a median PFS of 10.1 months and median OS of 19.6 months. In our study, we noted comparable results for the patients who were treatment-naïve for RT, without the use of intensive chemotherapy. We treated 14 patients who were previously untreated for RT with a median of 2 prior CLL therapies. We noted an overall response rate (ORR) of 50% (7 of 14) with a median DOR of 10.1 months and median OS of 24.1 months.</p>
              <p id="p0140">Ding et al reported the first study of checkpoint inhibition in patients with RT. Among the 9 patients with RT (6 relapsed/refractory RT; 3 treatment-naïve RT), 4 of 9 (44%) had a response (1 CMR, 3 PMR) to pembrolizumab monotherapy with a median PFS of 5.4 months and median OS of 10.7 months.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> Notably, all 4 responders had a prior exposure to ibrutinib. In contrast, in a retrospective study of PD-1 blockade for 10 patients with RT, all of whom were BTKi exposed, only 1 patient (10%) showed a response and the median OS from initiation of PD-1 inhibitor was just 2 months for the entire cohort.<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref> Younes et al reported a trial of combined nivolumab and ibrutinib in patients with RT with an overall response rate of 65% (10% CR and 55% partial response by CT assessments) in 20 patients with DLBCL RT; all patients, by study design, were BTKi naïve in this trial.<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36</sup></xref> In our study, we also saw the majority of responses in the BTKi-naïve group with 7 of 11 (64%) responses vs 3 of 13 (23%) responses among patients who had a prior exposure to BTKi. Our results are consistent with the results by Younes et al with both studies using combined nivolumab and ibrutinib for patients with RT and reporting ∼65% response rate in the BTKi-naïve cohort. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the largest cohort of patients with DLBCL RT treated with checkpoint inhibition. Based on these studies, PD-1 inhibition with or without ibrutinib is an appropriate treatment option for patients with RT and therefore included in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines.</p>
              <p id="p0145">Given that allo-SCT consolidation is the only potentially curative modality for patients with RT, notably 4 of 10 responding patients (40% of responders and 17% of all patients) were able to proceed directly to an allo-SCT after the treatment. A fifth patient underwent allo-SCT while maintaining response for RT with combined nivolumab and ibrutinib but received interim venetoclax due to CLL relapse. The use of checkpoint inhibitors like nivolumab before or after allo-SCT pose the risk for immunological toxicities, including higher risk of GVHD.<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr"><sup>37</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr"><sup>38</sup></xref> In patients with Hodgkin lymphoma, around 30% of those who received nivolumab for disease relapse after allo-SCT had acute GVHD; notably all of these were reactivation of prior GVHD.<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr"><sup>39</sup></xref> In our study, 1 of 3 patients who proceeded to allo-SCT directly after the study experienced systemic acute GVHD and another patient who had a prior allo-SCT had reactivation of GVHD, causing study discontinuation for the patient. Though the risk appears low, it is important that patients who proceed to allo-SCT after nivolumab-based regimens or are offered the drug after a prior allo-SCT be closely monitored for the onset or reactivation of GVHD.<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr"><sup>40</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="p0150">Clonally-related RT is associated with worse outcomes than clonally-unrelated RT. Studies have shown that clonally-related DLBCL RT is more commonly associated with PD-1/PD-L1 expression than de novo DLBCL.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> Unfortunately, we do not have data for clonal relatedness of RT for our study patients; however, based on published literature, we expect &gt;80% to 90% of the patients to have RT that is clonally-related to the underlying CLL. We assessed the PD-1/PD-L1 expression in 10 patients with available baseline samples, 7 of whom were positive for PD-1/PD-L1. Five patients positive for and 2 of 3 negative for PD-1/PD-L1 responded to the treatment. With the caveat of limited sample size, we are unable to establish response correlation with PD-1/PD-L1 expression. Correlative studies are ongoing in responders vs nonresponders to interrogate immune profile and activation in samples from patients treated in this trial.</p>
              <p id="p0155">Check point inhibition adds to the emerging therapeutic landscape for patients with RT. Early results of noncovalent BTKi pirtobrutinib in patients with RT appear promising.<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr"><sup>41</sup></xref> Anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy has also been investigated in patients with DLBCL RT with early positive results.<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> However, these approaches need to be further studied to understand their optimum timing in the treatment schema, the need for subsequent allo-SCT and their effect on the underlying CLL compartment.</p>
              <p id="p0160">Of the 10 patients with CLL enrolled in the trial, 3 achieved CR/CRi. However, due to the changing landscape of CLL therapies with the introduction of novel BTK and BCL2 inhibitors, additional patients were not enrolled in this cohort. In the study by Ding and colleagues, of the 16 patients with CLL who received pembrolizumab monotherapy, none had a response.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> In the study by Younes and colleagues, the response rate in patients with CLL (n = 36) treated with ibrutinib and nivolumab combination therapy was similar to single agent ibrutinib.<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="p0165">In conclusion, combined nivolumab and ibrutinib is an active and safe regimen for patients with DLBCL RT. Given the limited treatment options for patients with RT, checkpoint inhibition provides a potential therapeutic option for these patients.</p>
