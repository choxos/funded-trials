              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are pivotal to the advancement of clinical care and scientific decision-making. However, selective outcome reporting and alteration of end points undermine the validity, reproducibility, and clinical applicability of RCTs.<sup><xref rid="zoi230424r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Despite efforts to make protocols available<sup><xref rid="zoi230424r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> and to require clinical trial registration,<sup><xref rid="zoi230424r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> lack of transparency among RCTs remains a pressing concern.<sup><xref rid="zoi230424r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230424r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> There has been considerable variability in reported PEP change rates due to inconsistencies and the limited scope in how PEP changes have been identified and detected.<sup><xref rid="zoi230424r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230424r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230424r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230424r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230424r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230424r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230424r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230424r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Most notably, it is unknown how often trials report changes in primary end points when publishing their work. We hypothesized that PEP changes among active cancer clinical trials occur at a substantial rate and are underreported in published articles. Herein, we provide, to our knowledge, the first comprehensive assessment of publicly available sources for documenting PEP reporting changes (ClinicalTrials.gov, published articles, and published protocols) among cancer clinical trials. We evaluated the incidence of and factors associated with PEP changes.</p>

              <p>All data used for this cross-sectional study were collected from publicly available resources and did not require institutional review board approval per the Common Rule. The study followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/strobe/" ext-link-type="uri">STROBE</ext-link>) reporting guideline. We queried all completed phase 3, cancer-specific, interventional RCTs registered in ClinicalTrials.gov from inception through February 2020, with published articles reporting PEP results (<xref rid="zoi230424f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).<sup><xref rid="zoi230424r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> In brief, trials were initially identified using ClinicalTrials.gov with the search parameters <italic>cancer</italic>, <italic>all studies</italic>, <italic>phase 3</italic>, and <italic>with results</italic>, excluding trials <italic>not yet recruiting</italic>. Published articles were identified using those linked to ClinicalTrials.gov and through PubMed searches using National Clinical Trial numbers. Trials were excluded if no PEP was provided or if any detected PEP change occurred before trial initiation. Changes in PEPs detected prior to trial initiation were not scored as PEP changes for the purposes of this study.</p>

Minor changes in PEP wording or not clearly defined initial reporting were not considered a PEP change. Discrepancies in reported PEP were assessed using 3 reporting methods: (1) history of tracked changes on ClinicalTrials.gov, (2) self-reported changes noted in the article, and (3) changes reported within the protocol, including all available protocol documents (original and final versions of the protocol, protocol amendments, and summary of protocol changes, as available). Primary end point changes were determined by a single reviewer. Inconspicuous PEP changes were confirmed by 2 separate reviewers (J.A.J., E.B.L.).</p>

              <p>A total of 1877 trials were identified on ClinicalTrials.gov. We identified 789 trials involving therapeutic interventions, with 755 of those trials reporting a PEP in a published article. One trial had a PEP change detected prior to trial initiation and was not included as having a PEP change in the present study. Of 755 trials meeting the inclusion criteria, 145 (19.2%) had detectable PEP changes occurring after the study start date by at least 1 of the 3 detection methods (ClinicalTrials.gov, article, published protocols) (<xref rid="zoi230424t1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). There was a significant difference in the detection rate of PEP changes among the methods (<italic>χ<sup>2</sup></italic> = 72.1; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). The highest rates of PEP changes were detected in published protocols (41 of 148 [27.7%]) followed by ClinicalTrials.gov (120 of 755 [15.9%]) and articles (43 of 755 [5.7%]) (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) (<xref rid="zoi230424t1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Of the 145 detected trials with PEP changes, 102 (70.3%) did not disclose changes within the article. The most common PEP changes observed were a PEP reported as an SEP (49 [33.8%]) and PEP definition changes (47 [32.4%]) (<xref rid="zoi230424t1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). There were no trials in which PEP changes were exclusively detected within the article. Of the 120 trials with changes that were observed on ClinicalTrials.gov, 63 (52.5%) had changes that occurred after the reported study primary completion date based on dates provided on ClinicalTrials.gov. Furthermore, using masking reporting on ClinicalTrials.gov, 85 of 145 trials with PEP changes (58.6%) were listed as open label compared with 309 of 610 trials without detected PEP changes (50.7%) (<italic>P</italic> = .052).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive analysis of PEP changes among phase 3 trials in clinical oncology that used 3 methods of detecting PEP changes. We found not only a high rate of PEP changes in clinical trials after trial initiation but also considerable variability in reporting of PEP changes across available methods. There was substantial underreporting of PEP changes within published articles, and only one-third of RCTs provided protocols. Furthermore, when assessing the association of PEP changes with trial masking, our data showed that more PEP changes occurred in trials that were listed as open label, whereas trials with no PEP change had similar numbers of trials that were listed as open label vs not open label. While ClinicalTrials.gov does not provide information regarding the masking of the sponsoring institution, the higher frequency of PEP changes in open-label trials suggests a need for greater transparency in reporting PEP changes.</p>
              <p>Prior studies assessing rates of PEP change among multiple trials have reported variable rates of PEP discrepancies.<sup><xref rid="zoi230424r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230424r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230424r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230424r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230424r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Studies conducted on cancer-specific published trials found a PEP change of 12% when comparing protocols with published articles<sup><xref rid="zoi230424r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230424r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> and 19% when comparing ClinicalTrials.gov with published articles.<sup><xref rid="zoi230424r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Another group identified a PEP change frequency of 6% when comparing registered PEPs with protocol PEPs.<sup><xref rid="zoi230424r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> However, these prior reports each used a single detection method, compared end points among different methods, had small sample sizes, or limited the analysis to select journals. In the present study, we used all publicly available detection methods to both comprehensively quantify the PEP changes in cancer-specific RCTs in a major trial registry and differentiate among detection methods in detail.</p>
              <p>There are multiple reasons for changes in PEPs. Masked review of data may reveal a high rate of discontinuation of therapy or slow accrual, which makes it difficult to properly assess the impact of a specific intervention. Prior to unmasking, results of a similar trial may also suggest that a different PEP may be more optimal in assessing the outcome of treatment.<sup><xref rid="zoi230424r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Furthermore, other ongoing trials may show toxic effects or other patient safety concerns, which would require changes in the study design and end points.<sup><xref rid="zoi230424r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Despite multiple potential reasons for altering study end points, our results showed a high rate of PEP changes detected, with few trials discussing those changes in published articles. It is possible that the changes in PEP reflected within the history of tracked changes on ClinicalTrials.gov were from clerical errors. This could also be true in comparing initial and final protocols, although less likely. Prior attempts by some of us to contact authors to learn about changes in PEPs have been largely unsuccessful.</p>
              <p>These results highlight the need for increased transparency in reporting changes within trial protocols and within the article.<sup><xref rid="zoi230424r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Relying on authors to self-report PEP changes in published articles may be insufficient. While previous efforts have resulted in increased requirements for trialists to provide protocols as supplemental materials for published trial results,<sup><xref rid="zoi230424r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> our data suggest that the current guidelines may be suboptimal to detect key changes in trial design and end points. Disclosure of substantial changes in PEPs, especially after trial initiation, should be required, as understanding the context and rationale for PEP choice (or alteration) is critical for trial interpretation and validity. This imperative is underscored by our finding that PEP changes appeared to be independently associated with trial positivity. Our findings suggest that trialists and journals should consider or require routine publication of protocols with a historical record of protocol changes in addition to mandating manuscript disclosure of any PEP changes that occurred after trial initiation. These policy changes would likely augment the transparency, validity, and interpretability of reported trial results.</p>
              <sec id="H2-2-ZOI230424">
                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p>Our analysis has several limitations. The results are based on only publicly available data; therefore, detectable changes relied on consistent and available reporting with each method. It is also not possible to know whether unintentional errors occurred during the initial reporting of PEPs on ClinicalTrials.gov that led to the discrepancies in PEPs observed in the study. Similar errors in reporting primary completion dates and changes on ClinicalTrials.gov may have led to our observation of PEP changes following the primary completion date. Studies have reported discrepancies in clinical trial registries related to listing of the principal investigators<sup><xref rid="zoi230424r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> and reporting of results<sup><xref rid="zoi230424r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> and registration dates.<sup><xref rid="zoi230424r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> The variable quality of PEP descriptions and reporting on ClinicalTrials.gov that has been previously described may also have led to false-positive results or false-negative results in the present study, although we endeavored to mitigate this through the use of previously described definitions for major PEP changes.<sup><xref rid="zoi230424r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230424r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230424r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230424r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Furthermore, trials were not excluded if the initial PEP was not reported when the trial was first registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, and thus, we may have missed a small collection of early PEP changes. As discussed, there are numerous valid reasons to change the study design and end points prior to the study unmasking, including unexpected revelations related to study accrual, treatment-related toxic effects, and new scientific findings from similar studies. It is thus possible that some PEP changes were valid. However, based on available public data, we could not conclude whether the PEP changes were justified or detected due to unintentional clerical errors.</p>
                <p>In addition, there could be multiple confounding variables related to the association between PEP change and trial positivity. Trials that justifiably change PEPs prior to unmasking and analysis because of internal or external factors may be more likely to have positive outcomes. Furthermore, trial positivity may be associated with variables not tested in the multivariable analysis, including statistical power or patient accrual. Although we could not fully elaborate on or determine the validity of PEP changes and its causal relationship to trial positivity, our study found a high rate of PEP changes that were not properly highlighted or justified.</p>

The findings suggest that revision of journal policies to require trialists to publish and report PEP changes within the article and to provide protocols with multiple versions for reference is needed. The implications of PEP changes on trial outcomes and patient care need to be further elucidated.</p>
