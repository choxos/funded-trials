                <p id="Par1">In patients with previously treated metastatic uveal melanoma, the historical 1 year overall survival rate is 37% with a median overall survival of 7.8 months. We conducted a multicenter, single-arm, open-label phase 2 study of tebentafusp, a soluble T cell receptor bispecific (gp100×CD3), in 127 patients with treatment-refractory metastatic uveal melanoma (NCT02570308). The primary endpoint was the estimation of objective response rate based on RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours) v1.1. Secondary objectives included safety, overall survival, progression-free survival and disease control rate. All patients had at least one treatment-related adverse event, with rash (87%), pyrexia (80%) and pruritus (67%) being the most common. Toxicity was mostly mild to moderate in severity but was greatly reduced in incidence and intensity after the initial three doses. Despite a low overall response rate of 5% (95% CI: 2–10%), the 1 year overall survival rate was 62% (95% CI: 53–70%) with a median overall survival of 16.8 months (95% CI: 12.9–21.3), suggesting benefit beyond traditional radiographic-based response criteria. In an exploratory analysis, early on-treatment reduction in circulating tumour DNA was strongly associated with overall survival, even in patients with radiographic progression. Our findings indicate that tebentafusp has promising clinical activity with an acceptable safety profile in patients with previously treated metastatic uveal melanoma, and data suggesting ctDNA as an early indicator of clinical benefit from tebentafusp need confirmation in a randomized trial.</p>

              <p id="Par3">Uveal melanoma is the most common primary eye tumour<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> but it remains a rare condition, affecting fewer than 10 individuals per million<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Up to half of the patients with uveal melanoma will develop metastatic disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, with the liver as the predominant site of distant spread<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Nearly all cases of uveal melanoma harbor one of four initiating oncogenic driver mutations in <italic>GNAQ</italic>, <italic>GNA11</italic>, <italic>PLCB4</italic> or <italic>CYSLTR2</italic> in a mutually independent fashion, as well as a secondary oncogenic event affecting <italic>EIFA1X</italic>, <italic>BAP1</italic> or genes encoding for spliceosome components, most commonly <italic>SF3B1</italic> (refs. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>). Uveal melanoma has one of the lowest mutational burdens of all malignancies, with approximately 0.5 mutations per megabase and a median of 32 coding mutations per tumour<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, and is characterized by low expression of programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par4">Tebentafusp, a first-in-class immune-mobilizing monoclonal T cell receptor (TCR) against cancer (ImmTAC), has been demonstrated in a phase 3 trial to improve overall survival in patients with previously untreated metastatic uveal melanoma when compared with investigator’s choice and represents the first therapy to demonstrate such a benefit in this disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. The overall survival at 1 year was 73% in the tebentafusp group and 59% in the control group, with a hazard ratio (HR) for death of 0.51 (95% CI: 0.37–0.71, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). These results are superior to those observed with targeted therapies such as selumetinib<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> and immune checkpoint blockade. Two single-arm studies of combined ipilimumab and nivolumab in untreated and a mixed population of untreated and previously treated patients with metastatic uveal melanoma reported 1 year overall survival rates of 52% and 56% (refs. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>), respectively, which are similar to those reported in recent meta-analyses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par5">Tebentafusp consists of a soluble affinity-enhanced TCR, specific for the gp100 peptide YLEPGPVTA–HLA-A*02:01 complexes presented on the surface of melanocytic cells, fused to an anti-CD3 single-chain variable fragment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Once bound to their target gp100–HLA complex, polyclonal T cells are recruited and activated through CD3 ligation to release cytokines and cytolytic mediators against target cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. In the first-in-human multicenter phase 1 study of tebentafusp, 3 of 15 (20%) evaluable patients with metastatic uveal melanoma achieved a partial response and 7 (47%) achieved stable disease, with an observed 1 year overall survival rate of 65% (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>). A dose–response relationship was observed, with tebentafusp doses at or exceeding the maximum tolerated dose being associated with a greater response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. The phase 1 dose escalation portion of this phase 1/2 study (IMCgp100-102) was therefore designed to identify a higher and potentially more effective recommended phase 2 dose. Using a step-up dosing regimen to mitigate acute toxicity, a recommended phase 2 dose that was 36% higher than the maximum tolerated dose identified in the first-in-human trial was achieved<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. An early analysis of safety and efficacy in these heavily pre-treated patients (<italic>n</italic> = 19) demonstrated a promising 1 year overall survival rate of 73%, despite a modest overall response rate of 11% (refs. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>), suggesting a decoupling of overall response rate as a surrogate for overall survival. This lack of correlation between overall response rate and overall survival was also observed in the tebentafusp cohort of the phase 3 trial in which the overall response rate was limited to 9% despite a very significant survival benefit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par6">A similar but less pronounced disconnect between radiographic response and overall survival has been observed in other studies of immunotherapies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, prompting efforts to identify novel and effective surrogates for treatment benefit. Recent evidence indicates that a reduction in circulating tumour DNA is associated with clinical response to treatment in many cancer settings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> and can predict benefit to immunotherapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. This is of particular importance given that activation of the immune system can lead to different kinetics of response to therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>, and commonly used radiographic treatment response assessment criteria such as the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup> may not account for response patterns associated with immune activation, limiting their applicability in such settings.</p>
              <p id="Par7">The objective of the phase 2 expansion of IMCgp100-102 was to characterize the antitumour activity of tebentafusp in patients with previously treated metastatic uveal melanoma, a patient population distinct to that enrolled in the randomized phase 3 study, and to explore the association of early ctDNA dynamics with clinical outcomes in this setting.</p>

                <p id="Par8">This open-label, international, phase 1/2 study (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02570308">NCT02570308</ext-link>) included a phase 1 dose escalation as well as an expansion cohort and was subsequently expanded into a full phase 2 study. The results of the phase 1 dose escalation portion of this study have been recently reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Patients in the phase 2 study received weekly intravenous (i.v.) tebentafusp, initially at 20 μg on day 1, 30 μg on day 8, 68 μg on day 15 and then 68 μg i.v. once weekly thereafter as the recommended phase 2 dose, with the length of a treatment cycle defined as 4 weeks (28 days). Following at least the first three infusions, patients were observed for a minimum of 16 hours for monitoring of vital signs and, if necessary, provision of supportive care. After this induction period and provided that no grade 2 or higher hypotension was noted, the observation period for tebentafusp could be reduced to 30–60 minutes. Patients with an initial assessment of progressive disease according to RECIST v1.1 (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>) could continue therapy beyond progressive disease provided that they did not have symptomatic progression requiring alternative therapy and the investigator believed that they were continuing to derive clinical benefit. After a patient was assessed as having RECIST progressive disease the treatment was continued until confirmation of immune-related progressive disease. This was defined as an additional ≥20% increase in tumour burden (that is, the sum of diameters of both target and new measurable lesions) as per the modified immune-related RECIST (irRECIST) criteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>, which were used to evaluate the response to and duration of treatment beyond progression.</p>
                <p id="Par9">The primary objective of the phase 2 study was to estimate the overall response rate based on RECIST v1.1. Secondary endpoints included safety, overall survival, progression-free survival, disease control rate (defined as the proportion of patients with either an objective response (that is, partial or complete response) or a best overall response of stable disease recorded at least 24 weeks (±1 week) after the date of the first dose of study drug), time to response, duration of response (defined as the time from the date of the first documented objective response (that is, partial or complete response) until the date of documented disease progression or death by any cause in the absence of disease progression), and the rate and duration of minor response, defined as a 10–29% reduction in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions (<xref rid="Sec10" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>). Imaging-based endpoints were assessed by blinded, independent central review. For overall survival, patients who did not die were censored on the date on which they were last known to be alive. For progression-free survival and duration of response, patients who were known to be alive and without disease progression were censored at the date on which they were last known to be progression free. To assess potential predictors of efficacy of tebentafusp, changes in serum ctDNA levels were measured using a custom panel including mutations commonly found in uveal melanoma (GNAQ Q209L/P; GNA11 Q209L; SF3B1 K700E, R625L/H/C; PLCB4 D630N/Y/V; CYSLTR2 L129Q; and EIF1AX G15D) (<xref rid="Sec10" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>).</p>

                <p id="Par10">Of the 148 HLA-A*02:01-positive patients screened, 127 patients met the eligibility criteria and were enrolled between January and December 2017 in 26 study centers in five countries (Canada, Germany, Spain, United Kingdom and United States) (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The median age was 61 years (range, 25–88 years) and 50% of patients were male (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The majority of patients (96%) had hepatic involvement. A total of 53% of patients had either American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) M1b or M1c disease and 58% of patients had a baseline lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level above the upper limit of normal (ULN). The median time from initial diagnosis to the development of metastatic disease was 3 years (range, 0–28 years) and the median and mean time since primary diagnosis to enrollment was 4.4 and 6.3 years (range, 1–28 years), respectively. All patients had received at least one prior line of therapy in the metastatic setting, with 34% receiving ≥2 lines of prior systemic (±liver-directed) therapy.

Of the 127 patients in the trial, 118 (93%) had evaluable serum samples, with most (109/118; 92%) found to have detectable ctDNA at any timepoint up to and including week 9 (baseline, week 5, week 9). A total of 99 of these 118 patients (84%) had detectable ctDNA at baseline and on treatment, of whom 94 had mutations detected in one or more uveal melanoma genes (<italic>GNAQ</italic>, <italic>GNA11</italic>, <italic>SF3B1</italic>, <italic>PLCB4</italic>, <italic>CYSLTR2</italic>) at a variant allelic frequency of &gt;0.3 at baseline and were included in the analyses (<xref rid="Sec10" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>, Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). Given that patient data were limited at week 25, this timepoint was excluded from analysis. In the subset of patients (<italic>n</italic> = 45) with both baseline ctDNA data and mutational analysis from tumour biopsies, there was good concordance: 82% of the known uveal melanoma-specific mutations in ctDNA were also found in tumour biopsies; for mutations in <italic>GNAQ/GNA11</italic> the concordance was 85% (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>), and 43 of 45 tumour samples (96%) had likely loss of one copy of <italic>BAP1</italic> (see <xref rid="Sec10" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>). However, the sensitivity of base calling in the sequencing of tumour biopsies was lower due to a lack of matched normal tissue.

However, patient numbers are small, and such an association was not observed for anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen (anti-CTLA) monotherapy or combination anti-PD1 and anti-CTL4.

A total of 29% of patients (27/94) had an increase in ctDNA by week 9, and there were no patients who did not have some change from baseline ctDNA levels (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). Twelve patients had complete ctDNA clearance (undetectable), of whom one had a partial response, seven had stable disease, three had progressive disease and one was non-evaluable by RECIST (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>). For the remaining 82 patients without ctDNA clearance, three had a partial response, 34 had stable disease, 44 had progressive disease and one was non-evaluable by RECIST (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>). The magnitude of ctDNA reduction by week 9 was strongly associated with improvement in overall survival (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.9, <italic>P</italic> = 8.89 × 10<sup>−7</sup>): a 0.1 log reduction was associated with an HR of 0.8, while a 1 log reduction was associated with an HR of 0.4, a 2 log reduction was associated with an HR of 0.2, a 3 log reduction was associated with an HR of 0.2, and ctDNA clearance was associated with an HR of 0.1 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). The 1 year overall survival rate in patients with ctDNA clearance (<italic>n</italic> = 12) was 100% compared with 52% in those with increased ctDNA (<italic>n</italic> = 27) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref> and Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">10b</xref>). Even in the subset with ≥1 log reduction in ctDNA but without clearance there was a trend for longer overall survival (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">10c</xref>). Notably, of the 47 patients with a best radiographic response of progressive disease who were also evaluable for ctDNA, one-third (<italic>n</italic> = 16) had a ≥0.5 log reduction in ctDNA by week 9, including three with ctDNA clearance; 14 patients (30%) had &lt;0.5 log reduction and 17 (36%) had increased ctDNA (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>). In these patients with progressive disease, ctDNA reduction of ≥0.5 log (including patients who cleared their ctDNA) was associated with improved overall survival, compared with patients with progressive disease with a &lt;0.5 log ctDNA reduction or ctDNA increase (HR 0.47, 95% CI: 0.22–1.01, <italic>P</italic> = 0.042; Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref> and Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">10d</xref>).

              <p id="Par24">Data from this study provide the longest follow-up of overall survival and safety of a soluble TCR therapeutic to date. The observed 1 year overall survival rate of 62% and median overall survival of 16.8 months compare very favorably with an analysis using data on a similar population of previously treated patients with metastatic uveal melanoma from a recent meta-analysis that resulted in a 1 year overall survival of 37% and a median overall survival of 7.8 months<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. These data also support the recent approval of tebentafusp for HLA-A*02:01-positive adult patients with unresectable metastatic uveal melanoma regardless of prior treatment history in the United States, European Union and United Kingdom.</p>
              <p id="Par25">In this cohort of previously treated patients, tebentafusp had a predictable and manageable safety profile supported by a very low rate (3%) of treatment discontinuation due to treatment-related adverse events and no treatment-related deaths. As observed in the phase 1 study and the recent phase 3 study, most treatment-related adverse events recorded could be classified as either skin related or cytokine mediated, consistent with tebentafusp’s proposed mechanism of action. After each of the first three doses patients need to be monitored for at least 16 hours, to facilitate prompt intervention and management when the risk for cytokine release syndrome is highest. Following the first few doses, treatment-related adverse events tend to decrease in both frequency and severity, enabling the monitoring period to be shortened to 30–60 minutes.</p>
              <p id="Par26">RECIST v1.1 underestimated the degree of clinical benefit from tebentafusp. Although the primary endpoint of overall response rate was low at 5%, 44% of patients achieved some degree of tumour shrinkage. More than 70% of all of the patients were treated beyond initial radiographic progression, and nearly half of the patients with tumour growth (≥20%) as best response were alive at 12 months. This pattern of clinical benefit is similar to what was observed in the randomized phase 3 trial of tebentafusp versus investigator’s choice in previously untreated patients with metastatic uveal melanoma, in which tebentafusp-treated patients with a best response of progressive disease had a better overall survival than patients with a best response of progressive disease on the investigator’s choice control arm (HR 0.43)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Together, these data highlight the need for new measures of clinical activity that correlate with overall survival for this new class of immuno-oncology therapy.</p>
              <p id="Par27">Higher levels of ctDNA at baseline have been shown to be correlated with tumour burden and poor prognosis, while on-treatment reductions in ctDNA are associated with improved outcomes, including prolonged progression-free survival and overall survival<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. In a recent analysis of samples from patients with 16 advanced stage tumour types treated with checkpoint inhibition (durvalumab ± tremelimumab), early on-treatment reductions in ctDNA were not only associated with improved survival but were also able to be used to differentiate responders from non-responders in patients who had radiologic stable disease at their first assessment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Likewise, in this study we observed a significant linear relationship between the level of ctDNA reduction and overall survival. Baseline ctDNA levels correlated with tumour burden and, by week 9 on tebentafusp, more than two-thirds of patients had some degree of ctDNA reduction, with greater reduction being associated with longer survival. This association was true even for patients with a best radiographic response of progressive disease, three of whom had complete ctDNA clearance, which may reflect changes in tumour size on treatment due to immune activation and infiltration into the tumour rather than frank tumour growth, as proposed for other forms of immuno-oncology therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Additionally, tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes, edema and tumour necrosis without clearance of debris could also result in the appearance of radiographic progression in the presence of ctDNA reduction or clearance.</p>
              <p id="Par28">In a study of 125 melanoma patients, Lee et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> demonstrated that ctDNA reduction had utility in identifying the nine patients with pseudoprogression and was associated with overall survival in that subset. In this study with a larger percentage of patients having long overall survival despite apparent radiographic progression, we used a quantitative approach to demonstrate that ctDNA reduction even without complete clearance can provide useful information regarding benefit from tebentafusp. These findings suggest that early reductions in ctDNA reflect tebentafusp-related activity in the tumour and may provide a more precise molecular predictor of clinical response to tebentafusp than traditional radiographic response criteria. Further studies are needed to assess how changes in ctDNA correlate with other pharmacodynamic changes including T cell infiltration into the tumour<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>, and whether other potential surrogate endpoints, such as radiomic features of tumour lesions (particularly change in tumour heterogeneity)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>, can be identified that better capture these changes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par29">Commonly used approaches for analyzing ctDNA include next-generation sequencing or digital droplet (dd) polymerase chain reaction (PCR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. Both approaches have their strengths and limitations: ddPCR can be economical but needs to be focused on known mutations and can be challenging to optimize for certain mutations. Next-generation sequencing can enable discovery of new mutations but can be less cost-effective. Here, we used multiplex PCR followed by next-generation sequencing to enable discovery of new variants and for convenience, given that it fitted into other sequencing projects ongoing in the laboratory.</p>
              <p id="Par30">Our study was limited by the absence of a control arm. To interpret the clinical findings, we compared overall survival from this study with that of published studies of first-line ipilimumab plus nivolumab as well as the Rantala et al. and the Khoja et al. meta-analyses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. We also performed a propensity score analysis that accounts for differences in baseline prognostic factors between patients in this study and patients randomized to the control arm of the phase 3 study (IMCgp100-202) who received subsequent therapy after progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. This latter dataset represents the most recent overall survival follow-up of a second line plus metastatic uveal melanoma population available in the public domain. In each case, the overall survival from previously treated metastatic uveal melanoma for patients who received tebentafusp in this study was found to be superior to the comparator.</p>
              <p id="Par31">The exploratory analysis of ctDNA levels was a retrospective hypothesis-generating analysis using samples collected from a single-arm phase 2 trial, thus limiting interpretation. These results need to be confirmed in a prospective randomized study before ctDNA dynamics on tebentafusp can be introduced to routine clinical practice to manage patient treatment.</p>
              <p id="Par32">In conclusion, tebentafusp demonstrates a promising survival benefit for patients with metastatic disease that has progressed on at least one line of prior therapy, with ctDNA as an early indicator of benefit. The addition of ctDNA analysis to assess the molecular response to treatment may provide a more sensitive means than standard imaging studies to identify those patients who will benefit most from tebentafusp treatment.</p>

The primary objective of the phase 1 portion of the study was to identify the maximum tolerated dose and determine the recommended phase 2 dose, the results of which are reported elsewhere<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. The primary objective of the phase 2 portion was to estimate the objective response rate based on RECIST v1.1 (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>) in patients treated at the recommended phase 2 dose of tebentafusp. Secondary objectives included assessment of the safety and antitumour efficacy of tebentafusp with the parameters of overall survival, progression-free survival, disease control rate (defined as the proportion of patients with either an objective response (that is, partial or complete response) or a best overall response of stable disease recorded at least 24 weeks (±1 week) after the date of first dose of study drug), time to response, duration of response (defined as the time from the date of first documented objective response (complete or partial response) until the date of documented disease progression or death by any cause in the absence of disease progression), and the rate and duration of minor response (defined as tumour response with a 10%–29% reduction in the sum of the longest diameters of the target lesions).</p>
                <p id="Par34">Patients with an initial assessment of progressive disease according to RECIST v1.1 could continue therapy beyond initial progressive disease, provided that they did not have symptomatic progression requiring alternative therapy and the investigator believed they were continuing to derive clinical benefit. The modified immune-related RECIST (irRECIST) criteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup> were used to evaluate response to treatment beyond progression. Tumour-based endpoints were assessed by a blinded, independent central review with investigator assessment data collected as a secondary evaluation. To assess potential predictors of the efficacy of tebentafusp, change in serum ctDNA level in response to treatment was also measured.</p>

                <p id="Par36">Tebentafusp was given intravenously using a step-up weekly dosing regimen that was optimized during the phase 1 portion of the study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. In this phase 2 portion of the study, all patients received 20 μg on cycle 1 day 1 (C1D1), 30 μg on cycle 1 day 8 (C1D8), and then the recommended phase 2 dose of 68 μg on cycle 1 day 15 (C1D15) and weekly thereafter in cycles of 4 weeks (28 days). Following at least the first three infusions, patients were observed for a minimum of 16 h for monitoring of vital signs and, if necessary, provision of supportive care. After this induction period and provided that no grade 2 or higher hypotension was noted, the observation period for tebentafusp could be reduced to 30–60 min. Treatment continued until confirmation of disease progression as per the modified irRECIST Criteria, intolerable toxicity, investigator decision, or patient withdrawal of consent. The modification to irRECIST was to redefine confirmed immune-related progressive disease as unequivocal progression of non-target lesions and/or new non-measurable disease or an additional 20% increase in tumour burden (that is, the sum of diameters of both the target and measurable new lesions) from the initial progressive disease assessment per RECIST v1.1 rather than from the nadir. An independent data monitoring committee was established to provide oversight of safety and efficacy considerations and to give advice and recommendations regarding steps to ensure both patient safety and the ethical integrity of the study. Radiologic assessments were performed every 8 weeks from C1D1 until C11D1 (40 weeks), then every 12 weeks until progressive disease as per RECIST v1.1, immune-related progressive disease as per the modified irRECIST for patients who continued treatment beyond progressive disease per RECIST v1.1, or discontinuation of study drug.</p>

                <p id="Par38">Serum samples collected at baseline and at weeks 5, 9 and 25 on treatment were used to assess the ctDNA level. The analysis focused on mutations up to and including the week 9 on-treatment timepoint given that patient data were sparse at the week 25 timepoint. A custom panel of mutations commonly found in uveal melanoma was designed to assess changes in ctDNA (Natera; Supplementary Data Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). Using a panel-based ctDNA approach as in this study, the assessment of BAP1 copy number loss and mutations is very challenging because they can be spread across the gene, without a hotspot. Moreover, genomic studies indicated that BAP1 alterations (copy number loss or mutations) are almost always present in the context of other uveal melanoma mutations, particularly GNAQ or GNA11 (refs. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>), which are well-covered by the ctDNA panel used here.

Paired end fragments of 100 bp in length were sequenced (50 million reads per sample) using the Illumina NovaSeq system. The resulting reads were aligned using BWA-MEM (Burrows–Wheeler aligner – maximal exact match) v0.7.15. Reads were mapped to the GRCh38 primary assembly provided by Ensembl.

An exploratory overall survival analysis compared patients in this study with patients from the control arm of a randomized study in front-line metastatic uveal melanoma who had progressive disease and received subsequent systemic therapy in a second-line setting according to a statistical analysis plan developed before the analysis took place. Given that patient-level data were available for that analysis, a propensity score model and inverse probability of treatment weights were applied to the Kaplan–Meier estimates. The weighting strategy used was the average treatment effect of the treated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>, whereby tebentafusp patients from this study received a weight of 1.0 and the patients who received other systemic therapies received a weight of <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>/(1−<italic>p</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>), where <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> represents the probability of receiving tebentafusp according to the propensity score model for the <italic>i</italic>-th patient.

Tumour size was measured as the sum of longest diameters or short axis of the target lesions according to RECIST v1.1 by Independent Central Review. Best percent change in target lesion size was the maximum percent reduction from baseline or the minimum percent increase from baseline (in the absence of a reduction), up until disease progression or starting subsequent alternative cancer therapy. Complete response, partial response or minor response required confirmation at least 4 weeks later. Reference lines at 20%, -10%, and -30% mark target lesion response criteria for disease progression (PD), minor response (MR), and partial response (PR), respectively. SD, stable disease. <bold>(b)</bold> Overall survival in months is plotted for each patient (n = 116). 61.2% of patients survived more than 12 months. + denotes censored. (A-B) Only patients with at least one evaluable post-baseline target lesion scan were included. Eleven patients overall were not included due to non-measurable disease at baseline or no evaluable post-baseline target lesion scans. Evaluable post-baseline scans must be on or prior to disease progression or starting subsequent alternative cancer therapy to be considered.</p>

Using Propensity Scoring methods (IPTW), control patients in the IMCgp100-202 phase 3 study who received standard of care 2 L therapies were weighted so that, overall, they are similar with respect to their baseline prognostic factors to the tebentafusp-treated patients from this study (102). The primary analysis involving 2 L + patients from Study 102 compared to control patients in Study 202 who received any systemic therapy as their 2 L treatment resulted in an HR (95% CI) of 0.40 (0.29, 0.55). The hazard ratio was derived from a weighted Cox proportional hazards model and the 95% confidence interval was derived using robust sandwich estimation from the weighted Cox model.
