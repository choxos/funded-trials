              <abstract>
                <p>Multiple myeloma (MM) cells are responsible for aberrant osteoclast (OC) activation. However, when cocultured monocytes, but not OC precursors, with MM cells, we made a novel observation that MM cells inhibited receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL)-induced increase of OC differentiation, OC gene expression, signaling pathways and bone resorption activity. Our results showed that MM cells produced multiple inhibitory cytokines of osteoclastogenesis, such as IL-10, which activated STAT3 signaling and induce OC inhibition. However, cocultures of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) reversed MM-induced OC inhibition. We found that MM cells increased production of MCP-1 from BMSCs and BMSC-derived MCP-1 enhanced OC formation. Mechanistic studies showed that IL-10 downregulated RANK expression in monocytes and thus, inhibited RANKL-induced OC formation. In contrast, MCP-1 upregulated RANK expression and thus, enhanced OC formation. Overall, our studies for the first time demonstrated that MM cell have inhibitory effects on osteoclastogenesis by producing inhibitory cytokines. Our results further indicate that activation of osteoclastogenesis in bone marrow requests the crosstalk of MM cells, BMSCs and their produced cytokines. Thus, our studies provide evidences that targeting bone marrow microenvironmental cells and/or cytokines may be a new approach to treating MM bone destruction.</p>

Osteoclast (OC)-mediated bone resorption is crucial for normal bone homeostasis, and also plays a causative role in osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis, Paget disease, multiple myeloma (MM), and bone metastasis of breast cancers[<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. OCs, which are essentially effector cells for resorbing bone tissue, arise from hematopoietic monocytic precursors within the bone marrow cavity[<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. During OC differentiation, associated genes such as those for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP), calcitonin-related polypeptide alpha (CALCA) and CALCA receptor (CALCR), cathepsin K (CTSK), β3-integrin, and ATP-dependent proton pump subunit 18 are encoded and expressed[<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Mature OCs can polarize and adhere to bone matrix, induce actin ring formation, acidify bone surface, and release osteolytic enzymes to resorb bone tissue[<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Recent studies showed that multiple cytokines and chemokines, produced primarily by bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs), osteoblasts, and activated immune cells, regulate osteoclastogenesis[<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. For example, receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) ligand (RANKL) and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) activate OC differentiation and bone resorption activity, while RANKL decoy receptor osteoprotegerin (OPG) inhibits RANKL effects[<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. </p>
              <p>Bone destruction is a hallmark of MM. More than 80% of patients with MM develop osteolytic bone destruction that causes pathological fractures, bone pain, and hypercalcemia[<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Recent studies showed that MM cells are responsible for activation of osteoclastogenesis. MM cells upregulate RANKL production and downregulate OPG production from BMSCs[<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Moreover, MM cells express and release RANKL to the microenvironment. Increased RANKL levels and decreased OPG levels disrupt OPG/RANKL balance and induce enhanced OC differentiation and bone resorption activity[<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>-<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. MM cells also express multiple cytokines and chemokines, such as interleukin (IL)-3, IL-7, monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1α, and parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP), all of which enhance OC differentiation and activity in a RANKL-dependent or -independent manner[<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Furthermore, cocultures of MM cells have been shown to induce mature OC formation from monocyte-derived OC precursors (preOCs)[<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. However, the mechanism underlying increased OC differentiation and activity induced by MM cells remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that cocultures with MM cells inhibit RANKL-induced OC differentiation from monocytes but not from preOCs, and elucidate a novel mechanism whereby bone marrow osteoclastogenesis is influenced by crosstalk between MM cells, BMSCs, and derived cytokines.</p>

                <p>The method for generating OCs <italic>in vitro</italic> has been described previously[<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Briefly, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained from healthy donor buffy coats (Gulf Coast Regional Blood Center, TX) by Ficoll-Paque (GE Healthcare, WI) density gradient centrifugation.

PreOCs were then cultured in medium with M-CSF (25 ng/mL) and RANKL (50 ng/mL) for another 7 days to obtain multinuclear (&gt;3 nuclei) TRAP<sup>+</sup> mature OCs. The numbers of multinuclear TRAP<sup>+</sup> OCs per well of 24-well plate were counted. </p>
                <p>In cocultures, CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes (5 × 10<sup>5</sup>/mL) were seeded in culture wells, and MM cells (2 × 10<sup>5</sup>/mL) were coseeded in culture wells or separately seeded in transwell inserts. In some cocultures, BMSCs (5 × 10<sup>5</sup>/mL) were also coseeded with MM cells in transwell inserts. Cells were cultured in M-CSF-containing medium with or without RANKL for 14 days. BMSCs were generated from the bone marrow aspirates of MM patients or healthy donors or were generated from human healthy fetal bones in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. </p>
                <p>TRAP staining for detection of mature OCs was performed with the Leukocyte Acid Phosphatase kit (Sigma-Aldrich, MO) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Quantitative measurement of active isoform TRAP 5b was done using BoneTRAP® Assay (Immunodiagnostic Systems Inc., Scottsdale, AZ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.</p>

                <title>MM cells have an inhibitory effect on OC formation from monocytes</title>
                <p>Previous studies showed that RANKL, an activator of osteoclastogenesis, enhances OC differentiation and activity in vitro [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], and MM cells produce RANKL [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>-<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In lines with previous results, without RANKL, few preOCs or monocytes could differentiate into mature OCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082453-g001">Figure <bold>1A, 1B</bold>
</xref>). In the presence of RANKL, CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes, the progenitors of OCs, develop into preOCs in a 7-day culture. PreOCs further develop into mature OCs with RANKL after additional 7 days of culturing. In addition, cocultures of MM cells without RANKL induced mature OC formation from preOCs, and with presence of RANKL OC differentiation is further enhanced, in lines with previous studies[<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Interestingly, if monocytes were cocultured with MM cells in the presence of RANKL (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0082453.s001">Figure <bold>S1A</bold>
</xref>), the generation of mature OCs was partly inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082453-g001">Figure <bold>1B</bold>
</xref>). Cocultures of MM cells without RANKL could not induce OC formation from monocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082453-g001">Figure <bold>1B</bold>
</xref>). TRAP staining showed that the addition of RANKL resulted in large numbers of mature OCs, characterized as TRAP<sup>+</sup> multinuclear (&gt;3 nuclei) cells, while cocultures of monocytes with MM cells in medium with RANKL significantly reduced the numbers of mature OCs, and without RANKL formed few of mature OCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082453-g001">Figure <bold>1B</bold>
</xref>). Cocultures of all tested primary MM cells isolated from 10 MM patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082453-g001">Figure <bold>1C</bold>
</xref>) and 6 MM cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082453-g001">Figure <bold>1D</bold>

                <p>In addition, we examined signaling pathways in monocytes during OC differentiation. We focused on NF-κB, PI3K/Akt, ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK, because these signaling pathways are important for RANKL-induced OC differentiation[<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082453-g002">Figure <bold>2C</bold>
</xref>, addition of RANKL upregulated the levels of phosphorylated NF-κB, JNK, ERK and p38 MAPK but not Akt. However, cocultures of ARP-1 or MM.1S cells significantly repressed kinase phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082453-g002">Figure <bold>2C</bold>
</xref>). The levels of nonphosphorylated kinases (data not shown) and β-actin protein were unchanged. There are several hallmarks of transcription factors for OC differentiation, such as c-fos, NFATc1, and PU.1, and their relative expression levels were evaluated by real-time PCR. In our system, NFATc1 expression played a major role in RANKL-mediated OC differentiation, and its level was greatly reduced in the presence of APR-1, MM.1S, RPMI-8266, or U266 cells as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082453-g002">Figure <bold>2D</bold>
</xref>, indicating a repressed OC differentiation by MM cells.</p>
                <p>To assess whether the decrease in OC formation in cocultures of MM cells was accompanied by a decrease in OC bone resorption activity, we measured the levels of TRAP 5b activity, which reflects OC-induced bone resorption activity, in the same experimental settings as described above. The addition of RANKL induced high levels of TRAP 5b activity, while cocultures with MM cells, including primary MM cells from 10 MM patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082453-g002">Figure <bold>2E</bold>
</xref>) and 6 MM cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082453-g002">Figure <bold>2F</bold>

An array containing specific antibodies for 48 cytokines or chemokines, the majority of which are known regulators of osteoclastogenesis, was incubated with these media. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082453-g003">Figure 3B and 3C</xref>, the levels of eight cytokines were higher in ARP-1-conditioned medium than those in medium containing no cell cultures. Reverse transcription PCR confirmed the array results and further showed that the mRNA levels of IL-8, IL-10, MCP-1, IFN-γ, thrombopoietin and angiogenin but not VEGF, RANTES, were expressed in the majority of primary MM cells and MM cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082453-g004">Figure <bold>4A</bold>

                <p>On the basis of these results, we focused on IL-10 and IL-8 to further verify the role and mechanism of MM-produced cytokines in MM-induced OC inhibition. We collected conditioned media of ARP-1 and U266 cells because ARP-1 cells secreted high, but U266 cells secreted low levels of IL-10, and both cell types secreted similar low levels of IL-8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082453-g004">Figure <bold>4C</bold>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>This study has demonstrated for the first time that MM cells inhibit RANKL-induced OC differentiation, OC gene expression, and bone resorption activity from monocytes and repress RANKL-induced NF-κB, ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK signaling pathways by producing several inhibitory cytokines, such as IL-10. Cocultures of BMSCs reversed MM inhibitory effects on osteoclastogenesis by upregulating MCP-1 production from BMSCs. Crosstalk between MM cells, BMSCs, and monocytes affected RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis through regulation of RANK expression on monocytes by MCP-1 secreted by these cells and MM-derived IL-10.</p>
              <p>Enhanced osteoclastogenesis and progressive bone-destructive lesions occur during MM cell growth in bone marrow. Previous studies showed that MM cells enhance osteoclastogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Yaccoby et al reported that MM cells upregulate mature OC formation from preOCs generated from monocytes in a 2-4 day coculture in medium with the addition of RANKL, M-CSF, and dexamethasone[<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Other studies showed that cocultures of preOCs with MM cells induce OC formation in either the presence or the absence of BMSCs[<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. As OCs originate from monocytic lineage cells existing in the bloodstream and bone marrow, the role of MM cells in OC formation directly from monocytes was not known. This study has demonstrated for the first time that cocultures of MM cells with monocytes, but not preOCs, inhibit mature OC formation even in the presence of RANKL. However, cocultures of monocytes with both MM cells and BMSCs reversed MM inhibitory effects and restored RANKL effects on OC differentiation and activity. Osteoclastogenesis activation induced by MM cells is likely a result of interplay between monocytes, MM cells, and BMSCs within bone marrow. These findings indicate that BMSCs play an important role in osteoclastogenesis activation. </p>
              <p>Previous studies showed that RANKL plays a central role in OC activation. Addition of RANKL has been shown to induce OC differentiation and bone resorption activity in vitro[<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. BMSCs, osteoblasts and activated T cells express and release RANKL to the bone marrow microenvironment [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Moreover, MM cells stimulate BMSC production and release of RANKL and other cytokines, such as MIP-1α, VEGF, TNFα, MCP-1, stromal cell-derived factor-1, IL-3, and IL-7, into the bone marrow microenvironment, and in turn these cytokines enhance OC differentiation and activity in a RANKL-dependent or -independent manner[<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>-<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. BTK inhibitor PCI-32765 has been shown to be able to block RANKL/M-CSF-induced phosphorylation of Btk and downstream PLC-γ2 in OCs, and diminish TRAP 5b and bone resorption activity [<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In addition, MM cells also produced multiple cytokines that involve in OC activation, such as PTHrP. Elevated levels of PTHrP were reported in a number of clinical myeloma cases, and recent studies by Cafforio et al. have found that both the full-length molecule and NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal fragment of PTHrP reinforces the production of osteoclastogenic factors RANKL and MCP-1, thus activate osteoclastogenesis [<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. On the other hand, several cytokines play a negative role in osteoclastogenesis. For example, OPG has been shown to disrupt RANKL-induced OC activation[<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In patients, production of OPG from BMSCs is reduced by MM cells[<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Our studies identified several OC-inhibitory cytokines expressed and secreted by MM cells, such as IL-10, angiogenin, and thrombopoietin, which inhibited osteoclastogenesis. Antibodies against these cytokines enhanced OC formation. These findings indicate that MM cells express and secrete both stimulatory cytokines such as RANKL and inhibitory cytokines such as IL-10, angiogenin, and thrombopoietin, which work in a complementary manner in regulating osteoclastogenesis in bone marrow.</p>
              <p>IL-10 is an inflammatory cytokine involved in immunosuppression[<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Previous studies showed that IL-10 stimulates RANKL production from BMSCs in vitro and activates osteoclastogenesis in vivo[<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. However, IL-10 upregulates STAT3 and downregulates NF-κB, leading to OC inhibition[<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Our results showed that all tested MM cell lines and primary MM cells from MM patients produced high levels of IL-10. Addition of anti-IL-10 antibody enhanced OC formation in cocultures of monocytes with MM cells via STAT3 activation. Furthermore, our study elucidates a novel mechanism that MM-derived IL-10 inhibited RANKL-induced OC differentiation from monocytes by downregulating RANK expression. These results indicate that there is a feedback loop in IL-10-induced osteoclastogenesis, in which IL-10 upregulates RANKL production, but downregulates RANK expression and inhibits RANKL-induced OC differentiation and activity. </p>
              <p>MCP-1 is a chemokine that recruits monocytes, T cells, and dendritic cells to sites of infection or tissue injury. Previous studies have shown that MCP-1 promotes the fusion of hematopoietic precursors to mature OCs [<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], rescues granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor-induced OC inhibition [<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], and determines OC activity by binding to receptor CCR2 [<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. MCP-1 can be secreted from monocytes [<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] and BMSCs [<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], and its levels are upregulated by RANKL during osteoclastogenesis [<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Moreover, we previously found that MM cells also secreted low levels of MCP-1, and MM-derived MCP-1 involved in OC differentiation [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. ELISA results showed that MM cells ARP-1 produced around 500 pg/ml of MCP-1in cultured media. However, we also observed that in the presence of both BMSCs and ARP-1 cells, the levels of MCP-1 in cultured media increased more than 5-fold, which is much higher than that of ARP-1 cells alone or BMSC alone, indicating a synergistic effect from the combination presence of BMSCs and MM cells.</p>
              <p>The OC inhibition induced by MM cells, MM-derived IL-10, or other MM-derived inhibitory cytokines was quenched in the presence of BMSCs. In vitro cocultures of monocytes with MM cells and BMSCs created a mimicking of MM-bearing bone marrow in vivo. In cocultures of these cells, the osteoclastogenesis-suppressive function of IL-10 was reversed by BMSC-derived MCP-1. Mechanistic study showed that addition of IL-10 downregulated RANK expression in monocytes, while addition of anti-IL-10 antibody to cocultures of monocytes and MM cells enhanced RANK expression. In contrast, addition of MCP-1 upregulated RANK expression, while addition of anti-MCP-1 antibody to cocultures of monocytes, MM cells, and BMSCs reduced RANK expression. These results indicate that the regulation of RANK levels in monocytes by MM-derived IL-10 and BMSC-derived MCP-1 affects activation of osteoclastogenesis by RANKL. However, the integrative mechanism through which the IL-10- and MCP-1-activated signaling pathways regulate RANK gene and surface protein expression warrant further investigation. </p>
