              <abstract>
                <p>Despite the positive health effect of physical activity, one third of the world’s population is estimated to be insufficiently active. Prior research has mainly investigated physical activity on an aggregate level over short periods of time, e.g., during 3 to 7 days at baseline and a few months later, post-intervention. To develop effective interventions, we need a better understanding of the temporal dynamics of physical activity. We proposed here an approach to studying walking behavior at “high-resolution” and by capturing the idiographic and day-to-day changes in walking behavior. We analyzed daily step count among 151 young adults with overweight or obesity who had worn an accelerometer for an average of 226 days (~25,000 observations). We then used a recursive partitioning algorithm to characterize patterns of change, here sudden behavioral gains and losses, over the course of the study. These behavioral gains or losses were defined as a 30% increase or reduction in steps relative to each participants’ median level of steps lasting at least 7 days. After the identification of gains and losses, fluctuation intensity in steps from each participant’s individual time series was computed with a dynamic complexity algorithm to identify potential early warning signals of sudden gains or losses. Results revealed that walking behavior change exhibits discontinuous changes that can be described as sudden gains and losses. On average, participants experienced six sudden gains or losses over the study. We also observed a significant and positive association between critical fluctuations in walking behavior, a form of early warning signals, and the subsequent occurrence of sudden behavioral losses in the next days. Altogether, this study suggests that walking behavior could be well understood under a dynamic paradigm. Results also provide support for the development of “just-in-time adaptive” behavioral interventions based on the detection of early warning signals for sudden behavioral losses.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>It is widely recognized that physical activity directly protects against the development and exacerbation of non-communicable diseases and mental health issues, and improves quality of life [<xref rid="pone.0251659.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Physical activity is also, in some forms such as active transportation, a key contributor to climate change mitigation and air pollution reduction, which indirectly protect population health [<xref rid="pone.0251659.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Despite these positive effects, one third of the world’s population is estimated to be insufficiently active and, so far, the promotion of physical activity globally has been described as “<italic>largely unsuccessful</italic>” [<xref rid="pone.0251659.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Although several explanations for this relative failure have been proposed (see for example [<xref rid="pone.0251659.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0251659.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]), little prior research has been conducted to understand the day-to-day, “high-resolution”, and long-term changes in physical activity behavior, despite clear theoretical and practical benefits to do so. Indeed, gaining a better understanding of the resolution of change could provide important information to refine current physical activity guidelines and theories to reflect a more dynamic perspective and, ultimately, inform new forms of quasi-real time physical activity interventions [<xref rid="pone.0251659.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0251659.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The present study aimed to improve our understanding of day-to-day changes in physical activity within individuals over several months. Notably, this study focuses on walking behavior, a central component of physical activity and an accessible, inexpensive and low-impact means for individuals to meet national and international physical activity guidelines [<xref rid="pone.0251659.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0251659.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p>
              <sec id="sec002">
                <title>Physical activity behavior changes</title>
                <p>Evaluation of physical activity interventions typically incorporate measurement bursts, i.e., regular measurement of physical activity for 3 to 7 days, that are dispersed across time, such as immediately before taking part in an intervention, immediately after an “intervention phase”, and, occasionally, a few weeks or months after the intervention is completed (e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0251659.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]). Using this measurement approach, physical activity levels within each measurement burst are often aggregated at the weekly level (e.g., minutes/week of moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity), and insight into the high-resolution day-to-day variations in physical activity removed through aggregation [<xref rid="pone.0251659.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. As both a cause and consequence to this methodological paradigm, physical activity changes have been mostly conceptualized as a relatively linear and deterministic process (e.g., “the <italic>adoption and maintenance</italic> paradigm”; [<xref rid="pone.0251659.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0251659.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]). Nonetheless, recent studies adopting continuous measures of physical activity via accelerometry and investigating the within-person variability in that behavior have shown that physical activity levels can vary extensively within individuals over time and across different contexts [<xref rid="pone.0251659.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0251659.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. To date, no studies have characterized the within-person patterns of change in physical activity over several months; however, recent findings speak to the possibility that physical activity fluctuates in a potentially strong irregular fashion at the individual level [<xref rid="pone.0251659.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0251659.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p>
                <p>In this regard, complex systems theory offers a unique framework to characterize and understand dynamics and discontinuous/irregular patterns of change in human behavior [<xref rid="pone.0251659.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0251659.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0251659.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0251659.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. According to this theoretical framework, complex systems can experience abrupt and discontinuous changes from one stable state to another over time (e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0251659.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]). These changes are sometimes referred to as <italic>abrupt shifts</italic>, <italic>order transitions</italic> or <italic>sudden gains and losses</italic> ([<xref rid="pone.0251659.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]; we will henceforth refer to them using this last term). Numerous examples of sudden gains and losses in complex systems exist in the literature, from asthma attacks [<xref rid="pone.0251659.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], shifts in motivational flow [<xref rid="pone.0251659.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], improvements or aggravations of symptoms in individuals with depression, mood and/or anxiety disorders [<xref rid="pone.0251659.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], and, at a broader level, forms of societal collapse [<xref rid="pone.0251659.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] or climatic change [<xref rid="pone.0251659.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In the health behavioral science literature, recent studies found that sleep stage transitions [<xref rid="pone.0251659.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], as well as sedentary behaviors (i.e., time spent sitting) [<xref rid="pone.0251659.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], were characterized by such irregular patterns of change. More volitional behaviors, such as daily changes in alcohol consumption, have also been successfully modelled with methods allowing the consideration of non-linearity and non-stationarity [<xref rid="pone.0251659.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Although there have been prior and recent calls to study the dynamics of physical activity behavior changes through the lens of complex systems theory [<xref rid="pone.0251659.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0251659.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], empirical investigations are lacking for this behavior.</p>
              </sec>
              <sec id="sec003">
                <title>Early warning signals for sudden behavioral changes</title>
                <p>Beyond characterizing the dynamic nature of behavior change processes, early findings suggest that sudden gains and losses in complex systems can sometimes be predicted via <italic>early warning signals</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0251659.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0251659.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. One kind of signal corresponds to the presence of critical fluctuations in the behavior, as observed within time series data from a given system (e.g., an individual), which can be interpreted as an indicator of an imminent sudden gain or loss [<xref rid="pone.0251659.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. For example, research conducted within the psychotherapy setting showed that sudden gains and losses in symptom severity in individuals diagnosed with a mood disorder could be predicted by critical fluctuations in measures of the therapeutic process a few days before each transition [<xref rid="pone.0251659.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. This study used scores of <italic>dynamic complexity</italic> to quantify the amount of fluctuation [<xref rid="pone.0251659.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The authors reported a positive and significant association between different dynamic complexity indicators and subsequent occurrence of sudden gains and losses [<xref rid="pone.0251659.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Notably, this study found that greater fluctuations in measures of the therapeutic process were prospectively associated with the occurrence of sudden gains and losses in the next few days (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0251659.g001">Fig 1</xref> for a conceptual illustration of this process). The detection of behavioral fluctuations, quantified by indicators of dynamic complexity, thus represents a potentially useful way for clinicians and intervention designers to anticipate sudden behavioral gains and losses before they occur [<xref rid="pone.0251659.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Applied to physical activity, the early prediction of imminent behavioral transitions represents a potentially valuable signal for delivering interventions “just-in-time” [<xref rid="pone.0251659.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p>

Work in critical transitions across various systems indicate that instability can be observed shortly before a phase transition; increases in dynamic complexity can thus be seen as a form of early warning signal for either sudden gains and/or losses in a given system [<xref rid="pone.0251659.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0251659.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].

                <p>It is theoretically plausible that physical activity behavior is usefully described from a complex systems perspective; however, there is a paucity of empirical work to test this assumption. If empirical work suggests that there are inherent sudden gains and losses, and potential complexity, in physical activity changes within individuals over time, then that would have important implications for physical activity research methods, theories, and interventions. If strong discontinuous patterns of change are observed, then the current measurement approach, which largely relies on snapshots of behavior across time, would be demonstrably insufficient to understand behavioral dynamics. Consequently, there would be a need to move from low- to high-resolution physical activity assessments [<xref rid="pone.0251659.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. If results illustrate discontinuous patterns of change, this would also establish the need for behavioral theories of physical activity that better account for the dynamic, discontinuous and potentially complex nature of physical activity [<xref rid="pone.0251659.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0251659.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Finally, in regard to interventions, if the sudden gains and losses exist, the capacity to identify early warning signals for these state shifts in physical activity would be highly valuable for realizing and optimizing just-in-time adaptive interventions [<xref rid="pone.0251659.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In particular, critical fluctuations, characterized by an increase in dynamic complexity, could be used to identify states of vulnerability, opportunity, or “teachable moments” for individuals (i.e., periods in which individuals would benefit from support if they are receptive to it [<xref rid="pone.0251659.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0251659.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]).</p>

                <p>This study aimed to (<italic>i</italic>) characterize within-person, day-to-day patterns of change in physical activity (i.e., daily step count); and (<italic>ii</italic>) examine whether critical fluctuations in walking behavior, expressed as a dynamic complexity score, were associated with the subsequent occurrence of a sudden gain or loss in the following days. Based on previous literature in psychology and behavioral sciences, we expected to observe discontinuous patterns of change in walking behavior within individuals, including sudden gains and losses preceded and followed by relatively stable behavioral states (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0251659.g001">Fig 1</xref>, upper panel). We also expected heterogeneity in state transitions between participants, with participants experiencing either few or many sudden gains and losses. Second, we expected a significant and positive association between dynamic complexity (derived from the observation of fluctuations in walking behavior) and the subsequent occurrence of a sudden gain or loss in the following days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0251659.g001">Fig 1</xref>, lower panel).</p>

                <p>Data on walking behavior (i.e., daily step count) were collected with a Fitbit Charge 3 (Fitbit Inc, San Francisco, CA, USA).

                <p>Steps are estimated from the Fitbit via triaxial accelerometry measuring gravitational acceleration in the anterior-posterior [x], cranial-caudal [y], and medial-lateral [z] planes. It should be noted that this indicator of physical activity (i.e., step count) was chosen over other metrics offered by the device (e.g., physical activity intensity) because the estimation of steps from Fitbit sensors range from good to excellent in comparison with direct observation [<xref rid="pone.0251659.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], while the validity of other metrics remains questionable [<xref rid="pone.0251659.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].

                  <title>Characterization of gains and losses</title>
                  <p>Following the approach applied by Olthof et al. (2020), we used a recursive partitioning algorithm to characterize within-person behavioral changes over the course of the study using regression trees from the package <italic>rpart</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0251659.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] for the R software environment [<xref rid="pone.0251659.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Regression trees enable to identify nodes and partition a continuous variable y in recursive splits based on different predictors. In the present study, we partitioned the variable steps based on the progressive day of the intervention as predictor. Once we identified the splits for the variable steps for each participant separately, we classified them as gain or losses if they met additional criteria defined on the basis of previous research. Specifically, sudden gains and losses were defined as a shift toward a lower (loss) or higher (gain) number of steps over time, provided that two conditions (i.e., criteria) were simultaneously met:</p>

                    <list-item>
                      <p>Based on past research from our group [<xref rid="pone.0251659.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0251659.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], gains or losses for each participant were defined as a 30% increase or reduction in steps relative to the median number of steps, as assessed over the study period. For example, for a participant with a median of 7000 steps/day, a sudden gain was defined as an increase greater than 2100 steps per day (+30%) compared with the median, while a sudden loss was defined as a drop greater than 2100 steps per day (-30%) compared with the median. We used the median number of steps instead of the mean to manage potential skewed step count distributions at the individual level.</p>

                      <p>In addition to these +/- 30% criteria, and to control for known differences in walking behavior between weekends and weekdays [<xref rid="pone.0251659.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], sudden gains and losses had to be observed for stable periods of at least 7 days during which no further shifts in step count occurred. In other words, these changes of +/- 30% had to last at least 7 days, otherwise they were not classified as sudden gains or losses. Consequently, periods of high variability in steps without a stable period of at least 7 days (i.e., changes greater than +/- 30% from one day to another) were not classified as sudden gains or losses with our algorithm.</p>

                  <title>Local dynamic complexity calculation</title>
                  <p>After the identification of gains and losses, dynamic complexity was estimated from the fluctuations in the steps times series. We used for this purpose an algorithm designed specifically to identify critical fluctuations in time series and implemented with the R package <italic>casnet</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0251659.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].</p>
                  <p>The dynamic complexity score is the product of a fluctuation measure, <italic>F</italic>, and a distribution parameter, <italic>D</italic>, for each unit of the time series (here, each day). The fluctuation measure, <italic>F</italic>, is sensitive to the amplitude and frequency of change in the time series, with <italic>F</italic> being at its maximum when the dynamics of the data vary from one observation to another with large (e.g., between the minimum and maximum values of the outcome) and regular frequency. The distribution parameter, <italic>D</italic>, measures the deviance of the data points from the range of possible values within the time series. This parameter increases when irregular changes from one observation to another occur (see [<xref rid="pone.0251659.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]).</p>
                  <p>The two measures, <italic>F</italic> and <italic>D</italic>, were computed from moving time windows over the course of the time series. Based on previous literature [<xref rid="pone.0251659.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0251659.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], we used a backward 7-day overlapping window, which means that <italic>F</italic> and <italic>D</italic> for a particular day <italic>n</italic> was computed on the basis of fluctuations in walking behavior in the past 7 days. In other words, the scores for day <italic>n</italic> was computed based on the aggregation fluctuation intensity in the past 7 days, between day <italic>n</italic>-7 and day <italic>n</italic>.</p>
                  <p>The dynamic complexity score (<italic>F</italic> x <italic>D</italic>) was then used to derive a continuous predictor of sudden gains and losses called <italic>local dynamic complexity</italic>. This score reflects the highest complexity score (<italic>F</italic> x <italic>D</italic>) in the 3 days preceding a possible gain or loss (as conceptually illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0251659.g001">Fig 1</xref>, lower panel, day #14). This 3-day time window was chosen based on previous literature [<xref rid="pone.0251659.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and because, theoretically, critical fluctuations are likely to appear a few days before a sudden gain or loss (although please see the sensitivity analyses in the Results section with varying time windows).</p>

Further, the effect of time between events (e.g. sudden gains, losses and the start of data collection) was modeled by including a “duration indicator”, i.e. the number of days passed between events. The inclusion of this duration indicator is essential in event-history analyses to (<italic>i</italic>) control for censored cases (i.e., participants who did not experience a sudden gain or loss within the observation period) and (<italic>ii</italic>) reliably estimate cases with multiple sudden gains or losses [<xref rid="pone.0251659.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Similar models were then conducted separately for the occurrence of gains (1 = occurrence of a sudden gain; 0 = no sudden gain) and losses (1 = occurrence of a sudden loss; 0 = no sudden loss).

This result was driven by a positive association between local dynamic complexity score and sudden losses, <italic>OR</italic> = 1.44, 95%CI [1.28, 1.58]. Indeed, an increase in local dynamic complexity of 1 <italic>SD</italic> relates to 44% increased odds of experiencing a transition to lower physical activity levels. In contrast, local dynamic complexity tended to be negatively related (although not statistically significant) with behavioral gains, <italic>OR</italic> = 0.88, 95%CI [0.76, 1.00]. Time (i.e., the progressive number of days from the start of data collection) was negatively associated with the occurrence of both types of behavioral shifts, indicating that sudden gains and losses were less likely to occur at the end of the data collection period compared with the beginning. In contrast, duration (i.e., the number of days between events) was positively associated with the occurrence of both types of behavioral shifts, indicating that the longer the time since the beginning of the study or a prior gain or loss, the more likely it is that a participant will experience a sudden gain or loss.</p>

However, fluctuations in one’s daily step count is not significantly associated with the odds of observing a sudden gain of at least 30% compared with one’s usual step count in the next three days, lasting for at least a week (see <xref rid="pone.0251659.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Findings from this study provide new empirical insights into the idiographic, day-to-day, changes in walking behavior over time in participants of a weight loss program. Regarding our first objective, the results revealed that, when analyzed at the daily-level, walking behavior exhibits discontinuous changes that can be described as sudden gains and losses, as conceptualized in complexity theory. Indeed, on average participants to this study experienced six sudden gains and losses of at least +/-30% of their individual steps level over a mean period of 226 days. Results also show heterogeneity in the patterns of change in walking behavior, with participants experiencing between 0 and up to 14 behavioral gains or losses during the study period. Regarding our second objective, significant associations between critical fluctuations in walking behavior, characterized here as increases in local dynamic complexity, and the subsequent occurrence of sudden gains and losses in the next three days were observed. Notably, increased local dynamic complexity was predictive of increased odds of sudden losses. The odds of having a sudden loss was 43% higher after an increase in local dynamic complexity. Overall, these findings provide early empirical support of our hypotheses that walking behavior is subject to irregular, day-to-day changes and that sudden losses can be anticipated with some accuracy from the analyses of critical fluctuations computed from physical activity behavior two to four days previous.</p>
              <p>The first set of results (i.e., the identification of sudden gains and losses), is in accordance with both (<italic>i</italic>) previous empirical results, showing that psychological, physiological, social and behavioral systems, when observed at a high-resolution, might changes in a discontinuous fashion (e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0251659.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0251659.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]), and (<italic>ii</italic>) complex systems theory assumptions, which postulate that any natural system is “bubbling” with change and tends to evolve in a non-stable manner [<xref rid="pone.0251659.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Our observations thus provide support for several recent position papers arguing that changes in health behaviors can be fruitfully studied with research designs, methods, and statistics that reflect these behavioral dynamics [<xref rid="pone.0251659.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0251659.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0251659.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Further, at the theoretical level, results from this study support the adoption of complex systems theory to better understand the dynamics of health behaviors over time and across contexts [<xref rid="pone.0251659.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0251659.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. With regards to walking behavior specifically, visual inspection of the time-series (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0251659.s001">S1 Fig</xref>) also provides support to previous research (conducted at the group level and over short and aggregated periods of time) showing that significant variance in physical activity data could be observed at the intra-individual level, thus varying extensively not only between individuals but also within individuals [<xref rid="pone.0251659.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p>
              <p>The second set of results (i.e., associations between local dynamic complexity and sudden behavioral shifts), are partially aligned with previous literature. We observed a significant and positive association between our marker of critical fluctuations (i.e., local dynamic complexity) and the occurrence of sudden behavioral shifts in the following days. This confirmed assumptions from complex systems theory that changes within a system tends to be characterized by increased variability in system behavior before reorganization [<xref rid="pone.0251659.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0251659.g001">Fig 1</xref> for an illustration). However, this result was driven by a relatively strong positive association between critical fluctuations and the occurrence of a sudden behavioral loss. In contrast, although not significant, greater fluctuations were related to reduced odds of behavioral gains. Previous empirical work, conducted by Olthof et al. (2019), also found differences in the prediction of improvement (sudden losses) and deterioration (sudden gains) in psychological symptoms: (<italic>i</italic>) a positive and significant association between higher fluctuations and the occurrence of sudden symptoms improvements in psychotherapy and (<italic>ii</italic>) a positive but not-significant association between higher fluctuations and the occurrence of sudden symptoms deteriorations [<xref rid="pone.0251659.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. However, these analyses were explorative and possibly under-powered [<xref rid="pone.0251659.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. It is possible that different indicators of critical fluctuations have different predictive values for gains and losses depending on contextual parameters (i.e., weight loss program <italic>versus</italic> psychotherapy) or according to the outcome specificity (i.e., walking behavior <italic>versus</italic> depressive symptoms). Whether different kinds of gains or losses can be predicted from different critical fluctuations indicators remains an open question for future research inside and outside the field of physical activity. In any case, the fact that different associations are observed in the literature between indicators of dynamic complexity and sudden gains and losses invite to analyze these two kinds of behavioral shifts distinctively instead of pulled together.</p>
              <p>Finally, an interpretation of the results can also be offered in terms of dynamic attractor landscapes depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0251659.g003">Fig 3</xref>. Consider a landscape with two attractors, (<italic>i</italic>) a behavioral state of “low physical activity level’ (on the left) and (<italic>ii</italic>) a behavioral state of “high physical activity level” (on the right). In panel A of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0251659.g003">Fig 3</xref>, the system is in a stable state, either in the low-activity attractor or the high-activity one (upper panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0251659.g001">Fig 1</xref>). In panel B, as the landscape evolves to a state where the system is more unstable (due to the intervention, for example), random perturbations from daily events could move it to back and forth either direction, resulting in the instability indicated by increased dynamic complexity. Whether one starts out from low, medium or high activity, if the high-activity attractor remains shallower than the low-activity attractor, instability (which, again, shows up as dynamic complexity) will increase odds of ending up in the low-activity attractor after destabilizations. If the landscape subsequently evolves back to the one depicted in panel A, it has likely become trapped in the low-activity attractor–that is, having experienced what we define as a sudden loss. In other words, we make here the hypothesis that the low activity state would, in general, be more stable than the high activity one in the studied population and that destabilizations therefore are more likely to lead to low activity state (i.e., a sudden loss).</p>

                <title>Study strengths, limitations and perspectives</title>
                <p>A key strength of this study lies in its design and modelling approach, which highlighted original and unique information on the within-person, day-to-day changes in walking behavior over several months; which, taking together, lend empirical support toward the adoption of a more dynamic and complex systems-oriented research paradigm in this field of research. This study also provides a first proof of concept regarding the analysis of critical fluctuations in walking behavior as a form of early warning signal for sudden behavioral losses for walking behavior, thus providing potentially fruitful interventional perspectives for the development of just-in-time adaptive interventions.</p>
                <p>This study has also several limitations. Based on literature in psychotherapy (e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0251659.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]) and the availability of appropriate statistical methods, we decided to classify behavioral changes as sudden gains and losses, however, other characterizations of behavioral states could have been deployed. For example, analyses of decreasing or increasing slopes could be conducted with structural break detection methods [<xref rid="pone.0251659.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Further, and although our recursive algorithm partially considers within-person variability in daily step count, other statistical methods might be more appropriate in the detection of “stable” <italic>versus</italic> “unstable” behavioral states, such as the analyses of signal variability [<xref rid="pone.0251659.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Such complementary analyses (e.g., slope or signal variability analyses) could give a different insight on physical activity changes and might actually provide better statistical fits in some contexts or for some participants. Further, and using these or different techniques, it would also be important to explore whether different trajectories or patterns of change are associated with treatment responses and relevant outcomes (e.g., weight loss, improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness or mental health). In the same vein, we decided in the present study to focus on day-to-day changes in physical activity; however, micro-temporal changes occurring within days (see [<xref rid="pone.0251659.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]) or macro-temporal variations across months or years could also be studied with similar methods, with important implications for physical activity theories and interventions from a multi-time scale perspective [<xref rid="pone.0251659.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Future studies are thus needed to explore different characterizations of discontinuous and idiographic behavior changes over multiple time-scales to complement the results from this early work.</p>
                <p>Second, this study used a specific score of local dynamic complexity to characterize critical fluctuations in daily steps based on previous successful applications of this indicator in the prediction of sudden mental health improvements or deteriorations in psychotherapy [<xref rid="pone.0251659.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Also, and like for the detection of sudden behavioral shifts, other forms of fluctuation indicators could be tested for their predictive power in future research. A previous study for example has computed the local dynamic complexity score from several self-reported items compiled together instead of computing the dynamic complexity score from the main variable of interest [<xref rid="pone.0251659.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], like we did in the present study (i.e., steps). Hence, future studies might wish to test whether critical fluctuations in several indicators, compiled together, such as walking behavior but also some of its determinants (e.g., motivational factors, stress, weather), have greater predictive power in the detection of subsequent behavior changes than the analyses of critical fluctuations in the main variable of interest solely. Testing whether determinants of walking behavior (e.g., fluctuations in behavioral intentions or action control) are associated with the critical fluctuations in the behavior would also provide important information about why increases in dynamic complexity are observed and what they represent. Adopting an idiographic approach, we could also make the assumptions that the predictive power of critical fluctuations for behavior changes differ from one person to another [<xref rid="pone.0251659.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0251659.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. It is possible that different fluctuation indicators (e.g., derived from walking behavior only <italic>versus</italic> from compiled variables) or time-lapses (e.g., 3-day versus 7-day windows to compute local dynamic complexity) are more or less predictive depending on participant idiosyncrasies.</p>
                <p>Third, our results provide support for the hypothesis that behavioral change may occur through critical transitions that are preceded by increased levels of dynamic complexity. However, we do not know the causal drivers of the increased dynamic complexity and the transitions. it is important for future studies to explore (<italic>i</italic>) whether possible causal influences on physical activity behavior (i.e., weather variations; changes in motivation) are related to changes in local dynamic complexity and sudden gains or losses. Furthermore, future research should test whether local dynamic complexity can be manipulated during an intervention to prevent sudden losses in walking behavior.</p>
                <p>Finally, this study was conducted among young, fairly active, adults with overweight and obesity participating in a weight loss program where different health-related behaviors are manipulated as part of the intervention. Although, this population is of prior interest for physical activity promotion, other pattern of results might be observed in other contexts and populations. Further, as the trial is still ongoing, group assignment remained unknown for the present study, and was not modelled in our analyses, which constitutes a limit given that results might differ by groups. For all these different reasons, results from the present study should be replicated in other contexts.</p>

                <title>Theoretical, methodological and interventional implications</title>
                <p>Although results from this study should be replicated in different contexts, they provide empirical evidence that high-resolution changes in walking behavior might be better studied and understood if elements of complexity theory and methods are accounted for [<xref rid="pone.0251659.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In other words, a dynamic and complex systems-oriented paradigm should be adopted to better understand and describe physical activity behavior change, notably if those changes are studied at high-resolution, such as a daily level. Theories and models could progressively be refined to include more precise assumptions about time and behavior dynamics as argued in recent position papers [<xref rid="pone.0251659.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0251659.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Previous assumptions about gradual behavior change following adoption and maintenance phases should also be refined, or at least completed, to better account for rapidly changing critical transitions. At the methodological level, results from this study suggest that future studies interested in the dynamics of behavior changes should transition from (<italic>i</italic>) low- to high-resolution behavioral assessments to better capture potential discontinuous changes in those processes; (<italic>ii</italic>) group-only to group- and individual-level statistical inference to accurately modelled individual variability; and (<italic>iii</italic>) static to adaptive and continuous tuning interventional designs to better account for rapidly changing behavioral states and contexts (see [<xref rid="pone.0251659.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] for further justifications). If successfully applied, that type of adaptive interventions would also argue against the utilization of traditional randomized control trials to test interventions in the physical activity context, at least as they are often implemented, i.e., with low-resolution behavioral measures, exclusively using a nomothetic approach and fixed intervention components.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>This study highlights discontinuous -sudden gains and losses- and heterogeneous patterns of day-to-day changes in walking behavior over months among a large sample of young adults with obesity participating to a weight loss program. This study also provides first evidence that critical fluctuations in behavior time-series can be associated with the subsequent occurrence of behavioral losses in the next days, thus providing a form of early warning signals for physical activity behavior changes. Taken together, this study suggests that walking behavior changes could be well understood under dynamic and complex-system paradigms.</p>

You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: The authors intended to assess walking behavior under a dynamic paradigm. They analyzed data based on 151 overweight or obesity young adults. They conduct the analysis using recursive partitioning algorithm to identify the patterns of behavioral change and computed individual’s fluctuation intensity with a dynamic complexity algorithm. The results showed the positive association between critical fluctuations in walking behavior, a form of early warning signals, and the subsequent occurrence.</p>
              <p>1. Line 230. The regression tree was conducted based on several binary criteria. What are these binary criteria? How about other continuous sample characters, such as age and so on? Also, the outcome is binary, classification tree is more appropriate name for the analysis.</p>
              <p>2. Classification/regression tree tends to be overfitting in general. Please comment on addressing this for the current analysis.</p>
              <p>3. Classification/regression tree is pretty data-driven approach. How stable of the results would be for current analysis? or any strategies were implemented to avoid this?</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: In the “Data analysis” section, please adress the following concerns.</p>
              <p>(1) What does the sentence “Missing days were imputed using the Kalman Filter method” (lines 219-220) mean? Please describe the approach briefly.</p>
              <p>(2) The approach to identify sudden gains and losses for depressive symptoms (lines 225-230) was unclear.</p>
              <p>(3) In the subsection “Local dynamic complexity calculation”, it would be better to give the mathematical expressions of the metrics such as “dynamic complexity score”, “fluctuation measure”, and “distribution parameter” and then explain the rationales for the use of these metrics.</p>
              <p>(4) In the subsection “Associations between …”, it is difficult to understand the method to test the association between local dynamic complexity and the occurrence of sudden gains and losses (lines 278-283) and the equation (lines 286-287). It would be better to present them in a mathematical manner.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: In this submission, the authors are able to show a correlation between fluctuations in walking behavior and subsequent behavioral losses within the following days. The primary methodology is based on a reasonable sample size based on a recent parallel-group randomized controlled trial related to weight loss among young adults. A significant limitation of the study is that the trial is ongoing, in addition to changes due to to the onset of Covid-19 disturbance (which the authors account for), and as such information was not available on group assignment. Due to the nature of the aforementioned RCT study, there could be different interventions on subgroups of the study population which could affect the data. This would have been interesting to analyze or detect subgroups of varying complexity within the analyzed population, even though it is understandable there would be no confirmation available due to the RCT design parameters. Another limitation is the age range of the study population. Overall, the authors address the above points and do a good job in describing the limitations of their study.</p>
              <p>Regarding methodology, the authors performed Kalman filtering over missing days, and specified a mean number of days missing and range. To detect gains and losses, a recursive partitioning algorithm available in an R package was used. Changes of 30% increase or reduction of steps were assessed. A sensitivity analysis was performed looking at the effect of changing this threshold. A different R package was used to calculate dynamic complexity. A link was provided for data and code. Looking at associations between gains/losses and local dynamic complexity showed relations as characterized in Table 1, with appropriate statistics. Overall, the approach is sound and the results are interesting. It would be good to know the proportion of stable 7 day periods vs periods of high variability to better characterize the amount of days/time during which no sudden gains/losses could be computed. Figure 1 could also use expansion, to better illustrate use of the algorithm and graphically display examples of some of the situations encountered (gain vs loss, threshold bars, etc). Also recommend the time axis be labeled with units.</p>
              <p>The author's discussion was sound and noted results that somewhat but not entirely corresponded with literature. Results are interpreted, and limitations of the study were described in a reasonable amount of detail. Fig.3 might have benefitted from more labeling or description in the figure caption (which was embedded in the text instead). As the authors mention in their study strengths and limitations section, it would be interesting to cross compare with different scores of local dynamic complexity, particularly in reference to variables outside the main variables of interest, and taking into account timing of events such as interventions among different subgroups in the RCT. This would be an interesting topic of follow-up work. Overall, the manuscript is well written, the methodology described and thought processes used in the study are thoroughly described, and the results are interesting, though require further study in the future. I thus recommend this manuscript for publication.</p>

              <p>Academic Editor, PLOS ONE </p>
              <p> Dear Editor, </p>
              <p> Thank you for the opportunity to submit a revised version of our manuscript. I would like to draw your attention to the fact that, during the revision process, we benefited from feedback from Merlijn Olthof (PhD candidate from Radboud University and topic specialist) on our study’s preprint. Given the quality of his feedback, we offered Dr. Olthof to be part of the authorship for this paper. One of the main remarks made by Dr. Olthof was to include a “duration” indicator in our statistical model accounting for the time (i.e., number of days) between each event (i.e., gains and losses), as usually recommended for this type of analysis. This addition substantially improved our models’ fit indices and slightly changed the results. </p>
              <p>All the modifications made in regards of Dr. Olthof’s comments and the ones of the three reviewers solicited by PLOS ONE can be tracked in the manuscript. Answers to the 3 reviewers’ remarks and your specific editorial interrogations can be found below.</p>
              <p>Best regards. </p>
              <p>On behalf of the authors, </p>
              <p>Guillaume Chevance</p>

              <p>Authors’ answer: This was updated.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Reviewers' comments:</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: </p>
              <p>1. Line 230. The regression tree was conducted based on several binary criteria. What are these binary criteria? How about other continuous sample characters, such as age and so on? Also, the outcome is binary, classification tree is more appropriate name for the analysis.</p>
              <p>Authors’ answer: We thank the reviewer for this comment because it gave us the opportunity to expand more on this important aspect of our analysis. We confirm that we adopted regression trees (the dependent variable of the partitioning algorithm is continuous) instead of classification tree and have amended this section accordingly, which now reads (page 12 in “characterization of gains and losses”): “Following the approach applied by Olthof et al. (2020), we used a recursive partitioning algorithm to characterize within-person behavioral changes over the course of the study using regression trees from the package rpart[44] for the R software environment[45]. Regression trees enable to identify nodes and partition a continuous variable y in recursive splits based on different predictors. In the present study, we partitioned the variable steps based on the progressive day of the intervention as predictor. Once we identified the splits for the variable steps for each participant separately, we classified them as gain or losses if they met additional criteria defined on the basis of previous research […].”</p>
              <p>Please note that this characterization is done at the individual level (i.e., for each participant separately) and focuses on the behavior (i.e., as a way to describe the behavioral change). Inter-individual-differences, such as age, are thus not relevant for this person-specific approach given that participants are not pooled together for these specific analyses.</p>
              <p>2. Classification/regression tree tends to be overfitting in general. Please comment on addressing this for the current analysis.</p>
              <p>Authors’ answer: We agree that regression trees tend to be overfitting. However, in the current study, the regression tree analysis was performed to identify splits in the time series. Such splits were successively coded as gains or losses if and only if they met more restrictive criteria driven by previous research. The criteria are explicitly mentioned on pages 12 and 13. The first is the 30% increase or reduction in steps relative to the median number of steps for each participant (point 1, please see line 254). The second is related to the period of 7 days during which a “stable change” can be characterized (point 2, please see line 264). Therefore, the number of shifts identified for each participant are a subset of the splits/nodes resulting from the regression tree. In this way we managed to counteract the potential overfitting of the regression tree models (with the application of complementary criteria).</p>
              <p>3. Classification/regression tree is pretty data-driven approach. How stable of the results would be for current analysis? or any strategies were implemented to avoid this?</p>
              <p>Authors’ answer: We agree that regression trees are a data driven approach, however, as highlighted in our response to the previous point, we counterbalanced this with specific top-down or theory-driven criteria based on our past research and the literature. Moreover, in order to avoid the opposite error and being too theory-driven, we performed multiple sensitivity analyses in order to test the robustness of the results under different assumptions and to adequately balance data and theory driven approaches. Specifically, sensitivity analyses were conducted for varying cut-offs (e.g., sudden gains or losses of 20% and 40%). This is explained in the “sensitivity analyses” section (in the results): </p>
              <p>“Sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the robustness of the results for varying levels of gains and losses (i.e., +/-20% and +/-40% of the median number of steps, instead of +/-30%, as specified in the main analyses), and different time-lags for the local dynamic complexity score (i.e., higher scores in the past two and four days, instead of the past three days, as specified in the main analyses). Results of the sensitivity analyses were compared with regards to their effects on the identification of gains and losses (objective 1) and the association between local dynamic complexity and the occurrence of sudden gains and losses (objective 2). </p>
              <p>As shown in Table 2, lower (+/-20%) and higher (+/-40%) thresholds lead respectively to the identification of more (N = 1180) and less (N = 595) sudden gains and losses in comparison with the main analyses (+/-30%; N = 862). Using a more conservative threshold (+/-40% of the median number of steps) resulted in the detection of a lower number of sudden gains and losses, while using a less conservative threshold (+/-20% of the median number of steps) resulted in the detection of a higher number of events.”</p>
              <p>Please see also the s1 table in supplemental material. The associations between local dynamic complexity and the occurrence of sudden gains and losses were substantially unchanged (notably the prediction of sudden losses) in the sensitivity analyses</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: In the “Data analysis” section, please address the following concerns.</p>
              <p>(1) What does the sentence “Missing days were imputed using the Kalman Filter method” (lines 219-220) mean? Please describe the approach briefly.</p>
              <p>Authors’ answer: Thank you for your feedback. We have now provided more detail on this method on pages 11/12 and provided an additional reference for interested readers: “Missing days were imputed using the Kalman Filter method (i.e., a procedure to compute the likelihood of a time series which is the outcome of a stationary autoregressive moving average process or non-stationary autoregressive integrated moving average process; see for further details [42]).”</p>
              <p>We added this reference:</p>
              <p>[42] Gómez V, Maravall A. Estimation, Prediction, and Interpolation for Nonstationary Series with the Kalman Filter. J Am Stat Assoc. 1994 Jun 1;89(426):611–24.</p>
              <p>(2) The approach to identify sudden gains and losses for depressive symptoms (lines 225-230) was unclear.</p>
              <p>Authors’ answer: We agree that the reference to the previous study about depressive symptoms was unclear and have now modified these two paragraphs to make the points more explicit (and answer other comments from the reviewer 1 as well). Please, see our modifications on pages 12-13 in the “characterization of gains and losses” section starting line 248. </p>
              <p>(3) In the subsection “Local dynamic complexity calculation”, it would be better to give the mathematical expressions of the metrics such as “dynamic complexity score”, “fluctuation measure”, and “distribution parameter” and then explain the rationales for the use of these metrics.</p>
              <p>Authors’ answer: We now provide a technical document with all the mathematical details related to this score (please, see the document entitled “Dynamic Complexity” in supplemental material available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/64cmv/">https://osf.io/64cmv/</ext-link> and page 14). We contend that presenting these indicators in non-mathematical terms within the main manuscript is a better strategy to keep the manuscript intelligible for most readers, notably our targeted audience (interventionists in behavioral medicine). Readers interested, and able, to deeply understand the maths behind this algorithm can now consult our appendix in addition to the reference indicated in the manuscript (references #34 and #50 in the list). Additionally, for interested readers, the R code contain the operationalization of the formula to compute dynamic complexity. We explicitly mention this addition line 314-315: “For mathematical details, see the document entitled “Dynamic Complexity” in the supplemental material available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/64cmv/">https://osf.io/64cmv/</ext-link>).”</p>
              <p>(4) In the subsection “Associations between …”, it is difficult to understand the method to test the association between local dynamic complexity and the occurrence of sudden gains and losses (lines 278-283) and the equation (lines 286-287). It would be better to present them in a mathematical manner.</p>
              <p>Authors’ answer: Although we understand your comment and truly respect your position, we believe that for most applied researchers (like us) it’s more common and easy to represent, read and understand a statistical model in the way it is implemented in traditional statistical software. Even if the use of these models (here generalized linear mixed-effects model) is extremely common in both social (e.g., psychology) or biological sciences (e.g., epidemiology), most of us aren’t mastering the mathematical equations underlying such type of models. Readers interested in these details can consult the references we provided for the theory behind the models (reference #51) and its implementation in R (reference #52).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: In this submission, the authors are able to show a correlation between fluctuations in walking behavior and subsequent behavioral losses within the following days. The primary methodology is based on a reasonable sample size based on a recent parallel-group randomized controlled trial related to weight loss among young adults. A significant limitation of the study is that the trial is ongoing, in addition to changes due to the onset of Covid-19 disturbance (which the authors account for), and as such information was not available on group assignment. Due to the nature of the aforementioned RCT study, there could be different interventions on subgroups of the study population which could affect the data. This would have been interesting to analyze or detect subgroups of varying complexity within the analyzed population, even though it is understandable there would be no confirmation available due to the RCT design parameters. Another limitation is the age range of the study population. Overall, the authors address the above points and do a good job in describing the limitations of their study. Regarding methodology, the authors performed Kalman filtering over missing days, and specified a mean number of days missing and range. To detect gains and losses, a recursive partitioning algorithm available in an R package was used. Changes of 30% increase or reduction of steps were assessed. A sensitivity analysis was performed looking at the effect of changing this threshold. A different R package was used to calculate dynamic complexity. A link was provided for data and code. Looking at associations between gains/losses and local dynamic complexity showed relations as characterized in Table 1, with appropriate statistics. Overall, the approach is sound and the results are interesting. </p>
              <p>Authors’ answer: Thank you for your positive feedbacks.</p>
              <p>R3. It would be good to know the proportion of stable 7-day periods vs periods of high variability to better characterize the amount of days/time during which no sudden gains/losses could be computed. </p>
              <p>Authors’ answer: As per our algorithm, any shift can't be preceded or followed by any other shift during the 7- days window which precedes and follows each shift. Overall, for each participant, the number of stable periods (i.e., period between two shifts) is equal to number of shifts + 1. </p>
              <p>R3. Figure 1 could also use expansion, to better illustrate use of the algorithm and graphically display examples of some of the situations encountered (gain vs loss, threshold bars, etc). Also recommend the time axis be labeled with units.</p>
              <p>Authors’ answer: It’s interesting to discuss the unit of x axis (time). Also, because this approach can be used for rapid- or slow-evolving processes, we decided to not modify the x axis of the figure. However, this point is now justified in the Figure legend: “Note that the Figure’s x axis (time) is not expressed here with a specific unit; this approach, however, can be used to describe both rapid- and slow-evolving processes. The time unit here can thus conceptually vary from seconds to days, months or years”. </p>
              <p>It’s difficult to provide indications related to the algorithm on this figure, because this last appears early in the manuscript as a conceptual, rather than technical, description of the approach (that is then develop in the method). However, we now provide a new supplemental file describing the approach in more technical terms (in the method section). Please, see page 14 and the supplemental material entitled “Dynamic Complexity” (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/64cmv/">https://osf.io/64cmv/</ext-link>). </p>
              <p>R3. The author's discussion was sound and noted results that somewhat but not entirely corresponded with literature. Results are interpreted, and limitations of the study were described in a reasonable amount of detail. Fig.3 might have benefitted from more labeling or description in the figure caption (which was embedded in the text instead). </p>
              <p>Authors’ answer: Thanks for your comment. We modified and added information in the Figure 3 to make it more intelligible (please see the figure as displayed by PLOS ONE). </p>
              <p>R3. As the authors mention in their study strengths and limitations section, it would be interesting to cross compare with different scores of local dynamic complexity, particularly in reference to variables outside the main variables of interest, and taking into account timing of events such as interventions among different subgroups in the RCT. This would be an interesting topic of follow-up work. Overall, the manuscript is well written, the methodology described and thought processes used in the study are thoroughly described, and the results are interesting, though require further study in the future. I thus recommend this manuscript for publication.</p>
              <p>Authors’ answer: Thank you again for the positive feedbacks. We agree with the seminal aspect of our work, as well as the limitation related to the unknown group assignment. We added two sentences (pages 27-28 at the end of the discussion section before the “implications section”) explicitly mentioning the needs for replications of the present results: “Further, as the trial is still ongoing, group assignment remained unknown for the present study, and was not modelled in our analyses, which constitutes a limit given that results might differ by groups. For all these different reasons, results from the present study should be replicated in other contexts.”</p>

              <p>4. Have the authors made all data underlying the findings in their manuscript fully available?</p>
              <p>The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.plosone.org/static/policies.action#sharing">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data—e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party—those must be specified.</p>

              <p>PLOS ONE does not copyedit accepted manuscripts, so the language in submitted articles must be clear, correct, and unambiguous. Any typographical or grammatical errors should be corrected at revision, so please note any specific errors here.</p>
