                <title>Summary</title>
                <p>Therapy-resistant cancer stem cells (CSCs) contribute to the poor clinical outcomes of patients with recurrent glioblastoma (rGBM) who fail standard of care (SOC) therapy. ChemoID is a clinically validated assay for identifying CSC-targeted cytotoxic therapies in solid tumors.</p>
                <p>In a randomized clinical trial (NCT03632135), the ChemoID assay, a personalized approach for selecting the most effective treatment from FDA-approved chemotherapies, improves the survival of patients with rGBM (2016 WHO classification) over physician-chosen chemotherapy. In the ChemoID assay-guided group, median survival is 12.5 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 10.2–14.7) compared with 9 months (95% CI, 4.2–13.8) in the physician-choice group (p = 0.010) as per interim efficacy analysis. The ChemoID assay-guided group has a significantly lower risk of death (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.44; 95% CI, 0.24–0.81; p = 0.008). Results of this study offer a promising way to provide more affordable treatment for patients with rGBM in lower socioeconomic groups in the US and around the world.</p>

              <p id="p0055">Due to the unpredictable nature of cancer, responses to chemotherapy can vary from patient to patient, even when cancer cells are of the same histology. Several genome-based methodologies and immunotherapies are under clinical investigation. They have not demonstrated a survival advantage in GBM,<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> and genome-directed drugs are often only applicable to a subset of patients with cancer with unique biomarkers.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> Many patients with cancer in the US in lower socioeconomic groups struggle to pay for their treatments because of rising costs for novel treatments and rising premiums, deductibles, and copayments for private health insurance plans.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> Additionally, most people, particularly in underserved areas, including those in developed nations with socialized healthcare systems or underdeveloped nations, lack access to many of the more recent targeted therapies and immunotherapies.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> Also, immunotherapies, as yet, have not shown a survival advantage in GBM.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> For these reasons, developing and optimizing cost-effective cytotoxic chemotherapies remain important.</p>
              <p id="p0060">A strategy to increase the survival of patients with GBM is to target the cancer stem cells (CSCs) that contribute to therapy resistance and cancer progression<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> by utilizing first- and second-line cytotoxic chemotherapies routinely covered by Medicare and health insurance plans. While there are newer targeted therapies and immunotherapies available today, this trial focused on screening SOC chemotherapies that are routinely covered and available to community oncology patients and for patients from other countries, where the more novel agents are not readily available.</p>
              <p id="p0065">The “CSC concept” was proposed four decades ago and revised recently and posits that tumor growth is analogous to the renewal of healthy tissues and fueled by small numbers of dedicated stem cells capable of plasticity.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> The unidirectional and irreversible hierarchical progression of GBM growth has been studied in an animal model of GBM.<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> The ablation of CSCs in this model halted tumor growth and prolonged survival without apparent regeneration of the CSC pool from other GBM cells.<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> Many of the current therapeutic strategies (chemotherapy and radiation) aimed at eliminating rapidly dividing cancer cells (bulk tumor) involve treatment with standard anti-proliferative chemotherapy, with limited response. This poses a challenge, as the residual population of chemotherapy-resistant tumor cells capable of regenerating the disease (relapse) is enriched in CSCs.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> In recent years, genetic fate mapping in several types of solid tumors has supported the notion that recurrence after chemotherapy results from the persistence of CSCs. Slow-proliferating CSCs of GBM resist TMZ treatment in animal models. Genetic ablation of this cell population renders GBMs susceptible again to chemotherapy.<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> These data suggest that differentiated cells may subsequently replace lost stem cells through plasticity inferring that the CSCs, by representing a source of chemotherapy-resistant cells, contribute to the occurrence of relapse after treatment.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="p0070">For patients with rGBM, a viable treatment option is to select chemotherapies that will eliminate the CSCs, the main cause of treatment resistance, while reducing the bulk of tumor cells.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> Real-world clinical studies demonstrated improved survival of patients with rGBM after treatment with CSC assay-guided chemotherapy regimens (ChemoID).<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="p0075">Based on this proof of concept and on real-world data, a multi-institutional, randomized clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: <ext-link ext-link-type="ClinicalTrials.gov" xlink:href="NCT03632135" id="intref0010">NCT03632135</ext-link>) of patients with rGBM was initiated to assess the efficacy of chemotherapy regimens selected by the ChemoID assay vs. best physician choice.

              <title>Results</title>
              <p id="p0080">Over a period of 3 years, 123 patients affected by rGBM or grade III glioma were screened and assessed for eligibility criteria to participate in a parallel-group-randomized controlled trial at 13 clinical sites across the US. The study protocol was approved by the Western Institutional Review Board (WIRB) and the independent ethics committee of each of the participating institutions. 78 patients with rGBM (diagnosed according to the 2016 WHO classification of brain tumors) were enrolled in the study (consort diagram: <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) after signing the informed consent. All enrolled subjects underwent surgical resection and biopsy. For histopathology confirmation and diagnosis, MGMT gene methylation, and IDH-1/-2 status, the tumor biopsies were sent to the sites’ hospital pathology laboratory. A portion of each of the biopsies was sent from the operating room as a fresh tumor sample to the ChemoID central clinical pathology laboratory, where the assay was conducted. The ChemoID assay is a diagnostic test that determines the cytotoxic profile of CSCs and the bulk of tumor cells treated with various NCCN-approved chemotherapies and/or their combination. All registered patients in the trial underwent the ChemoID assay and were randomly assigned by the sites’ coordinators to a study group using a computer-generated algorithm (in REDCap). Subjects were treated either with SOC chemotherapy chosen by the physician or treatment directed by the ChemoID assay (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). The treatment regimens in the two groups were chosen from the same list of chemotherapies (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>), depending on the randomly allocated study group (assay guided or physician best choice).<fig id="fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>CONSORT diagram of ChemoID study</p><p>A total of 123 patients were screened between May 18, 2018, and May 30, 2021; 78 of these patients were randomized to either the ChemoID or physician-choice group.

              <p id="p0085">A predetermined interim survival efficacy analysis was conducted when 35 deaths were reported (August 20, 2021).

Logistic regression models were constructed based on the ChemoID assay report data of patients’ cultured CSCs and bulk tumor cells exposed to the same drug(s) used during their treatment. We found that the optimal thresholds of tumor cell kill were 40% for CSCs and 55% for bulk tumor cells as per the logistic regression models (see referent lines in <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1</xref>).

In striking contrast, most data points for patients in the ChemoID arm were clustered in the upper right quadrant (i.e., high percentage kill of both CSCs and bulk tumor cells).</p>
                  <p id="p0125">Our analysis further revealed that for every 10% increase in CSC drug response, there was a significant increase (13%) in 6-month patient survival (HR, 0.87; p = 0.012), and for every 10% increase in bulk tumor cell response, the hazard of death decreased 13% (HR, 0.87; p = 0.024).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="p0160">To improve the outcome of rGBM, it is critical to use chemotherapies that are effective against the CSCs as they are proven to drive tumor development and relapse. We conducted a randomized clinical trial using the ChemoID CSC assay to guide chemotherapy for rGBM treatment. It is worth noting that patients in both arms were treated with a regimen chosen from the same panel of chemotherapy medications, with one group using the patient-specific ChemoID test report to guide chemotherapy selection and the other relying on the physicians’ best judgment.</p>
              <p id="p0165">Planned interim efficacy analysis showed that the ChemoID-guided group’s mOS was 3.5 months longer than the physician-choice group’s (12.5 vs. 9 months) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A). Additionally, mPFS was 6.6 months longer for patients receiving ChemoID assay-guided therapy compared with the patients treated using best-physician-choice chemotherapy (10.1 vs. 3.5 months) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B).</p>
              <p id="p0170">In the ITT analysis, the study continued to meet its primary endpoint. The mOS was 4.5 months longer for the ChemoID-guided group compared with the physician-choice group (12 vs. 7.5 months) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>C). Additionally, mPFS was 3.2 months longer for patients receiving ChemoID assay-guided therapy compared with the patients treated using the best-physician-choice chemotherapy (6.5 vs. 3.3 months) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>D).</p>
              <p id="p0175">To confirm the validity of the data analysis using the HR method to summarize the difference in survival curves between the two arms as described in the approved study protocol, we also analyzed the data using RMST. By analyzing the 1- or 1.5-year RMST and CIs for each of our primary results, we found that subjects who received ChemoID-guided therapy had a significant survival advantage, which proves that using other robust statistical analysis methods, the survival differences between the two groups were statistically significant. The data support the use of the ChemoID assay for guiding chemotherapy selection for rGBM. The OS and PFS advantages observed for the ChemoID-guided group are not due to differences in prognostic variables, such as age, sex, performance status, <italic>MGMT</italic> promoter methylation status, or <italic>IDH1</italic>/<italic>IDH2</italic> gene status since all these variables were balanced during randomization between the two arms. Since the mutations of the IDH1/IDH2 genes could still cause differences in the results between the groups analyzed, we reanalyzed the data by removing subjects with mutant IDH1/IDH2 genes and found that the OS and PFS results remained unchanged.</p>
              <p id="p0180">The current SOC treatment protocol for GBM is a combination of surgical resection, radiotherapy, and concomitant TMZ chemotherapy followed by maintenance TMZ as demonstrated in the EORTC-NCIC trial.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> TMZ is a key component of standard therapy for patients both newly diagnosed and with rGBM. In newly diagnosed GBM, the addition of TMZ to radiotherapy resulted in 2.5 months of survival benefit, which led to TMZ being approved as a SOC.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> However, most patients with GBM experience recurrence and have a poor prognosis following the SOC treatment protocol. Treatment options after recurrence are limited, and no recent randomized clinical trial has demonstrated median survival longer than 10 months in rGBM,<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> which is similar to the mOS of patients enrolled in the control group (best physician choice) of our trial. This randomized study demonstrates that using the ChemoID CLIA-certified clinical laboratory assay to select effective cytotoxic therapies for the treatment of rGBM is a promising and cost-effective strategy for increasing the survival of patients.</p>
              <p id="p0185">Of note, the use of anti-CSC-guided therapy resulted in a 3.5-month mOS advantage when compared with the control group in the population evaluated at the interim efficacy analysis and a 4.5-month mOS advantage in the ITT population. A significant difference was observed in the risk of death between the two groups. More participants survived in the ChemoID assay-guided group compared with the non-guided group at 6, 9, and 12 months, demonstrating that patients with rGBM derive a survival benefit from treatment with CSC-directed therapy.</p>
              <p id="p0190">In conclusion, the ChemoID assay was developed as an actionable tool for physicians to individualize cancer treatment by selecting the most effective therapies against CSCs from a panel of cytotoxic agents that are common and affordable for cancer patients. Treatments with more expensive targeted anti-cancer drugs and immunotherapies are not always feasible due to socioeconomic and health disparity issues in the US and around the world. Although there are newer targeted therapies, our clinical trial focused on screening SOC chemotherapies that are routinely covered and used by community oncologists globally. The results of our study highlight the clinical effectiveness of a personalized approach to treatment. The ability of the ChemoID assay to personalize chemotherapy selection is a promising way to provide more affordable treatment for patients with rGBM. The ChemoID assay is versatile, allowing it to be expanded to include other new agents. We anticipate personalized anti-cancer therapy targeting CSCs will be included sooner in the treatment plan, eliminating ineffective treatments and allowing patients to gain the greatest therapeutic benefit possible.</p>

                <title>Limitations of the study</title>
                <p id="p0195">Although this study provides good treatment options for patients with rGBM, some potential limitations should be noted. For example, ChemoID is a functional assay limited by the availability of viable tumor tissue samples. Our study only included rGBM subjects who underwent surgical resection or biopsy. Subjects with inoperable tumors or who were in poor health were not participants in our study. Future studies should incorporate patients with newly diagnosed <italic>MGMT</italic> unmethylated GBM, who would benefit from assay-guided intervention. In addition, further studies should investigate the use of genomic assays with this functional assay in larger cohorts for guiding treatment.</p>

Subjects eligible to participate in the study were men and women and members of all ethnic groups, at least 18 years old at the time of enrollment, who were affected by a surgically resectable first recurrence of grade-III glioma, and grade-IV recurrent glioblastoma (GBM), inclusive of gliosarcoma. In all cases, the diagnosis had to be confirmed by a pathologist according to the 2016-WHO classification of brain tumors.<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> Even though the primary inclusion requirement was the presence of recurrent grade-III glioma or grade-IV GBM, our trial only enrolled participants with 2016-WHO confirmed recurrent grade-IV glioma (rGBM). At the time that this clinical trial started enrolling patients, the WHO classification for brain tumors was in accordance with the 2016 guidelines. In August 2021, the updated 2021-WHO guidelines were published,<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> while our trial was completed in November 2021. All patients had already received first-line treatment with surgery, radiotherapy, and TMZ at the time of enrollment. Patients were excluded if they had another active malignancy or were receiving any other tumor-directed therapy (e.g., tumor treating fields device).</p>
                  <p id="p0220">78 recurrent GBM patients were enrolled in the study (Consort Diagram – <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Registered participants provided an MRI (or CT if the patient was unable to have an MRI performed) of the brain with and without contrast within 14 days of the screening visit. Blood samples were drawn as per standard-of-care and used to confirm eligibility based on clinical laboratory parameters. Female participants had a urine or serum pregnancy test.</p>
                  <p id="p0225">Subjects underwent surgical resection and biopsy. For histopathology confirmation and diagnosis of GBM, MGMT gene methylation status, and IDH-1/2 status, fresh tissue tumor biopsies from rGBM patients were sent to the sites’ hospital pathology lab for processing. The central ChemoID laboratory conducted the drug response assay using a second portion of the fresh biopsies. In accordance with CLIA and CAP requirements, samples were shipped to the ChemoID laboratory utilizing a secure FedEx overnight shipping container for clinical specimens. All recurrent GBM patients who registered for the trial underwent the ChemoID assay and were randomly assigned by the sites’ coordinators to a study group using a computer-generated algorithm (in REDCap).</p>
                  <p id="p0230">The patients were treated either with the standard of care chemotherapy chosen by the physician (ARM 1) or treatment directed by the ChemoID assay (ARM 2), depending on the randomly allocated study group.

A secure password-protected REDCap web portal was available for authorized study coordinators to input clinical trial data. Patients were blinded to randomization group assignment. Unblinding of test results was not permitted. Investigators and trial personnel were not aware of ChemoID test results for patients in the physician-choice therapy group until the end of the study. Investigators and trial personnel received the ChemoID lab test results <bold><underline>only</underline></bold> for subjects assigned to the assay-guided group. Data monitoring and analysis of results were conducted by independent statistical services and a data manager.

                  <p id="p0245">Lead investigators agreed on the cytotoxic chemotherapies used in the trial, and the health insurance plans covered them, thus study participants incurred no additional medical bills. The regimens and doses tested by the ChemoID drug response assay were the same as the ones that could be chosen by the physicians for patients enrolled in the control arm (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>).</p>
                  <p id="p0250">Patients received 1 of 14 cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens either chosen by the physician or guided by the ChemoID assay test report (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Physicians and investigators were not provided with ChemoID test reports for patients randomized to the physician-choice control arm. Regardless of which arm the patient was assigned to, the ChemoID test was performed on all subjects so that retrospective analysis could be conducted on patients randomly assigned to the Physician-choice group.</p>
                  <p id="p0255">The assay-guided group received the regimen that killed the most cancer stem cells and the bulk of the tumor. The treatment given to subjects in the control group was chosen from the same list of chemotherapies tested by the assay (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>), based on the treating physician’s best empirical judgment. The number of chemotherapy drug cycles in both trial arms was determined at the treating physician’s discretion. Patients were, however, treated for a minimum of 4 cycles and continued to receive treatment until unacceptable toxicity, hospice or death, or consent withdrawal.</p>
                  <p id="p0260">For patients in the assay-guided group, in the event of unacceptable toxicity or progression, treatment was changed to the next best chemotherapeutic drug or combination based on the ChemoID assay report. In cases in which the assay predicted more than one high-cell kill drug, for patients randomized to the assay-guided arm, the protocol gave the physicians the ability to choose a treatment among the high-cell kill drugs based on the ChemoID assay report that would benefit the patient, considering the patient’s general health status.</p>

This provides unparalleled control over the locations of cells and tissues within its bioreactor vessel during operation and sampling. Both the low-shear suspension of cells and control of the locations of cells and air bubbles are affected by means of the hydrodynamic force created by the flow within the vessel and fluid drag along the surface of the viscous spinner. A gas-permeable membrane connected to the base of the vessel enables the exchange of gas between the tissue culture medium in the vessel and an incubator environment in which the vessel is placed. The presence of a conic spinner on the axis of rotation of the cell culture rotating bioreactor enables the simultaneous creation of a low-shear culture environment and the “herding” of suspended cells and tissue assemblies, which is responsible for the CSCs' selective growth. A rotation rate of 15–25 rpm was estimated to have average sheer values of 0.001 dyn per square centimeter, which is the rate at which medium-large, three-dimensional, tissue-like suspended growth assemblies have been successful. This 3D-suspension cell culture rotating bioreactor configuration was shown previously to select and enrich 15-fold cancer cell cultures expressing markers of CSCs such as CD133 among others.<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> Other conventional bioreactors rely instead on agitation to suspend cells and attachment materials and to facilitate the mass transfer required for the growth of cells and tissue assemblies.

                  <p id="p0365">96-well plates are seeded in RPMI-1640 with 10% FBS, penicillin and streptomycin with a minimum of 20,000 individual tumor cells per regimen of bulk tumor cells or CSCs in 5 replicas and incubated at 37°C in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator. After 24 h from plating, clinical-grade chemotherapy drugs were added alone or in combination for 1-h exposure at concentrations that do not exceed the serum C[max] described in pharmacokinetic (PK) studies, including the clinical dose. Three concentrations of each chemotherapy treatment were prepared by serial dilution. Each concentration was added to five replicate wells on the microtiter plate. Additionally, three replicated wells (control 1 = no treatment) and three replicated wells (control 2 = equal amount of solvent) were associated with each treatment.</p>
                  <p id="p0370">After the 1-h exposure, the treatment media containing the various chemotherapies were removed and replaced with fresh media. MTT assay was performed 24 h following chemotherapy treatment to assess cell survival as previously described.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref></p>

Survival of tumor cells at each concentration was calculated as compared to control-2 and the overall percent of the bulk of tumor cells and CSCs killed was calculated for each treatment as the primary measures of potential therapy efficacy.</p>

                <p id="p0385">All statistical analyses followed the plan specified in the protocol with no deviations and were completed using Stata v17.1 (StataCorp) by independent biostatisticians. Two prespecified interim efficacy analyses were planned <italic>a priori</italic> at 35 and 70 death events (1/3 and 2/3 of the full target sample size number of events). The hazard ratio (HR) for ChemoID-guided: Physician-choice to declare efficacy was &lt;0.55 at all three-time points. The Lan-DeMets alpha spending approach was utilized to determine P-value stopping criteria for the two prespecified interim efficacy analyses. Efficacy could be declared at the first analysis if HR was &lt;0.55 with an associated P-value &lt;0.0167.</p>
                <p id="p0390">Baseline characteristics were compared using t-tests or Mann-Whitney U tests, as appropriate, for continuous and ordinal variables and Fisher’s exact tests for categorical variables. Kaplan-Meier curves were constructed using established methods, and median survival was calculated from these curves. Primary OS and secondary (PFS) HRs were constructed using Cox proportional hazard models with baseline HRs stratified by clinical site. Variance component estimation was performed via bootstrap resampling using 1000 bootstrapped replicates. Specific time-point survival probabilities (6, 9, and 12 months) were calculated using marginal probabilities obtained via logistic regression models, and associated odds ratios were reported. Additionally, an exploratory analysis was performed using a 1- or 1.5-year restricted mean survival time (RMST) to quantify the treatment effects.</p>

                  <title>Baseline data</title>
                  <p id="p0395">As per protocol, initial analyses involved data cleaning, variable development, and exploratory data analyses. We used standard summaries to describe baseline characteristic distributions in terms of centrality, spread, shape, and possible outliers by arm, cohort, and treatment group. Graphical explorations emphasized the examination of the nature and extent of potential nonlinear relationships on the appropriate modeling scale (e.g. natural, log, logit, etc.)</p>

                  <title>Efficacy analysis</title>
                  <p id="p0400">The primary analysis was based on an intention-to-treat approach and included all subjects randomized at baseline. The primary efficacy outcome was overall survival (OS) in months. This outcome was compared between patients randomized to ChemoID-guided chemotherapy) versus standard of care. OS comparisons were examined using Cox Proportional Hazard Models for Overall Survival with baseline hazards stratified by site and medians were compared between treatment arms. Models examining adjustments for sex, race, age, and tumor stage were constructed, as well as for moderating effects of these variables (subpopulation investigations).</p>
                  <p id="p0405">Secondary analyses included logistic regression models for Overall and Progression-Free Survival at 4, 6, 9, and 12 months, Cox Proportional Hazard Models for Progression-Free Survival in months, Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) for analyses on objective tumor response (RANO), and Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL). Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs) were used for analyses of changes in any additional repeated outcome measures to incorporate within-person associations and examine distributions of participant-specific declines. Huber-White robust standard errors were used, and multiple variance structures were investigated to examine the sensitivity of primary analyses to the choice of association model. Shared Parameter Models (SPM) were used to examine any potential informative missing data effects.</p>

                  <title>Interim analysis</title>
                  <p id="p0410">We performed a predetermined interim analysis as per protocol. From the clinical trial protocol, two interim analyses based on the alpha spending approach of Lan and DeMets could be performed. One would be performed whenever 35 patients had passed away. If both the observed HR was less than or equal to 0.55 and its related p-value was less than 0.0167, the trial may be stopped for efficacy at this point. If the trial continued, the second interim analysis would take place after 70 people had expired. If the observed HR was less than or equal to 0.55 and its corresponding p-value was lower than or equal to 0.0218, the trial could be stopped for efficacy at this point.</p>
