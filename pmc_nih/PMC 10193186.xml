                  <title>Question</title>
                  <p>Can deliberate practice (goal-oriented training with a coach who provides immediate, personalized performance feedback) improve diagnostic reasoning in trauma triage?</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="ab-zoi230417-2">
                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>In this pilot randomized clinical trial of a novel deliberate practice intervention, 93% of participants received 3 planned coaching sessions, and most participants (93%) described the sessions as entertaining and valuable. During a simulation, the triage decisions of physicians in the intervention group were more likely to adhere to clinical practice guidelines than the triage decisions of physicians in the control group.</p>

                  <title>Meaning</title>
                  <p>The deliberate practice intervention was feasible, acceptable, and effective in the laboratory, setting the stage for a future phase 3 clinical trial.</p>

                  <title>Design, Setting, and Participants</title>
                  <p>This pilot randomized clinical trial was conducted online in a national convenience sample of 72 emergency physicians between January 1 and March 31, 2022, without follow-up.</p>

                  <title>Interventions</title>
                  <p>Participants were randomly assigned to receive either usual care (ie, passive control) or a deliberate practice intervention, consisting of 3 weekly, 30-minute, video-conferenced sessions during which physicians played a customized, theory-based video game while being observed by content experts (coaches) who provided immediate, personalized feedback on diagnostic reasoning.</p>

                <sec id="ab-zoi230417-8">
                  <title>Main Outcomes and Measures</title>

                  <p>The study enrolled 72 physicians (mean [SD] age, 43.3 [9.4] years; 44 men [61%]) but limited registration of physicians in the intervention group to 30 because of the availability of the coaches.

The intervention was delivered with high fidelity, with 28 of 30 physicians (93%) completing 3 coaching sessions and with coaches delivering 95% of session components (642 of 674). A total of 21 of 36 physicians (58%) in the control group participated in outcome assessment; 28 of 30 physicians (93%) in the intervention group participated in semistructured interviews, and 26 of 30 physicians (87%) in the intervention group participated in outcome assessment. Most physicians in the intervention group (93% [26 of 28]) described the sessions as entertaining and valuable; most (88% [22 of 25]) affirmed the intention to adopt the principles discussed. Suggestions for refinement included providing more time with the coach and addressing contextual barriers to triage. During the simulation, the triage decisions of physicians in the intervention group were more likely to adhere to clinical practice guidelines than those in the control group (odds ratio; 13.8, 95% CI, 2.8-69.6; <italic>P</italic>â=â.001).</p>

                <p>We conducted a pilot randomized clinical trial of a deliberate practice intervention to improve diagnostic reasoning in trauma triage between January 1 and March 31, 2022, without follow-up. We enrolled and randomized a national respondent-driven sample of physicians to the intervention group or to a passive control group. We structured the process evaluation of the intervention using the Proctor framework of outcomes for implementation research and followed the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials Extension (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/consort-cluster/" ext-link-type="uri">CONSORT Extension</ext-link>) reporting guideline (ie, extension for pilot and feasibility trials) in reporting our results.<sup><xref rid="zoi230417r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230417r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> We previously published the trial protocol with a priori hypotheses about criteria for defining success.<sup><xref rid="zoi230417r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> The University of Pittsburgh Human Research Protection Office approved the study.

                <p>To recruit participants for the study, we contacted physicians who had previously participated in our research and asked them to refer us to 2 colleagues. We sought board-certified emergency physicians who treated adult patients in the emergency department of either a nontrauma center or a Level III or IV trauma center in the US and who therefore would have responsibility for performing trauma triage in their clinical practice. Respondents received a screening questionnaire with details about the trial, a consent form, and items querying their demographic characteristics. Racial and ethnic categories were specified by the study team based on National Institutes of Health criteria.<sup><xref rid="zoi230417r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Physicians who provided consent were randomized in a 1:1 ratio, stratified by prior participation in our research, using a schema built in Stata, version 16.0 (StataCorp LLC), with block sizes of 4 (<xref rid="zoi230417f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).

                <p>Three members of the study team with expertise in trauma surgery (D.M. and R.M.F.) and emergency medicine (J.E.) acted as the coaches. We standardized the fidelity of intervention delivery in 3 ways. First, prior to the trial, we conducted three 1-hour training sessions, supervised by experts in deliberate practice (R.M.A., B.F., and D.B.W.). Second, we created a coaching manual as a reference that summarized the learning objectives, core tasks of the coaching sessions, and the pedagogical strategies that coaches should use (a full draft of the coaching manual is in the eAppendix in <xref rid="note-ZOI230417-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 2</xref>). Finally, coaches met weekly with the full study team during the trial to debrief and to discuss strategies for managing issues that had arisen. Based on these sessions, we made several modifications to the intervention, including condensing the content to increase the time spent on each decision principle and identifying additional pedagogical strategies that coaches could use to engage participants in the sessions (eg, retrieval practice during sessions 2 and 3).</p>

We therefore asked those in the intervention group to select 1 of the 2 blocks (January or February) in which we offered coaching and to sign up for three 30-minute sessions within the block. Based on availability, we paired participants with a coach on a first-come, first-served basis.

We asked participants in the passive control group to complete the same simulation within 3 weeks of the start of the trial. The trial tasks took approximately 3 hours for those in the intervention group and 1 hour for those in the control group. Participants received 3 personalized reminder emails at weekly intervals or until they completed the trial tasks. We offered a financial incentive to increase response rates, setting its size with a wage-based model of reimbursement.<sup><xref rid="zoi230417r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230417r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Physicians in the intervention group received an iPad with the game and Zoom app preloaded, which they used for the coaching sessions and which they kept as their honorarium (approximate value, $300).

Most physicians (28 of 30 [93%]) completed 3 coaching sessions; 2 of 30 (7%) completed 2 sessions.

Coaches covered 95% of the tasks (642 of 674), pooled across the 3 sessions. The component most frequently missed was the debriefing (19% [6 of 32]), usually because of time constraints.</p>

                <p>In semistructured interviews, most participants (93% [26 of 28]) in the intervention group described the sessions as entertaining, providing a useful refresher of guidelines, distilling clear learning points, and modeling valuable communication scripts for emergency department physicians. Most participants responded that the length and number of sessions were appropriate (80% [16 of 20]) and would recommend the intervention (87% [20 of 23]). Of the 25 physicians who discussed adoption of the principles, 6 (24%) reported having used the material since completing the coaching sessions, while 16 (64%) said they would use the material in the future. Some participants (7 of 28 [25%]) had reservations about the program. For example, 1 participant noted a discordance between the intervention and the realities of clinical practice; another responded that the time commitment was excessive.

It was just kind of like thatâs what we always do or thatâs what we know what we usually do but this kind of like helped me kind of clarify in my mind what those criteria are.

Because itâs a frustrating piece of our jobs, trying to get folks accepted and sort of make the right pitch to our person. And so, I think this was helpful for me to refine that language.

                <p>Physicians in the intervention group spent a median of 5.3 minutes (IQR, 3.6-7.7 minutes) on severely injured cases and entered a median of 10 orders per case (IQR, 8-13 orders per case), while those in the control group spent a median of 6.8 minutes (IQR, 4.8-9.2 minutes) and entered a median of 11 orders per case (IQR, 9.5-15.0 orders per case). Physicians in the intervention group were more likely than physicians in the control group to transfer severely injured patients to trauma centers (51% [50 of 99] vs 15% [13 of 84]; odds ratio, 13.8; 95% CI 2.8-69.6; <italic>P</italic>â=â.001).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>In this pilot randomized clinical trial, we delivered a novel deliberate practice intervention to practicing emergency medicine physicians with high fidelity. Most physicians described the intervention as valuable and the time required as appropriate. They also reported intentions to adopt the lessons learned during the training sessions. The intervention had an effect on physiciansâ adherence to trauma triage practice guidelines during an online simulation.</p>
              <p>These results confirm those of previous studies, which demonstrated the ability of deliberate practice to facilitate the acquisition of expertise in medicine, across domains as varied as communication in the emergency department or intensive care unit, resuscitation, and surgery.<sup><xref rid="zoi230417r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230417r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230417r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230417r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230417r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> For example, a meta-analytic comparative review of the literature on skill acquisition in procedural domains (eg, laparoscopic surgery) identified a correlation between the use of deliberate practice and positive outcomes (<italic>r</italic>â=â0.71).<sup><xref rid="zoi230417r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> Our study expands on these results by focusing on diagnostic reasoning and targeting the performance of physicians in practice rather than medical trainees.</p>
              <p>If these results transfer to the clinical setting, deliberate practice could address national priorities to improve public health outcomes.<sup><xref rid="zoi230417r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230417r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> Injury is the leading cause of loss of life among people younger than 45 years and the leading cause of loss of independence among people older than 65 years.<sup><xref rid="zoi230417r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> More generally, diagnostic errors affect between 8% and 15% of all hospital admissions in the US, with cognitive factors in clinician decision-making contributing to 75% of the errors.<sup><xref rid="zoi230417r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230417r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup></p>
              <p>This pilot randomized clinical trial allowed us to test several concerns about delivering a deliberate practice intervention in trauma triage. One concern was how to design a training task that captured the core challenges of trauma triage at nontrauma centersâuncertainty, time pressure, and low rates of true-positive cases. The use of a customized video game provided physicians with an opportunity to practice the diagnostic task repeatedly and rapidly. A second concern was how to help participants refine the heuristics (intuitive judgments) guiding their judgments. Having participants think aloud while playing the game gave coaches access to participantsâ cognitive processes, expressed in their natural terms, helping coaches to select and to convey potentially missed cues (eg, frailty). A third concern was the feasibility and acceptability of such an intervention among busy practicing clinicians. We found that most physicians enrolled in the trial, albeit a self-selected sample, relished the opportunity to interact with someone whom they perceived as a content expert. In debriefing interviews, respondents emphasized the social aspect of the intervention, underscoring the value they found in the connections that they formed with the coach.</p>

                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p>This study has several limitations. First, we used a passive rather than an active control as the comparator, which may have magnified the effect of the intervention. Second, attrition in the completion of the virtual simulation differed among the control and intervention groups, which we attribute to engagement. Attrition could have introduced bias, if missingness was not random. However, we have no reason to believe that this was the case. Third, our observations may lack generalizability because of the characteristics of our convenience sample. Fourth, we did not cluster our analysis at the coach level during this pilot trial but plan to test this potential mediator of effect in the future.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>This successful pilot randomized clinical trial sets the stage for a planned phase 3 trial of our novel behavioral intervention. The trial also provides evidence that deliberate practice can support judgment tasks, as well as the procedural tasks addressed in most applications, and therefore extends the utility of the method.</p>
