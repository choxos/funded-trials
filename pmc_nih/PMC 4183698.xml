              <abstract>
                <p>Paradoxical tuberculosis-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (TB-IRIS) is an aberrant inflammatory response occurring in a subset of TB-HIV co-infected patients initiating anti-retroviral therapy (ART). Here, we examined monocyte activation by prospectively quantitating pro-inflammatory plasma markers and monocyte subsets in TB-HIV co-infected patients from a South Indian cohort at baseline and following ART initiation at the time of IRIS, or at equivalent time points in non-IRIS controls. Pro-inflammatory biomarkers of innate and myeloid cell activation were increased in plasma of IRIS patients pre-ART and at the time of IRIS; this association was confirmed in a second cohort in South Africa. Increased expression of these markers correlated with elevated antigen load as measured by higher sputum culture grade and shorter duration of anti-TB therapy. Phenotypic analysis revealed the frequency of CD14<sup>++</sup>CD16<sup>âˆ’</sup> monocytes was an independent predictor of TB-IRIS, and was closely associated with plasma levels of CRP, TNF, IL-6 and tissue factor during IRIS. In addition, production of inflammatory cytokines by monocytes was higher in IRIS patients compared to controls pre-ART. These data point to a major role of mycobacterial antigen load and myeloid cell hyperactivation in the pathogenesis of TB-IRIS, and implicate monocytes and monocyte-derived cytokines as potential targets for TB-IRIS prevention or treatment.</p>

                <p>Tuberculosis and HIV majorly impact host immune responses, resulting in immune deregulation and inflammation-driven tissue damage. Initiation of anti-retroviral therapy in patients with HIV-TB co-infection may result in immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (TB-IRIS), a disorder associated with increased immunopathology due to unfettered inflammation after CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell reconstitution. Monocytes are critical to the innate immune system and play an important role in several inflammatory conditions associated with chronic infections. Immunopathogenesis of TB-IRIS has been linked to activation of the adaptive immune response against opportunistic infection, yet the role of monocytes is still unknown. Here we investigated associations between soluble markers of monocyte activation, differential activation of monocyte subsets and TB-IRIS prospectively in two geographically distinct HIV-TB co-infected patient cohorts. Prior to ART initiation, patients who developed IRIS displayed a biosignature of elevated soluble monocyte activation markers, which were closely related to the mycobacterial antigen load in sputum samples. Amongst monocyte subsets, we observed that pre-ART circulating CD14<sup>++</sup>CD16<sup>âˆ’</sup> cell frequency independently predicted TB-IRIS and expanded during IRIS events. This monocyte subset was tightly associated with systemic markers of inflammation, and was found to produce inflammatory cytokines. Identification of this monocyte subset and its link with inflammation may lead to conception of novel therapies reducing immunopathology in TB-IRIS.</p>

              <p>Implementation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in patients co-infected with HIV and tuberculosis (TB) has greatly improved life expectancy <xref rid="ppat.1004433-Johnson1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>â€“<xref rid="ppat.1004433-Fang1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Anti-retroviral therapy reconstitutes the number and function of CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells and most patients manifest clinical improvement of signs and symptoms of opportunistic co-infections including tuberculosis (TB). Nevertheless, some patients experience a paradoxical worsening of TB during the first 3 months of ART, a phenomenon known as immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome or IRIS <xref rid="ppat.1004433-Lawn1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>â€“<xref rid="ppat.1004433-Meintjes1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. The incidence of TB-IRIS is variable (from 8 to 54%) depending on the epidemiological settings <xref rid="ppat.1004433-Breen1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>â€“<xref rid="ppat.1004433-AbdoolKarim2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. The clinical manifestations can range from fever and lymph node enlargement to sepsis-like syndrome and neurological deterioration <xref rid="ppat.1004433-Lawn2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. The immunological basis of the pathological mechanisms leading to TB-IRIS is still not fully understood. The clinical onset of IRIS has been linked to hyperactivation of T-cells specific for antigens from opportunistic pathogens, resulting in an inflammatory cytokine storm <xref rid="ppat.1004433-Mahnke1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>â€“<xref rid="ppat.1004433-Tadokera1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. In addition, different components of the innate immune response such as natural killer cells (NK) <xref rid="ppat.1004433-Conradie1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, macrophages <xref rid="ppat.1004433-Lawn3" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, monocytes <xref rid="ppat.1004433-Tran1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004433-Tran2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> and neutrophils <xref rid="ppat.1004433-Marais1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> have been implicated in the pathogenesis of TB-IRIS <xref rid="ppat.1004433-Gopalan1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Monocytes are critical for host immunity against both TB and HIV, and as such, their specific role in TB-IRIS warrants better understanding. In a recent study of TB-IRIS, transcriptional analysis of monocytes suggested a potential role of monocytes and the complement system in this phenomenon <xref rid="ppat.1004433-Tran2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. In addition, myeloid cells and innate cytokines such as IL-6 have been proposed to play a role in mycobacterial IRIS, as suggested in an animal model of IRIS developed by our group <xref rid="ppat.1004433-Barber2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004433-Barber3" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>.</p>
              <p>Human monocyte subpopulations can be categorized based on the dichotomous expression of the surface markers CD14 and CD16 into three major subsets: CD14<sup>++</sup>CD16<sup>âˆ’</sup>, CD14<sup>+</sup>CD16<sup>+</sup> and CD14<sup>dim</sup>CD16<sup>+</sup>. These different monocyte subsets have been described to exhibit very distinct functional roles in a range of homeostatic and pathological conditions <xref rid="ppat.1004433-Shi1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. No detailed analysis of the different monocyte subsets in TB-IRIS has been performed in patients. The goal of the present study was to evaluate the role of monocyte subsets and their association with pro-inflammatory cytokines in the setting of TB-IRIS. Our findings from studying three geographically distinct patient cohorts demonstrate that expansion and activation of the CD14<sup>++</sup>CD16<sup>âˆ’</sup> monocyte subset is closely associated with the pathogenesis of TB-IRIS.</p>

                <p>TB-IRIS has been clearly shown to be associated with elevated plasma concentrations of several pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines <xref rid="ppat.1004433-Tadokera1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, some of them known to be strongly linked to monocyte stimulation. We tested whether the monocyte and macrophage activation markers sCD14, sCD163 and sTF were also altered in TB-IRIS in a cohort of patients from South India. We found significantly higher levels in TB-IRIS patients vs. non-IRIS controls at baseline of sCD163 (median 3638 ng/mL, IQR: 3411â€“3880 ng/mL vs. 3257 ng/mL, IQR: 2823â€“3343 ng/mL, P&lt;0.001) and sTF (median 32.5 pg/mL, IQR: 19.3â€“52.1 pg/mL vs. 13.9 pg/mL, IQR: 10.2â€“28.2 pg/mL, P&lt;0.001), whereas sCD14 was significantly lower at baseline (median 3.8 Âµg/mL, IQR: 3.2â€“4.4 Âµg/mL vs. 5.5 Âµg/mL, IQR: 4.4â€“6.7 Âµg/mL, P&lt;0.001). At the time of IRIS, levels of all three markers were higher in IRIS patients compared to non-IRIS controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004433-g001">Figure 1</xref>). In addition, statistically significant differences were observed when comparing changes from baseline to the time of IRIS or an equivalent time point in the IRIS vs. non-IRIS groups for sCD14 (median fold-change from baseline 1.2, IQR: 0.64â€“1.7 vs. 0.6, IQR: 0.45â€“0.9, Pâ€Š=â€Š0.012), sCD163 (median fold-change from baseline 1.0, IQR: 0.94â€“1.1 vs. 0.94, IQR: 0.85â€“1.0, Pâ€Š=â€Š0.015) and sTF (median fold-change from baseline 2.4, IQR: 2.1â€“2.9 vs. 1.07, IQR: 0.76â€“2.5, P&lt;0.001). At 24 weeks after ART initiation, levels of these biomarkers significantly decreased in both IRIS and non-IRIS patients, with no significant differences between the groups except for sCD163 levels, which remained higher in the IRIS group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004433-g001">Figure 1Aâ€“C</xref>).</p>

                <p>We next compared plasma levels of several pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and markers of tissue damage in the Indian cohort. Consistent with previous reports <xref rid="ppat.1004433-Tadokera1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, we confirmed that after ART initiation, patients who experienced IRIS exhibited elevated levels of many pro- and anti-inflammatory biomarkers with 7 out of the 16 cytokines and chemokines measured dramatically elevated in TB-IRIS patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004433-g001">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004433.s007">Table S1</xref>). Nevertheless, circulating levels of CXCL10, IL-12p70 and PDGF were higher in non-IRIS control patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004433-g001">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004433.s007">Table S1</xref>). In addition, after 6 weeks of ART, individuals without IRIS events had higher plasma concentrations of I-FABP and CCL5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004433-g001">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004433.s007">Table S1</xref>).</p>
                <p>As reported in other studies, a critical difference between the patients who developed IRIS and those who did not was duration of anti-TB therapy (ATT) before ART initiation at study baseline: median of 20 days (IQR: 14â€“30 days) in TB-IRIS cases versus 43 days (IQR: 23â€“68 days) in controls (Pâ€Š=â€Š0.002) <xref rid="ppat.1004433-Narendran1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. In order to assess how the duration of ATT impacts the cytokine and chemokine profile of patients prior to ART (a factor that has been repeatedly associated with risk of IRIS), we compared the concentrations of plasma biomarkers in study patients grouped according to time on ATT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004433-g002">Figure 2</xref>). As expected, the mycobacterial load in sputum cultures significantly reduced with time on ATT (Pâ€Š=â€Š0.005; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004433-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). The pattern of distribution of plasma biomarkers also changed significantly with duration of ATT. Individuals who were on ATT for less than 4 weeks exhibited higher concentrations of plasma biomarkers associated with activation of innate immune responses, such as IL-1Î², IL-6, CRP, sCD163, IL-8, CCL2, PDGF as well as several chemokines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004433-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). In contrast, biomarkers that are more closely associated with activation of adaptive immune responses, such as IFN-Î³, IL-2, IL-15, sPD-1 and IL-7, were higher in patients who were on ATT for more than 4 weeks before ART initiation. The finding that IRIS patients received ATT for a shorter time before ART initiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004433-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) suggested the importance of an elevated Mtb antigen load, as supported by increased colony forming unit grades in sputum Mtb cultures.</p>

                <title>The plasma inflammatory profile of TB-IRIS patients is not associated with absolute counts of monocytes or neutrophils in the peripheral blood</title>
                <p>To further investigate the association between monocyte activation markers and systemic inflammation in TB-IRIS, we employed a network analysis based on multiple Spearman correlations between all the biomarkers measured in plasma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004433-g001">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004433.s001">Data File S1</xref>). We found that in IRIS patients, the number of significant correlations between multiple variables was very high compared to non-IRIS controls (P&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004433-g001">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004433.s001">Data File S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004433.s004">Figure S2</xref>). This finding from network analysis argues that the cytokine storm observed in TB-IRIS is tightly coordinated. In addition, the direction of change in network densities observed in the IRIS vs. non-IRIS groups did not seem to be associated with HIV viral load or CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell count (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004433.s004">Figure S2</xref>), implying that other factors may affect more directly how plasma biomarkers correlate with one another.</p>
                <p>Our results from measurements of multiple plasma biomarkers suggest that biomarkers of monocyte activation are associated with the inflammatory environment of TB-IRIS after ART initiation. We next tested whether the concentration of monocytes in peripheral blood reflected the observations from plasma protein analysis and found no significant differences in total monocyte counts between the study groups at the different time points evaluated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004433-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Absolute neutrophil counts were higher in the IRIS group at week 6 compared to non-IRIS controls (P&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004433-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). However, the network analysis revealed a lack of significant correlations between absolute neutrophil and monocyte counts and the plasma biomarkers of inflammation at all time points studied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004433-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). At enrollment (pre-ART), patients who developed IRIS during the study displayed significant positive correlations between monocyte counts and innate cytokines such as IL-1Î² (râ€Š=â€Š0.53, Pâ€Š=â€Š0.012), IL-6 (râ€Š=â€Š0.67, Pâ€Š=â€Š0.001) and IL-8 (râ€Š=â€Š0.49, Pâ€Š=â€Š0.023) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004433-g003">Figure 3B</xref>).</p>

                <p>Our results from two separate areas endemic for HIV-TB co-infection suggest that soluble markers of monocyte/myeloid activation are associated with the occurrence of paradoxical TB-IRIS following ART initiation, but total monocyte or neutrophil counts do not seem to influence this association.

                <p>Analyses of the monocyte subsets confirmed that the chemokine receptor CX3CR1 was more highly expressed in the CD14<sup>dim</sup>CD16<sup>+</sup> subset, whereas CCR2 was more prevalent in the CD14<sup>++</sup>CD16<sup>âˆ’</sup> and CD14<sup>+</sup>CD16<sup>+</sup> subsets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004433-g005">Figure 5A</xref>).

CD163 expression co-localized with CD14 on the surface of monocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004433-g005">Figure 5C</xref>) and was elevated pre-ART on CD14<sup>++</sup>CD16<sup>âˆ’</sup> monocytes in IRIS patients compared with non-IRIS controls (MFI 1271 arbitrary units [AU], IQR: 100.1â€“3696 AU vs. 101.5 AU, IQR: 47.5â€“425.0 AU, Pâ€Š=â€Š0.002; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004433-g005">Figure 5D</xref>), being further increased at the time of IRIS (MFI 5000.3 AU, IQR: 1000.5â€“20050.6 AU at IRIS event vs. 146.0 AU, IQR: 20.3â€“492.5 AU at week 6 in non-IRIS controls, P&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004433-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). Moreover, CD163 expression on the CD14<sup>++</sup>CD16<sup>âˆ’</sup> subset was positively correlated with plasma levels of sCD163 (Spearman râ€Š=â€Š0.63, P&lt;0.001), suggesting that this monocyte subset could be a source of the soluble receptor.</p>
                <p>We next analyzed the changes in each of the major monocyte and other mononuclear myeloid subsets between study baseline and the time of IRIS or 6 weeks post-ART initiation in non-IRIS patients. The total number of circulating mononuclear myeloid cells did not significantly change in IRIS (34.7Â±12.5% of total PBMC) or non-IRIS patients (35.2Â±9.3% of total PBMC) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004433.s005">Figure S3A</xref>). Among all monocytes, the CD14<sup>++</sup>CD16<sup>âˆ’</sup> subset exhibited the greatest increase in IRIS patients and the greatest decrease in non-IRIS patients after ART initiation (median delta variation for IRIS vs. non-IRIS groups: 9.9%, IQR: 8.5 to 11.5% vs. âˆ’7.7%, IQR: âˆ’5.7 to âˆ’8.2%, P&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004433.s005">Figure S3B</xref>). Multivariate logistic regression analysis adjusted for baseline age, gender, days to ART initiation, plasma HIV RNA levels and CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell count revealed that the frequency of each circulating monocyte subset prior to ART initiation was an independent predictor of TB-IRIS developing during the study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004433-g005">Figure 5E</xref>).</p>
                <p>These results support the idea that monocyte subsets are associated with the occurrence of TB-IRIS in HIV patients following ART initiation and, specifically, that circulating CD14<sup>++</sup>CD16<sup>âˆ’</sup> cells are associated with IRIS pathogenesis. This was further supported by the fact that, in the entire Indian cohort (nâ€Š=â€Š48), the frequency of circulating CD14<sup>++</sup>CD16<sup>âˆ’</sup> monocytes, but not other subsets, was strongly correlated with several key cytokines associated with inflammation and IRIS both at baseline (pre-ART) and after ART initiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004433-g006">Figure 6</xref>).</p>

                <p>Our results have demonstrated that CD14<sup>++</sup>CD16<sup>âˆ’</sup> monocytes expand in the blood after ART initiation in patients who develop TB-IRIS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004433-g005">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004433.s005">Figure S3</xref>) and also correlate with the inflammatory milieu seen during the IRIS episode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004433-g006">Figure 6</xref>). We have also shown that the patients receiving ATT for shorter periods before ART initiation exhibited heightened Mtb sputum culture grades (suggestive of elevated mycobacterial burden) and displayed increased plasma concentration of several inflammatory cytokines associated with IRIS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004433-g002">Figure 2</xref>). These observations indicate that the mycobacterial load prior to immune reconstitution with ART may be critical to promote the inflammatory environment of IRIS. We hypothesized that elevated mycobacterial load leads to increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by monocytes in HIV infected patients responding to ART (after HIV viremia suppression). To test this hypothesis, we assessed the intracellular cytokine production by monocytes in North American HIV infected patients at pre-ART and week 8 post-ART initiation, who were not co-infected with Mtb (to control for differences of <italic>in vivo</italic> exposure to mycobacteria). We observed that the CD14<sup>++</sup>CD16<sup>âˆ’</sup> monocyte subset represented the vast majority of IL-6 and TNF-Î± producing monocytes after Mtb stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004433-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). Monocytes from HIV+ patients with suppressed viral load produced more intracellular IL-6 and TNF-Î± spontaneously and also upon stimulation with different doses of Mtb than those from individuals with HIV viremia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004433-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). These results argue that once HIV viral load is suppressed and CD4 cell numbers increase shortly after ART initiation, inflammatory monocytes can respond to Mtb with augmented production of IL-6 and TNF-Î±, cytokines tightly associated with IRIS.</p>

We performed intracellular cytokine assays in whole blood samples available from our South India Cohort (17 individuals who developed IRIS and 15 patients from the non-IRIS group).

Before ART initiation, IRIS patients exhibited an increased frequency of monocytes producing at least one of these pro-inflammatory cytokines than non-IRIS individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004433-g008">Figure 8B</xref>).

The increased frequency of monocytes producing pro-inflammatory cytokines prior to ART initiation was also strongly associated with a reduced time on ATT (â‰¤4 weeks) and increased Mtb loads in sputum cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004433-g008">Figure 8C</xref>).

In the present study, soluble biomarkers of inflammation and monocyte activation were evaluated in patients with TB-HIV co-infection from India and South Africa, to examine the role of monocytes in pathogenesis of TB-IRIS. Our findings revealed distinct differences in monocyte subsets between individuals who developed paradoxical TB-IRIS compared to those who did not, which were strongly linked to the profound inflammatory milieu of IRIS.</p>
              <p>Soluble markers derived from monocyte activation, such as sCD14, sCD163 and sTF have been extensively described in the context of HIV infection <xref rid="ppat.1004433-Burdo1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>â€“<xref rid="ppat.1004433-Mayne1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Plasma levels of sCD14 have been established as a strong indicator of monocyte activation <xref rid="ppat.1004433-Su1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref> and as an independent predictor of death <xref rid="ppat.1004433-Sandler1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Here, we describe that pre-ART plasma levels of sCD14 increased at the time of IRIS, while decreasing in individuals not developing IRIS. In addition, patients in this study who developed IRIS already exhibited increased levels of CD163 pre-ART, which were sustained at high levels for up to 24 weeks after ART initiation. Levels of sCD163 positively correlated with the degree of cellular expression of CD163 on CD14<sup>++</sup>CD16<sup>âˆ’</sup> monocytes, implying that this subset might be an important source of this marker in TB-IRIS. Our results showing an association between sCD163 and IRIS are not surprising, as this marker has been linked to a worse prognosis and increased HIV activity both prior to and after ART initiation <xref rid="ppat.1004433-Burdo1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> and appears to be an independent predictor of mortality in TB <xref rid="ppat.1004433-Knudsen1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>.</p>
              <p>Activated monocytes in the circulation and tissue macrophages are also a major source of TF <xref rid="ppat.1004433-Osterud1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. The shedding of TF by these cells triggers coagulation, which has been clearly associated with increased mortality and cardiovascular complications in HIV infection <xref rid="ppat.1004433-Baker1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004433-Mayne1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. More recently, it has been shown that Mtb induces TF expression in macrophages and Mtb signaling pathways that induce TF require cooperation of multiple receptors and co-factors including Toll-like receptors <xref rid="ppat.1004433-Kothari1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Our results demonstrate that levels of sTF in plasma are already elevated before ART initiation and increase even more in patients who develop IRIS upon immune reconstitution. Increased TF expression could be one of the factors that, together with sCD163, influence the onset of IRIS. More importantly, the analysis of plasma biomarkers of monocyte activation in this study favors the idea of increased monocyte activation prior to ART in patients who ultimately develop TB-IRIS and is corroborated by increased cytokine production by monocytes pre-ART in TB-IRIS patients.</p>
              <p>There is now strong evidence that patients experiencing TB-IRIS exhibit increased systemic concentrations of multiple cytokines, chemokines and growth factors, a phenomenon known as cytokine storm or hypercytokinemia <xref rid="ppat.1004433-Tadokera1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Our findings assessing multiple plasma biomarkers from patients originating from two different endemic countries for HIV-TB co-infection reinforce this idea. Interestingly, ATT itself seems to considerably affect the expression of several plasma biomarkers. At less than 4 weeks after TB treatment initiation, TB-HIV co-infected individuals exhibited increased concentrations of several plasma factors of innate immune origin, such as IL-1Î², IL-6, IL-8 and CCL2. The levels of these and other innate soluble factors decreased with time on ATT, whereas markers of activation of adaptive immune responses significantly increased. We have previously shown for the same cohort of patients described here, that time from ATT to ART initiation was strongly associated with the occurrence of TB-IRIS, even after adjustment for several confounding factors, such as CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell counts and HIV viral load <xref rid="ppat.1004433-Narendran1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Because the majority of the IRIS patients were on ATT for a shorter period compared with non-IRIS controls, we speculate that the activated innate immune signature in these individuals may set the stage for paradoxical TB-IRIS upon ART initiation. More importantly, we describe that multiple soluble parameters measured in TB-IRIS patients during the event were not only increased in expression but also displayed strong positive correlations with each other, suggesting they belong to common activation pathways.</p>
              <p>To our knowledge, this is the first study that formally describes monocyte subsets in an at-risk TB-HIV co-infected population and demonstrates associations between activation of these cellular subsets and TB-IRIS. Our results clearly show that the composition of monocyte subsets is significantly different between IRIS and non-IRIS patients, even before ART initiation. The striking finding that CD14<sup>++</sup>CD16<sup>âˆ’</sup> and CD14<sup>+</sup>CD16<sup>+</sup> monocytes are increased, whereas CD14<sup>dim</sup>CD16<sup>+</sup> cells are dramatically decreased, in IRIS patients before ART initiation implies that the relative distribution of monocyte subsets may be an important predictor of IRIS. In addition, these results indicate that CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes or tissue myeloid cells derived from circulating monocytes might be the source of several of the inflammatory cytokines detected in plasma. The function of the different monocyte subsets in producing pro- or anti-inflammatory cytokines is controversial and has been variably reported in past studies, depending on the experimental design and inflammatory setting. Studies assessing sorted monocytes stimulated with different Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands show that CD14<sup>dim</sup>CD16<sup>+</sup> cells are more prone to producing TNF-Î±, whereas CD14<sup>+</sup>CD16<sup>+</sup> cells are a major source of IL-10 <xref rid="ppat.1004433-SkrzeczynskaMoncznik1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004433-Belge1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. More recently, CD14<sup>dim</sup>CD16<sup>+</sup> cells were shown to exhibit patrolling characteristics, with a weak ability for phagocytosis and a limited capacity to produce reactive oxygen species and cytokines when stimulated with bacterial TLR agonists but high amounts of TNF-Î± and IL-1Î² upon stimulation with viral ligands or nucleic acids <xref rid="ppat.1004433-Cros1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. These findings suggest that monocyte subsets cannot be categorized merely as pro- or anti-inflammatory and that their effector functions may depend on the activation pathway and immune microenvironment. Our study reveals that among the different types of monocytes, the CD14<sup>++</sup>CD16<sup>âˆ’</sup> subset is the key monocyte population producing inflammatory cytokines and, upon ART initiation, has a clearly differentiated trajectory, expanding in TB-IRIS patients and proportionally decreasing in non-IRIS patients.</p>
              <p>Macrophages derived from CD14<sup>++</sup>CD16<sup>âˆ’</sup> monocytes have been shown to be more permissive to Mtb growth in vitro than those derived from the CD14<sup>dim</sup>CD16<sup>+</sup> subset <xref rid="ppat.1004433-Dhiman1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, due to increased c-maf expression. It is plausible that increased numbers of CD14<sup>++</sup>CD16<sup>âˆ’</sup> monocytes of TB-HIV co-infected individuals with very low CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell counts (and, thus, with reduced capacity to provide co-stimulatory signals for antigen presenting cells) generate macrophages that are more permissive to Mtb infection and replication. When HIV-mediated immunosuppression is decreased upon ART initiation and antigen-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells rapidly reconstitute, this may create a burst of T-cell help, with large numbers of infected macrophages now becoming fully activated simultaneously in individuals developing paradoxical TB-IRIS. This would result in a massive production of pro-inflammatory mediators, which contributes to IRIS immunopathology. We have proposed this hypothesis previously, based on observations from a murine model of mycobacterial IRIS in which similar changes in the same monocyte subsets are observed <xref rid="ppat.1004433-Barber1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004433-Barber2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004433-Barber3" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. A pathogenic role of neutrophils was not supported by our data but was not studied exhaustively and should be further investigated.</p>
              <p>In the current study, the percentage of circulating CD14<sup>++</sup>CD16<sup>âˆ’</sup> monocytes, but not other subsets, was significantly correlated with several pro-inflammatory cytokines before and after ART initiation, reinforcing this hypothesis. In addition, we have also demonstrated here that CD14<sup>++</sup>CD16<sup>âˆ’</sup> monocytes from HIV+ patients with suppressed viral replication are capable of producing larger amounts of IL-6 and TNF-Î± than at pre-ART upon stimulation with increasing doses of Mtb. Spontaneous direct <italic>ex vivo</italic> cytokine production was also higher pre-ART in TB-IRIS patients. These results may lead us to speculate that once HIV+ individuals with higher mycobacterial antigen loads suppress HIV replication, they become highly responsive to Mtb stimulation, which results in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines that contribute to the activation of inflammatory pathways and the resultant immunopathology of TB-IRIS. The lack of differences in direct spontaneous cytokine production of monocytes from TB-IRIS patients at the IRIS time point may represent trafficking and maturation into tissue macrophages or myeloid dendritic cells, a hypothesis that should be further investigated. Understanding the key determinants from the innate immune system, and myeloid cells more specifically, that play a fundamental role in TB-IRIS can help develop better strategies for the prediction, clinical management and pharmacologic targeting of this important complication of ART.</p>

A hierarchical cluster analysis using the Ward's method was employed to reveal the patterns of expression in plasma. The analyses were first performed in the Indian cohort and then repeated in the South African cohort for validation. The databank from South Africa contained a reduced number of biomarkers compared to India, and there was no pre-selection of markers based on the Indian cohort data.
