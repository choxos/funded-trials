              <abstract>
                <p>MicroRNAs are a class of small noncoding RNAs that function as critical gene regulators through targeting mRNAs for translational repression or degradation. In this study, we showed that miR-128 expression levels were decreased in glioma, and identified p70S6K1 as a novel direct target of miR-128. Overexpression of miR-128 suppressed p70S6K1 and its downstream signaling molecules such as HIF-1 and VEGF expression, and attenuated cell proliferation, tumor growth and angiogenesis. Forced expression of p70S6K1 can partly rescue the inhibitory effect of miR-128 in the cells. Taken together, these findings will shed light to the role and mechanism of miR-128 in regulating glioma tumor angiogenesis via miR-128/p70S6K1 axis, and miR-128 may serve as a potential therapeutic target in glioma in the future.</p>

              <p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of endogenously expressed small noncoding RNAs that are usually 18∼23 nucleotides long, and regulate gene expression posttranscriptionally by targeting the untranslated regions <xref rid="pone.0032709-Bartel1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.

They have been identified as a new kind of gene expression regulators through targeting mRNAs for translational repression or degradation <xref rid="pone.0032709-EsquelaKerscher1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Gliomas are the most common type of primary brain tumors in adults. Among gliomas, astrocytomas have the highest incidence <xref rid="pone.0032709-Bourne1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. According to World Health Organization's classification, astrocytomas are divided into four grades: pilocytic astrocytoma, diffuse astrocytoma, anaplastic astrocytoma, and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Anaplastic astrocytoma and glioblastoma multiforme are considered malignant glioma. Recently, many miRNAs are found to play important roles in glioma. MiR-7 was down-regulated in glioblastoma which inhibited invasiveness of primary glioblastoma lines <xref rid="pone.0032709-Kefas1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, while miR-26 promotes glioblastoma cell proliferation <italic>in vitro</italic> and tumor growth <italic>in vivo</italic> by targeting several tumor suppressor genes such as PTEN and RB1 <xref rid="pone.0032709-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. MiR-128 is a brain-enriched miRNA <xref rid="pone.0032709-Ciafre1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Most of the studies of miR-128 in carcinogenesis are focusing on glioma. For example, miR-128 has been shown to be down-regulated in glioma <xref rid="pone.0032709-Ciafre1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0032709-Godlewski1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.

              <p>P70S6K1 is one of the key downstream targets of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), which plays important roles in cancerous characteristics such as cell cycle, cell apoptosis, cell growth and proliferation <xref rid="pone.0032709-Bjornsti1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0032709-Aoki1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.

Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) is one of the major regulator of VEGF <xref rid="pone.0032709-Forsythe1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. High levels of HIF-1 expression are observed in many human cancers, and correlated with tumorigenesis <xref rid="pone.0032709-Rankin1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.

However, it is unclear what miRNAs directly regulate p70S6K1 in glioma.</p>
              <p>In the present study, we found that miR-128 was down-regulated in human glioma and acted as a tumor suppressor by directly targeting p70S6K1. Forced expression of miR-128 inhibited p70S6K1, HIF-1α, and VEGF expression. Overexpression of p70S6K1 restored miR-128-inhibited HIF-1α and VEGF expression, confirming that p70S6K1 is the downstream target of miR-128. In addition, miR-128 overexpression suppressed cell proliferation and attenuated tumor growth and angiogenesis <italic>in vivo</italic>. These results give novel insights into our understanding the role and mechanism of miR-128 in glioma pathoetiology, and provide a potential therapeutic strategy for glioma treatment in the future.</p>

                <p>Next, we established cell lines stably expressing miR-128 and its scrambled control (miR-SCR) using human glioma cells U87 and U251 by lentiviral transduction. The expression levels of miR-128 were analyzed in these stable cell lines using RT-PCR. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0032709-g002">Figure 2C</xref>, the expression levels of miR-128 were increased in pLe-miR-128-expressing U87 and U251 cells, respectively, demonstrating that these stable cells successfully expressed miR-128. The cells with miR-128 overexpression showed low levels of p70S6K1 and p-p70S6K1 proteins by 30–50% reduction when compared to those of scrambled control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0032709-g002">Figures 2D and 2E</xref>).

              <p>MiRNAs function as post-transcriptional gene regulators in regulating various physiological and pathological events <xref rid="pone.0032709-Mendell1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. MiRNA abnormalities are thought to play important roles in cancer development. Recent studies have showed that many miRNAs are down-regulated in tumors when compared to normal tissues <xref rid="pone.0032709-Lu1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Consistent with previous studies <xref rid="pone.0032709-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0032709-Godlewski1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, we demonstrated that the expression of miR-128 in glioma tissues was down-regulated when compared to normal brain tissues. The results indicate that miR-128 is involved in pathogenesis of glioma. To determine the role and molecular mechanism of miR-128 in glioma development, we used computational bioinformatics to predict the potential targets of miR-128. Among the potential targets, we confirmed that p70S6K1 is a novel target of miR-128 by experimental method with forced expression of miR-128 suppressing p70S6K1 protein expression. In agreement with these results, overexpression of p70S6K1 rescued the inhibitory effect of miR-128 on p70S6K1 signaling pathway. Interestingly, the levels of miR-128 were negatively correlated with p70S6K1 protein levels in glioma tissues. Thus, this study is useful not only to reveal a novel mechanism of miR-128 in regulating glioma growth through targeting p70S6K1, but also to potentially use the alterations of miR-128/p70S6K1 axis for the diagnostics and treatment of glioma in the future.</p>
              <p>Angiogenesis is the process by which new microvessels sprout from the pre-existing blood vessels. The pathophysiological processes of angiogenesis and tumor cell invasion play pivotal roles in glioma development and growth in the earliest phase and closely related to drug resistance against chemotherapy <xref rid="pone.0032709-Bello1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0032709-Wong1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Angiogenesis is required for tumor growth and metastasis. Our previous studies have showed that p70S6K1 played an important role in regulating HIF-1α and VEGF expression <xref rid="pone.0032709-Fang2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0032709-Bian1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Here we found that miR-128 overexpression can inhibit HIF-1α and VEGF expression through targeting p70S6K1. Consistent with these <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments, forced expression of miR-128 attenuated tumor growth and angiogenesis in nude mice. Furthermore, our results showed that miR-128 expression levels were inversely correlated with the CD31-positive microvessel densities in glioma tumor tissues. These findings indicated a new role and mechanism of miR-128 in angiogenesis and tumor growth.</p>
              <p>In summary, we identified that miR-128 inhibited tumorigenesis and angiogenesis through targeting p70S6K1 and suppressing p70S6K1downstream molecules such as HIF-1 and VEGF. This study identified a link between miR-128 and p70S6K1 axis, which plays vital role in glioma angiogenesis, and provided a potential new target in glioma diagnostics and therapy in the future.</p>
