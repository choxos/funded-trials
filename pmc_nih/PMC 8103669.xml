                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Although largely preventable through diet management and topical fluoride use, early childhood caries (ECC) often progresses to severity that necessitates surgical repair. Yet repair often fails to mitigate caries progression. Needed is an effective behavioral intervention to address underlying behavioral causes.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">This randomized controlled trial will evaluate the efficacy of a behaviorally focused, family-centered intervention, the MySmileBuddy Program (MSB Program), to reduce ECC progression in high-risk preschoolers in New York City. Recruitment will target 858 children ages 24â71Â months with ECC and their parents from primary care medical and dental clinics. The study aims to assess the MSB Programâs efficacy to: (1) decrease ECC progression measured 12-months post-randomization; and (2) enhance adoption of a low cariogenic diet and twice-daily fluoridated toothpaste use compared to control group. Potential causal pathways (mediators and moderators) will be explored. The MSB Program equips community health workers (CHWs) with an app that facilitates multilevel risk assessment and provides motivational interviewing-based counseling to inform parents about the caries process, develop personalized goals, and create family-level action plans to achieve targeted behaviors. Social support from CHWs (4 interactions during the 6-month intervention, supplemented by up to 4 in-person/remote contacts throughout the 12-month study period, based on need) is bolstered by automated text messages. Participants will be randomized to a Control Group (paper-based educational handout plus toothbrushes and fluoridated toothpaste for the child) or Intervention Group (MSB Program, two tooth-brushing observations with feedback and instruction, and toothbrushes and toothpaste for the entire family). All children will receive visual ICDAS dental examinations and parents will complete study measures at baseline and 12-months. An incentive up to $150 plus round-trip transit cards ($5.50 value) will be provided.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">This study hypothesizes that the MSB Program can reduce ECC progression in a high-risk population. Sufficient incentives and a focus on establishing rapport between participants and CHWs are anticipated to mitigate recruitment and retention challenges. If successful, this study will advance the long-term goal of reducing pediatric oral health disparities by demonstrating the efficacy of an acceptable and feasible intervention that shifts attention from dental repair to behavioral risk mitigation.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par17">Dental caries in children under age six years is a persistent, prevalent, and consequential public health problem. More than one-in-five U.S. children ages 2â5 are affected (21.4%) and the disease is disproportionately concentrated in minority and socially disadvantaged populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Early childhood caries (ECC) has deleterious impacts on the child and family as well as elevating risk for future caries experience in both the primary and permanent dentitions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Current treatment regimens focus on surgical repair and pharmacologic suppression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] while also recognizing the need for preventive guidance to mitigate caries activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par18">Needed are behavioral strategies that mitigate caries risk for individual children and reduce ECC disparities among child populations. Twice-daily fluoridated toothpaste use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], consumption of a low cariogenic diet, and health-promoting feeding and eating behaviors have both preventive and therapeutic values for young childrenâs oral health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par19">To date, the few US reports of behavioral interventions to reduce ECC have been predicated on theoretical constructs that include Social Cognitive Theory, Health Belief Model, Theory of Planned Behavior, and Self-determination Theory. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Three of these studies included both clinical and behavioral outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] but none analyzed mediators or moderators to describe how or why the intervention was expected to improve ECC-related behaviors or reduce disease progression. What remains unknown are how to increase the adoption and maintenance of salutary behaviors by high-risk families or populations and the reasons why interventions work or fail to work to secure behavioral changes and reduce ECC incidence.</p>
              <p id="Par20">Approaches built on principles of motivational interviewing and chronic disease management have been suggested to promote such positive oral healthful behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] with mixed results but some notable successes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par21">One such therapeutic caries counseling behavioral approach to ECC prevention and suppression is the theory-based MySmileBuddy (MSB) Program developed by a multidisciplinary team at Columbia University [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. An overview of the theoretical model underlying the MSB Program is presented in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. Using the MySmileBuddy App to ensure scientific integrity, the MSB Program utilizes Community Health Workers (CHWs) to engage families of young children in home and community sites to educate parents, assess ECC risk factors, establish a personalized behavioral goal, develop an action plan to achieve that goal, and provide ongoing support and follow up. As public health workers who are considered trusted members of the communities they serve, CHWs provide an essential link to health and social services (e.g., housing and legal aid, food assistance, counseling and educational programs, etc.) and support enhanced individual and community capacity by increasing health-related knowledge and self-sufficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The MSB Program seeks to both increase motivation and ability to adopt salutary behaviors by providing families with the knowledge, tools, social support, and material supplies to make positive changes, thereby addressing current gaps in knowledge about behavioral management of ECC.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>MySmileBuddy program theoretical model. This figure presents the theoretical model that is used to guide the MySmileBuddy Program intervention and analysis of causal pathways through which the intervention exerts (or fails to exert) an influence on targeted behaviors. Mediators included are drawn from MySmileBuddyâs foundation in Social Cognitive Theory and the Health Belief Model. Social Cognitive Theory is based on a wide range of motivating and facilitating determinants. This theory provides extensive guidance on translating motivation into action through its emphasis on action self-efficacy and facilitating determinants. It emphasizes that individuals and their environments mutually influence each other, and so the environment must also be addressed. Health Belief Model focuses on the motivational determinants and the benefits and barriers to taking action and self-efficacy. It is useful for audiences and settings where the emphasis is on health. The included motivational determinants bolster parentsâ motivation through increasing perceived threat of caries (both perceived susceptibility and seriousness) and promoting positive outcome expectations. Facilitating determinants are influenced by CHW efforts to increase parentsâ ability to act on their motivation by demonstrating skills, enhancing self-efficacy to perform these skills, providing access to tooth brushes and toothpaste, and action goal setting. In addition to these psychosocial theories, three broad evidence-based targets from the Science of Behavior Change (SOBC) program relevant to understanding mechanisms to predict whether participants are successful at action goal setting, are included</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12903_2021_1582_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>
              <p id="Par22">The MSB Program and App were developed with support from the National Institutes of Health (NIH; UL1TR001873, RC1MD004257), evaluated for validity of its risk components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], assessed for feasibility and acceptability when delivered to a low-income primarily Hispanic population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], and tested through a pragmatic effectiveness trial with families of 1,207 children supported by the federal Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (C1CMS331347). Needed to assess the Program is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) that tests the efficacy of the MSB Program in a high-risk minority population and advances understanding of its mechanisms of action. This report describes the protocol for such an RCT as developed and initiated with support from the NIH National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (R34DE023158, U01DE026739). This RCT was halted in March 2020 by the COVID-19 pandemic just as recruitment began. Since that time, a grant from the Cabrini Foundation of New York City has been secured to refashion the MSB Program for virtual telehealth visits. When and if resumed, this RCT will measure factors shown to influence motivation (perceived threat, ECC contextual knowledge, and positive outcome expectations) and ability to act on motivation (knowledge and skills, self-efficacy, action goal setting, and access to toothbrushes and toothpaste) to initiate and maintain positive oral health behaviors.</p>

Upon presentation, receptionists will give parents a printed statement substantiating their providerâs endorsement of the study and allowance of waiting room recruitment. Recruitment posters in both English and Spanish will be posted in waiting areas and examination rooms. Recruiters, who are bilingual community health workers (CHWs) will approach parents of young children to explain the study and invite participation. Community Health Workers will obtain informed consent for subsequent eligibility screening, collect parentâs primary and alternative contact information, schedule the screening appointment at the Columbia Community Partnership for Health (CCPH) research and community-engagement facility, and provide the parent with a pre-loaded MetroCard (value $5.50) to cover the cost, if any, of transportation to and from the CCPH. Parents will receive an appointment confirmation call or text message the day before the scheduled CCPH eligibility-screening visit.</p>
                <p id="Par30">Additionally, snowball recruitment will be employed by asking parents to solicit others with age-appropriate children for examination at the enrollment facility.

Parents of children confirmed to have ECC will be invited to participate in the study, asked to provide written informed consent, and informed that they will be randomized to a Control or Intervention Group. Parents who enroll in the study will complete an interview with a CHW, which includes administration of the pre-intervention survey instrument. Their children will receive a visual oral examination with tooth surface-specific charting of caries experience at this baseline visit (T1). Parents will confirm agreement to attend a follow up visit at 12Â months (T2) when they will again participate in a CHW interview and survey and their children will have a second study-specific dental examination and charting. Enrolled parents who meet these requirements will be given an additional $30.00 participation incentive. Randomization will be stratified by age (24-48 and 49-71 months) and recruitment site, with approximately equal numbers in each Group using a biased-coin design facilitated by computerized randomization software.

Based on observation of tooth brushing behaviors, the CHW will offer instruction that promotes skills, helps parents overcome barriers, and bolsters parental self-efficacy. The family will be provided with sufficient toothbrushes and over-the-counter fluoridated toothpaste for the entire familyâs use at T1 and replenished quarterly for 12Â months (until T2). Printed educational materials will describe the caries process, promote a low cariogenic diet (based on recommended frequency, duration, content, and timing of cariogenic foods and drink consumption), and detail elements of therapeutic tooth brushing (twice daily with appropriate amount of fluoridated toothpaste, by parents, for at least 1Â min).</p>
                <p id="Par34">At T1, Intervention Group parents will also engage with a CHW in the first round of the MSB Program. Using the MSB App, positioned to facilitate parentsâ engagement, CHWs will involve parents in a conversation that fulfills the first four components of the MSB Program:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par35">Education: on caries pathogenesis using videos and models;</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par36">Caries risk assessment: completionâin any order that feels appropriate to the conversationâof a caries risk assessment that includes considerations of feeding practices, fluoride use, family caries history, beliefs and attitudes regarding caries, and a modified 24-h dietary recall using a unique widget that derives an algorithm-driven dietary cariogenicity score;</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par37">Goal setting: parent selection of a specific tailored oral health behavioral goal related to an identified high-risk behavior; and</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par38">Action planning: development of a written action plan that specifies who in the familyâs circle will do what, with whom, where, when and how to achieve the stated goal.</p></list-item></list></p>
                <p id="Par39">The fifth Program componentâFollow up and Facilitationâwill be achieved over six months through at least three CHW-parent interactions and automated delivery of standardized study-specific text messages. Of the three interactions, at least one will be an in-home visit (or, if necessary, a virtual in-home visit) that will include a timed tooth brushing observation during which CHWs will provide additional guidance and instruction if necessary. Two additional interactions may be conducted by telephone or reciprocal text messaging. Interactions will focus on review and reinforcement of the familyâs goal and the familyâs progress toward fulfilling their self-defined action plan. Up to four additional interactions with parents may be provided by CHWs if needed to address pressing parental concerns related to food, housing, income, employment, or immigration insecurities by making referrals to appropriate community, social service, and legal aid programs. All interactions will be recorded to analyze possible impacts on study outcomes. The standardized text messages are comprised of 4 rounds of 12â13 messages each over the course of the 6-month intervention, with specific hygiene recommendations (<italic>Brush twice a day; Brush your childâs teeth; Use fluoride toothpaste; and Brush for at least one minute</italic>) and dietary/feeding recommendations (<italic>Donât buy snacks and drinks that cause cavities; Make water your go-to drink; Make eating time, time to eat; Sit to eat, and Donât snack all day</italic>) based on behavioral intervention targets. Tooth brushing video recordings, obtained at T1 and T2, will be assessed for quality and duration using the Tooth Brushing Observation System (TBOS) protocol developed by Collett, et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par40">CHWs will utilize additional MSB App features including instruction on how to conduct each Program component; a library of culturally-, linguistically-, and literacy-appropriate educational materials suitable for distribution to parents by handout, mail or text; and administrative functions for recordkeeping (case management, tracking familiesâ progress, and maintaining a log of activities) and data transmission to the studyâs Data Coordinating Center (DCC).</p>
                <p id="Par41">If the first four components of the MSB Program are not completed at T1, they will be completed at the in-home visit to be scheduled within one week of the CCHPH visit.

Rather than receiving MSB Program-specific educational materials, they will receive materials on caries prevention from the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research. Rather than receiving oral hygiene supplies for the entire family over the course of the one-year study period, they will receive oral hygiene supplies once at T1 and only for the child. At T1, parents will be reminded of their obligation to return one year later for the T2 visit at which time the childâs dentition will be again examined and a videotaped tooth brushing observation will be conducted, recommendations made, and the video subsequently analyzed using the TBOS.

The regression coefficient corresponding to the interaction term is the key parameter of interest for assessing the efficacy of the MSB Program as it represents the post- to pre-treatment ratio of the average rate of dmft/dfs between the Intervention and Control Groups. A random effect is included to account for within-subject correlation and for the possibility of heterogeneity among subjects in the ratio of expected dmft/dfs counts before and after randomization. R packages will be used to fit and carry out inference for the proposed models.</p>
                <p id="Par63">Mediation analysis will be used to test of joint significance of the two paths involving a potential mediator, which was found to achieve the best balance of Type I error and statistical power across the 14 reviewed methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Potential mediators are risk perception for ECC, self-efficacy for tooth-brushing, skills for tooth brushing, self-efficacy for eating a low cariogenic diet, skills for eating a low cariogenic diet, goal setting reflecting self-regulation processes, physical environmental support, social environmental support, knowledge, positive outcome expectations, and ability to overcome barriers to tooth brushing and adoption of a low-cariogenic diet. This allows for expected partial rather than total mediation, a variable will be declared a mediator if and only if both the test of the regression coefficient of the explanatory factor on the mediator <italic>and</italic> the test of the coefficient of the mediator on the outcome variable are both significant at level alphaâ=â0.05, two-tailed.</p>
                <p id="Par64">Missing outcome data due to subject dropout can introduce bias that results in misleading inferences since subjects may drop out for reasons related to the outcome of interest. We will use random effect logistic regression models to examine whether missing data are completely random, missing at random, or non-ignorable (38, Ch. 13). In the first two cases our proposed approach based on maximum likelihood estimation is still valid, and multiple imputation of missing outcomes is also valid, as long as the models are correctly specified. If the missingness mechanism is found to be non-ignorable we will use tipping point analysis as sensitivity analysis to assess the potential impact of missingness on our results.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par65">Over six years of preliminary research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], an NIDCR-funded planning grant (R34DE023158), and refinement in collaboration with NIDCR (U01DE026739), protocols were developed to minimize recognized large RCT challenges in participant recruitment, enrollment, and retention. Reaching the studyâs targeted enrollment is achievable at a pace of 8â9 dyads enrolled weekly over 24Â months given that more than 800 age-eligible children visit the recruitment sites each month, at least half of 4â5Â year olds and one-quarter of 2â3Â year olds in the target population experience ECC, and a preliminary study of 108 families found a 95.6% acceptance rate without financial incentive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. While the preliminary study involved only one recruiter 2.5Â days/week for five months, this study will engage three CHW recruiters and three support staff five days each week for 24Â months and will provide financial incentives. Recruitment and enrollment rates will be monitored weekly and additional resources invested as necessary.</p>
              <p id="Par66">This study encourages retention through financial incentives, user-friendly technology, rapport between CHWs and parents, assistance to families to address social service needs, and an approach that is non-judgmental and encouraging. Initial and semiannual CHW training will help ensure that study protocols are well understood and that appropriate communications and referral skills are established. Adherence to study protocols will be monitored for fidelity by a CHW supervisor and the Study Team through recurrent retraining and bi-weekly meetings that identify and address problems as they arise and weekly review of CHW logs and DCC data for timeliness, completeness, and accuracy (e.g., reported data that are within allowable limits). Corrective action plans will be developed and implemented as needed.</p>
              <p id="Par67">The primary assessment of intervention effects will use an intention-to-treat approach. Implementation data will allow testing of doseâresponse effects if some subjects do not complete all intervention activities thereby enabling assessment of potential moderating effects attributable to delivery of varying levels of intervention intensity.</p>
              <p id="Par68">Through these efforts, the study team seeks to maximize its ability to meet the studyâs <italic>Impact</italic>, <italic>Translational</italic>, and <italic>Exploratory</italic> objectives and build understanding of oral health behavior change that holds promise to improve individual childrenâs oral health and the oral health of socially disadvantaged populations.</p>
