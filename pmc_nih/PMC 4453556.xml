                <title>ABSTRACT</title>
                <p>A mechanistic understanding of the purported health benefits conferred by consumption of probiotic bacteria has been limited by our knowledge of the resident gut microbiota and its interaction with the host. Here, we detail the impact of a single-organism probiotic, <named-content content-type="genus-species">Lactobacillus rhamnosus</named-content> GG ATCC 53103 (LGG), on the structure and functional dynamics (gene expression) of the gut microbiota in a study of 12 healthy individuals, 65 to 80 years old. The analysis revealed that while the overall community composition was stable as assessed by 16S rRNA profiling, the transcriptional response of the gut microbiota was modulated by probiotic treatment. Comparison of transcriptional profiles based on taxonomic composition yielded three distinct transcriptome groups that displayed considerable differences in functional dynamics. The transcriptional profile of LGG <italic>in vivo</italic> was remarkably concordant across study subjects despite the considerable interindividual nature of the gut microbiota. However, we identified genes involved in flagellar motility, chemotaxis, and adhesion from <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> and the dominant butyrate producers <named-content content-type="genus-species">Roseburia</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species">Eubacterium</named-content> whose expression was increased during probiotic consumption, suggesting that LGG may promote interactions between key constituents of the microbiota and the host epithelium. These results provide evidence for the discrete functional effects imparted by a specific single-organism probiotic and challenge the prevailing notion that probiotics substantially modify the resident microbiota within nondiseased individuals in an appreciable fashion.</p>

                <p>Probiotic bacteria have been used for over a century to promote digestive health. Many individuals report that probiotics alleviate a number of digestive issues, yet little evidence links how probiotic microbes influence human health. Here, we show how the resident microbes that inhabit the healthy human gut respond to a probiotic. The well-studied probiotic <named-content content-type="genus-species">Lactobacillus rhamnosus</named-content> GG ATCC 53103 (LGG) was administered in a clinical trial, and a suite of measurements of the resident microbes were taken to evaluate potential changes over the course of probiotic consumption. We found that LGG transiently enriches for functions to potentially promote anti-inflammatory pathways in the resident microbes.</p>

              <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
              <p>The consumption of probiotic bacteria has been heralded as a means to promote digestive health, alleviate a range of deleterious conditions, including atopic dermatitis and gastroenterological diseases, and reverse dysbiotic microbiota to restore gut mucosal homeostasis (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">–</xref><xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic> studies to delineate the molecular mechanisms of probiotic species have indicated modulatory capabilities for strain-specific and molecule-specific benefits to the host, which include shifts in anti-inflammatory cytokine profiles and stabilization of epithelial tight junctions (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Well-characterized effector molecules produced by probiotic organisms include cell surface proteins, lipoteichoic acid, peptidoglycan-derived muropeptides, exopolysaccharides, and pilus-type structures (reviewed in reference <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). However, extrapolation of these mode-of-action studies to <italic>in vivo</italic> behavior is complicated by a multitude of factors, largely by the complex, reciprocal interaction of the host with the resident microbiota along the gastrointestinal tract. The majority of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) to evaluate the <italic>in vivo</italic> health benefits of probiotic species have focused on a variety of clinical indicators from the human host; to date, few studies have focused on the impact of probiotic consumption on the resident gastrointestinal microbiota on a community-wide scale (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). There is great need to systematically study the effects of probiotic bacteria on the autochthonous microbial community in the human gut to further elucidate how these organisms confer beneficial outcomes to the host and substantiate commercial health claims.</p>
              <p>The most comprehensively studied probiotic strain, <named-content content-type="genus-species">Lactobacillus rhamnosus</named-content> GG ATCC 53103 (LGG), has been shown to have clinical benefits from a variety of cohort studies and is thought to act by (i) competitive colonization advantage through the use of mucus-binding pili, (ii) putative bacteriocin activity identified via bacteriocin-like genomic architecture, and (iii) soluble effector signaling proteins that elicit anti-inflammatory cytokines and activate mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Despite the strong biofilm-forming capacity <italic>in vitro</italic>, LGG colonization <italic>in vivo</italic> is restricted to discrete ecological niches along the human gastrointestinal tract with limited biofilm formation (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Recently, the application of a phylogenetic microarray (HITChip) to survey the composition and structure of the fecal community within a healthy adult Finnish cohort revealed no significant difference related to LGG consumption (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p>
              <p>A major challenge to assess the impact of probiotics on the resident gut consortia is the ability to measure both compositional and functional components on a community-wide scale. Techniques and sequencing technologies to enable sampling of the active microbial fraction have recently become available (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), yet robust bioinformatics and statistical methodologies have yet to be formally implemented for mixed-community RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data sets. Using a novel pipeline for analysis of metatranscriptomic data, we characterized the structure and functional dynamics (gene expression) of the gut microbiota associated with consumption of the single-organism probiotic <named-content content-type="genus-species">Lactobacillus rhamnosus</named-content> GG ATCC 53103 (LGG), from a study of 12 healthy elderly individuals. The gut microbiota of elderly people provides a unique system to study the fitness landscape of the presumptive healthy, aging microbiota and assess the community stability and dynamics. We found that community composition was not modified due to probiotic intake; however, community-wide transcriptional changes were evident.</p>

                <p>To investigate whether consumption of the probiotic <named-content content-type="genus-species">Lactobacillus rhamnosus</named-content> GG ATCC 53103 (LGG) would exert an influence on the composition and structure of the gut microbiota, we carried out a longitudinal 16S rRNA, metagenomic, and metatranscriptomic analysis of fecal samples obtained from 12 elderly subjects (65 to 80 years old) enrolled in an open-label clinical trial (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). The healthy volunteers included seven females and five males, all of white, non-Hispanic origin, residing in private residences in the greater Boston metropolitan area (further clinical information and demographics can be found in reference <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Fecal samples were collected prior to probiotic consumption (day 0; baseline), on day 28 after consuming 10<sup>10</sup> CFU of LGG twice daily for 28 days, and on day 56, 1 month after stopping LGG consumption. We generated 295,442 high-quality sequence reads from bacterial 16S rRNA gene V1-V2 amplicons, with an average (±standard deviation) of 8,207 (±1,434) reads per fecal sample (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS1">Table S1</xref> in the supplemental material). Consistent with previous studies of the gut microbiota of elderly people (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">–</xref><xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), we observed marked interindividual variability, with longitudinal samples collected from the same individual displaying high bacterial community similarity irrespective of probiotic consumption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS1">Fig. S1</xref> in the supplemental material). No statistically significant differences associated with LGG consumption were found at any phylogenetic level of resolution, as determined by analysis of variance (ANOVA). Moreover, we examined the effect of LGG consumption and medication status on community diversity using a linear mixed-effects model and found that ciprofloxacin was the only measured variable that significantly explained the observed variation (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS1">Table S1</xref>).</p>

                <p>In addition to 16S rRNA profiling, we also carried out a metagenomic analysis using whole-genome sequencing to assess the gene content of the gut microbiota at all time points for a subset of three subjects. The three subjects were selected based on the 16S rRNA profiles, representing a range of community composition and diversity. Over 1.1 billion sequence reads were generated for three subjects across all time points, with an average of 124.1 million (±13.3 million) reads per fecal sample (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS2">Table S2</xref> in the supplemental material). A robust metagenomic assembly procedure was implemented and yielded an average of 351,662 contigs per sample, with an average N50 of 2,856 (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS2">Table S2</xref>; see Materials and Methods). A comparison of the recovered genomes for each of the three individuals revealed strain-resolved patterns of relative abundance (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS2">Table S2</xref>). For example, the relative proportion of <named-content content-type="genus-species">Bacteroides</named-content> strains was highly specific across the three sampled individuals and lends support that individuals can be differentiated based on unique strain-resolved gut communities (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).</p>
                <p>We reconstructed the probiotic LGG genome at an estimated 62% average genome coverage on day 28, despite an average relative sequence abundance of only 0.4% across the three individuals sampled (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS2">Table S2</xref>). The reconstruction of the LGG genome enabled evaluation and verification that many of the functional properties associated with probiotic efficacy were present in LGG. For example, from the annotation of 730, 1,874, and 1,925 LGG-specific genes for subjects 408, 419, and 428, respectively, we were able to positively identify the ABC transporter/permease components required for antimicrobial peptide type IIb bacteriocin synthesis in all three metagenomes and the bacteriocin immunity proteins in subjects 419 and 428 (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Further, we identified the unique mucus-binding pili gene cluster <italic>spaCBA-srtC1</italic> from subjects 419 and 428, indicating that the LGG probiotic administered possessed the capacity to adhere to the host epithelial mucosa (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).</p>

                <title>Community-wide gene expression captures community transcriptome groups.</title>
                <p>We next used whole-community RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) for all subjects in the study and first sought to evaluate whether the abundance of taxa identified by 16S rRNA profiling correlated with specific patterns of gene expression. In sum, over 4.6 billion sequence reads were generated, with an average of 129.7 million (±26.4 million) reads per fecal sample (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS3">Table S3</xref> in the supplemental material). Importantly, we utilized a robust total RNA extraction method to obtain high-quality intact RNA (RNA integrity number [RIN] averaging 8.5) and an efficient ribosomal depletion protocol that yielded an average 7.3% rRNA out of the total sequenced data set (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS3">Table S3</xref>). This represents a high-quality data set to more fully evaluate the functional gene expression within a mixed community from mRNA. Previously reported metatranscriptomics data sets have consisted of greater than 50%, and even in excess of 90%, of ribosomal sequences compared to functional transcripts from fecal and other environments (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Further, we developed a robust bioinformatics pipeline to exhaustively search reference bacterial, archaeal, viral, and microeukaryotic genomes to classify individual reads as comprehensively as possible and to post-process these data to provide estimates of relative abundance across microbial genera (see Materials and Methods; see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS2">Fig. S2</xref> in the supplemental material). We compared the relative taxonomic abundance predictions between the two data sets and found that the abundance of many prevalent bacterial genera, including <named-content content-type="genus-species">Bacteroides</named-content>, <named-content content-type="genus-species">Eubacterium</named-content>, <named-content content-type="genus-species">Faecalibacterium</named-content>, and <named-content content-type="genus-species">Streptococcus</named-content>, as determined by 16S rRNA profiling, correlated with their respective transcriptional signals (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS4">Table S4</xref> in the supplemental material). However, for other genera, most notably <named-content content-type="genus-species">Ruminococcus</named-content>, there was no significant correlation between data sets. This finding is perhaps not surprising given that 16S rRNA signatures provide a broad view of all bacteria present in the gut microbiota, although with known caveats, such as PCR amplification biases, whereas metatranscriptomics data provide a snapshot of the expressed genes.</p>
                <p>We found that the archaeal transcripts, which were not identified using bacterial-specific 16S rRNA sequencing, contributed to clustering of the samples into three groups, designated transcriptome groups, which displayed distinct patterns of gene expression and transcript diversity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS3">Fig. S3</xref> in the supplemental material). Highly expressed archaeal transcripts from the methanogens, <named-content content-type="genus-species">Methanobrevibacter</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species">Methanosphaera</named-content>, were identified in a subset of individuals (24% average abundance) and, when present, were relatively stable over time (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS2">Fig. S2</xref> in the supplemental material). Each transcriptome group displayed a unique transcript abundance profile from the <italic>Firmicutes</italic> phylum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2B</xref>), with the greatest firmicute diversity found within transcriptome group 1. In contrast, within transcriptome group 3, the majority of transcripts were derived from <named-content content-type="genus-species">Ruminococcus</named-content> spp. that significantly differentiated this group from the other two transcriptome groups (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS5">Table S5</xref> in the supplemental material). The transcriptome groups also differed significantly in overall community diversity, as measured by the Shannon diversity index, which is influenced by both the species richness and their relative proportions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2B</xref>). Transcriptome group 1, which was not dominated by any single taxon, displayed the highest diversity compared with transcriptome groups 2 and 3, which had similar community-wide diversity scores.</p>

                <title>Global and genus-level differential gene expression associated with community transcriptome groups.</title>
                <p>The global gene transcriptional response across the three transcriptome groups was investigated using a robust differential expression analysis applied for mixed-community RNA-seq data. A total of 3,514 unique KEGG orthologs were identified, the majority of which were conserved across the three transcriptome groups. The largest number of unique KEGG orthologs (654) was found within transcriptome group 2, and these largely represented transcripts derived from the methanogenic archaea. <named-content content-type="genus-species">Methanobrevibacter</named-content>-associated KEGG pathways involved in methane (map00680) and nitrogen metabolism (map00910) were found at significantly greater (&gt;10-fold) levels within transcriptome group 2 than within the other transcriptome groups. The methanogens within group 2 were also involved in porphyrin/chlorophyll metabolism (map00860), riboflavin metabolism (map00740), glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism (map00260), pyruvate-ferredoxin oxidoreductase (M00310), lysine biosynthesis (map00300), DNA mismatch repair (map03430), homologous recombination (map03440), and synthesis/degradation of ketone bodies (map00730) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS6">Table S6</xref> in the supplemental material).</p>
                <p>Approximately 55% of the transcripts within transcriptome group 3 were derived from <named-content content-type="genus-species">Ruminococcus</named-content> spp., and differential expression analysis revealed that several <named-content content-type="genus-species">Ruminococcus</named-content>-derived pathways and modules involved in transport and carbohydrate metabolism were highly abundant in this transcriptome group. For example, systems for maltose/maltodextrin transport (M00194), putrescine transport (M00300), and cell division transport (M00256) and pathways for fructose/mannose (etae0051) metabolism from <named-content content-type="genus-species">Ruminococcus</named-content> spp. were highly represented.</p>
                <p>As described previously, transcriptome group 1 displayed the greatest level of taxonomic diversity across transcripts, and this was reflected in part in the functional profile. For example, transcripts from several phylogenetic lineages encoding transport systems with specificity for a range of substrates, including maltose/maltodextrin (M00194), putrescine (M00300), and multiple sugars (M00207), as well as enzymes involved in glycolysis (e.g., glucose-6-phosphate isomerase [K01810]) and amino acid metabolism (e.g., aspartate aminotransferase [K00812]), were represented.</p>
                <p>While global comparisons enable a top-down approach to identify universal differences across all samples, taxonomically partitioned differential expression analyses provide specific insight into discrete differences among the three transcriptome groups. Therefore, we complemented our global differential expression analysis with genus-level differential expression analyses using a novel pan-genome and orthologous group clustering method (see Materials and Methods; see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS6">Table S6</xref>). The equivalent functional differences identified across transcriptome groups globally were largely reflected, as expected, in the genus-level differential expression results. For example, comparison of transcriptome groups 1 and 3 yielded enrichment in functions associated with <italic>Firmicutes</italic> members <named-content content-type="genus-species">Clostridium</named-content> (122 KEGG orthologs), and <named-content content-type="genus-species">Roseburia</named-content> (34 KEGG orthologs) for group 1, while group 3 was highly enriched in <named-content content-type="genus-species">Ruminococcus</named-content> functions (365 KEGG orthologs) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS6">Table S6</xref>).</p>

                <p>Despite considerable differences in functional dynamics across the three transcriptome groups, global and genus-level alterations associated with the administration of LGG were readily identified. Across all samples, we identified 16 differentially expressed KEGG orthologs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS6">Table S6</xref> in the supplemental material). Half of these globally differentially expressed KEGG orthologs (8/16) were derived from <named-content content-type="genus-species">Lactobacillus</named-content> on day 28 and included functional categories for central glycolytic gene regulation (K05311), 2-oxoisovalerate dehydrogenase components (K00166 and K00167), ribonucleotide reductase (K00524), S1 RNA binding domain protein (K07571), arsenite-transporting ATPase (K01552), UPF0148 protein (K07145), and pyruvate oxidase (K00158). Interestingly, three KEGG orthologs involved in bacterial flagellar motility were differentially expressed on day 28 and were contributed predominantly by <named-content content-type="genus-species">Roseburia</named-content>, with minor contributions by <named-content content-type="genus-species">Eubacterium</named-content> (K02407, flagellar hook associated protein 2; K02397, flagellar hook-associated protein 3 FlgL; and K02396, flagellar hook-associated protein 1 FlgK) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS6">Table S6</xref>). Previous studies have suggested that motility of <named-content content-type="genus-species">Roseburia</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species">Eubacterium</named-content> species may allow them to actively penetrate the gastrointestinal mucosa, leading to higher bioavailability of butyrate for the host and eliciting proinflammatory responses in the host with immunostimulatory potential (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>).</p>

In sum, 333 KEGG orthologs were differential at baseline compared to on day 28 (238 upregulated on day 28), and an almost equivalent 342 KEGG orthologs were differential on day 28 compared to on day 56 (232 upregulated on day 28). Functions that were differential at baseline were identified for <named-content content-type="genus-species">Collinsella</named-content> (3 KEGG orthologs), <named-content content-type="genus-species">Streptococcus</named-content> (12 orthologs), and <named-content content-type="genus-species">Roseburia</named-content> (31 orthologs), while all <named-content content-type="genus-species">Faecalibacterium</named-content> KEGG orthologs (9) were upregulated on day 28. We identified pilus assembly proteins upregulated on day 28 within <named-content content-type="genus-species">Bifidobacterium</named-content> (K02653) and <named-content content-type="genus-species">Ruminococcus</named-content> (K02283), which might indicate adhesion of certain members of the resident microbiota to the host epithelium induced by the probiotic LGG.

                <p>Analysis of <named-content content-type="genus-species">Lactobacillus</named-content>-specific expression also revealed more than 200 KEGG orthologs that were differentially expressed on day 28, with many related to carbohydrate uptake (e.g., ABC transporters, PTS system) and utilization (e.g., beta-glucosidase, beta-<italic>N</italic>-acetyl-hexosaminidase, and secondary metabolism [pyruvate oxidase, 2-oxoisovalerate dehydrogenase E1 component]) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS6">Table S6</xref>). Of the differential <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> modules and pathways, the probiotic LGG exclusively contributed to the differentially expressed pathway for the biosynthesis of ketone bodies (map00072).

                <p>We lastly evaluated differential expression across the transcriptome groups following probiotic administration and found significant differences in differentially expressed KEGG orthologs in each of the three transcriptome groups. A total of 74 global differentially expressed KEGG orthologs and 250 genus-level differentially expressed KEGG orthologs were identified between baseline and day 28 in transcriptome group 1, and the majority of the KEGG orthologs (168/252) were upregulated on day 28 (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS6">Table S6</xref> in the supplemental material). Most of the KEGG orthologs on day 28 were derived from <named-content content-type="genus-species">Lactobacillus</named-content> (144), with the remainder from a limited number of bacterial genera, including <named-content content-type="genus-species">Bacteroides</named-content>, <named-content content-type="genus-species">Eubacterium</named-content>, <named-content content-type="genus-species">Faecalibacterium</named-content>, <named-content content-type="genus-species">Roseburia</named-content>, <named-content content-type="genus-species">Ruminococcus</named-content>, and <named-content content-type="genus-species">Streptococcus</named-content> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS6">Table S6</xref>).

In comparisons between baseline and day 56, there were no significant differences in the levels of relative expression of the motility genes, indicating that the modulation of gene expression associated with administration of LGG was transient.</p>

                <p>Lastly, to evaluate the <italic>in vivo</italic> behavior of the probiotic LGG, we examined the transcriptional response specific to LGG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>). As expected, transcript coverage of the LGG genome was restricted to the period of probiotic consumption (a total 4,272,346 reads across the entire data set mapped specifically to LGG) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS7">Table S7</xref> in the supplemental material). We observed a distinct gradient of transcript coverage of the LGG genome and relative abundance of LGG transcripts across the samples, from a high of 71% genome coverage, representing 1.9% of the total transcripts in subject 421 on day 28, to a low of 0.74% coverage in subject 406 (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS7">Table S7</xref>). Furthermore, there was a significantly high level of concordance of LGG expression globally (Kendall's coefficient of concordance, <italic>W</italic> = 0.71), and even greater concordance for transcriptome groups 1 (<italic>W</italic> = 0.84) and 2 (<italic>W</italic> = 0.91), despite consistent dosage of LGG administered for each subject (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS7">Table S7</xref>). Given the significant concordance across transcriptome groups, we tested whether overall community diversity or the abundance of certain resident microbial taxa contributed to specific patterns of LGG expression. We found no significant correlations for LGG expression related to overall community diversity, transcriptome groups, or specific resident microbial taxa (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS7">Table S7</xref>). The reasons for the subject-specific differences in gene expression are not known. It is possible that the differential abundance of LGG transcripts in the day 28 samples reflects a difference in the absolute amount of LGG present in the stool. We found a strong positive correlation between LGG genome recovery and transcript abundance, suggesting that the relative amount of LGG present in the gut might play a strong role in transcriptional activity (<italic>r</italic> = 0.73, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0074). Another intriguing hypothesis is that the commensal gut microbiota may differentially direct LGG transcriptional responses across individuals.</p>

                <p>Across the LGG genome, we found the greatest absolute expression levels associated with small noncoding RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>). Of the five intergenic regions with greatest transcript coverage, four were previously identified within the Rfam database (bacterial RNase P, RF00010; 6S/SsrS, RF00013; and transfer mRNA, RF00023), although they are not currently annotated within the LGG genome (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). One intergenic region represented a putatively novel sRNA, with transcripts partially overlapping a small 53-amino-acid putative hypothetical protein (LRHM_2096, NCBI gene identifier [ID] 12475226). Downstream of this region is a putative protein (LRHM_2095, NCBI gene ID 12475225) containing a GyrI-like small-molecule binding domain (pfam06445) found in numerous bacterial transcriptional activators that regulate genes involved in resistance to antibiotics, organic solvents, and heavy metals (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). We found little evidence for high transcriptional expression of the many characterized host-associated genes, such as the intestinal adhesins or secreted protein effectors, despite metagenomic evidence for the presence of these genes described previously. A likely explanation could be that transcription of these gene sets is temporally restricted during LGG interaction with the intestinal epithelium and is not captured from sampling of the fecal transcriptional pool.</p>

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>It has been widely proposed that probiotics harbor the potential to reverse dysbiosis in the resident microbial consortia of the human gastrointestinal tract, thereby restoring gut mucosal homeostasis (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). However, direct evidence demonstrating a system-wide restoration of a dysbiotic microbial ecosystem has proven elusive. Few studies have measured the global microbial community composition and structure within an adult human clinical study to evaluate the effects of probiotic administration, with only a single study evaluating the transcriptional response (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). The results of those studies have demonstrated that the composition of the resident bacterial community in adults remains largely unchanged following probiotic administration (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p>
              <p>Heightened interest in the human microbiome and its relation to human health has led to the hypothesis that administration of a probiotic organism could modulate the resident microbial ecology. There is growing support for taking a system-level approach, or “adaptive management,” to maintain the microbial ecosystems across our body to promote health (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). However, much has yet to be learned about our resident commensal microbes, particularly the mechanisms governing ecological community assembly rules (e.g., deterministic factors, historical contingencies, and stochastic factors) if we are to effectively implement probiotic treatment to elicit a beneficial and long-lasting modification to a given health state. In this study, we provide robust analytical techniques to evaluate, in detail, the effects of a single-organism probiotic on the gut microbiota of elderly people. Through the use of bacterial community profiling using 16S rRNA pyrosequencing, whole-community expression profiling using RNA-seq, and metagenomic sequencing, we investigated the role that probiotics may play on the structure and function of the resident microbiota.</p>
              <p>No statistically significant differences associated with LGG consumption were identified from the 16S rRNA analysis, which is consistent with recent studies evaluating the fecal microbiota before and after LGG intervention from an adult Finish cohort (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) and seven adult female monozygotic twin pairs (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Given the depth of 16S rRNA sequence coverage in our study, there is a possibility that rarer organisms in the community might be impacted by LGG consumption. Our findings indicate that the dominant microbial taxa are not modified by probiotic consumption, yet additional deep sequencing of the community is needed to resolve whether rare members are impacted.</p>
              <p>Our inclusion of reference genomes for viruses and human-associated microeukaryotes enabled us to taxonomically identify a subset of transcripts affiliated with these additional microbial components of the community, capturing the community-wide taxonomic profile. While fungal transcripts were not well represented within the community (on average, 0.00018%), highly represented transcripts mapping to the plant-pathogenic single-stranded RNA viruses <italic>Pepper mild mottle virus</italic> (PMMoV) and <italic>Tomato mosaic virus</italic> (ToMV) were identified, consistent with previous findings (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), suggesting that a signature for the consumption of virus-infected produce might be readily captured from microbial RNA-seq studies. Further, we found distinct dynamics from the viral and fungal fraction that did not follow the intraspecific clustering patterns observed for the bacterial and archaeal expression profiles. The uncoupled dynamics observed in the viral and fungal fractions could perhaps reflect strong dietary influences compared to host-specific influences.</p>
              <p>Comparison of transcriptional profiles relative to taxonomic composition yielded three distinct transcriptome groups that displayed differences in functional dynamics. The transcriptome groups were differentiated both by unique transcript taxonomic composition and distinctive functional properties and also differed significantly in overall community diversity, as measured by the Shannon diversity index. Transcriptome group 2 was characterized by highly abundant transcripts from the dominant archaeon, <named-content content-type="genus-species">Methanobrevibacter</named-content>, which lends further support for the importance of this microbe in a subset of individuals and underscores the need to complement 16S rRNA surveys that use bacterial-specific primer sets to fully capture the extant microbial community.</p>
              <p>While differentially expressed functions across the three identified transcriptome groups were more pronounced than differences during probiotic consumption, we nevertheless identified a suite of global and genus-level KEGG orthologs that were differentially expressed during consumption of LGG. We found evidence for differential expression of genes involved in adhesion and a large number of genes involved in bacterial motility during probiotic consumption that were predominantly associated with <named-content content-type="genus-species">Roseburia</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species">Eubacterium</named-content> motile gut species. These commensal gut bacteria are notable as producers of the short-chain fatty acid butyrate, which is the preferred nutrient for human colonocytes, has anti-inflammatory properties, and decreases epithelial permeability. Previous studies have suggested that motility of <named-content content-type="genus-species">Roseburia</named-content> species is an important factor in colonization of the gastrointestinal mucosa, and the presence of flagella may allow them to actively penetrate into the mucus layer, which in turn may lead to higher bioavailability of butyrate for the host (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). It has recently been reported that increased levels of butyrate following administration of the probiotic VSL#3 stimulated the release of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) from intestinal L cells in a mouse model of obesity, resulting in reduced food intake and improved glucose tolerance (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>).</p>
              <p>Furthermore, we were able to directly evaluate the <italic>in vivo</italic> behavior of LGG and found that the transcript coverage of the LGG genome was restricted to the period of probiotic consumption, a finding that lends support for the transient properties of this probiotic. Despite minimal genomic and absolute transcript abundances of LGG relative to the resident microbiota, we were able to reconstruct, on average, 62% of the genome from the metagenomic data and 34% from the transcriptomic data. We observed noteworthy concordance across study subjects, particularly within transcriptome groups, despite considerable interindividual resident microbiota profiles. These findings are intriguing and might suggest that the commensal gut microbiota may play a role in differentially directing LGG expression patterns across individuals. Further studies to more fully investigate this hypothesis are clearly warranted, as well as further exploration to delineate the functional contribution of the resident microbiota to the metabolic capacity of the host. Taken together, our results provide evidence for discrete, transient functional effects imparted by a specific single-organism probiotic and challenge the prevailing notion that probiotics substantially modify the resident microbiota within nondiseased individuals in an appreciable fashion.</p>

                <p>Mapped reads were totaled using htseq-count (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>) for orthologous gene clusters and KEGG orthologs. Copy number normalization for paralog/ortholog groups was informed by per-sample expression abundance, and pseudolength calculation for the KEGG ortholog group was performed by abundance-weighing the lengths of the most highly expressed genes. Each gene’s length was multiplied by its raw read count; these counts were then summed and divided by the total number of reads aligning to the most-expressed genes. The abundance-weighted, pseudolength-normalized KEGG ortholog counts were then summed to produce aggregated count estimates for KEGG modules and KEGG pathways globally and for each genus.</p>
                <p>To examine both global and genus-level differential expression patterns, we utilized the extensive statistical methodologies developed specifically for RNA-seq data within the software package edgeR (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). The trimmed mean of M values (TMM) was utilized to estimate appropriate scaling factors for normalization among samples with the inherent assumption that the majority of counts are not differentially expressed (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). We used generalized linear model (glm) methods in order to account for technical variation characteristic of RNA-seq data, as well as to factor in the complexity of a mixed microbial community data set derived from multiple individuals over three separate sampling times (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). Within this framework, the Cox-Reid profile-adjusted likelihood (CR) method was implemented to estimate dispersions and model the biological coefficient of variation (BCV) across samples. Transcriptome group designations were calculated based on complete-linkage hierarchical clustering of the Pearson correlation coefficients (PCC) for the species-level transcript abundances (LGG transcripts were removed prior to calculation). Transcriptome group membership was validated by three separate algorithms, the average silhouette index (SI), prediction strength, and the Caliński-Harabasz (CH) statistic (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS3">Fig. S3</xref> in the supplemental material).</p>
                <p>A suite of independent differential expression calculations were performed using the negative binomial model with an adjusted <italic>P</italic> value of &lt;0.05 (Benjamini and Hochberg multiple-testing correction) between all pairs of transcriptome groups, the study time points, and across the study time points for each transcriptome group for the global KEGG orthologs, global KEGG modules and pathways, and genus-level KEGG orthologs, modules, and pathways.</p>
