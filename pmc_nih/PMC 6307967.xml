              <abstract>
                <p><bold>BACKGROUND.</bold> Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous smoking-related disease characterized by airway obstruction and inflammation. This inflammation may persist even after smoking cessation and responds variably to corticosteroids. Personalizing treatment to biologically similar “molecular phenotypes” may improve therapeutic efficacy in COPD. IL-17A is involved in neutrophilic inflammation and corticosteroid resistance, and thus may be particularly important in a COPD molecular phenotype.</p>
                <p><bold>METHODS.</bold> We generated a gene expression signature of IL-17A response in bronchial airway epithelial brushings from smokers with and without COPD (<italic><italic>n</italic></italic> = 238), and validated it using data from 2 randomized trials of IL-17 blockade in psoriasis. This IL-17 signature was related to clinical and pathologic characteristics in 2 additional human studies of COPD: (a) SPIROMICS (<italic><italic>n</italic></italic> = 47), which included former and current smokers with COPD, and (b) GLUCOLD (<italic><italic>n</italic></italic> = 79), in which COPD participants were randomized to placebo or corticosteroids.</p>
                <p><bold>RESULTS.</bold> The IL-17 signature was associated with an inflammatory profile characteristic of an IL-17 response, including increased airway neutrophils and macrophages. In SPIROMICS the signature was associated with increased airway obstruction and functional small airways disease on quantitative chest CT. In GLUCOLD the signature was associated with decreased response to corticosteroids, irrespective of airway eosinophilic or type 2 inflammation.</p>
                <p><bold>CONCLUSION.</bold> These data suggest that a gene signature of IL-17 airway epithelial response distinguishes a biologically, radiographically, and clinically distinct COPD subgroup that may benefit from personalized therapy.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Personalizing treatment to “molecular phenotypes,” i.e., to subsets of patients with shared underlying biology, is an emerging strategy to guide therapeutic choices in chronic disease (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). In respiratory disease, this strategy has particularly gained traction in severe asthma, where subgroups of patients with type 2 and eosinophilic inflammation can be targeted using new biologics (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Much of the inflammation in chronic respiratory disorders, however, does not respond to therapies directed against type 2 inflammation. Identifying subgroups that display enhanced non–type 2 inflammatory pathways may lead to the repurposing of available biologics indicated for other inflammatory disorders to target these subgroups.</p>
              <p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a highly prevalent respiratory disease, most commonly associated with smoking. COPD is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide for which few interventions have been found that prevent disease progression (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Yet molecular phenotyping has been less studied in COPD than in asthma and has focused on eosinophilic and type 2 inflammation based on the previous work in asthma (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Type 2 inflammation is likely relevant in only a minority of COPD patients (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Nonetheless, this work suggests that biologically distinct COPD subgroups exist and are clinically relevant. COPD patients with high eosinophil counts or an airway epithelial genomic signature of type 2 inflammation are more likely to respond to corticosteroids, and potentially to biologics targeting eosinophils (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). These studies suggest the promise of molecular phenotyping in COPD, but responses beyond type 2 inflammation require further investigation.</p>
              <p>The IL-17 family of cytokines includes 6 members that play various roles in mucosal host defense and chronic inflammation (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). IL-17A stimulates the airway epithelium to produce chemokines and other mediators, which recruit and activate neutrophils and macrophages, cells crucial to COPD pathogenesis (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). IL-17A is implicated in COPD-associated pathogenic responses, including emphysema, lymphoid neogenesis, corticosteroid resistance, dysbiosis, mucus hypersecretion, and ongoing inflammation despite smoking cessation (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>–<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). However, many of these responses have not been investigated in human studies. By identifying the COPD subgroup that manifests IL-17A–associated inflammation (IL-17A is hereafter referred to as IL-17), we hypothesize that we can distinguish a corticosteroid-unresponsive subgroup that may benefit from anti–IL-17 biologics. Anti–IL-17 biologics are now approved for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, specifically psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, and are being studied in COPD (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Nontargeted trials of biologic therapies in COPD have failed to meet clinical endpoints, suggesting the importance of directing therapy to appropriate subgroups (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>).</p>
              <p>Here we studied the transcriptional response of the airway epithelium to IL-17. We have found that direct measurement of interleukin proteins, including IL-17, can be difficult in human blood and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). These challenges may contribute to the inconsistent evidence for IL-17 protein levels being increased in COPD (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>–<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Conversely, airway epithelial cells have reproducible transcriptional responses to many interleukins. Thus our general strategy has been to assay this epithelial response, which we have validated for IL-13 (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>) and interferons (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>).</p>
              <p>We examined a genomic signature of the airway epithelial IL-17 response in 3 separate human COPD studies in which bronchial airway samples were collected during bronchoscopy. We first fit the IL-17 genomic signature, generated using bronchial epithelial cells exposed to IL-17, to a cross-sectional study of ever-smokers with and without COPD (bronchial airway epithelial [BAE] data set, <italic>n</italic> = 237). We next established that the signature specifically identified IL-17–associated inflammation by determining its response to other airway epithelial adaptive immune responses (types 1 and 2) and to IL-17–directed biologic therapies in psoriatic skin lesions. We then tested the associations between this IL-17 signature and clinical features in 2 independent COPD studies that collected rich phenotypic data (GLUCOLD, <italic>n</italic> = 79, and SPIROMICS, <italic>n</italic> = 47; study design in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). We hypothesized that our airway epithelial IL-17 genomic signature would be increased in a COPD subset, and associated with distinct clinical, pathologic, and radiographic characteristics.</p>

                <title>Generation of an airway epithelial IL-17–associated gene expression signature in COPD.</title>
                <p>We first characterized the airway epithelial response to IL-17 using whole transcriptome profiling of IL-17–stimulated versus matched unstimulated control human bronchial epithelial cell (HBEC) cultures grown at air-liquid interface (ALI). The 100 genes most upregulated by log<sub>2</sub> fold change in response to IL-17 were studied as candidate IL-17 signature genes.</p>
                <p>We examined these 100 genes in a previously generated BAE transcriptome profiling data set derived from bronchoscopic brushing samples from ever-smokers with (<italic>n</italic> = 85) and without COPD (<italic>n</italic> = 152; BAE data set; demographics in <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Candidate IL-17 signature genes were enriched among smokers with COPD compared with those without (mean of the zero-centered log<sub>2</sub> gene expression in those with COPD = 0.11 ± 0.27 vs. without = –0.60 ± 0.19, <italic>P</italic> = 6.10 × 10<sup>–6</sup>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd">Supplemental Figure 1</xref>; supplemental material available online with this article; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI121087DS1">https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI121087DS1</ext-link>).</p>
                <p>Next, we generated a genomic signature of the IL-17 response specific to in vivo brushing samples from smokers by restricting the 100-gene signature identified in the culture model to those tightly correlated in the BAE data set using an elastic net (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). We took this additional step because cell culture models cannot optimally reproduce the complexity of the in vivo environment in which multiple mechanistic pathways impact gene expression, often with disparate effect. This signature refinement process is based on the premise that highly intercorrelated genes are coregulated by the same molecular processes, a premise also used by pathway analysis tools such as weighted gene coexpression analysis (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Starting with the 100 candidate genes as predictors, elastic net regression with leave-one-out cross-validation selected 10 genes highly correlated with a representative IL-17–related gene, <italic>CCL20,</italic> in the BAE data set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). We chose <italic>CCL20</italic> a priori to guide the elastic net gene selection to specifically identify an IL-17/<italic>CCL20–</italic>associated response. <italic>CCL20</italic> was chosen for this role based on (a) biological relevance, as an epithelial gene known to be the only ligand for CCR6, a chemokine receptor preferentially expressed by Th17 cells, and thus thought to be more specific for an IL-17 response as compared with other adaptive immune responses (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>); and (b) statistical relevance, because it was highly upregulated (log<sub>2</sub> fold change = 2.92, FDR = 0.0006) following IL-17 stimulation in vitro. Importantly, this IL-17–associated gene was chosen to guide gene selection because our goal was to retain co-associated genes given their potential biological relevance, independent of outcomes of interest. We confirmed that the 10 genes selected by elastic net and <italic>CCL20</italic> were all intercorrelated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd">Supplemental Figure 2</xref>), verifying that the elastic net procedure removed loosely correlated genes. Nearly all of the 10 genes have previously been shown to be associated with IL-17–related inflammation (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>–<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). We thus used these 10 genes, along with <italic>CCL20</italic>, to construct a gene signature of airway epithelial response to IL-17 using the mean of their zero-centered log<sub>2</sub> expression values.</p>
                <p>We confirmed that the genes selected for the signature were measuring an IL-17 response not just specific to <italic>CCL20</italic> in two ways. First, we evaluated the correlation between our IL-17 signature and a 5-gene airway epithelial IL-17 gene expression metric previously examined in asthma (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). In the BAE data set the 2 signatures were well correlated (ρ = 0.51, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 2.2 × 10<sup>–16</sup>) in COPD participants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd">Supplemental Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd">Supplemental Table 1</xref>). The signatures were also correlated in an additional COPD data set, GLUCOLD (demographics in <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), in which transcriptomic profiles from endobronchial biopsies were obtained from 79 participants with COPD (ρ = 0.49, <italic>P</italic> = 5.0 × 10<sup>–6</sup>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd">Supplemental Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd">Supplemental Table 1</xref>). Second, we repeated the elastic net procedure using <italic>SLC26A4</italic>, the gene most upregulated with IL-17 stimulation in cell culture also measured in the COPD array data (log<sub>2</sub> fold change = 8.51, FDR = 0), to guide the elastic net. The <italic>SLC26A4</italic>-based signature incorporated 16 genes, 6 of which were also in the 11-gene <italic>CCL20</italic>-based signature, and was highly correlated with the <italic>CCL20</italic>-based signature in the BAE and GLUCOLD data sets (ρ = 0.97 and <italic>P</italic> &lt; 2.2 × 10<sup>–16</sup>, ρ = 0.87 and <italic>P</italic> &lt; 2.2 × 10<sup>–16</sup>, respectively; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd">Supplemental Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd">Supplemental Table 1</xref>). Thus, removal of loosely associated genes from the 100-gene signature using <italic>CCL20</italic> to guide the elastic net measured a response that does not appear to be exclusive to <italic>CCL20</italic>. However, we used the <italic>CCL20</italic>-based signature for our subsequent analyses, as it had clear advantages over the others. The asthma signature was generated in a cell culture model and never fit to the in vivo environment. <italic>SLC26A4</italic> is of unclear significance in IL-17 biology, and thus we considered the <italic>CCL20</italic>-based signature more biologically relevant.</p>

                <p>To further validate that our IL-17 signature reflects an IL-17 response, we examined it in 2 publicly available transcriptomic data sets of psoriatic skin lesions before and after controlled treatment with anti–IL-17 biologics.</p>
                <p>In the first data set (GEO GSE31652) (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>), psoriatic skin lesion biopsies were taken at baseline and after 2 weeks of ixekizumab, an anti–IL-17 monoclonal antibody (<italic>n</italic> = 6), or placebo (<italic>n</italic> = 4). All ixekizumab-treated participants, but none of the placebo-treated, showed clinical improvement of at least 75% at 6 weeks. The skin IL-17 gene signature decreased over 2 weeks in lesions from ixekizumab- but not placebo-treated participants (<italic>P</italic> = 0.003 for the interaction between treatment and time; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3, A and B</xref>).</p>
                <p>In the second data set (GEO GSE53552) (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>), biopsies were taken from psoriatic skin lesions and matched nonlesional skin at baseline (<italic>n</italic> = 25). Psoriatic lesions were then sampled over 6 weeks after treatment with placebo (<italic>n</italic> = 5) or a dose range of brodalumab (<italic>n</italic> = 20), an IL-17 receptor-α–blocking monoclonal antibody. Psoriatic lesions showed higher IL-17 signature expression compared with matched nonlesional skin (<italic>P</italic> = 0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3, C–F</xref>). The signature decreased over time in psoriatic lesions in those who received 350 or 700 mg compared with placebo, but not in those who received 140 mg (350 mg: <italic>P</italic> = 0.005 at 1 week, <italic>P</italic> = 0.02 at 2 weeks, and <italic>P</italic> = 0.12 at 6 weeks; 700 mg: <italic>P</italic> = 0.002 at 2 weeks and 0.0006 at 6 weeks for the interaction between treatment and time; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3, C–F</xref>). This was consistent with clinical treatment response (all placebo-treated and three of four 140-mg-treated participants showed no clinical treatment response; all 700-mg-treated and all but one 350-mg-treated showed at least 70% clinical improvement). The observation that our putative IL-17 signature tracked with clinical response to an IL-17 inhibitor in 2 psoriasis clinical trials provides independent confirmation of its value as a metric of IL-17–driven inflammation.</p>

                <p>In the BAE data set, our 11-gene IL-17 signature was higher in former smokers (mean of the zero-centered log<sub>2</sub> gene expression = 0.29 ± 0.46) compared with current smokers (–0.42 ± 0.48, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 2.2 × 10<sup>–16</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd">Supplemental Table 4</xref>), and was associated with older age (ρ = 0.19, <italic>P</italic> = 0.004).

The signature was also higher with decreasing lung function (defined as the volume of air exhaled in the first second of a forced expiratory maneuver [FEV<sub>1</sub>]). Specifically, a higher gene signature was associated with lower FEV<sub>1</sub> expressed as a percentage of the predicted value (FEV<sub>1</sub>% predicted) across all participants (1 unit increase in the IL-17 signature is associated with a 12-ml decrease in FEV<sub>1</sub>, <italic>P</italic> = 1.40 × 10<sup>–5</sup>) and among only COPD participants (associated with a 5.5-ml decrease in FEV<sub>1</sub>, <italic>P</italic> = 0.04), suggesting an association with increasing COPD severity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p>

                <title>Association with decreased response to inhaled corticosteroids in GLUCOLD.</title>
                <p>Following baseline bronchoscopy in GLUCOLD, 49 participants with available baseline biopsies were randomized to treatment with 30 months of medication containing inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) (<italic>n</italic> = 33) or placebo (<italic>n</italic> = 16). A higher baseline IL-17 signature was associated with lack of improvement in post-bronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub> on ICS, whereas a lower IL-17 signature was associated with improvement in FEV<sub>1</sub>, as compared with placebo (<italic>P</italic> = 0.028 for the interaction between treatment and time; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref> and <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). We identified 28% of GLUCOLD participants as having high IL-17 gene expression (“IL-17–high”) by cluster partitioning (31% of COPD participants over all 3 studies, including 33% of BAE and 34% of SPIROMICS participants, were IL-17 high; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd">Supplemental Figure 6</xref>). After categorization of participants based on this cluster partitioning, those with an “IL-17–low” designation were more likely to respond to ICS with an improvement in lung function, while IL-17 high was associated with lack of response to ICS at 30 months (<italic>P</italic> = 0.047 for the interaction between IL-17 status and percentage change in FEV<sub>1</sub> after ICS compared with placebo).</p>
                <p>We found that a high IL-17 signature was specific but not sensitive for steroid unresponsiveness. Using the dichotimization into IL-17 high and low by cluster partitioning, the specificity for steroid unresponsiveness was 75% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd">Supplemental Table 5</xref>). When the IL-17–high group was restricted to a slightly higher cutoff at the top quartile of IL-17 signature values, the specificity increased to 94% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd">Supplemental Table 6</xref>).</p>
                <p>The association between the IL-17 signature and change in FEV<sub>1</sub> among ICS-treated participants was not due to those participants with low IL-17 signature expression reciprocally exhibiting high type 2 inflammation. The significance of the relationship between the IL-17 signature and ICS response persisted even after we adjusted for markers of steroid-responsive type 2 inflammation using either airway tissue eosinophils (<italic>P</italic> = 0.027) or our previously identified airway epithelial genomic signature of type 2 inflammation (<italic>P</italic> = 0.018; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd">Supplemental Figure 7</xref>, <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, and ref. <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). The association also does not appear to be explained by IL-17 inflammation simply reflecting tissue neutrophils or macrophages, as adjustment for neutrophil or macrophage counts in the model also did not change the relationship between the IL-17 signature and ICS response (<italic>P</italic> = 0.016 and 0.030, respectively; <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>).</p>
                <p>The IL-17 signature alone explained 23% of the variation in change in FEV<sub>1</sub> with corticosteroids (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.23; <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). As expected given the low sensitivity of the IL-17 signature for steroid unresponsiveness, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was modest (63%; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd">Supplemental Figure 8</xref>). However, there were no significant associations between other biomarkers of inflammation (including sputum and blood cell counts) and change in FEV<sub>1</sub> in ICS- versus placebo-treated participants after adjustment for age and smoking status. Furthermore, the AUCs for these other potential biomarkers (sputum eosinophils, 51%; blood eosinophils, 55%; sputum neutrophils, 52%; blood neutrophils, 45%) suggest that they lack any predictive power for corticosteroid responsiveness in this data set (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd">Supplemental Figure 8</xref>). Although limited by small sample size, these proof-of-concept analyses suggest that our airway epithelial signature of IL-17 response in COPD may mark FEV<sub>1</sub> response to ICS better than easily measured cell differentials or other genomic markers of the adaptive immune response.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>In this study, we used 3 complementary human COPD studies to characterize the clinical significance of the airway epithelial response to IL-17 in COPD. We showed that a signature of IL-17–associated airway inflammation is upregulated in a subset of participants with COPD (31% across studies), and is associated with distinct inflammatory, physiologic, and clinical features. Increases in this signature are associated with an inflammatory profile characteristic of an IL-17 response, including increased airway neutrophils and macrophages but not eosinophils, type 2 markers, or type 1 gene expression. Decreases in the signature occur in response to therapeutic blockade of IL-17 in psoriatic skin lesions, and this response corresponds to clinical improvement in that disease. In COPD, the signature is further associated with more severe airway obstruction and a novel CT biomarker of functional small airways disease that is predictive of worsening airway disease over time (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). Finally, higher IL-17 signature expression is associated with a lack of response to ICS in COPD, whereas low expression may identify those patients who benefit from ICS. This association does not appear to be due simply to reciprocal alterations in type 2 inflammation, as the interaction between our IL-17 signature and treatment was unaffected by adjustments for airway eosinophils or our type 2 airway genomic signature. Thus, our findings suggest that enhanced IL-17 inflammation characterizes a distinct subset of COPD, and that identifying this subgroup may be important for therapeutic decisions.</p>
              <p>In COPD, chronic exposure to smoking, microbial insults, and recurrent mucosal injury may all contribute to immune activation with IL-17–producing T cells, supported by innate IL-17–producing cells (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). This likely contributes to ongoing neutrophilic inflammation and macrophage recruitment with subsequent airway remodeling and tissue destruction (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). We found that our IL-17 gene expression signature is associated with increases in airway neutrophils and macrophages, indicating an IL-17 response. It is related to worse clinical outcomes across former and current smokers. These findings provide evidence for the contribution of IL-17 inflammation to COPD pathology despite smoking cessation.</p>
              <p>We found that the IL-17 response in COPD is heterogeneous, enhanced in a subgroup. Prior studies found variability in IL-17–related inflammation within COPD (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>–<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), and our data suggest that this variability is clinically significant. Other studies have identified some characteristics of IL-17–associated inflammation in COPD, including more severe obstruction, emphysema, and lymphoid neogenesis (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Here we comprehensively investigated the associations between IL-17–driven inflammation and COPD patient characteristics. In addition to an association with increased airway obstruction, we found associations with a novel CT biomarker of functional small airways disease and corticosteroid unresponsiveness. COPD phenotypes are heterogeneous and complex. Thus we hypothesize that multiple overlapping molecular phenotypes underlie the complex clinical phenotypes we observe in chronic airway diseases and that there will be an upper bound to the predictive power of any one biological pathway (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). However, a strength here is that we observe correlations that are reproducible across our transcriptional data sets (for associations with neutrophils and FEV<sub>1</sub>).</p>
              <p>We had hypothesized that the IL-17 signature would be associated with increased emphysema, as found in a previous study (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). We evaluated this using the recently developed PRM CT analysis method (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). By matching inspiratory and expiratory scans, PRM improves the ability to distinguish emphysema from functional small airways disease, both of which are associated with low-radiodensity lung regions on expiration (i.e., air trapping). Our IL-17 signature is associated with PRM<sup>fSAD</sup> but not PRM<sup>emph</sup> in SPIROMICS. As the participants generally had mild to moderate disease with minimal emphysema, the lack of association with PRM<sup>emph</sup> is not surprising. The association with PRM<sup>fSAD</sup> is of interest as the small airways are likely the main site of airway inflammation in COPD, and small airways disease is thought to precede emphysema (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). Studies using PRM have supported these findings. PRM<sup>fSAD</sup> is associated with more rapid FEV<sub>1</sub> decline, particularly in mild to moderate disease (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). PRM<sup>fSAD</sup> is also the greater contributor to radiographic abnormalities in mild to moderate COPD, with both PRM<sup>fSAD</sup> and PRM<sup>emph</sup> contributing in severe disease (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). Thus, an association between our IL-17 signature and PRM<sup>fSAD</sup> in mild to moderate COPD does not preclude an association with emphysema in more severe disease. In fact, it signifies an association with a more severe phenotype among participants with milder airway obstruction and suggests that IL-17–related inflammation may be a pathway on which to intervene to prevent the progression to emphysema and severe airway obstruction.</p>
              <p>Our IL-17 signature, when measured at baseline, is associated with a poor lung function response to corticosteroids at 30 months. This corticosteroid responsiveness is not simply due to participants with low IL-17 signature expression exhibiting low neutrophil counts or reciprocally exhibiting high type 2 inflammation. In murine models, Th17 cell–mediated airway inflammation has been shown to be corticosteroid resistant, in contrast to Th2 cell–mediated inflammation (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). Here, for the first time to our knowledge, we show the association between an IL-17 inflammatory signature and corticosteroid unresponsiveness in a longitudinal randomized controlled trial in humans. Many patients with COPD do not respond to corticosteroids, and ICSs are only indicated in exacerbation-prone symptomatic COPD. However, corticosteroids are still used broadly despite possible increases in adverse outcomes such as pneumonia (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). The corticosteroid unresponsiveness finding suggests that a more easily measurable surrogate for our IL-17 signature could serve as a biomarker for therapeutics in COPD. While it may be useful to predict who will not respond to corticosteroids, it may be even more useful to predict who will respond to therapies targeting IL-17 or associated inflammatory pathways as we found in psoriatic lesions.</p>
              <p>Our study relied on the airway epithelial gene expression response to IL-17. The airway epithelium is the first line of defense against injury in the lung and a chief target on which IL-17 induces an effect. Other studies have relied on cell counts or immunoreactivity, which are poorly correlated in the human lung (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Additionally, Th17 cells display a high level of plasticity, and are thus more unstable than Th1 or Th2 cells (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>), suggesting that cell numbers may not represent cytokine response. Data are also conflicting on whether IL-17<sup>+</sup> cell counts are elevated in COPD and related to key pathologic characteristics such as airway neutrophilia (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). We, however, show that IL-17 signature genes are not only upregulated in 2 separate experiments in which HBECs were stimulated with IL-17, but that our signature is associated with increases in airway neutrophils as well. We also show that our signature is decreased in response to IL-17–blocking agents in psoriatic skin lesions but distinct from airway epithelial type 1 and 2 responses, further indicating that we are marking an IL-17–specific epithelial response.</p>
              <p>We acknowledge that fitting our IL-17 signature to <italic>CCL20</italic> could have limited its generalizability. However, the signature generalized well in that (a) it was highly correlated with 2 other IL-17 gene signatures (a signature previously studied in asthma [ref. <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and a signature fit to <italic>SLC26A4</italic>, the most significantly upregulated gene in our IL-17–stimulated human bronchial epithelial culture experiments) and (b) our IL-17 signature was responsive to anti–IL-17 therapy and reflective of clinical response in 2 randomized controlled trials in psoriasis. The advantage of fitting this gene signature to <italic>CCL20</italic> is that it improved its “fit” to a more complex in vivo tissue environment rather than a simple cell culture model. In a COPD patient this complex environment may be further compounded by multiple airway insults (e.g., smoking, microbial colonization, exacerbations, medications) that are not modeled well in culture. By retaining only tightly intercorrelated genes, a well-established method for identifying genes in the same molecular pathway (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>), we removed those genes that may be nonspecific to an IL-17 response in vivo.</p>
              <p>Our study has some potential limitations. For instance, some analyses were cross-sectional, and those analyses can only show associations, not causality. Our longitudinal analyses were limited by sample size. Thus, while we did find a strong association between our IL-17 signature and lack of response to inhaled steroids over 30 months, an assessment of the predictive power of the signature for corticosteroid responsiveness was quite limited. Furthermore, our definitions of “high” and “low” for the IL-17 signature are highly dependent on the population in which they were developed. Therefore, further studies will be needed to determine whether the signature could be used as a biomarker for steroid unresponsiveness, and to determine the best cutoff for IL-17 high and low. We also were not powered to study the association between the signature and exacerbation rates, which will be important to study in relation to therapeutic response. It was not within the scope of this study to identify the cause of the increased IL-17 response. We do, however, see associations in current and former smokers, suggesting that more than just smoke exposure is playing a role. The contributions of stimuli such as alterations in the microbiome or autoimmunity to enhanced IL-17–related gene expression will require further study. Furthermore, COPD phenotypes are heterogeneous and complex, and thus we hypothesize that multiple overlapping molecular phenotypes underlie the complex clinical phenotypes we observe in chronic airway diseases. Finally, future work will be needed to identify surrogate biomarkers in more easily obtained specimens than airway brushings. This is similar to the approach we took in our asthma studies in which we initially identified a type 2 high asthma molecular phenotype based on airway gene expression, and then expanded this work to identify the best associated biomarkers (periostin, eosinophils, FeNO).</p>
              <p>In summary, we show here that a signature of IL-17–associated airway inflammation is upregulated in approximately a third of COPD participants and is associated with distinct inflammatory, physiologic, and clinical features. Our findings suggest that the IL-17 signature defines a molecular COPD phenotype that responds poorly to corticosteroid therapy, and that could instead be the target of emerging therapies that interfere with IL-17 (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>).</p>

                  <p>A subgroup of participants in the SPIROMICS multicenter observational cohort study underwent research bronchoscopy. RNA was obtained from bronchial epithelial brushings from third- to fourth-generation bronchi of the right or left lower lobe of current and former smokers with mild to moderate COPD (<italic>n</italic> = 47). RNA was used for profiling IL-17–associated gene expression by 2-step, nested-primer quantitative reverse transcription PCR as described previously (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Primer and probe sequences are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd">Supplemental Table 8</xref>.</p>
                  <p>At least a 20-pack-year smoking history was required for inclusion, and participants were classified as former smokers after 1 year of smoking cessation. Participants were classified as having COPD based on spirometry, performed before and after 4 inhalations each of albuterol (90 μg dose per inhalation) and ipratropium (18 μg dose per inhalation), using the GOLD staging system (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>). Full inclusion/exclusion criteria are included in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd">Supplemental Table 7</xref>.</p>
                  <p>Blood collection, sputum induction, and CT scans were done at the first study visit. Sputum induction was performed as previously described (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). Parametric response mapping (PRM) of CT imaging was used to distinguish areas of normal lung (PRM<sup>norm</sup>) from areas of functional small airways disease (PRM<sup>fSAD</sup>) and emphysema (PRM<sup>emph</sup>) as previously described (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). Briefly, PRM is a CT voxel-based imaging biomarker that uses dynamic image registration to spatially align paired inspiratory and expiratory scans. PRM<sup>fSAD</sup> is defined as areas of lung that are greater than –950 Hounsfield units (HU) on inspiration and less than –856 HU on expiration. PRM<sup>emph</sup> is defined as areas of lung that are less than –950 HU on inspiration and less than –856 HU on expiration. PRM<sup>norm</sup> is defined as areas of lung exceeding both thresholds on inspiration and expiration.</p>

                <title>Derivation of the IL-17 genomic signature</title>
                <p>An IL-17 genomic signature specific to bronchial epithelial brushings from smokers was generated using elastic net regression for feature selection in the BAE data set. The 100 genes most upregulated in ALI models after IL-17 stimulation were used as candidate predictor variables (“features”). Genes highly correlated with a representative IL-17 gene, <italic>CCL20</italic>, were selected as features for inclusion in the IL-17 signature using elastic net regression via the glmnet package in R with α = 0.75 and leave-one-out cross-validation (<xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>). Alpha was selected at just below 1 to maximize sparsity (and thus limit feature selection) while allowing for selection of closely correlated genes. <italic>CCL20</italic> and the 10 genes selected by elastic net regression were used for generation of the IL-17 signature. The mean of the zero-centered log<sub>2</sub>-scale gene expression values of these 11 genes was used as the IL-17 airway epithelial signature metric, a previously validated method (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). To confirm that our IL-17 signature was not just specific to <italic>CCL20</italic>, two alternative IL-17 signatures were generated. One was generated using the above procedure with <italic>SLC26A4</italic>, the most upregulated gene following IL-17 stimulation in cell culture also measured in the COPD array data, guiding the elastic net. The other was an IL-17 signature previously studied in asthma and was generated in the same way as previously reported, using the mean value of the zero-centered gene expression of five IL-17–associated genes (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>).</p>
                <p>For the ixekizumab and brodalumab studies, 4 genes were excluded before derivation of the IL-17 signature metric: 2 genes that were poorly annotated in the microarray platform used (<italic>SAA1</italic>, <italic>SAA2</italic>) and 2 genes that were not expressed above background (<italic>CSF3</italic>, <italic>MTNR1A1</italic>) in these skin biopsies. As there was 100% concordance between the 2 psoriasis studies on genes not expressed above background, we concluded that these genes were poorly expressed in the resident skin cells. We did not, however, change the signature in any way based on knowledge of the genes or relevance in psoriasis. The IL-17 skin signature was thus derived using the mean value of the zero-centered log<sub>2</sub>-scale gene expression values of the remaining 7 genes (<italic>CCL20</italic>, <italic>SLC26A4</italic>, <italic>TNIP3</italic>, <italic>CXCL3</italic>, <italic>CXCL5</italic>, <italic>CXCL6</italic>, and <italic>VNN1</italic>).</p>

                <title>Statistical analyses of the IL-17 genomic signature</title>
                <p>All regression analyses were performed using the limma package in R (<xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>). For cross-sectional analyses of the associations between the IL-17 signature and clinical variables (in the BAE, GLUCOLD, and SPIROMICS data sets), linear or logistic regression was used, as appropriate. Analyses were done before and after adjustment for age and smoking status. Race, sex, pack-years, and ICS use were evaluated as potential confounders as well. These variables were, however, left out of the final models, as they were not significantly associated with IL-17 signature expression, and did not significantly alter the relationships between the IL-17 signature and outcomes beyond adjustments for age and smoking status. Data were transformed when necessary for normal distribution. A <italic>P</italic> value less than 0.05 was considered significant. However, multiple-hypothesis testing was done using an FDR when appropriate (<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>). For the ixekizumab and brodalumab studies, mixed-effects models were used to relate the IL-17 signature (as the outcome variable) to the interaction between treatment and time (fixed effects) across participants (random effect). For longitudinal analyses in GLUCOLD, the interaction between treatment (ICS or placebo) and the baseline IL-17 signature was related to change in FEV<sub>1</sub> over 30 months. The ICS and ICS plus long-acting β-agonist groups were combined to improve power, as the long-term effects in these groups were comparable. In secondary analyses, the interactions between the IL-17 score and (a) tissue eosinophils, (b) our previously generated metric of type 2 inflammation (the T2S score), or (c) tissue neutrophils were related to change in FEV<sub>1</sub> over 30 months among those GLUCOLD participants who received ICS (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p>

                <title>Clustering</title>
                <p>All clustering analyses were performed using Euclidean distance with average linkage as the distance metric. The NbClust package (Bioconductor, R) was used to determine the best participant clustering of the IL-17 signature genes, based on a majority vote of 30 indices that evaluate partitioning (<xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>). NbClust deals with the inherent variability in the many indices available to determine the optimal number of clusters by requiring a consensus vote among these indices on best partitioning. Participants with relatively high expression who clustered separately from the majority of participants were considered “IL-17 high.” Before determination of the best number of partitions, the data sets were first stratified by smoking status given the large effect of smoking on gene expression. Differences among indices in deciding best clustering were generally due to separation of those with IL-17–high expression into 1 or more categories, while those with low expression clustered together. The exceptions were 2 participants in the SPIROMICS data set with low expression that were partitioned into their own groups. Six of 35 participants with relatively high IL-17 gene expression in the BAE data set, 3 of 23 participants in the GLUCOLD data set, and 5 of 18 participants in the SPIROMICS data set were partitioned out as the highest for IL-17 expression. For simplicity, all IL-17 high, including these highest participants, were grouped together.</p>
                <p>The IL-17 signature was then discretized into 2 categories, IL-17 high and IL-17 low, using 2 different methods, to use as a categorical predictor for longitudinal analyses in GLUCOLD. Discretization was first based on the best partitioning decided by NbClust, and then alternatively based on the top quartile of signature expression. Ten percent of samples with IL-17 signatures closest to the partition were removed before discretization to diminish overlap.</p>
