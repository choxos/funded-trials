                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Obesity is a persistent public health concern and a risk factor for many chronic diseases including at least 13 different cancers. Adult Black females have the highest prevalence of obesity (57%) compared to other racial/gender groups in the U.S. Although behavioral weight loss (BWL) interventions have demonstrated effectiveness, Black females tend to lose less weight than White counterparts. The higher prevalence of chronic psychological stress reported by Black females may contribute to their disproportionate prevalence of obesity and observed suboptimal weight loss. This study will examine the effectiveness of a 12-month culturally-targeted, stress management-enhanced BWL intervention on weight loss and stress reduction among Black females in a fully-powered randomized, controlled trial.</p>

                  <p id="Par2">Adult Black females with obesity (<italic>n</italic> = 340) will be randomized to either a culturally targeted stress management-enhanced BWL intervention (BWL-Stress) or the same BWL intervention alone (BWL-alone). The primary outcome is weight change at month 6. Secondary outcomes will include changes in stress measures (e.g., perceived stress, cortisol), energy intake, and physical activity at month 6. We will also assess process measures (e.g., treatment adherence, treatment burden). Each outcome will also be evaluated at month 12 to assess longer-term effects of the intervention.</p>

                  <p id="Par3">This novel approach for enhancing an evidence-based BWL program with culturally-targeted stress management strategies for Black females addresses an understudied barrier to effective weight management among a population at high risk for obesity and obesity-related chronic diseases. This study will potentially elucidate psychological or behavioral mechanisms linking our novel intervention to study outcomes. If the intervention is proven to be effective, this study will have significant clinical and public health implications for weight management among Black females.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par18">In the US, Black adults are disproportionately affected by cancer, with the highest death rate of any racial or ethnic group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The lifetime risk of cancer for Black adults is 1 in 3, and more cases occur among females than males [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Nearly 40% of US adults have obesity, a risk factor for 13 types of cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The highest prevalence of obesity is among Black females, at approximately 57% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Given that obesity is a strong risk factor for cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], effective strategies for weight management are needed to combat the obesity epidemic and the resulting risk for several types of cancer and other chronic conditions, especially in those at highest risk.</p>
              <p id="Par19">Although behavioral weight loss (BWL) interventions have been effective at promoting weight loss in some individuals with obesity, these programs still result in less weight loss among Black females compared to White counterparts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Even the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) Intensive Lifestyle Intervention, which produced clinically meaningful weight loss (3-5% of baseline weight) among Black women (4.7 kg weight loss at 6 months), achieved 2.8 kg greater weight loss in White women and significantly greater weight loss among all race-gender groups (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) except for Black men, indicating a need to examine sociocultural and environmental factors for successful BWL interventions among Black women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Disparities in weight loss outcomes of Black and White individuals have also been reported in several other BWL trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. To improve weight loss outcomes among Black women, research on culturally-adapted interventions and mechanistic links between cultural factors and weight loss is warranted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par20">Psychological stress is associated with weight gain over time and higher body mass index (BMI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In previous BWL interventions, individuals with higher stress at the start of the weight loss program went on to lose less weight than those with lower stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Given that Black females report higher chronic stress than other groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], have a unique stress experience due to the intersection of race and sex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], and tend to employ coping strategies that may be detrimental to health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], the role of stress on weight control efforts may be particularly relevant for Black women. There is a well-established literature on stress reduction interventions that address racial/ethnic, health, and socioeconomic differences in stress exposure and stress-related outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], as well as observational relationships suggesting that high stress levels may contribute to enduring and increasing adiposity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, there remains a gap in the literature about whether adding a culturally-targeted stress management component to an evidence-based BWL intervention will produce greater weight loss than the standard intervention. A 2018 review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] reported that only two small studies have investigated how adding stress management training to BWL programs affects weight loss: one reported significant positive effects among Greek women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], and the other, conducted in a sample of Black women, reported encouraging trends but was underpowered to detect significance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In addition, a randomized BWL program that tested the addition of mindfulness training for stress reduction in a predominantly (60%) White sample did not lead to greater weight loss, although it led to greater glucose control, a secondary outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The participants of color attended fewer sessions in the mindfulness condition, and had less weight loss, again suggesting culturally tailored stress reduction is needed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The purpose of this study is to examine whether a culturally-targeted, stress management-enhanced BWL intervention will improve weight loss and stress reduction among Black females in a fully powered randomized, controlled trial.</p>

                <title>Aims and hypotheses</title>
                <p id="Par21">This study examines whether a culturally-targeted, stress management-enhanced BWL intervention (BWL-Stress) is effective in reducing weight compared to a standard BWL intervention (BWL-Alone) among adult Black females with obesity and elevated stress levels. The primary aim is to conduct a randomized controlled trial to determine the effects of BWL-Stress on body weight compared to BWL-Alone among adult Black females with obesity and elevated perceived stress. Black women with co-existing obesity and elevated stress as measured by a validated survey will be randomized to BWL-Stress or BWL-Alone. We hypothesize that BWL-Stress will lead to greater weight loss at 6 months than BWL-Alone. The second aim is to evaluate the effects of BWL-Stress on multidimensional stress as measured by a validated survey instrument and a stress biomarker. Perceived psychological stress will be measured by the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and the Stress and Adversity Inventory (STRAIN) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], and salivary cortisol (assessing the cortisol awakening response) will be collected as an objective measure of stress at baseline and multiple follow-up time points to be able to compare changes by intervention group over time. We hypothesize that BWL-Stress will lead to greater reduction in perceived stress and more improvement in cortisol level at 6 months than BWL-Alone. The third aim is to determine whether the relationship between BWL-Stress and weight change is mediated by perceived stress, energy intake, and/or physical activity. A multiple mediation model will be used to determine if perceived stress level, energy intake, and/or energy expenditure explain observed relationships between the stress management-augmented intervention and weight change. We hypothesize that the relationship between BWL-Stress and 6-month weight change will be partially mediated by PSS-10 score, energy intake, and physical activity.</p>

Both groups will receive the same evidence-based BWL program over 26 sessions. In addition to the BWL program, the BWL-Stress group will receive training on stress management, whereas the BWL-Alone group will receive education on general women’s health topics as an equivalent attention control.

                <p id="Par24">While primary analysis will be adjusted for prognostic factors for weight loss, sample size was determined using an equal variance t-test. Preliminary data identified a 1.4 kg loss for Lifestyle alone and 2.7 kg loss for Lifestyle + Stress interventions, with standard deviations of 2.1 and 4.0 kg, respectively, yielding a Cohen’s d of 0.44 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. As these measures were taken at 3 months, and the current study is assessing 6-month weight loss, larger effects are likely; however, to reduce the likelihood of using an effect size which is too large [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], the study has been powered for a Cohen’s d of 0.35. This effect comes from assuming the above with both groups having a 4 kg standard deviation. Thus, with 85% power and a Type 1 error rate of 0.05, 148 participants are needed per group for a total of 296 participants. To allow for 10% attrition without loss of power, 340 participants (170 per group) will be enrolled and randomized.</p>

Established relationships between Moffitt Cancer Center and the Tampa Bay Community Cancer Network will also be leveraged to aid in the recruitment of community volunteers for this research study. Recruitment campaigns will be conducted across Years 2-5 of the project to enroll approximately 85 participants per each of four waves, allowing for delivery of at least four treatment groups per cohort (two BWL-Stress and two BWL-Alone groups) with approximately 21 participants per group. Based on a conservative estimate of a 35% recruitment yield obtained from our preliminary research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], we anticipate pre-screening approximately 970 individuals (~ 323 per year) to enroll 340 participants over four waves.

                <p id="Par27">Both treatment conditions will include a DPP-based lifestyle change curriculum presented in a group-based format in 26 sessions over a 1-year period. DPP is a structured lifestyle change program focused on reducing caloric intake and increasing physical activity to at least 150 min per week [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. DPP employs evidence-based behavior change strategies such as self-monitoring and goal setting to promote lifestyle changes. Based on the original DPP study in which participants lost 5-7% of baseline body weight and the risk of developing diabetes was reduced by 58% in high-risk adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], as well as follow-up studies showing similar successes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], DPP has been adopted as a Centers for Disease Control (CDC)-recognized lifestyle change program. Consistent with the CDC-recommended meeting schedule, participants will meet once a week for 4 months (sessions 1 to 16), every other week for 2 months (sessions 17 to 20), and once a month for 6 months (sessions 21 to 26) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].

                  <p id="Par28">A Community Advisory Board (CAB) consisting of five Black women from the Tampa Bay area contributed personal and professional opinions about stress management curriculum materials. CAB members included two consultants, a director/program manager, a nurse, and a public health manager. All CAB members had experience working in a leadership role in a community nonprofit or business. These women were selected to serve on the CAB primarily because of their community/health advocacy experience, their racial- and sex-concordance with the targeted population for the study, and because they represent different perspectives (e.g., race, sex, age, geography) that our research team wanted to ensure were reflected in the intervention materials. The CAB met for four weekly 1-h sessions, in which stress management session content, impact, and usability, as well as cultural relevance of wording and images, was discussed.

These evidence-based techniques will be linked with needs, values, beliefs, and culture of the target population (e.g., collectivism, racial pride, religiosity/spirituality) to provide culturally relevant strategies for stress management among Black females with elevated stress. While we are primarily focused on culturally-targeted stress management strategies, some elements of the cultural targeting, e.g., racial- and gender-concordant interventionists, will naturally be imbedded into the BWL portion of the intervention.

Intervention materials (i.e., worksheets and information sheets) will be emailed to participants prior to the intervention session. Participants will be asked to print their own materials. To further reduce site visits, participants will be asked to mail their saliva kits and activity monitors to a member of the study team for analysis. Non-monetary incentive benchmarks will be aligned with assessment visits instead of being spaced out throughout the duration of the study. Participants will track their dietary intake and physical activity using the MyFitnessPal app instead of a food and activity diary. Lastly, to foster a positive group dynamic, interventionists will be trained to engage participants via Zoom (e.g., using polls and online whiteboards), and participants will receive Zoom backgrounds for the sessions.

                    <p id="Par39">Participants’ perception of psychological stress will be assessed using the PSS-10 and STRAIN. The PSS-10 measures the degree to which an individual perceives life events to be stressful. Sample items include: “In the past month, how often have you felt that you could not cope with all the things that you had to do?” and “How often have you felt that you were unable to control the important things in your life?” Responses are on a 5-point Likert sale (0 = never to 4 = very often). Four items (e.g., “felt confident about ability to handle personal problems”; “I felt things were going my way”) are positively worded and will be reverse coded for analysis. Higher total scores correspond to greater perceived stress. The PSS-10 has been validated in diverse populations and demonstrated to have good internal consistency (α = 0.77) in a previous study conducted by our group among a similar population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. STRAIN is an instrument that measures cumulative exposure to life stress, with questions on acute life events, chronic difficulties, and early life stressors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. STRAIN contains approximately 220 total questions, with automated omission of questions that are inappropriate for the respondent’s demographic characteristics. STRAIN is structured with close-ended core questions about 55 distinct stressors related to major life domains (e.g., health, education, work, finances, housing, living conditions, intimate relationships, friendships, crime, etc.) and follow-up questions regarding the severity, frequency, timing, and duration of each stressor. A set of 20 lifetime stressor scores will be created based on STRAIN responses. Objective stress will be measured by salivary cortisol via SalivaBio Oral Swab (Salimetrics, LLC, Carlsbad, CA, USA) at baseline and 6-months to correspond with the primary study outcome of weight loss at 6 months. Participants will be provided with a Salimetrics Swab Saliva Collection Kit that includes 9 swabs and tubes. Participants will be asked to collect saliva upon waking and at 30- and 60-min after waking for 3 consecutive days. Participants will be asked to store the samples in their home freezer until they return the samples to our research team after completion at each time point.</p>

The NCI ASA-24 is drawn from the USDA’s Automated Multiple-Pass Method which uses the “gold standard” multiple-pass methodology. This web-based program allows researchers to enter dietary recall data via a respondent portal that is linked to a researcher site where data are saved for future download. The NCI ASA-24 uses Computer-Assisted Self-Interviewing (CASI) methodology to guide the respondent through multiple steps of recall, including meal-based quick list, meal gap review, detail pass (including quantity consumed), forgotten foods, and final review. Data will be quantitated to assess energy and nutrient intake, and average daily caloric intake will be the parameter of analysis. Each assessment will include a weekday and weekend day to account for eating variations.</p>

In addition to receiving a CDC-recognized BWL program at no cost to them, participants will be provided with the results of their assessments, including BMI, waist circumference, blood glucose, blood pressure, and PSS-10 score. We will also send birthday and holiday cards to remain connected to participants. To further promote retention, we will provide participants with monetary incentives for completing each of three follow-up data collection visits, with an escalating scale of reimbursement to maximize the acquisition of follow-up data, including $50 at month 4, $100 at month 6, and $150 at month 12. Participants will also receive non-monetary incentives, i.e., merchandise with the study logo, such as a water bottle for perfect attendance by month 4 assessment, for achieving milestones. Finally, the research team will foster relationships and rapport with participants, which will positively impact adherence and retention. The research team will also have a weekly review of attendance to discuss participants at-risk for loss and discuss targeted strategies for retention (e.g., troubleshooting transportation challenges or scheduling conflicts) to proactively limit attrition. If a participant misses two consecutive intervention sessions, a member of the research staff will reach out to them directly to identify and discuss any barriers that may be able to be addressed.</p>

                <title>Statistical analyses</title>
                <p id="Par49">For the primary aim which compares BWL-Stress and BWL-Alone on 6-month weight loss outcomes, weight change (baseline weight subtracted from 6-month weight), will be tested using linear models and adjusted for known prognostic measures for weight loss such as age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>] and baseline weight. Model diagnostics, such as assessing normality of residuals and homoskedasticity, will be performed. If any assumption is violated, appropriate transformations (e.g., log) or analyses (e.g., quantile regression) will be performed. Follow-up analyses will be conducted to examine weight loss at month 12.</p>
                <p id="Par50">The secondary aim examines change in perceived, self-reported psychological stress, and will specifically examine changes in PSS-10 and STRAIN scores and cortisol by intervention group at month 6. Similar to Aim 1, change scores will be created and treated as continuous, and adjusted linear models and baseline outcome measure will be performed with appropriate diagnostics for model assumptions. Stress will also be examined at month 12 using data from the PSS-10.</p>
                <p id="Par51">For Aim 3, which examines whether the relationship between the intervention and weight change is mediated by perceived stress, energy intake, and physical activity, we will determine whether the relationship between each intervention condition and weight loss is mediated by perceived stress (as measured by the PSS-10), caloric intake, or physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Each potential mediator will be evaluated independently using a counterfactual approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. As we are interested in multiple mediators which likely are not independent, we will use inverse odds ratio weighting (IOWR) to estimate the natural direct effect of BWL-Stress and BWL-Alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. This method first estimates weights by using logistic regression (to predict the dichotomous exposure variable) containing all mediators and confounders and creates an odds ratio for each participant. Next, the odds ratios (OR) are inverted (f (OR<sub>i</sub>) = OR<sub>i</sub><sup>− 1</sup>) for each participant to create an IORW weight with standard BWL participants having weight 1. Direct effects of the intervention are estimated using weighted linear regression models including confounders and no mediators using IORW weights. The total effect of the intervention on weight loss is then estimated using an unweighted linear regression with the same confounders as the weighted analysis. The indirect effect is then estimated by subtracting the direct effect from the total effect. Confidence intervals for the effects are created using bootstrap methods. All analyses will be intention-to-treat. Baseline observation carried forward, which conservatively estimates a return to pre-treatment weight, will be used for participants without follow-up outcome measures for the primary outcome of weight. For participants missing data other than the primary outcome, we will perform multiple imputation as appropriate, as complete case analyses are known to be biased.</p>
                <p id="Par52">Missing data will be handled using multiple imputation by chained equations (MICE) with auxiliary variables identified using procedures from Enders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Estimates from different imputed datasets will be combined using Rubin’s rules, and these will be integrated with inverse weighting mediation measures based on Stata code from previous similar work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Multiple imputation is superior to complete case analysis if the missing complete at random assumption is violated. The likelihood of meeting the missing at random assumption will be bolstered with the use of auxiliary variables.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par54">Obesity, a risk factor for many chronic diseases, is disproportionately represented among minority populations, with the highest prevalence among Black females [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Over half of adult Black females in the United States have obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and Black females lose less weight than White females when engaging in obesity treatment, regardless of the treatment modality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Black females also have a higher prevalence of obesity-associated diseases, including type 2 diabetes, compared with White females [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. While it is clear that creating an energy deficit through decreased intake or increased expenditure is required to promote weight loss, research shows that energy intake and expenditure are associated with many biological, psychosocial, environmental and behavioral factors that may vary across population subgroups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Thus, obesity treatment is not a “one size fits all” regimen, and targeted approaches may lead to improved outcomes, especially among high-risk populations.</p>
              <p id="Par55">This study will examine whether culturally-salient stress management strategies can improve weight loss outcomes for Black females with obesity and elevated stress and will identify the mechanisms that link stress management to improved weight loss. Findings from this study may provide tools to improve weight loss outcomes for a high-risk population that has demonstrated only modest responses to other obesity treatment options. Findings may also provide a model to address other chronic diseases such as diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular disease. If shown to be effective and clinically meaningful, the novel intervention examined in this study will also support future dissemination and implementation studies to integrate this approach into current community-based and clinical obesity treatment programs.</p>
              <p id="Par56">Completion of this proposal will determine if systematically addressing stress in BWL programs can improve outcomes for adult Black females with elevated stress and identify the underlying behavioral mechanisms. If the novel intervention is effective, study findings can be used to improve obesity treatment for the segment of the U.S. population with the greatest burden of obesity and may be adapted for other populations.</p>
