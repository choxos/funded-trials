                <p>Doravirine (DOR) is a non‐nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of HIV‐1. Its use in combination with rifapentine (RPT), an antituberculosis (TB) antibiotic, may reduce the exposure of DOR compromising viral suppression in those living with HIV‐1 co‐infected with TB. We conducted a prospective, phase I, open label, two‐period, fixed sequence, drug interaction study to evaluate the effect of once‐weekly RPT and isoniazid (INH) on the pharmacokinetics (PKs) of DOR in healthy volunteers. DOR 100 mg was administered alone twice‐daily for 4 days in period 1. In period 2, once‐weekly RPT + INH were co‐administered with multiple doses of DOR 100 mg twice‐daily for study days 7, 14, and 21. Plasma was obtained for DOR PKs when given alone and co‐administered with RPT + INH. Eleven healthy volunteers enrolled and completed the study. The geometric mean ratios and 90% confidence intervals for DOR area under the concentration‐time curve from zero to 12 hours (AUC<sub>0–12</sub>) and C<sub>12</sub> in the presence of RPT + INH compared with DOR alone were 0.71 (0.60–0.85) and 0.69 (0.54–0.89), respectively. Although exposures were moderately reduced in the presence of RPT + INH, trough DOR values were within the concentration range associated with virological suppression. These results demonstrate that a modest decrease in DOR exposure would unlikely be clinically relevant in a virally suppressed patient co‐administered once‐weekly RPT + INH.</p>

                <p>☑ Co‐infection with latent tuberculosis (TB) in persons living with HIV‐1 is common. Rifapentine (RPT) is an antiTB antibiotic available as once‐weekly treatment for latent TB and is a potent inducer of CYP3A metabolic enzyme. There are limited studies that evaluate RPT in the presence with antiretrovirals, including doravirine (DOR), a novel non‐nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor metabolized by CYP3A.

</p>
                <p>☑ Following RPT‐mediated CYP3A induction, DOR steady‐state trough concentrations declined in a time‐dependent manner. Steady‐state clearance of DOR increased with a &gt; 50% reduction in plasma half‐life following co‐administration with RPT and INH. Despite this reduction, DOR exposure is in a range that is likely to maintain viral suppression.

</p>
                <p>☑ DOR 100 mg given twice‐daily can mitigate the interactive effects of once‐weekly RPT. Co‐administration was generally well‐tolerated with a modest decrease in DOR exposure unlikely to be clinically relevant. This dosing regimen may offer an alternative to virally suppressed patients on antiretroviral therapy co‐infected with latent TB and considering an RPT‐based regimen.</p>

              <p>Doravirine (DOR) is a non‐nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) used in combination with other antiretrovirals (ARVs) for the treatment of HIV‐1 infection in adults.

              <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) currently recommends several latent tuberculosis (TB) infection (LTBI) treatment options for persons with HIV and includes either once‐daily isoniazid (INH) for 9 months, rifampin or rifabutin once‐daily for 4 months, or once‐weekly rifapentine (RPT) and INH for 3 months.<xref rid="cts12810-bib-0004" ref-type="ref"><sup>4</sup></xref> The rifamycin class of antiTB agents are strong inducers of CYP enzymes, including CYP3A, with rifabutin being the less potent inducer of the three.

<xref rid="cts12810-fig-0001" ref-type="fig"><bold>1</bold></xref>). Subjects received DOR 100 mg twice‐daily for 4 study days during the first period. In the second period, once‐weekly weight‐based RPT and INH and pyridoxine 50 mg was co‐administered with DOR 100 mg twice‐daily. The doses of RPT were weight‐based and included 900 mg (≥ 50 kg) or 750 mg (32.1–49.9 kg) with a 900 mg maximum dose. Isoniazid was given as a 15 mg/kg dose and rounded up to the nearest 50 or 100 mg with a maximum dose of 900 mg. The doses and dosing schedule for RPT, INH, and pyridoxine were selected based on the CDC treatment regimens for LTBI.<xref rid="cts12810-bib-0004" ref-type="ref"><sup>4</sup></xref> Subjects received a light meal prior to each DOR dose for study days 1–4. For the morning of study days 7, 14, and 21, INH and pyridoxine were dosed following an overnight fast with DOR and RPT dosed after the subject received a meal. For days 8–13 and 15–20, subjects received a light meal before each dose of DOR. All subjects received 8 ounces of water with each dose.</p>

A predose sample was taken for all subjects prior to starting period 1 and DOR dosing to ensure no previous doses of DOR were taken. A DOR trough concentration was collected on study days 15, 16, and 20 prior to the administration of the second DOR dose. Approximately 3 mL of blood was collected into K2‐EDTA vials and inverted 8–10 times before being centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 10 minutes. Plasma was aliquoted into a cryotube and was stored at −20°C before analysis. Plasma DOR concentrations were determined using a validated ultra‐performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry with a lower limit of quantification of 1 ng/mL over a calibration range of 1–1,000 ng/mL (developed and validated by Syneos Health Clinique, Quebec, Canada).</p>

                <p>DOR in combination with RPT and INH was generally well‐tolerated with no serious adverse events. Adverse events were mild in intensity with 9 of 11 subjects (82%) reporting at least one adverse event. The most common adverse event throughout the study was intravenous catheter site pain and redness (45.5%) where blood sampling occurred. Nausea and vomiting were the most common reported adverse event (9%) during period 1 where DOR was dosed alone. During the second period where DOR was co‐administered with weekly RPT and INH, one subject (9%) reported dysuria following the second week of RPT and INH dosing. The same subject reported chills, headache, and a fever following the third week of dosing RPT and INH. These symptoms subsided and were resolved 2 days after the reported adverse event. All laboratory parameters were within normal limits during the course of the study.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>In patients infected with HIV and LTBI, the current therapeutic options include daily rifampin or rifabutin for 4 months or INH daily for 9 months. Although both INH and rifamycin‐based regimens are similarly effective in the treatment of LTBI in patients with HIV, patients are more likely to complete shorter and convenient regimens. Although RPT and INH affords a shorter duration and dosing frequency for treatment than INH monotherapy, drug interaction studies are infrequent to evaluate this regimen co‐administered with HIV ARV therapies.</p>
              <p>In this study, twice‐daily doses of DOR 100 mg dosed to steady‐state was selected based on nonparametric superposition predictions from a single dose drug interaction study with rifabutin.<xref rid="cts12810-bib-0006" ref-type="ref"><sup>6</sup></xref> Furthermore, DOR was generally well‐tolerated across multiple doses of up to 750 mg with robust antiviral activity at 200 mg once‐daily in patients with HIV‐1 with a terminal elimination half‐life of ~ 15 hours.<xref rid="cts12810-bib-0009" ref-type="ref"><sup>9</sup></xref>, <xref rid="cts12810-bib-0010" ref-type="ref"><sup>10</sup></xref> Therefore, a twice‐daily dosing regimen for 4 days was selected in the first period for several reasons: (a) given the safety profile of DOR reported previously, a 100 mg twice‐daily dose of DOR is expected to not be a safety concern, (b) it is expected that the 100 mg twice‐daily doses of DOR should obtain the same level of virological efficacy as seen with patients dosed 200 mg once‐daily, and (c) steady‐state exposure is expected within 3 days of dosing allowing steady‐state DOR concentrations to be sampled by the fourth study day in the first period.</p>
              <p>DOR is contraindicated when co‐administered with drugs that are strong CYP3A inducers. The current study evaluated the PKs of steady‐state DOR in the presence of RPT and INH. Once‐weekly doses of RPT and INH moderately reduced DOR steady‐state AUC<sub>0–12</sub> and C<sub>12</sub> following twice‐daily doses of 100 mg DOR in healthy volunteers. This reduction in exposure is reflected by the increase in DOR steady‐state clearance (8.4 L/hour vs. 5.9 L/hour) and a shortened half‐life (15.2 hours vs. 6.4 hours) in the presence of RPT and INH. RPT is a potent inducer of CYP450 metabolizing enzyme specifically impacting CYP3A4, CYP2C8, and CYP2C9 isoenzymes.<xref rid="cts12810-bib-0011" ref-type="ref"><sup>11</sup></xref> The potency of induction is 45% greater than rifabutin, with rifampin being the most potent of the anti‐TB rifamycins.<xref rid="cts12810-bib-0012" ref-type="ref"><sup>12</sup></xref> Therefore, this reduction in exposure with subsequent increase in DOR clearance was expected as seen in previous drug interaction studies, where rifampin and rifabutin co‐administration significantly reduced DOR trough values following once‐daily dosing.<xref rid="cts12810-bib-0005" ref-type="ref"><sup>5</sup></xref>, <xref rid="cts12810-bib-0006" ref-type="ref"><sup>6</sup></xref> This study reinforces the time‐dependent change in the metabolic induction capacity of once‐weekly RPT.

<bold>)</bold>, concentrations still remained 7.6‐fold above the values associated with maximal viral load reduction. Moreover, the nadir trough values seen at the second week of RPT and INH dosing were &gt; 50% of the values following a 25 mg dose in the patient population where the antiviral activity was comparable to the higher dose levels. Based on the strong correlation of DOR trough values in the exposure‐response relationship, trough concentrations seen in this study are within the ranges associated with a ≥ 80% proportion of individuals achieving HIV‐1 RNA copies of &lt; 50 copies/mL.<xref rid="cts12810-bib-0015" ref-type="ref"><sup>15</sup></xref>
</p>
              <p>It should be noted that a true nadir cannot be defined given the absence of trough collections on study days 17–19. Using the elimination rate and distribution volume of DOR in the presence of RPT observed in this study, trough values were predicted for study days 16–19 (<bold>Figure</bold>

<bold>)</bold>. The mean plasma trough concentrations at 12 and 24 hours was predicted to be 376.4 ng/mL suggesting that concentrations of DOR can be sustained above the IC<sub>50</sub> during a once weekly course of RPT. Although we observed a persistent reduction of up to 82% in DOR C<sub>12</sub> 6 days following the last dose of RPT, the time‐dependent metabolic induction is nonetheless similar to reports in literature that observed up to 2–4 days of maximal induction following RPT administration.<xref rid="cts12810-bib-0016" ref-type="ref"><sup>16</sup></xref>, <xref rid="cts12810-bib-0017" ref-type="ref"><sup>17</sup></xref>

              <p>There were minimal adverse events observed in this study. Compared with previous reports using this regimen in drug interaction studies with other HIV‐1 ARVs,<xref rid="cts12810-bib-0017" ref-type="ref"><sup>17</sup></xref> co‐administration of DOR with once‐weekly RPT and INH at maximum doses was well‐tolerated. The most common adverse event reported by 45.5% of subjects was intravenous catheter site pain and redness, which was unrelated to the study drugs. Only one female subject reported flu‐like symptoms, which included fever, chills, and headache after the second dose of RPT, INH, and DOR. This was anticipated, as a high incidence of flu‐like symptoms have been reported following high dose RPT and INH, particularly in older aged white women.<xref rid="cts12810-bib-0018" ref-type="ref"><sup>18</sup></xref> Furthermore, safety laboratory value trends were within the normal ranges throughout the entirety of the study.</p>
              <p>Several limitations should be noted. The study did not analyze the primary metabolite, M9, which is a direct result of CYP‐mediated oxidation. In the presence of an inducer, such as RPT and twice‐daily dosing of DOR, the exposure of M9 is expected to increase. The impact of the M9 metabolite on safety is unclear, as M9 is present as only 13% of parent dose, does not accumulate with repeated dosing, and does not have activity against HIV reverse transcriptase.<xref rid="cts12810-bib-0003" ref-type="ref"><sup>3</sup></xref> The study also enrolled mostly male participants (10 men vs. 1 woman). Although there was a sex imbalance in this study, sex does not impact the PKs of DOR.<xref rid="cts12810-bib-0015" ref-type="ref"><sup>15</sup></xref> Last, DOR trough concentrations were not collected for study days 17–19 during period 2 of the study. As such, a true nadir cannot be confirmed with certainty during that period where DOR was co‐administered with RPT and INH.</p>
              <p>In summary, once‐weekly oral RPT and INH moderately reduced the AUC<sub>0–12</sub> and C<sub>12</sub> of twice‐daily 100 mg DOR by 29% and 31%, respectively. This reduction, however, was within the trough values associated with virological efficacy seen in pivotal clinical studies. As a result, DOR 100 mg administered twice‐daily may be considered to mitigate the drug interaction effect of RPT where the modest reduction in DOR exposure is unlikely to be clinically relevant in a virally suppressed patient.</p>
