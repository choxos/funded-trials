                  <p id="P4">The use of a DR-CYS administered every 12 hours to patients with cystinosis is of great benefit to their quality of life and to important biomarkers of disease control, when studied in a prospective, controlled fashion.

          <body>
            <p id="P5">Nephropathic cystinosis (OMIM 219800; 219900) is an autosomal recessive, systemic disease caused by defective cystinosin transport of cystine out of the lysosome. Kidney failure is inevitable with the untreated disease, and multiple organ failures ensue over time as well if the disease is untreated after kidney transplantation. Immediate release cysteamine bitartrate<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> treatment is effective but difficult to use long term.</p>
            <p id="P6">A novel formulation of microspheronized, micro-encapsulated beads of cysteamine bitartrate was developed that allowed extended pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) such that twice daily administration was possible (delayed-release cysteamine bitartrate [DR-CYS]). A pilot study in 9 patients with cystinosis (data not shown) confirmed both the delayed release (T<sub>max</sub> = 2.78 ± 1.56 and 1.22 ± 0.51 hours for DR-CYS and immediate release cysteamine bitartrate, respectively) and a longer half-life (5.85 ± 2.89 and 1.90 ± 0.58 hours for DR-CYS and immediate release cysteamine bitartrate, respectively) for DR-CYS. In addition, in data not shown, a regression of the blood cysteamine area under the curve from 0–12 hours normalized by dose in milligram/kilogram for DR-CYS vs the area under the curve from 0–6 hours normalized by dose in milligram/kilogram for immediate release cysteamine bitartrate suggested a linear relationship with a slope of 1.4136. Thus, to achieve an equivalent exposure of cysteamine over a 12-hour dosing interval, a single dose of DR-CYS would have to be equal to 2/1.4136 = 1.4148 times a single dose of immediate release cysteamine bitartrate.</p>
            <p id="P7">Based initially on the observed PK and PD discussed, we demonstrated that in a randomized, controlled, cross-over study of 3 weeks duration in 41 patients with nephropathic cystinosis, DR-CYS (PROCYSBI, Raptor Pharmaceutical Inc, Novato, California), was not inferior to immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate (Castagon, Mylan Pharmaceuticals, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania), for control of white blood cell content of cystine (WBC [cystine]) (reported as nano-moles of ½ cystine/mg protein), a biomarker of the disease.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p>
            <p id="P8">However, in this short-term efficacy study of DR-CYS in nephropathic cystinosis, the ability to evaluate the effect on maintenance of optimal WBC (cystine), native kidney function, somatic growth, and the impact on quality of life was not present. Therefore, we designed an open-label, controlled, prospective study to answer these questions, and provide herein the data for 2 years of treatment.</p>
            <sec sec-type="methods" id="S5">
              <title>Methods</title>
              <p id="P9">Patients with nephropathic cystinosis, their native kidneys, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &gt;30 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> (&gt;0.5 mL/s/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>) who completed the short-term efficacy study noted above were eligible to enroll in this prospective study, and 40/41 of these patients did so after approval of the study by the ethics boards or institutional review boards of the institutions and signed consent from parents or adolescents and assent from minors according to institutional policies. Patients were seen monthly for the first 6 months of the study and quarterly thereafter. Clinical laboratory assessments (hematology, chemistry, urinalysis), physical examination (including basic neurologic and skin assessments) and vital signs, ECG, body weight, body mass index (BMI), body surface area, and an age-appropriate qualify of life questionnaire (Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory [PedsQL]) were made at each monthly and quarterly visit. During these visits, blood samples for PK (cysteamine) and PD (WBC [cystine]) were collected 0.5 hours after the DR-CYS dose administered at the study visit. Concomitant medications and adverse events (AEs) were collected from a written diary.</p>
              <p id="P10">Upon entering this study, the initial DR-CYS dose was the same as that used at the end of the short-term study. Subsequent DR-CYS dosing following each study visit was adjusted by each investigator based on their evaluation of interval WBC [cystine], and a clinically meaningful dosing change for purposes of this study was defined by a minimum of ±5% of the baseline dosage. This differentiated trivial changes in either direction based on changes in patient body mass alone.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="P22">Nephropathic cystinosis is a systemic disease that results in kidney failure at the end of the first decade of life when untreated,<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>–<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> or even when treatment is initiated after 5 years of age with immediate release cysteamine therapy.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> To date, the only studies evaluating such therapy in patients with the disorder have been observational and retrospective.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Such studies have suggested that immediate release cysteamine improves ultimate outcomes by reducing the frequency of hypothyroidism, diabetes, neuromuscular disorders, or death long-term.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Treatment before age 5 years may preserve kidney function in some patients.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Such outcomes may be linked to WBC [cystine] itself, a marker of disease control, but such observations have not rigorously controlled for this exposure.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> However, optimal control of the disease, a WBC [cystine] &lt;1 nmol ½ cystine/mg protein, has never been reported in a cohort of patients because of the inherent difficulties in having patients remain adherent to the every six hours regimen required for immediate release therapy to achieve such control.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p>
              <p id="P23">In contrast, we provide 2 years of data with optimal control of the disease under a controlled protocol and demonstrate that with DR-CYS, there was preservation of kidney function, stable somatic growth, and BMI. Importantly, quality of life improved in several subscales and in total function as patients switched to delayed release cysteamine compared with immediate release cysteamine, and these changes were maintained for the entire 24-month period. None of the other subscales were lower at the end of the study. In addition, we found no untoward side effects or safety concerns with DR-CYS and an overall slight decrease in overall AEs (data not reported).</p>
              <p id="P24">Two large series of patients have examined retrospectively the relationship between the age of treatment initiation with immediate release cysteamine therapy and subsequent kidney functional outcomes in nephropathic cystinosis.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> When used either before 2 years of age, and with a median WBC (cystine) ≤2 nmol ½ cystine/mg protein in 1 study (adequate treatment, representative of only 25.4% of the reported study population),<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> or when used before 5 years of age and with a mean WBC (cystine) ≤2 nmol ½ cystine/mg protein (representative of only 29.3% of the study population reported),<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> there was preservation of reduced kidney function. This attests to the inability to maintain optimal disease control with immediate-release cysteamine for most patients with nephropathic cystinosis, and that progressive chronic kidney disease is inevitable.</p>
              <p id="P25">We studied patients at a mean age and a similar level of reduced kidney function to those reported by Markello et al.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> In their study, the slope of the line describing subsequent years of kidney function in the ‘adequate treatment’ group was downward trending, but not as steep as those untreated or poorly treated. In distinction, in the current study using DR-CYS, we demonstrated that prospective, optimal control of disease activity (WBC [cystine] &lt; 1 nmol ½ cystine/mg protein) did not lead to a downward slope change in eGFR during the 2 years of treatment.</p>
              <p id="P26">What might account for the differences in outcomes of kidney function between immediate release cysteamine and DR-CYS? First, we targeted patients with an optimal level of disease control, and by having a prospective, controlled study protocol, could maintain our target values, rather than relying on observational data alone. In fact, our mean WBC [cystine] was always below 1 nmol ½ cystine/mg protein, and the patients reported in the retrospective study as using immediate release cysteamine and having ‘adequate treatment’ had a median value of≤2 nmol ½ cystine/mg protein, defining a population well above the levels we achieved.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Second, we would suggest that the adherence was superior with DR-CYS in our study compared with immediate-release cysteamine in observational studies, as we were able to maintain optimal disease control through measured WBC [cystine] at a lower dose of DR-CYS over time in the entire cohort. This likely is due to the ability to have the drug taken every 12 hours compared with the need to have every 6-hour dosing with immediate release cysteamine. Consistent with our hypothesis that increased adherence was an important component of outcome in our patients treated with DR-CYS for 2 years, are the additional observations we made of preservation of statural growth, stability of BMI, and improved measures of quality of life.</p>
              <p id="P27">Our study provided a new insight into the management of nephropathic cystinosis, based on the measurements of plasma [cysteamine]. Given the observation that 94.5% of measured WBC [cystine] values demonstrated optimal control (&lt;1 nmol ½ cystine/mg protein) when the plasma [cysteamine] was &gt;0.1 mg/L 0.5 hours after the DR-CYS dose, patients might have only plasma [cysteamine] measured in follow-up care. Importantly, this measure of plasma [cysteamine] does not reflect long-term drug adherence, but rather that the dose administered to the patient is sufficient for optimal disease control. Furthermore, until more data are available, we would suggest that such means of patient follow-up be limited to those having demonstrated optimal control for a period of time.</p>
              <p id="P28">Our study had limitations. We did not directly compare a 2-year treatment period between DR-CYS and immediate release cysteamine. This was purposeful, following the observation we made of noninferiority of DR-CYS compared with immediate release cysteamine for optimal disease control measured by WBC (cystine).<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> As has been well documented many times, patients in clinical trials may have outcomes based on higher adherence than in real world care. However, given the ability to dose every 12 hours and avoid a middle of the night dose required for immediate release cysteamine, real world adherence may more closely mimic that which we observed in the current study. Lastly, we studied only previously, optimally controlled patients under immediate release cysteamine therapy, which by historical record represents a minority of patients with nephropathic cystinosis. Current ongoing studies with DR-CYS in both treatment naïve patients and in those not optimally controlled patients with immediate release cysteamine will answer additional questions about the utility of DR-CYS in a broader population of patients with cystinosis. In addition, longer-term outcomes using DR-CYS should be done to obtain further evidence of the important effects we observed after 2 years of treatment.</p>
              <p id="P29">The blood level of WBC [cystine] maintained below 1 nmol ½ cystine/mg protein for 2 years is associated with preservation of native kidney function, stable statural growth, stable body mass, and improved quality of life. Although the longer-term consequences of DR-CYS use remain unknown at present, it is highly encouraging to suggest that increased adherence may result from this new therapeutic agent’s every 12 hour dosing regimen, and the improvements we documented on patient-centered quality of life measures.</p>
