                  <p id="Par1">Healthy Lifetime, a theoretically driven, personalized health coaching program delivered electronically, including face-to-face videoconferencing, was developed to intervene in early aging to stave off functional decline and minimize the onset/exacerbation of chronic conditions.</p>

                  <title>Objective</title>
                  <p id="Par2">To determine the efficacy of a theoretically driven, personalized health coaching program in participants 50Â years and older with one or more chronic conditions using a randomized, controlled, pragmatic clinical trial methodology.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par3">Participants were randomly assigned to the HL (<italic>n</italic>â=â59) or a usual care (<italic>n</italic>â=â63) group. The HL group received health coaching from a trained nurse over eight weeks. Outcomes were measured at baseline, eight weeks, and 20Â weeks (after the 12-week no-treatment phase). Regression modeling with fixed-effect repeated measures was used to account for the longitudinal data collection.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par4">For the HL group, <italic>health habits</italic> increased at 8Â weeks (3.1 units; SEâ=â1.0; <italic>p</italic>â=â.0005; effect sizeâ=â.15). This difference was sustained at 20Â weeks (2.4 units, SEâ=â0.2; <italic>p</italic>â=â.0005). <italic>Independent self-care agency</italic> improved at 8Â weeks in individuals with high blood pressure (13.5 units; SEâ=â4.37; <italic>p</italic>â=â.0023; effect sizeâ=â.3). However, that difference was not sustained at 20Â weeks (<italic>p</italic>â=â.47). No significant improvements were shown in the usual care group at 8Â weeks or 20Â weeks.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p id="Par5">HL participants significantly improved their health habits at 8Â weeks and sustained this improvement at week 20 (after a 12-week no-treatment phase) vs. the usual care group. Changing health habits alone has been shown to reduce all-cause morbidity and mortality in chronic disease. The high-functioning, community-dwelling older adults with chronic diseases we studied is an important target population for primary care practices to intervene early in aging to stave off the complications of chronic disease and functional decline.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par20">A significant and growing proportion of people seen in primary care practices are 50 and over with one or more chronic conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In addition to managing the disease process, primary care practices are challenged with health promotion to improve lifestyle habits in this population, as these significantly impact clinical outcomes in chronic diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. For example, there is abundant literature showing the effect of specific health habits on all-cause mortality and morbidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], such as inadequate exercise, sleep, poor food choices, use of alcohol, smoking, and the negative impact of socio-behavioral factors such as poor health-related quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Yet, a paucity of evidence-based approaches or programs are available to assist primary care practices in improving lifestyle and socio-behavioral factors.</p>
              <p id="Par21">Health coaching is an often-espoused method to assist adults in changing their lifestyle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], yet results across randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are highly variable. An integrative review published in 2010 yielded 15 peer-reviewed studies published between 1999â2008. Significant improvements in one or more health behaviors were identified in only six of the 15 studies [40%]. Intervention strategies described in the studies also varied, including goal setting [73%], the use of motivational interviewing [27%], and collaboration with health providers [20%]. In a more recent systematic review of health coaching RCTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], only one of six studies cited showed significant between-group effects after 40Â weeks of coaching [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Three studies cited in this review measured physical activity and showed no significant between-group results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In a 2023 systematic review and meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] examining the behavioral change techniques (BCTs) used in health coaching-based intervention for Type 2 Diabetes (T2DM), few BCTs were used in the interventions.</p>
              <p id="Par22">Inadequate, imprecise descriptions of interventions and the need for more theory-based methods were the main limitations of the studies reviewed. Behavior change techniques and coaching protocols need to be transparent and replicable to build the evidence base of effective health coaching interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Moreover, recent reviews of health coaching interventions found that telehealth technology improved accessibility, especially for older adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], and others have shown older adults' acceptance and facility of teleconferencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par23">Considering this literature and prior limitations in health coaching interventions, we developed a theoretically driven, nurse health coaching program incorporating specific BCT strategies accessible to a broad group of older adults using the videoconferencing eHealth methods called the Healthy Lifetime program. Our program's overall goal is to intervene in early aging when individuals have the best chance for more extended-term benefits of changing their health behavior, staving off functional decline, and delaying the onset or exacerbation of chronic conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par24">The principal aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of the Healthy Lifetime program using a randomized, controlled, pragmatic clinical trial methodology in participants 50Â years and older with one or more chronic conditions. This paper provides the findings of this recently completed pragmatic randomized trial. The theoretical framework, BCT strategies, and intervention protocol are previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p>

Survey measurements were taken at three-time points, baseline, at 8Â weeks (after the 8-week coaching intervention), and at 20Â weeks (after a 12-week no-treatment phase to determine the sustainability of outcomes). We employed a randomization sequence using Excel 2007 (Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA) with a 1:1 allocation using random block sizes of 2 and 4 by a blinded team member (statistician) to randomize participants to either the Healthy Lifetime (HL) coaching intervention or the usual care group.

To encourage gender, racial/ethnic, and economic diversity, we included direct mailings to Medicare and Medicare/Medicaid dual-eligible beneficiaries from the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services and to the Healthier Black Elders Centerâs (HBEC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] registry in Detroit, Michigan, which is part of the Michigan Center for Urban African American Aging Research. The study coordinator managed participant recruitment. Once a participant was screened and enrolled, another team member (project manager) assigned the participant to the group aligned with the randomization scheme. Because the intervention was delivered online, participants were blind to other participants. The study was conducted in a large Midwestern catchment area from October 2020 through December 2021.</p>

The HL intervention sessions with participants included the following: (1) an initial health and goal assessment survey completed online; (2) a review of the surveys by the nurse coach; (3) a two-way videoconference home assessment to determine environmental safety; (4) a narrative session to understand the participantâs health story; (5) a planning session with the nurse to understand the participantâs overall health goals and action planning; and (6) six weekly 30-min personalized sessions with the nurse coach.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Treatment process for Healthy Lifetime and Usual Care groups</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12875_2023_2162_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>
                <p id="Par29">The HL 8-week intervention focused on person-centered engagement, client empowerment, and cognitive-behavioral and narrative coaching approaches, with the overall communication approach based on motivational interviewing (MI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. As previously reported, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] specific BCT strategies were individualized and tailored to address each participant's unique driving and restraining forces for behavior change.

The survey was used for several purposes: to focus participants on their health and health-related goals, to provide participantsâ health background for the nurse coaches, to describe the sample, and to use some measures as independent or dependent variables in the analyses. Unless otherwise indicated, individual and composite scales that comprised the PHS survey were taken from the Self-Management Resource Center of Stanford University (SMRC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] with previously reported psychometric properties. We could not include biometric measures such as body weight, blood pressure, etc., because the study occurred during the lockdown phase of the COVID-19 pandemic when most participants were in quarantine and could not obtain in-home or clinic measurements from a health professional.</p>

                <p id="Par34">Descriptive statistics are reported using means and standard deviations for continuous variables and frequencies and percentages for categorical variables. To assess the impact of the HL intervention on participant outcomes, we performed regression modeling with fixed-effect repeated measures to account for the longitudinal data collection at baseline, eight weeks, and 20Â weeks. We used logistic regression for dichotomous outcomes and linear models with transformations as needed for continuous outcomes. The candidate variables for inclusion in the model are the demographic, descriptive, and outcome variables listed in Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. Covariates included age, race, gender, education level of income, and whether the participant had a partner. The primary variable of interest is the interaction between group and time. The parameter associated with this interaction indicates a change in trajectory over time between the HL group and the âusual careâ group. Also, two candidate effect modifiers â the number of medications taken, and high blood pressure (HBP) were included in a three-way interaction with group and time due to their potential to modify the effectiveness of the intervention. Hypertension was conceptualized as a measure of medical risk as it represented the dominant chronic disease. Health behavior plays a significant role in preventing and treating hypertension in our target population.</p>
                <p id="Par35">To prevent over-fitting and the small sample size relative to many predictors, we used a forward selection technique at an alpha level of 0.05.

Trajectories over time and interactions are reported. The statistical package used was SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC).

                <title>Principal results</title>
                <p id="Par43">The race, gender, and partner characteristics of our sample are not surprising as it has been reported that there is much higher participation in community centers and organizations by females than males [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] and that there is a shrinking rate of coupled relationships among people over 50 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. African-American men also continue to have substantially lower life expectancy than African-American women, White women, and White men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. The recruitment from the HBEC essentially yielded African-American women.</p>
                <p id="Par44">A graphic display of outcome variables (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) indicates improvement trends over time for <italic>both</italic> the HL and âusual careâ groups for functional impairment, independent self-care agency, goal-setting confidence, and confidence in medication taking. However, regression analyses showed no significant benefit of the HL program for these outcomes versus the âusual careâ condition, possibly because the latter included an opportunity to self-evaluate health through the PHS and health goal setting throughout the treatment and follow-up phases of the study. However, when we considered the influence of the dominant chronic disease in the model, which for the sample was HBP, the HBP subgroup demonstrated more significant improvement in the independent self-care agency at eight weeks than the âusual careâ group without HBP. This effect for the HL group was not seen at 20Â weeks. A similar outcome pattern was seen in an RCT of weekly health coaching for six months in TypeÂ 2Â DiabetesÂ Mellitus participants focused on increasing exercise and diet to reduce carbohydrate intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The intervention group achieved an accelerated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) reduction, leading to a significant between-group difference at three months; however, with no significant between-group differences in change of HbA1c at six months as the control group continued to improve with usual care.</p>
                <p id="Par45">As measured in this study, independent self-care agency relates to confidence in performing life activities independently, such as shopping, housework, and transportation, and managing aspects of chronic disease such as symptom âusual careâ and medications. Since the question set was designed to assess self-efficacy in managing a chronic illness, it is a more relevant assessment for the subgroup of people with a similar chronic disease. Our nurse coaching HL intervention focused on addressing and improving participantsâ confidence in managing their chronic condition and overall health; therefore, this improvement in self-efficacy for those with HBP is a promising benefit of the HL nurse coaching intervention.</p>
                <p id="Par46">Although the individual variables of activity, eating, and drinking showed improved trends over time, with higher trend values for the HL group, the individual regression results were insignificant. In contrast, the interaction of time and group effect of the composite variable outcome <italic>health habits</italic> was substantial. Given that the individual variable scales each had relatively few items, the composite variable <italic>health habits</italic>, which includes the total items among these variables, is a more robust measure of change as the number of items in a scale improves reliability when those items measure the same construct [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. The items comprising <italic>health habits</italic> directly align with the top two priority goals selected by the HL intervention and âusual careâ groups related to eating, weight loss, and exercise/activity, as displayed in Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>. This may relate to the split priorities of participants between the focus on behaviors associated with changing food and alcohol consumption and behaviors to change exercise/activity, reducing the overall participant effort and programâs effect for each.</p>
                <p id="Par47">In recent years, there has been a shift from addressing individual risk factors/behaviors toward addressing multiple risk factors such as smoking, body weight, alcohol consumption, and exercise/activity. A recently published large-scale population-based cohort study found that the lowest risk of all-cause cardiovascular or cancer-related mortality across physical activity and diet combinations is achieved with the blend of the highest levels of self-reported physical activity and highest diet quality score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Like our outcome measures, physical activity was hours/week, and diet quality was food types consumed rather than calories or biometric measurements such as body mass index. Our results indicate that measuring the total effect across several discrete risks provided the best evidence of participant effort and progress toward overall risk reduction and are commensurate with the best practice of incorporating multiple health behavior change interventions to maximize impact and cost-effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par48">Our HL program is delivered via videoconferencing technology (Zoom.com) with face-to-face nurse coaching, short-term (8Â weeks), and intensive (weekly sessions 30â90Â min) using specifically defined cognitive behavioral approaches in older adults with a range of chronic conditions. While others have shown more moderate satisfaction scores with the introduction of videoconferencing for clinical consultation with patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], our participant satisfaction rates were high across all five dimensions (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Noteworthy is the high satisfaction scores for nurse interaction. The two-way videoconferencing enhanced this, allowing âface-to-faceâ communication, which may have boosted satisfaction with the technology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par49">Moreover, we strove to standardize coaching methods and emulate the best health coaching practices. While our outcomes were designed with the anticipated functional decline of an aging population, the outcomes we demonstrated aligned with participantsâ self-identified goals regardless of health or functional status. The finding for the HBP subgroup is similar to that of others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] who found an accelerated improvement in the intervention group that was not observable at follow-up when control group outcomes matched the intervention group.</p>

                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p id="Par50">We used a âRisk of Biasâ assessment tool to retrospectively evaluate our study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. There were no deviations from the study protocol during implementation that could have introduced bias. Our final sample size rendered the study slightly underpowered from the preliminary estimate. Our recruitment methods produced a sample of high-functioning older adults, predominantly a race-balanced group of women with one or more chronic conditions. This limits generalizability to gender-diverse and more impaired populations. We also cannot conclude from this study the influence of the functional capacity of older adults on the ease of computer and video conferencing use â a relationship observed by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. An inclusion criterion for our study was having access to a computer and internet connectivity capable of video streaming to allow high-fidelity video conferencing. Thus, our inclusion criterion confounds the relationship to functional ability, for even our low-functioning participants met this computer/internet criterion. There is also the inevitable potential of participant response bias due to treatment expectations, as the group assignments were not blinded. Yet we found high satisfaction with the treatment phase among most participants regardless of group assignment, suggesting participants had similar treatment expectations. These limitations are the natural consequence of a pragmatic pilot trial such as ours, and more research is needed to replicate our results in a larger sample.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p id="Par51">Our primary conclusion is that a nurse health coaching program had essential health-related lifestyle benefits over and above usual care in a higher-functioning sample of community-based older adults with chronic diseases. This is an important target population for primary care practices as the goal is to intervene early in aging to stave off the complications of chronic disease and functional decline. Our sustained improvement in <italic>health habits</italic> is important because changing health habits alone has been shown to reduce all-cause morbidity and mortality in chronic diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. While we and others have shown that short-term benefits can be achieved in outcomes directly related to disease/condition, such as HbA1c or our outcome of independent self-care agency in HBP participants, the longer view on changing overall health habits for multifactor risk reduction may be the most critical target outcome regardless of disease or condition.</p>
              <p id="Par52">Further, our program uses specific theory-based strategies and methods that are replicable, unlike many previous studies in health coaching, and can be tested in other populations. It is delivered through accessible electronic methods with high participant satisfaction. Preserving the face-to-face component with videoconference technology may be most meaningful to older adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par53">Future studies should continue to address the standardization of videoconferencing health coaching methods, incorporating best practices with experimental designs that address âdoseâresponseâ in target populations. A greater understanding of the relationship between the underlying mechanisms of effective behavior change, such as the role of participant-driven goal setting and the face-to-face component, to the complexities of multifactorial outcome measurement is required to predict better the efficacy and service âdoseâ of health coaching in specified populations.</p>
