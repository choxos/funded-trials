              <abstract>
                <p>Although vitamin D deficiency is a common feature among patients presenting with active tuberculosis, the full scope of vitamin D action during <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<italic>Mtb</italic>) infection is poorly understood. As macrophages are the primary site of <italic>Mtb</italic> infection and are sites of vitamin D signaling, we have used these cells to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying modulation of the immune response by the hormonal form of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25D). We found that the virulent <italic>Mtb</italic> strain H37Rv elicits a broad host transcriptional response. Transcriptome profiling also revealed that the profile of target genes regulated by 1,25D is substantially altered by infection, and that 1,25D generally boosts infection-stimulated cytokine/chemokine responses. We further focused on the role of 1,25D- and infection-induced interleukin 1β (IL-1β) expression in response to infection. 1,25D enhanced IL-1β expression via a direct transcriptional mechanism. Secretion of IL-1β from infected cells required the NLRP3/caspase-1 inflammasome. The impact of IL-1β production was investigated in a novel model wherein infected macrophages were co-cultured with primary human small airway epithelial cells. Co-culture significantly prolonged survival of infected macrophages, and 1,25D/infection-induced IL-1β secretion from macrophages reduced mycobacterial burden by stimulating the anti-mycobacterial capacity of co-cultured lung epithelial cells. These effects were independent of 1,25D-stimulated autophagy in macrophages but dependent upon epithelial IL1R1 signaling and IL-1β-driven epithelial production of the antimicrobial peptide DEFB4/HBD2. These data provide evidence that the anti-microbial actions of vitamin D extend beyond the macrophage by modulating paracrine signaling, reinforcing its role in innate immune regulation in humans.</p>

                <title>Author Summary</title>
                <p>In 2010 there were ∼9 million cases of tuberculosis and 1.4 million deaths, representing the second largest cause of death worldwide and the leading cause of death from a curable disease. <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (<italic>Mtb</italic>) replicates within cells of the immune system called macrophages over an approximate 72 hour period, ultimately inducing cell death. Notably, macrophages are sites of vitamin D signaling, and there is broad evidence that vitamin D modulates macrophage responses to <italic>Mtb</italic>. Elevated levels of TB have long been associated with vitamin D deficiency, strongly suggesting that vitamin D supplementation may be of therapeutic benefit. In this study we profile the host macrophage response to <italic>Mtb</italic> infection through the use of high-throughput genomics techniques. From this we have discovered that the dominant function of vitamin D is the modulation of the levels of specific cytokines, mediators of immune cell to cell signaling. Of particular interest was the increase in IL-1β signaling, which we show to be directly regulated by vitamin D. We also show that this increase in IL-1β is critical for driving a signaling cascade between macrophages and lung epithelial cells leading to epithelial antimicrobial peptide production that helps to contain <italic>Mtb</italic> infection in our model culture system.</p>

              <p><italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<italic>Mtb</italic>) infects ∼2 billion people <xref rid="ppat.1003407-Dye1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> and active tuberculosis (TB) represents the leading cause of death from a curable disease <xref rid="ppat.1003407-Keeler1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. The typical <italic>Mtb</italic> life-cycle involves entry into the host via inhalation (exposure), survival and replication of bacteria in the lungs and associated lymph nodes where they resist host elimination (infection), and ultimately promotion of host immunopathology resulting in aerosol transmission via coughing to the next host (disease). While current treatments aim to control active disease or prevent progression from infection to disease, an attractive point of intervention would be at the transition from exposure to infection by enhancing innate pathogen control at the time of exposure.</p>
              <p>Innate immunity to <italic>Mtb</italic> infection is critical for determining disease outcome, and it has long been recognized that during TB outbreak investigations, only 30–50% of those with an equivalent exposure develop a productive infection, as demonstrated by a tuberculin skin-test conversion <xref rid="ppat.1003407-Marks1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. The primary site of <italic>Mtb</italic> infection is alveolar macrophages, which lie within the alveolar space, adjacent to the epithelial lining <xref rid="ppat.1003407-Holt1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Lung epithelial cells are generally not considered part of the innate immune responses to <italic>Mtb</italic> infection. However, they represent both a physical and an immunological barrier to infection by contributing to the maintenance of mucosal integrity, promoting phagocytosis, and producing several antimicrobial peptides, vanguards of innate immune responses to infection <xref rid="ppat.1003407-Holt1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003407-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. For example, antimicrobial peptide (AMP) DEFB4/HBD2 is expressed in upper airway epithelial cells, is inducible by interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and has been detected in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from normal healthy humans <xref rid="ppat.1003407-Singh1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. It has been shown to have direct antimicrobial activity against <italic>Mtb</italic> and drug-resistant <italic>Mtb</italic>
<xref rid="ppat.1003407-CorralesGarcia1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p>
              <p>IL-1β is critical for host resistance to <italic>Mtb</italic> infection, demonstrated by the substantially reduced survival of IL-1β−/− or IL1R−/− mice after infection <xref rid="ppat.1003407-MayerBarber1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003407-Fremond1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003407-Juffermans1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003407-Yamada1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Caspase-1 cleaves a precursor of IL-1β to generate its active form. Catalytically active caspase-1 binds to the apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC) subunit of inflammasomes, multiprotein complexes containing pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which detect infection by pathogens or cellular stress. A number of PRRs have been implicated in the detection of intracellular pathogens, and the resulting IL-1β secretory response. For example, AIM2 is a cytoplasmic sensor for double stranded DNA (dsDNA) and has recently been implicated as a component of the caspase-1 inflammasome in cells infected with viral and intracellular bacterial pathogens <xref rid="ppat.1003407-Hornung1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003407-Tsuchiya1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003407-Warren1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003407-FernandesAlnemri1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003407-Rathinam1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Similarly, NOD2 is a cytoplasmic sensor for muramyl dipeptide <xref rid="ppat.1003407-Coulombe1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, which stimulates NF-κB signaling to induce IL-1β expression <xref rid="ppat.1003407-Ogura1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, plays an important role in immunity against <italic>Mtb</italic>
<xref rid="ppat.1003407-Divangahi1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, and associates with the NALP1-containing inflammasome <xref rid="ppat.1003407-Hsu1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Lastly, the NLRP3 pattern recognition receptor is activated by a wide range of signals <xref rid="ppat.1003407-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. It is of particular importance for IL-1β secretion from macrophages after infection with <italic>Mycobacteria marinum</italic> (<italic>M. marinum</italic>) <xref rid="ppat.1003407-Koo1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> and <italic>Mtb</italic>
<xref rid="ppat.1003407-TeKippe1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.</p>
              <p>Given the critical role of innate immunity in initiating an effective response to <italic>Mtb</italic> infection, we determined in detail the host macrophage transcriptomic and cytokine responses to virulent H37Rv infection and modulation of this response by the hormonal form of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25D). Historically, there is a correlation between vitamin D deficiency and TB susceptibility <xref rid="ppat.1003407-Masten1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003407-White1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Epidemiologic studies have documented a higher occurrence of active TB during winter months when sunlight exposure is reduced <xref rid="ppat.1003407-Chan1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> and vitamin D deficiency has been identified as a common feature of patients with active TB <xref rid="ppat.1003407-Davies1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003407-SitaLumsden1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003407-Nnoaham1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. However, the mechanisms underlying vitamin D signaling and control of <italic>Mtb</italic> infection are not well understood. 1,25D synthesis is induced in macrophages and dendritic cells upon exposure to pathogen, and the 1,25D-bound vitamin D receptor (VDR) directly induces transcription of genes encoding AMPs DEFB4/HBD2 and cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide (CAMP) <xref rid="ppat.1003407-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003407-Gombart1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003407-Wang2" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003407-White2" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003407-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003407-Szeles1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, both of which have demonstrated anti-mycobacterial activity <xref rid="ppat.1003407-Kisich1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003407-Martineau1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Despite this, the direct effects of 1,25D on <italic>Mtb</italic> bacterial burden in infected macrophages have been modest <xref rid="ppat.1003407-Campbell1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003407-Liu2" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, posing the question of whether these findings alone could account for the clinical and epidemiological observations, if they are indeed causally associated.</p>
              <p>Here, we show that one of the primary macrophage responses to <italic>Mtb</italic> infection is a broad cytokine/chemokine response, which is generally enhanced by 1,25D. Importantly, 1,25D directly stimulates <italic>IL1B</italic> gene transcription, a critical component of the macrophage response to <italic>Mtb</italic> infection <xref rid="ppat.1003407-Master1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. As this mechanism of <italic>IL1B</italic> regulation was not conserved in mice, we developed a co-culture system between macrophages and primary small airway lung epithelial cells to model the effects of elevated IL-1β secretion. In these co-culture experiments, 1,25D potentiated IL-1β signaling from macrophages resulting in the secretion of DEFB4 from primary lung epithelial cells. Taken together these results suggest that the effects of 1,25D extend beyond the macrophage and involve the modulation of paracrine signaling to enhance the innate immune responses to <italic>Mtb</italic> infection.</p>

                <p>In order to understand the host macrophage transcriptional response to <italic>Mtb</italic> infection, we performed expression profiling studies in PMA-differentiated human THP-1 macrophage cells. Cells were infected with virulent <italic>Mtb</italic> strain H37Rv (I) or left uninfected (NI), and treated with vehicle (DMSO) or 100 nM 1,25D (+D) for 24 hours. 1,25D treatment of <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected macrophages produced broad changes in mRNA profiles (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003407.s007">Table S1</xref></bold>), in which expression of 328 genes was altered at least 5-fold by either infection or 1,25D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003407-g001"><bold>Figure 1A</bold></xref>
<bold>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003407.s008">Table S2</xref></bold>). A heat map of highly induced transcripts identified three major groups of genes: those that were regulated by 1,25D in uninfected cells, but not in infected cells (group 1), those that were regulated in the same direction in infected cells treated with vehicle or 1,25D (group 2), and those that were regulated in infected cells in either the vehicle or 1,25D treated condition, but not both (group 3). From this it is clear that about half of all 1,25D target genes in uninfected macrophages (NI+D) are not regulated in infected cells, as they do not belong to group 1. Infection resulted in broad changes in transcription, which substantially changed the cohort of genes regulated by 1,25D, indicated by group 3, and the columns that change in intensity in group 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003407-g001"><bold>Figure 1A</bold></xref>).</p>

                <p>To understand the dominant effects of 1,25D in <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected macrophages, the 328 genes regulated more than 5-fold by infection were filtered to retain those whose expression was altered at least a further 1.5-fold by 1,25D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003407-g001"><bold>Figure 1B</bold></xref>).

                <p>Previous <italic>in silico</italic> studies <xref rid="ppat.1003407-Wang3" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref> identified a promoter-proximal sequence corresponding to a consensus vitamin D response element (VDRE) in the <italic>IL1B</italic> gene (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003407.s001">Fig. S1</xref></bold>). To further investigate the mechanisms of <italic>IL1B</italic> gene expression by 1,25D, we evaluated the VDR binding to this element by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay. VDR binding was 1,25D-dependent, and significantly enhanced by infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003407-g002"><bold>Figure 2F</bold></xref>). 1,25D-dependent binding of the VDR may be due in part to its elevated expression, which was stimulated by 1,25D (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003407.s002">Figure S2</xref></bold>), consistent with the <italic>VDR</italic> being a 1,25D target gene <xref rid="ppat.1003407-Zella1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>.

Catalytically active caspase-1 is a component of inflammasomes, of which ASC is a core component. We found that while the 23 kD form of ASC was predominant in THP-1 cells, the 20 kD splice variant <xref rid="ppat.1003407-Bryan1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003407-Matsushita1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref> coimmunoprecipitated with caspase-1, an association only seen in infected cells and found to be slightly higher in infected cells treated with 1,25D, consistent with elevated cytosolic caspase-1 activity under these conditions (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003407.s005">Figure S5C</xref></bold>).

IL-1β induces expression of genes encoding AMPs in epithelial cells through its capacity to stimulate the activity of transcription factor, NF-κB, leading to secretion of antimicrobial proteins <xref rid="ppat.1003407-Liu3" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003407-Xia1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. Thus, to understand the potential crosstalk between alveolar macrophages and the human respiratory epithelial surface, we conducted a series of experiments using an <italic>in vitro</italic> co-culture system between macrophages and human primary cultures of non-polarized small airway epithelial cells (SAECs) from multiple donors. In cultures of SAECs alone, recombinant IL-1β induced expression of the gene encoding DEFB4, while 1,25D had no significant effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003407-g004"><bold>Figure 4A</bold></xref>).

In addition, as IL-1β has been shown to induce NF-κB signaling through IL1R1 <xref rid="ppat.1003407-Xia1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>, we investigated the expression of NF-κB target gene <italic>DEFB4</italic>

                <p>Next, to model the consequences of the real-time interaction between infected macrophages and the alveolar epithelia during the initial round of infection, we established a transwell co-culture system between <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected macrophages and SAECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003407-g005"><bold>Figure 5A</bold></xref>). Macrophages were infected with <italic>Mtb</italic> for 4 hours and washed extensively to eliminate any remaining extracellular mycobacteria. A transwell bucket containing co-cultured lung epithelial cells was then added to the tissue culture plate containing the infected macrophages. The two cell populations were separated by a 0.4 µm filter to allow for the exchange of secreted proteins but prevent migration of mycobacteria. Note that in control experiments no mycobacteria were detected in the transwell bucket 4 days after infection (data not shown). Co-culture of macrophages infected at an multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5 with SAECs dramatically extended macrophage cell survival at three days post-infection, as measured by cytoplasmic lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003407-g005"><bold>Figure 5B</bold></xref>), a marker of plasma-membrane compromise and necrosis. After 3 days of infection, the relative amount of LDH release was comparable to that seen 24 hours after infection under macrophage-only conditions. 1,25D treatment had no effect on the survival of infected cells cultured in the absence or presence of SAECs. When macrophages infected at an MOI of 10 were co-cultured with SAECs, LDH release was slightly higher, but a similar protective effect of SAECs was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003407-g005"><bold>Figure 5B</bold></xref>). The protective benefit of the SAECs in co-culture was also clear by the relative amount of adherent cells remaining as visualized by phase-contrast microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003407-g005"><bold>Figure 5C</bold></xref>); most of the macrophages co-cultured with SAECs were still adherent, whereas infected macrophages cultured in the absence of SAECs had detached from the plate.</p>

                <p>To determine any effects of co-culturing with and without 1,25D on mycobacterial burden, colony forming unit (CFU) assays were performed with cells co-cultured as above. We determined changes in total <italic>Mtb</italic> burden after 72 hours of infection. The addition of SAECs resulted in a halving of mycobacterial burden at this time point, and addition of 1,25D to the co-culture system produced a further significant reduction in mycobacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003407-g006"><bold>Figure 6A</bold></xref>). To confirm the contribution of epithelial signaling by infection- and 1,25D-induced IL-1β towards the reduction in mycobacterial burden, we knocked down IL1R1 receptor expression in SAECs 36 hours prior to their co-culture. Control experiments showed that expression of epithelial IL1R1 was reduced for at least 72 hours after siRNA-mediated knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003407-g006"><bold>Figure 6B</bold></xref>). Mycobacterial burden was sharply elevated 72 hours after infection in the absence or presence of 1,25D when macrophages were co-cultured with IL1R1-depleted SAECs. In contrast, co-culture of SAECs transfected with control siRNAs eliminated net mycobacterial growth in the presence of 1,25D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003407-g006"><bold>Figure 6C</bold></xref>), consistent with experiments described above. To determine if epithelial secretion of DEFB4 was responsible for the increased control of mycobacterial proliferation, we transfected SAECs with either siRNA against <italic>IL1R1</italic> or <italic>DEFB4</italic> transcripts 36 hours prior to their co-culture with infected macrophages.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>In this study we have presented the first large scale microarray profile to determine the host macrophage transcriptomic responses to <italic>Mtb</italic> infection and the effect of 1,25D on those responses. Analysis of this data demonstrated that infection markedly changed the profile of genes regulated by 1,25D. ChIP studies also revealed that infection enhances DNA binding by the VDR. These data suggest infection induces large-scale changes in chromatin that modify the availability of VDREs for binding by the VDR throughout the genome. Additionally, it is clear from this work that studies of 1,25D target genes in uninfected macrophages are not an accurate depiction of its contribution to host responses in the face of an active infection. A potential limitation of this study was our initial use of THP-1 cells for microarray analysis of target genes. As this is cell line is derived from a monocytic leukemia, not all of the genes identified as being regulated may be found under similar experimental conditions using primary human alveolar macrophages.</p>
              <p>Pathways analysis of genes differentially regulated by 1,25D in infected THP-1 cells revealed that the dominant function of 1,25D in the context of the innate immune response to <italic>Mtb</italic> is the up-regulation of specific components of the broad cytokine response induced by infection. Previous computational analysis identified VDREs proximal to the <italic>IL1B</italic>, <italic>CCL3</italic>, <italic>CCL4</italic>, <italic>CCL8</italic> genes, but not <italic>IL-8</italic> or <italic>TNF-a</italic>
<xref rid="ppat.1003407-Wang3" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Probing 1,25D modulation of these cytokines <italic>in vivo</italic> is complicated by our results showing that these VDREs are not conserved in mouse, rabbit, or guinea pig (this paper and Verway et al, manuscript in preparation), the model organisms typically used to study <italic>Mtb</italic> infection. Despite the fact that IL-1β signaling also is critical for innate immune responses to <italic>Mtb</italic> in these animal models, it would appear that they would not be appropriate for <italic>in vivo</italic> modeling of the modulatory effects of vitamin D on the early innate immune responses to infection.</p>
              <p>1,25D markedly enhanced mRNA levels and secretion of IL-1β in <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected macrophages. Our data reveal that 1,25D is acting primarily at the level of <italic>IL1B</italic> gene transcription without affecting the levels of inflammasome, as substantial levels of pro-IL-1β were seen in uninfected macrophages after 1,25D treatment, whereas secretion required infection. Furthermore, of the cytokines whose secretion was elevated by 1,25D treatment after infection (CCL3, CCL4, CCL8, IL-8, and TNF-α), treatment did not induce their secretion from uninfected cells. This would suggest that 1,25D is acting to prime and potentiate inflammatory innate immune responses, without inducing any unwanted inflammation in a resting state.</p>
              <p>IL-1β and IL1R1 are essential for survival in mouse models of <italic>Mtb</italic> infection <xref rid="ppat.1003407-MayerBarber1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003407-Fremond1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003407-Juffermans1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003407-Yamada1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. IL-1β is also of critical importance during the early stages of infection as shown by <italic>in vitro</italic> infections using macrophages from these knockout mice <xref rid="ppat.1003407-Yamada1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Additionally, it has been demonstrated that <italic>Mtb</italic> expresses <italic>zmp1</italic>, a metalloproteinase that prevents phagolysosomal maturation by inhibiting inflammasome-mediated IL-1β cleavage, a mechanism of virulence that suppresses the host response <xref rid="ppat.1003407-Master1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. siRNA-mediated knockdowns of various inflammasome sensors demonstrated that the NLRP3 inflammasome is responsible for IL-1β secretion under all conditions, in agreement with previously published data looking at mycobacterial infection in mouse and human macrophages <xref rid="ppat.1003407-Koo1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003407-TeKippe1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. While mouse genetic models have revealed that IL-1β signaling plays a key role in <italic>Mtb</italic> resistance, <italic>nlrp3</italic>−/− and <italic>casp1</italic>−/− mice showed no deficiency in the production of IL-1β, control of bacterial burden, or survival <xref rid="ppat.1003407-TeKippe1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Even though ASC was important in this model, this may be because ASC-null mice are deficient in antigen presentation and DC trafficking due to a loss of Dock2 expression <xref rid="ppat.1003407-Ippagunta1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. It is therefore unclear at this time whether the NLRP3 inflammasome is required <italic>in vivo</italic> for control of <italic>Mtb</italic> infection.</p>
              <p>Previous studies on the role of IL-1β in the innate immune response to infection have focused on its capacity to control infection by autocrine signaling from infected macrophages. While epithelial cells are known to have important immunologic function in other diseases and contexts <xref rid="ppat.1003407-Holt1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003407-Kolls1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003407-Abreu1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>, they are usually not considered to be an important part of the innate immune response to <italic>Mtb</italic> infection. Primary upper respiratory epithelial cells express DEFB4 in response to IL-1β stimulation <italic>in vitro</italic>
<xref rid="ppat.1003407-Singh1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Our data demonstrate that the IL-1β secreted from infected macrophages has the capacity to elicit an antimycobacterial response from small airway epithelial cells. Importantly, siRNA-mediated knockdown of epithelial IL1R1 or DEFB4 expression significantly negated the control of <italic>Mtb</italic> growth in co-cultured macrophages. Modeling of these findings <italic>in vivo</italic> will be necessary to fully understand the extent of the contribution of epithelial cells to the innate immune response in this context. Doing so in primates would pose a major undertaking, and it would be difficult to assess the contribution of the reciprocal signaling cascade between alveolar macrophages and epithelial cells in such a model, as it would likely occur in the acute response to a very low dose exposure.</p>
              <p>Macrophage-epithelial cell co-culture controls mycobacterial burden but did not induce autophagy, and epithelial knockdown of IL1R1 expression negated any protective benefit. Taken together, our data suggest that paracrine secretion of DEFB4 from epithelial cells provides a more substantial level of protection against infection than DEFB4 production by macrophages. Previous studies have provided evidence for a reduction in bacterial burden when <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected macrophages are treated with 1,25D <italic>in vitro</italic>
<xref rid="ppat.1003407-Campbell1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003407-Liu2" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. We find that this effect is limited, and that bacterial burden is elevated 3 days after infection with virulent <italic>Mtb</italic>, representing a failure to control the infection. From this study it is clear that more complete models of the innate immune response are required to understand the full effect of 1,25D.</p>
              <p>Correlations between vitamin D deficiency and a higher incidence of TB have repeatedly been observed <xref rid="ppat.1003407-Davies1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003407-SitaLumsden1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003407-Nnoaham1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Clinical trials did not reveal a substantial benefit of vitamin D in the treatment of active disease <xref rid="ppat.1003407-Martineau2" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003407-Martineau3" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>, although a recent study showed that vitamin D supplementation accelerated the resolution of inflammatory responses during treatment for <italic>Mtb</italic> disease <xref rid="ppat.1003407-Coussens1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>. Our results would suggest that the optimal point of treatment would be vitamin D supplementation to bolster innate responses and prevent infection. Such a program would be economically viable considering the negligible cost of vitamin D supplementation as compared to antibiotic chemotherapy, and a useful prophylactic measure against drug-resistant tuberculosis. Our mechanistic data supports the idea that serum levels of vitamin D may be causally important for defense against <italic>Mtb</italic> exposure, but clinical trials would be required to understand this.</p>
