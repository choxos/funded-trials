                  <p>There is a lack of consensus on what is the most appropriate treatment of moderate
acute malnutrition (MAM).</p>

                  <title>Objectives</title>
                  <p>We aimed to determine if provision of ready-to-use-therapeutic food (RUTF) and
antibiotics to “high-risk” MAM (HR-MAM) children in addition to nutritional counseling
would result in higher recovery and less deterioration than nutrition counseling
alone.</p>

                <sec id="abs3">
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>At the 11 intervention clinics, HR-MAM children were given RUTF and amoxicillin along
with standard nutrition counseling, for 2–12 wk. All others received 6 wk of nutrition
counseling alone. HR-MAM was defined as midupper arm circumference (MUAC) &lt;11.9 cm,
weight-for-age <italic toggle="yes">z</italic> score (WAZ) &lt;−3.5, mother not the main caregiver,
or a child &lt;2 y old not being breastfed. Outcomes were compared using
intention-to-treat analysis.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="abs4">
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Analysis included 573 children at the intervention sites and 714 children at the
control sites. Of the intervention group, 317 (55%) were classified as HR-MAM.
Short-term recovery was greater at the intervention sites [48% compared with 39% at week
12; risk difference (rd): 0.08; 95% CI: 0.03, 0.13]. The intervention group had lower
risk of deteriorating to severe acute malnutrition (SAM) (18% compared with 24%; rd:
−0.07; 95% CI: −0.11, −0.04), lower risk of dying (1.8% compared with 3.1%; rd: −0.02;
95% CI: −0.03, −0.00), and greater gains in MUAC and weight than did children at the
control sites. However, by 24 wk, the risk of SAM was similar between the 2 arms (31%
compared with 34%; rd: −0.03; 95% CI: −0.09, 0.02). Control group data identified recent
illness, MUAC &lt;12.0 cm, WAZ &lt;−3, dropping anthropometry, age &lt;12 mo, being a
twin, and a history of previous SAM as risk factors for deterioration.</p>

                  <p>Provision of RUTF and antibiotics to HR-MAM children improved short-term recovery and
reduced short-term risk of deterioration. However, recovery rates were still suboptimal

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Worldwide, wasting affects ∼50 million children each year; however, only 20% of these
receive supplementary feeding (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Wasting encompasses a continuum, including severe
acute malnutrition (SAM) and moderate acute malnutrition (MAM). MAM is defined as a
weight-for-length <italic toggle="yes">z</italic> score (WLZ) between −2 and −3 SD or a midupper arm
circumference (MUAC) between 11.5 and 12.4 cm, without edema (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Children with MAM are at higher risk of death, disability,
infectious illnesses, and deterioration to SAM than healthy children, and those that survive
may have lifelong consequences (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). The COVID-19
pandemic has heightened the urgency to reduce wasting and its secondary impacts (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Whereas there is normative guidance on how best to
treat children with SAM (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), there is currently no
consistent guidance on how best to manage children with MAM. The WHO has therefore called
for more evidence in order to inform feasible and cost-effective guidelines for achieving
sustained recovery for children with MAM (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p>
              <p>Although the difference between MAM and SAM can be as arbitrary as 1 mm in arm
circumference, the approaches to treatment differ greatly. SAM is treated with a high-energy
ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF), whereas MAM is often not treated at all or treated
with a variety of approaches including nutrition counseling or 1 of various supplementary
food products. Neither counseling nor supplementary feeding programs (SFPs) have
demonstrated acceptable recovery rates (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). A recent systematic review found only 11 articles
comparing food supplementation with either nutrition counseling, micronutrient supplements,
or no treatment, highlighting the paucity of evidence on this topic (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p>
              <p>There is also growing recognition that treatment should target those at highest risk of
death and deterioration (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Recent trials have
aligned the treatment of SAM and MAM by using RUTF as a single food product and suggest this
could increase coverage, improve recovery, and simplify supply chains (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12–14</xref>). However, providing RUTF to all wasted children,
both severe and moderate, would be costly and thus difficult to implement at scale.</p>
              <p>Our study aimed to inform wasting policy and programs by testing a treatment approach which
divides MAM into high- and low-risk populations, and aligns treatment of high-risk MAM with
that of SAM. This clinical trial hypothesized that provision of RUTF and amoxicillin to
high-risk MAM children in addition to counseling would result in higher recovery and less
deterioration than the standard practice of nutrition counseling alone.</p>
            </sec>
            <sec sec-type="methods" id="sec2">
              <title>Methods</title>
              <p>This was a cluster-randomized controlled clinical trial (NCT03647150) of 22 community
nutrition clinics in Pujehun District, Sierra Leone. National data from Sierra Leone
estimate that 9% of children &lt;5 y old are wasted (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). The primary outcome was nutritional status 12 wk after enrollment. Each child
was categorized as having <italic toggle="yes">1</italic>) recovered from MAM, defined as MUAC ≥12.5 cm;
<italic toggle="yes">2</italic>) remained with MAM; <italic toggle="yes">3</italic>) deteriorated to SAM or died; or
<italic toggle="yes">4</italic>) been lost to follow-up. Secondary outcomes were reports of recent
illness (rash, fever, cough, or diarrhea), weight gain, MUAC gain, subcutaneous body fat,
and fat mass distribution (ratio of trunk to peripheral subcutaneous fat). These outcomes
were also assessed at 6 and 24 wk after enrollment, including the possibility of relapse in
children who had recovered.</p>
              <p>A secondary analysis to determine characteristics associated with deterioration (died or
developed SAM) was conducted using data from control sites only. The risk factors considered
included those used to define high-risk in this study, as well as other anthropometric and
demographic characteristics at admission which could plausibly be linked with a poor
outcome.</p>
              <p>Estimated sample size a priori was ∼800 children with MAM across 20 clusters (clinics).
This was adequate for detecting, at 80% power and 5% significance level, a difference in
anthropometric recovery rates in the high-risk group from 53% at the control sites to 73% at
the intervention sites. This estimation was based on recovery rates for MAM children in
Ethiopia who received no support (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) and SFP MAM
recovery rates in Sierra Leone. An intracluster correlation coefficient of 0.05 was assumed,
a conservative estimate based on the results of a previous cluster-randomized study testing
an integrated SAM protocol in Sierra Leone (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p>
              <p>The 22 clinics were those with the highest attendance in the previous MAM treatment
program. The clinics were a minimum of 7 km apart to limit selection bias between
participants at each clinic site. The clinic sites were then randomly allocated to either
the intervention or the control group, using a spreadsheet-based random number generator
(Excel, Microsoft). By design, the intervention was not blinded, because the clinic staff
needed to follow the protocol and the caretakers knew whether they received food for their
children. The principal investigator and first author were blinded to the allocation group
until the point of primary data analysis, in order to maintain objectivity in data
management.</p>

                <p>All children aged 6–59 mo with uncomplicated MAM were eligible for enrollment at study
clinics. Uncomplicated MAM was defined as MUAC ≥11.5 and &lt;12.5 cm without edema or
clinical complications (dehydration, respiratory distress, altered mental status, fever,
or a visible sign of developmental delay). Children were screened from those presenting at
biweekly nutrition clinics, many of which were referred to the clinic by community health
workers doing MUAC screening; self-referral was also possible. Children who were
identified as having SAM based on MUAC &lt;11.5 cm or WLZ &lt;−3 at baseline were excluded
and treated outside of the study. Any that developed SAM while in the study were referred
for SAM treatment but still followed to assess later outcomes. Children were excluded if
they were involved in another research trial or feeding program or their caretakers
reported an allergy to peanut or milk. Children who defaulted on treatment or missed
follow-up visits were still eligible for inclusion at later follow-ups. Caregivers
provided written and oral informed consent; the decision to participate in the research
did not affect the care received by the child.</p>

                <p>At the intervention sites, enrolled children were classified as high-risk (HR-MAM) or
low-risk MAM (LR-MAM). Criteria for defining HR-MAM were derived from characteristics
associated with failed treatment in MAM SFPs in Sierra Leone (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16–18</xref>). HR-MAM was defined as having ≥1 of the following
criteria: MUAC &lt;11.9 cm, weight-for-age <italic toggle="yes">z</italic> score (WAZ) &lt;−3.5, mother
not the primary caregiver, or a child under the age of 2 y not being breastfed (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). At intervention sites, children classified as
HR-MAM were provided with 1 daily packet of RUTF (92 g, 520 kcal) and a 7-d course of
amoxicillin (40–45 mg/kg per dose twice daily) (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). RUTF was provided until an
MUAC &gt;12.4 cm was achieved. All children (at both control and intervention sites) were
offered nutrition counseling via mother support groups.</p>
                <p>At all clinic visits, weight, length, MUAC, and skinfold thickness were measured using
standard WHO clinical procedures (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), including
double measurement of MUAC and skinfold thickness, and triple measurement of length. SECA
digital weighing scales were used (SECA Ltd.). To assess trunk body fat and fat
distribution, skinfold thickness was measured at the subscapular and triceps positions
using Tanner/Whitehouse calipers (Holtain Ltd.). Food insecurity was assessed using the
Food Insecurity Experience Scale (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>).</p>
                <p>Children attended clinic fortnightly until treatment was completed and then returned for
follow-up at 12 and 24 wk after enrollment. Caretakers participated in biweekly mother
support groups delivered by a community respected elder for a total of 4 sessions using a
curriculum adapted from the Ministry of Health and Sanitation. This curriculum included
optimizing infant and young child feeding, a cooking demonstration, lessons on hygiene and
sanitation, health care seeking, child development (UNICEF), and training on MUAC for
mothers (ALIMA). The mother support groups are an established program which have shown a
5% increase in recovery from acute malnutrition (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). All children were assessed at the biweekly mother support group meetings to
detect anthropometric deterioration or acute illness. If a child was found to have SAM,
they were provided with RUTF. A questionnaire was administered to a random 10% subset of
participants to ascertain attendance, opinions on the counseling intervention, and
compliance to the RUTF dose where applicable. Basic cost differences between the treatment
arms were also considered. Further detail on the treatment procedures can be found in the
study protocol (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p>

                <p>Data were double-entered into secure computer databases from paper forms. WLZ, WAZ, and
length-for-age (LAZ) <italic toggle="yes">z</italic> scores were calculated using WHO 2006 growth
standards with Stata's zscore06 package (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,
<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Analysis of outcomes was conducted at the
individual level using a modified intention-to-treat analysis, with adjustment for
clustering by clinic. Children were only excluded from analysis if <italic toggle="yes">1</italic>)
they did not meet eligibility criteria, <italic toggle="yes">2</italic>) they changed their clinic
location and thus allocation group, <italic toggle="yes">3</italic>) their risk category was
incorrectly assigned, or <italic toggle="yes">4</italic>) their data card was lost. No imputation of
missing data was made. Weight gain was calculated as grams per kilogram per day. Logistic
regression analyses were conducted to estimate risk differences for categorical outcomes
and linear regression analyses for mean differences for continuous outcomes between study
arms. Logistic regression was used to calculate the OR for potential characteristics
associated with deterioration during treatment in the control group only. Adjusted
analyses included age and sex in the model, selected a priori; all analyses accounted for
clustering by clinic site. Venn diagrams were also used to explore the sensitivity and
specificity of different combinations of risk factors for detecting high-risk children at
admission. Analysis was conducted using Stata IC version 13.1 (StataCorp LP, 2013).</p>

presenting with SAM at control clinics than at intervention clinics (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Boys were more likely to be classified as HR-MAM than girls
owing to greater stunting among boys and therefore a lower WAZ. Among those enrolled, 30.8%
reported having SAM previously. Recent morbidity (defined as fever, diarrhea, rash, or cough
in the previous 2 wk) was common in all groups (43%).</p>

              <p>In a subset of participants surveyed, we found that 58% (72 of 125) attended all 4 mother
support group sessions [82% (27 of 33) in the HR-MAM intervention group, 54% (15 of 28) in
the LR-MAM intervention group, and 47% (30 of 64) in the control group]. The majority only
missed 1 session; only 12% (15 of 125) missed &gt;1 session. Of the 33 HR-MAM caregivers
interviewed, all reported that their child enjoyed the RUTF and only 6% (2 of 33) reported
that the ration was difficult to finish.</p>
              <p>At the end of the treatment, 8 of 1287 (0.6%) children had died and 92 of 1287 (7%) had
defaulted on treatment (i.e., missed 3 consecutive visits). Children receiving food were
less likely to default (4%) than those receiving only counseling (8%)
(<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.007). In the intervention arm, 38 of 317 (12%) children receiving
RUTF remained with MAM after 12 wk of treatment; mean ± SD length of RUTF treatment was
5.4 ± 2.9 wk (range: 2–12 wk).</p>
              <p>Recovery was greater for the intervention children at 12 wk than for the control children
(48% compared with 39%, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.001) (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table"><bold>Table 2</bold></xref>) (disaggregation by HR and LR groups in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>). The intervention group had a
lower risk of deteriorating to SAM by 12 wk post enrollment (18% compared with 24%,
<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.001) and lower risk of death (1.8% compared with 3.1%,
<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.04) (<bold><xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Figure 1</xref></bold>), and had a greater change in MUAC and average
daily weight gain, than did the controls (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table"><bold>Table
3</bold></xref>). These weight and MUAC gains were sustained through 24 wk post
enrollment (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). However, by 24 wk, the risk
of having deteriorated to SAM was similar between the 2 arms (31% compared with 34%,
<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.24). There was also no difference in risk of relapse by 24 wk for
those who recovered (5.2% compared with 6.2%, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.46). All groups gained
in MUAC between enrollment and the 24-wk follow-up, including the LR-MAM groups who only
received mother support group counseling (<bold><xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Figure 2</xref></bold>). The lowest MUAC gains were observed in
HR-MAM children at the control sites, among whom 40% deteriorated to SAM and therefore
received RUTF. There was no improvement in LAZ (stunting) in the intervention children
compared with the controls, nor was there a difference in fat mass or fat distribution
(skinfold thickness) (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>).</p>

              <p>Although our analysis was not powered for disaggregated comparison between risk groups,
some of the differences between the intervention and control groups at 12 wk were driven by
differences in recovery between the 2 low-risk groups (54% compared with 42%, 12%
difference), both of which received counseling only (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). When comparing high-risk children only (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, <bold><xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Table 3</xref></bold>), we
found that recovery, survival, and preventing SAM were still significantly better in the
intervention group in the short term, especially at 6 wk (45% compared with 24%) when most
children had just completed their course of RUTF, but superiority of the intervention over
counseling receded by 12 and 24 wk (recovery at 12 wk = 42% compared with 36%, 6%
difference).</p>
              <p>Using the control group data only, we identified risk factors associated with poor
outcomes. <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table"><bold>Table 4</bold></xref> shows that there
was no difference in the odds of deteriorating to SAM or death based on the child's mother
not being the caregiver, or breastfeeding status, 2 of our a priori criteria. Lower MUAC and
WAZ did show greater odds of a poor outcome at the study control sites. Children who had
either a drop in weight or a drop in MUAC for 2 consecutive visits during their
participation in mother care support groups were more likely to deteriorate or die by 24 wk.
Illness in the previous 2 wk was also associated with a poor outcome—particularly fever
and/or diarrhea at enrollment or 6 wk after enrollment. Of those with a poor outcome, 34%
had fever at 6 wk compared with 23% of those who did not have a poor outcome (OR: 1.68; 95%
CI: 1.11, 2.52); for diarrhea the figures were 6% compared with 2% (OR: 3.80; 95% CI: 1.32,
10.97). Younger age, being a twin, and having had SAM in the past were also associated with
deterioration. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 3</bold></xref> presents the
sensitivity and specificity of different combinations of risk factors for predicting
deterioration. We found that 49% (129 of 261) of those with MUAC &lt; 12 cm at enrollment
deteriorated to SAM or died by 24 wk, whereas 31% (141 of 453) deteriorated or died if their
MUAC was ≥12 cm (<bold><xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>The best strategies for supporting children suffering from MAM need evidence to inform
policy and programs, and this study offers initial data to fill that important gap (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). We found that provision of 1 sachet of RUTF per
day and amoxicillin to HR-MAM children reduced their risk of a poor outcome while they were
receiving treatment (i.e., before 12 wk), and increased MUAC and weight gain, compared with
nutrition counseling; however, benefits in recovery and risk of deterioration were not
sustained. Our results also reveal that more than one-quarter of children with MAM in this
nonemergency context will deteriorate within 3 mo if treated with a counseling intervention
alone.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, recovery rates were suboptimal in both groups and a large proportion of
children deteriorated to SAM or relapsed to MAM, even among those who were discharged as
recovered. Only 42% of the HR-MAM children at the intervention sites recovered by 12 wk
without the need for SAM treatment; 28% remained moderately wasted and 25% developed SAM or
died. The provision of RUTF and antibiotics also did not provide significantly sustained
increases in anthropometry after 24 wk. A recent study of 2683 MAM children in the same
district in Sierra Leone that provided supplementary foods to all children with MAM found
similarly high rates of deterioration. They found that 63% recovered, 10% remained with MAM,
19% developed SAM, and 1% died within 12 wk (<bold><xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Figure 4</xref></bold>) (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). In combination, these results suggest that providing food (either to all, or
to some MAM children in combination with antibiotics) prevents ∼7% points of poor outcomes
at 12 wk compared with counseling alone.</p>
              <p>A 12-mo follow-up of children with MAM given supplementary food in Malawi also found high
rates of deterioration (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Both of these studies
were set in poor, nonemergency settings where MAM is likely to be the consequence of both
chronic factors and intermittent insults. A more comprehensive package of interventions,
beyond counseling and food supplementation, may help, and/or longer duration of support.
Most high-risk children in our study received RUTF for 5 wk; this was until they had
MUAC &gt; 12.5 cm for 2 consecutive visits. A study in Malawi provided recent MAM recoverees
with a package of health and nutrition interventions, including a lipid nutrient supplement
for 8 wk, deworming medication, zinc supplementation, a bed net, and malaria
chemoprophylaxis. However, only 56% of intervention children and 53% in the control group
sustained recovery after 12 mo (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Our findings
suggest that MAM in a nonemergency context is difficult to successfully treat, most likely
because of ongoing insults from the environment, food insecurity, and infectious
diseases.</p>
              <p>The WHO has questioned whether food supplementation is necessary in nonemergency contexts,
and others have suggested it may even increase the risk of excessive weight gain (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). We
found no evidence of excessive or unhealthy weight gain, based on skinfold thickness, in
those who received RUTF compared with those who did not. The average skinfold thickness
<italic toggle="yes">z</italic> scores for both groups remained below the global average—a similar
finding to those of a 4-mo follow-up study of MAM children treated with RUTF in Kenya (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). This suggests that the option of food
supplementation is likely to be safe for children across the spectrum of acute malnutrition;
however, there is still a need to identify and prioritize those at highest risk (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Food supplementation does not necessarily mean
RUTF, because studies have seen similar recovery rates when using other lipid-based nutrient
supplements; however, meta-analyses have suggested that fortified blended flours are not as
effective (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>).</p>
              <p>Within the population of children with MAM, further risk stratification can be used to more
specifically target supplementary feeding. The definition of “high risk” warrants more
precise characterization. Our control group suggests that low MUAC (&lt;12.0 cm), low WAZ
(&lt;−3), lower LAZ, dropping anthropometry, reported recent illness (especially fever or
diarrhea), younger age (approximately &lt; 12 mo), being a twin, and having a history of
previous SAM are significant risk factors for deterioration. A study in Ethiopia of
untreated MAM also found MUAC &lt; 12.0 cm to be a key risk factor for deterioration (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Low WAZ alone can be used to predict concurrent
wasting and stunting and has been identified previously as a risk factor for death (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). In hindsight, our a priori defined risk factors
were not wholly appropriate. “Mother not the primary caregiver” and “less than 2 years and
not breastfeeding” were not associated with risk of deterioration among our control
children. Because these risk factors defined 21% of the sample, this may have affected our
results by diluting the effect of RUTF and antibiotics on the HR-MAM group. This study has,
however, identified a combination of 3 practical risk factors: MUAC &lt; 12.0 cm,
WAZ &lt; −3, and declining anthropometry during treatment, which can predict 90% of
deteriorations with 67% specificity in this context. The addition of indicators to current
programming may, however, compromise the desired simplicity for frontline health
workers.</p>
              <p>With regard to the LR-MAM groups, another factor which may have affected our results was
the difference in adherence to counseling, which was higher in the intervention group than
in the control group. Adherence has been a challenge in other nutrition counseling studies
(<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Greater defaulting and greater declining to take part in the control group may
have also affected these results. We explored other factors that could have boosted the
recovery rate in the LR-MAM intervention group; however, baseline maternal education,
indicators of socio-economic status, and baseline morbidities were similar between the
groups and did not alter the results when included in the regression model.</p>
              <sec id="sec4-1">
                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p>Our study is limited in generalizability and scalability. The context of the study was
one of chronic poverty among subsistence farmers where malaria was endemic. Our finding
may not be relevant in urban settings, emergency contexts, Asian contexts, or where
infectious diseases are more intermittent. Our mother support groups were bolstered by
research staff, so their effectiveness once implemented at scale may differ. Integration
with existing health platforms such as community health workers could improve
effectiveness at scale. It is also not possible to disaggregate the effects of amoxycillin
from those of RUTF in our intervention group. The unexpectedly high recovery rates in the
LR-MAM intervention group are difficult to explain; different levels of adherence to
treatment between the groups suggest that RUTF may enhance the effect of counseling. More
participants also declined to participate in the control group than in the intervention
group, which may have introduced some selection bias (9% compared with 5%). Despite the
limitations, this exploratory study has raised a number of important questions for future
research.</p>

                <title>Conclusions</title>
                <p>The necessity of food supplementation for all children with MAM has been a topic of
recent debate. Our study adds to the body of literature that MAM is a warning sign of
potential deterioration to SAM and increased mortality risk. Our findings suggest that
nutrition counseling alone is not sufficient for all children with MAM; however, even with
a short course of RUTF and antibiotics, recovery rates were suboptimal and protection
against SAM did not last beyond the first 3 mo. A longer or more holistic package of
interventions may be necessary. Our results, building on previous studies, support a shift
in the current management of acute malnutrition in favor of a model which provides a
continuum of care for all acutely malnourished children through better identification of
risk. Low MUAC, low WAZ, declining anthropometry, young age, twin status, history of SAM,
and recent morbidity are appropriate criteria for defining high-risk in this context.
Given the large and growing burden of wasting, and the questions arising from this study,
further research and operational trials, in a range of contexts, need to carry these
findings forward if we are to prevent and treat the majority of malnourished children and
meet Sustainable Development Goal 2.</p>
