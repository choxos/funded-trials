                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Cryptococcal meningitis is responsible for around 15% of all HIV-related deaths globally. Conventional treatment courses with amphotericin B require prolonged hospitalisation and are associated with multiple toxicities and poor outcomes. A phase II study has shown that a single high dose of liposomal amphotericin may be comparable to standard treatment. We propose a phase III clinical endpoint trial comparing single, high-dose liposomal amphotericin with the WHO recommended first-line treatment at six sites across five counties. An economic analysis is essential to support wide-scale implementation.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>Country-specific economic evaluation tools will be developed across the five country settings. Details of patient and household out-of-pocket expenses and any catastrophic healthcare expenditure incurred will be collected via interviews from trial patients. Health service patient costs and related household expenditure in both arms will be compared over the trial period in a probabilistic approach, using Monte Carlo bootstrapping methods. Costing information and number of life-years survived will be used as the input to a decision-analytic model to assess the cost-effectiveness of a single, high-dose liposomal amphotericin to the standard treatment. In addition, these results will be compared with a historical cohort from another clinical trial.</p>

              <p>Cryptococcal meningitis (CM) is a severe fungal infection of the brain which occurs in advanced HIV infection. It is estimated that there are roughly 220 000 cases of CM globally per year with 73% of these occurring in sub-Saharan Africa. Annual global deaths are estimated at 181 000 and CM is responsible for approximately 15% of all AIDS-related deaths.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></p>
              <p>The current recommended first-line treatment for CM is amphotericin B deoxycholate (AmBd). AmBd is associated with multiple drug-induced toxicities including anaemia, impaired renal function, electrolyte abnormalities and infusion-related reactions which make it unsafe to administer in high doses. AmBd is also difficult to administer, requiring hospitalisation for 7 to 14 days of intravenous infusions, depending on which oral antifungal it has been paired with. In addition, treatment outcomes are poor with acute mortality at 10 weeks ranging from 30% to 55%.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> The use of a liposomal form of amphotericin called Ambisome (hereafter referred to as L-AmB) is associated with reduced drug-induced toxicities when compared with conventional AmBd.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The long tissue half-life and effective penetration into the brain tissue of L-AmB has prompted research into the effectiveness of treatment with short courses of high-dose L-AmB.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> The AMBisome Therapy Induction OptimisatioN (AMBITION) phase II clinical trial conducted in Botswana and Tanzania found that a single, high dose of 10 mg/kg L-AmB was well tolerated and led to a non-inferior reduction in fungal burden in cerebrospinal fluid when compared with standard 14-day courses of 3 mg/kg L- AmB.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> This dosing strategy is now being taken to a clinical endpoint trial.</p>
              <p>The phase III AMBITION trial is a phase III open-label randomised control non-inferiority trial to compare single, high-dose L-AmB treatment to the WHO first-line recommended regimen of a 7-day course of AmBd-based treatment in avoiding all-cause mortality in HIV-associated CM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>).<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 7</xref> Eligible patients will be randomised to receive either:</p>

              </list>
              <p>After the 2-week induction phase, all patients will receive fluconazole 800 mg/day to 10 weeks and 200 mg/day thereafter. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) will be commenced 4 to 6 weeks after initiation of antifungal therapy. The trial will enrol 850 patients across six sites in five countries in Africa: Gaborone, Botswana (90); Blantyre (230) and Lilongwe (110), Malawi; Cape Town, South Africa (80); Kampala, Uganda (110) and Harare, Zimbabwe (230). All participants will be invited to take part in the economic evaluation study.</p>
              <p>The use of L-AmB has potential implications for both clinical outcomes and healthcare costs. The widespread availability of L-AmB has previously been limited by the high cost of therapy: currently, the internationally listed price is $85 per 50 mg vial compared with $8 per 50 mg vial of AmBd. The listed cost per patient of the medication for the single-dose arm in this trial will be $996 versus $132 for the control arm. However, the impact of a potentially more clinically effective intervention that is associated with fewer drug-induced toxicities and a reduced length of hospital stay may offset this expense. An argument for widening access to L-AmB has been strengthened since, in September 2018, Gilead announced as part of the expanded access preferential pricing programme for visceral leishmaniasis to include CM. While the normal cost in other countries varies from US$80 to US$400, the drug will now be available for US$16.25 in 116 low/middle-income countries.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> This could have a dramatic impact on mortality.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p>
              <p>We plan an economic analysis to estimate the cost consequences and the cost-effectiveness of short-course L-AmB treatment, compared with the control arm, in five individual country settings across sub-Saharan Africa. The findings will also be compared with a historical cohort from the recently completed Advancing Cryptococcal Meningitis Treatment for Africa (ACTA) trial. The ACTA trial recruited patients in Cameroon, Malawi, Tanzania and Zambia and compared treatment outcomes among individuals receiving one of five different treatment regimens, including the control arm used in the AMBITION trial.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> The purpose of this comparison is to identify any change in costs over time and any gross variation in health service costs between the AMBITION and ACTA cohorts, and to enable comparison of the cost-effectiveness of the short-course L-AmB with the other regimens tested in ACTA.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p>
              <p>The hypotheses are that the short-course treatment:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Will show a zero-net societal cost change or that there will be societal cost savings from the short L-AmB treatment and an equivalent or increased effectiveness of the treatment reducing mortality over a patient lifetime.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Will be cost-effective in terms of life-years saved over a patient lifetime when compared with historical cohorts who received different combination treatment regimens in a recently completed clinical trial.</p></list-item></list></p>

                <p>The study is a prospective economic evaluation from the societal perspective—including both health service and patient related perspectives—comparing the costs and effectiveness of the two interventions at each of the six trial sites across the five country settings. The two key components of this study are the collection of data concerning personal expenditure on health and the development of country costing tools, which will be applied to data concerning health service costs collected within the trial.</p>

                <p>To estimate the societal costs at the patient and household level, they or their representatives will be interviewed at two points in time: within the first 5 days of randomisation and at their final face-to-face follow-up at week 10. The questionnaires, based on those used in the ACTA trial and further developed for this study, are designed to estimate their personal healthcare expenditure in the 4 weeks leading up to enrolment and during the trial. A summary of the questions included in the questionnaire are presented in <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="B1">box 1</xref>. In addition, the out-of-pocket healthcare expenditure by the individual and their household, loss of income incurred due to illness and loss of labour time of the patients themselves and their carers will be collected using methods adopted in trials of a similar nature.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>

                <p>The interview questions will preferably be asked directly to the patient. If the patient is confused or has reduced consciousness due to CM, a relative or next-of-kin may provide proxy consent for them to enrol in the trial. It is unlikely that this person will be fully aware of the patient’s financial situation, and in these cases, it may be necessary to wait for the patient to recover before asking them directly. In cases where patients have prolonged confusion or are felt to have a poor prognosis, these questions can be asked of the proxy. Data will be collected by study doctors and nurses and entered into the trial Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system: a uniform database to be used across all sites. An interview guide for those collecting data from patients will ensure that nuances and country-specific idioms are acknowledged.</p>
                <p>The above methods have been developed through an iterative process. Initially, the lead Health Economist, who led on the ACTA cost-effectiveness analysis, and members of the Trial Management Group developed the data collection tools and integrated these into the wider trial EDC. This was later refined following a 1-week meeting of health economists and study team members from across the AMBITION sites held in Blantyre, Malawi in November 2017. This provided the opportunity for experts working in this field and individuals who will collect data from patients to improve these tools by collecting and entering data from fabricated patients. Feedback was then integrated into both the data collection methods and the EDC and shared for final approval across the AMBITION consortium until a consensus was reached.</p>

                <p>Presently, each site has differing levels of experience with conducting economic analyses and has varied access to validated country costing tools. As stated, the preparation of the trial included a 1-week workshop with at least two team members from each site to assess the face validity and completeness of the questionnaire, to practise electronic data entry of the completed questionnaire, carrying costing computations, and to increase the knowledge and understanding of economic evaluation. In each country, resource use data will be collected using an ingredients-based approach. The data on individual resource use will be collected from all participants onto case report forms. Overhead costs, including costs of admissions and laboratory tests, will be collated from the hospitals’ financial and utilisation documents.</p>

Data will be obtained from Princess Marina Hospital, which is the biggest, and main referral hospital in Botswana. Staff salaries will be taken from the Government of Botswana salary scales for health professionals. By combining this treatment costing data with the meningitis burden data generated through a previously completed audit, we will also generate an estimate of the total current costs to the Botswana health service of treating CM. The data will complement the ‘Estimated resource needs for key health interventions offered under Botswana’s Essential Health Services Plan (2013–2018)’ that project the cost of all health programmes, including the treatment of CM, from 2013 to 2018 and will also be used as a reference for the next version of this document to be published in 2019.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p>

Specific activities by staff will be identified and estimated through the review of routinely collected time sheets. Human resource costs as well as recurrent and capital costs will be allocated using hospital expenditure and financial records as well as records from the Provincial Department of Health. The average cost of each treatment component will be calculated by multiplying the quantity of resources used by the unit price.

                <p>On closure of the study, full data analysis will commence. First, an empirical cost-consequence analysis will take place, using empirical individual patient data on societal resource use and unit cost based on the results from the costing studies.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Both societal and healthcare perspectives are chosen, and health service patient costs including household costs, treatment cost and hospitalisations in both arms will be compared over the trial period in a probabilistic approach, using Monte Carlo bootstrapping methods. To handle the heterogeneity of the trial population in within trial evaluation, we will derive a benefit value for each patient from the observed costs and effects and then construct a regression model with treatment variable and collected explanatory variables. Next, the costing information and number of life-years’ survival will be used in a decision analytic model to assess the cost-effectiveness of the single, high-dose arm against the control arm and also against other combination treatment regimens from the ACTA trial. A Markov model has been chosen as it allows to explicitly account for passage of time to calculate time dependent costs and life-years of the remaining life span. Results will be presented using incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves generated by Monte Carlo bootstrapping methods. This approach avoids the stochastic fallacy and will determine if a single, high-dose L-AmB will be as or even more cost-effective compared with the current WHO recommended first-line treatment. An existing model will be adapted based on Jarvis <italic>et al</italic>, using the treatment submodel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2</xref>).<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> The Markov model has a monthly cycle length, running the model for 12 cycles to calculate annual costs and annual life-years. We will supplement the model to be able to extrapolate data beyond the period of observed follow-up. The Markov modelling framework also allows for the synthesis of data from secondary sources, like mortality risk from other causes and excess mortality risks.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> It also allows for probabilistic sensitivity analyses. We are going to use non-parametric bootstrapping to assess uncertainties, and both deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses to examine the impact of all relevant parameters on the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. The other country teams will be able to use an adapted model to enter their country-specific data and costing information as well as estimated survival figures, while using the pooled effectiveness information. In this way, each country will arrive at valid country-specific economic estimates.</p>

              <p>This phase III clinical endpoint trial comparing single, high-dose liposomal amphotericin to the control arm treatment at six sites across five counties will provide valuable information on the comparative effectiveness with existing and other proposed strategies. This will be based on the effectiveness of simplified treatment strategies as well on the possibly increased safety. The proposed economic analysis of the equivalence trial for the Malawi situation will allow for a realistic comparison with settings where there is very limited coverage of appropriate treatment of CM in people with HIV. The estimates from other trial settings will help to document the generalisability of our findings. The economic information will be essential in the support of wide-scale implementation strategies and the formulation and testing of alternative delivery modes in all comparable sub-Saharan setting.</p>
              <p>A clinically effective and safer treatment for CM in sub-Saharan Africa could have a dramatic impact on HIV-associated mortality in the region. This economic analysis is essential to help justify any policy change towards increasing the availability of more expensive medication if it is proven to be cost-effective. This process will enable the development of country-specific costing tools across five African sites, which can be used for future studies and will build capacity in the region.</p>
