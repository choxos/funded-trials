                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Because the general population is largely naive to H5N1 influenza, antibodies generated to H5 allow analysis of novel influenza vaccines independent of background immunity from previous infection. We assessed the safety and immunogenicity of DNA encoding H5 as a priming vaccine to improve antibody responses to inactivated influenza vaccination.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>In VRC 306 and VRC 310, two sequentially enrolled phase 1, open-label, randomised clinical trials, healthy adults (age 18–60 years) were randomly assigned to receive intramuscular H5 DNA (4 mg) at day 0 or twice, at day 0 and week 4, followed by H5N1 monovalent inactivated vaccine (MIV; 90 μg) at 4 or 24 weeks, and compared with a two-dose regimen of H5N1 MIV with either a 4 or 24 week interval. Antibody responses were assessed by haemagglutination inhibition (HAI), ELISA, neutralisation (ID<sub>80</sub>), and immunoassays for stem-directed antibodies. T cell responses were assessed by intracellular cytokine staining. After enrolment, investigators and individuals were not masked to group assignment. VRC 306 and VRC 310 are registered with <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link>, numbers <ext-link ext-link-type="ClinicalTrials.gov" xlink:href="NCT00776711">NCT00776711</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="ClinicalTrials.gov" xlink:href="NCT01086657">NCT01086657</ext-link>, respectively.</p>

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>In VRC 306, 60 individuals were randomly assigned to the four groups (15 in each) and 59 received the vaccinations. In VRC 310, of the 21 individuals enrolled, 20 received the vaccinations (nine received a two-dose regimen of H5N1 MIV and 11 received H5 DNA at day 0 followed by H5N1 MIV at week 24). H5 DNA priming was safe and enhanced H5-specific antibody titres following an H5N1 MIV boost, especially when the interval between DNA prime and MIV boost was extended to 24 weeks. In the two studies, DNA priming with a 24-week MIV boost interval induced protective HAI titres in 21 (81%) of 26 of individuals, with an increase in geometric mean titre (GMT) of more than four times that of individuals given the MIV-MIV regimen at 4 or 24 weeks (GMT 103–206 vs GMT 27–33). Additionally, neutralising antibodies directed to the conserved stem region of H5 were induced by this prime-boost regimen in several individuals. No vaccine-related serious adverse events were recorded.</p>

                  <title>Interpretation</title>
                  <p>DNA priming 24 weeks in advance of influenza vaccine boosting increased the magnitude of protective antibody responses (HAI) and in some cases induced haemagglutinin-stem-specific neutralising antibodies. A DNA-MIV vaccine regimen could enhance the efficacy of H5 or other influenza vaccines and shows that anti-stem antibodies can be elicited by vaccination in man.</p>

              <p id="para60">The worldwide burden of influenza remains substantial and an estimated 250 000–500 000 people die of influenza every year.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> The substantial public health effect of influenza infections is compounded by the potential for pandemics caused by emerging virus strains for which no immunity exists in the population. Such episodes occurred in 1918, when the influenza A subtype H1N1 was first identified in human beings, causing the Spanish flu pandemic, with mortality estimated at 40 million deaths or more worldwide<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> and again in 2009, when a related H1N1 virus caused a pandemic derived by a triple reassortment of genes from swine, avian, and human influenza viruses.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> This type of adaptation of animal influenza viruses to man represents a global threat to public health.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> Another example of zoonotic spread includes the highly pathogenic avian influenza A H5N1 viruses, which cause morbidity and mortality in bird populations and have caused sporadic human disease.

To directly compare vaccine regimens with a 24-week boost interval, a follow-up clinical trial (VRC 310) was initiated, and 21 individuals were enrolled between March 8, 2010, and May 13, 2010. Groups A and B were enrolled in VRC 310 to expand on the findings in VRC 306 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>). The demographic characteristics were similar between groups (<xref rid="cesec110" ref-type="sec">webappendix p 4</xref>).

              <p id="para280">In this report, we analyse the ability of a H5 DNA vaccine to prime the neutralising antibody response elicited by an MIV H5N1 (Indo) boost. These regimens were safe and well tolerated, adding to the growing body of data that DNA vaccines carry a favourable safety profile. The safety data from the assessments of this H5 DNA vaccine are consistent with previous data generated by the Vaccine Research Centre using the same platform to assess vaccines for HIV, Ebola, Marburg, West Nile virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome virus, and seasonal influenza, in which 2100 individuals have been immunised with a total of 5700 doses of DNA vaccines.<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>
</p>
              <p id="para290">We have shown that the length of the interval between priming and boosting significantly affects the magnitude and breadth of the response and that DNA priming increases the potency of the responses. In some individuals, DNA priming can also increase breadth by eliciting antibodies directed to a highly conserved structure in the haemagglutinin stem.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> DNA priming followed by MIV with a 24-week boost interval induced HAI titres more than four times higher than did two doses of MIV. Similar to other H5 antigens, this antigen generally induces low-titre and low-frequency HAI responses compared with seasonal influenza strain vaccine antigens. The DNA vaccine assessed in this study has previously been shown to induce an HAI titre of 1:40 or more in just 20% of individuals when given three times at a 4 mg dose without an inactivated vaccine boost.<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> Similarly, when given twice, the MIV boost product assessed in this study was recently shown by another group<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref> to induce an HAI GMT of 27·6, and, although a 6-month boost interval improved those responses slightly (GMT 58·7), little or no cross-reactive antibody was induced.<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref>
</p>
              <p id="para300">In the data from two clinical studies reported here, when a single DNA prime was boosted by MIV at 24 weeks, protective (≥1/40) HAI titres were induced in 81% of individuals with a GMT of 152 (groups 3 and B), which is a frequency and magnitude much greater than those previously induced by either vaccine alone. MIV given twice induced a protective HAI titre in six of 15 individuals in group 1, and in four of nine in group A. This finding is remarkable because of the relatively weak immunogenicity of the H5 antigen and because only one dose of DNA priming was needed to greatly improve the antibody response. Moreover, the longer boost interval significantly improved the responses seen in the DNA primed groups, but did not significantly improve the responses in individuals who received two doses of MIV. This result indicates that the biology of the priming immunisation differs between DNA and a traditional inactivated vaccine. Another surprising finding was that two doses of DNA as a prime did not greatly improve the overall responses beyond those seen with a single-dose of DNA. The two-dose DNA prime did affect the ELISA and neutralising antibody response but had no significant effect on the HAI response, which is known to correlate with protection. Gene-based antigen delivery accesses different pathways of antigen presentation and might thereby facilitate T-cell help, increase the number and diversity of CD4 clones,<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> and induce greater expansion of the relevant B-cell populations. DNA prime-inactivated vaccine boost has been shown to elicit higher haemagglutinin-specific T-cell responses compared with inactivated vaccine alone in animals, supporting the findings in this study.</p>
              <p id="para310">DNA priming has been shown to induce improved haemagglutinin immune responses in animal studies.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> Research in animals also suggested that gene-based influenza vaccination induces broad protection across strains; although influenza-specific broadly neutralising antibodies have been occasionally detected in man, measurement of specific influenza vaccine-elicited responses has been difficult since there is a high prevalence and variability of pre-existing influenza immunity in the general population. The benefit of assessing an H5 antigen is the low seroprevalence despite the sharing of some cross-reactive epitopes with other group 1 influenza type A viruses.</p>
              <p id="para320">Assessment of the antibodies induced by the gene-based regimen described here indicates that antibodies against the conserved haemagglutinin stem epitope can be induced by DNA prime-MIV boost immunisation, and these antibodies are able to neutralise diverse strains, including H5N1, H5N2, and H9N2. The induction of stem-specific neutralising antibodies correlates with an overall higher magnitude of antibody response elicited by gene-based priming. Our data and previous studies<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> suggest that gene-based priming stimulates increased helper T-cell responses, perhaps by presentation in the absence of other viral components. This immune stimulation could augment the potency and breadth of the haemagglutinin-directed antibody response.</p>
              <p id="para330">We acknowledge the following limitations of these studies: data were derived in two sequential clinical trials rather than in one trial, the variability of stem-antibody response in man remains poorly understood, and the mechanism of DNA priming and boost interval responsible for improving MIV vaccine immunogenicity remains unknown. However, an increase in the magnitude of the antibody response, either HAI titre or activity of neutralising antibodies, induced by an influenza vaccine should translate to improved efficacy. The present findings suggest that DNA priming could substantially augment the responses otherwise seen with traditional H5 MIV vaccine approaches, and that gene-based regimens may also provide an opportunity to induce broader and potentially more potent neutralising antibodies, especially if a response can be induced against conserved influenza epitopes such as to the stem of haemagglutinin. A longer boost interval might provide an optimum immune response and allow for more flexibility in an immunisation schedule. Moreover, DNA priming might also prove to be a successful strategy in the effort to improve otherwise marginal immune responses to influenza vaccines, such as those seen in the very young or elderly.</p>
