              <abstract>
                <p>Gliomas are mostly incurable secondary to their diffuse infiltrative nature. Thus, specific therapeutic targeting of invasive glioma cells is an attractive concept. As cells exit the tumor mass and infiltrate brain parenchyma, they closely interact with a changing micro-environmental landscape that sustains tumor cell invasion.</p>
                <p>In this study, we used a unique microarray profiling approach on a human glioma stem cell (GSC) xenograft model to explore gene expression changes <italic>in situ</italic> in Invading Glioma Cells (IGCs) compared to tumor core, as well as changes in host cells residing within the infiltrated microenvironment relative to the unaffected cortex. IGCs were found to have reduced expression of genes within the extracellular matrix compartment, and genes involved in cell adhesion, cell polarity and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) processes. The infiltrated microenvironment showed activation of wound repair and tissue remodeling networks. We confirmed by protein analysis the downregulation of EMT and polarity related genes such as <italic>CD44</italic> and <italic>PARD3</italic> in IGCs, and <italic>EFNB3</italic>, a tissue-remodeling agent enriched at the infiltrated microenvironment. <italic>OLIG2</italic>, a proliferation regulator and glioma progenitor cell marker upregulated in IGCs was found to function in enhancing migration and stemness of GSCs. Overall, our results unveiled a more comprehensive picture of the complex and dynamic cell autonomous and tumor-host interactive pathways of glioma invasion than has been previously demonstrated. This suggests targeting of multiple pathways at the junction of invading tumor and microenvironment as a viable option for glioma therapy.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Glioblastoma (GBM), the most malignant glioma tumor, is highly invasive with a median survival of 16 months despite combined surgical resection, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. Although the molecular signature of glioma has been investigated in detail <xref rid="pone.0111783-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0111783-Verhaak1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, these studies have focused on the primary tumor and not on the invading cells and their microenvironment. By nature of their unique phenotype it is reasonable to assume that the invading cells in GBM have gene regulatory networks that differ from noninvasive cells within the primary tumor bulk. The present study was specifically aimed at identifying molecular pathways responsible for and potential therapeutic targets against glioma invasion.</p>
              <p>The brain consists of numerous cell types forming tissue scaffolds that guide invasion <xref rid="pone.0111783-Gritsenko1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Glioma cell invasion into brain tissue occurs along preexisting myelinated fibers and blood vessels, similar to the natural migratory patterns of neural stem cells (NSC) and progenitor cells <xref rid="pone.0111783-Sanai1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. It is clearly a multifactorial process that employs simultaneous interactions of invading glioma cells (IGCs) with the surrounding components of the tumor microenvironment. Further characterization of these cellular compartments may help in the development of novel strategies to therapeutically inhibit glioma invasion and progression.</p>
              <p>Glioma stem cells (GSCs) are a subpopulation of cells in the tumor capable of self-renewal that can give rise to a heterogeneous tumor <xref rid="pone.0111783-Clarke1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. In xenograft models, GSCs extensively infiltrate into the surrounding cerebral cortex, phenocopying a pathognomonic feature of human GBM <xref rid="pone.0111783-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p>
              <p>Ideally, one would perform between–group differential expression analysis for each cellular compartment. However, experimental methods for isolating the IGCs and their microenvironment cellular compartment are neither timely nor cost effective, and isolating them <italic>in vitro</italic> would affect cell physiology and gene expression. Traditional laser capture microdissection studies of glioma invasion focused on glioma specimens from human patients, dissecting neoplastic astrocytes as the invading cells at the rim of the tumor core <xref rid="pone.0111783-Hoelzinger1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111783-Kislin1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. These studies, however did not evaluate the more deeply invasive glioma cells nor did they interrogate the contribution of host cells residing within the invaded cerebral cortex.</p>
              <p>In the present study we used an innovative laser microdissection (LMD) enrichment strategy and gene expression analysis. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of IGCs and their microenvironment were simultaneously detected allowing us to deduce functional networks that characterize glioma invasion <italic>in situ</italic>. Subsequently, we found several genes in multiple pathways that may facilitate invasion which were validated at the protein level in xenografted GSCs and in clinical samples from GBM patients. Importantly, <italic>OLIG2</italic>, a proliferation regulator and glioma progenitor cell marker was upregulated in the IGCs relative to the tumor core. Inhibition of <italic>OLIG2</italic> expression reduced migration and stemness and provided functional confirmation as a potential therapeutic target in glioma invasion. Overall, the novel approach in this study allowed us to construct and evaluate a more complete picture of multiple pathways within the area of glioma invasion than has been previously demonstrated.</p>

</title>
                <p>GSCs derived from primary GBM show a predilection for migrating along white matter tracts such as the corpus callosum, as is characteristically seen in patient brains <xref rid="pone.0111783-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Thus, we first evaluated the migration capability of 0923 and 1228A1 GSCs using an <italic>in vitro</italic> cell migration assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111783-g001">Figures 1A and 1B</xref>). Both GSC lines demonstrated significant migration capability in haptotaxis conditions with laminin compared to cells in control uncoated wells (<italic>P</italic>≤0.01). When laminin was used for chemotaxis, only 0923 cells showed significant migration (<italic>P</italic>≤0.01). In haptotaxis conditions with fibronectin, only 1228A1 cells demonstrated significant migration (<italic>P</italic>≤0.01). None of the GSCs migrated in chemotaxis with fibronectin. Intracranial tumors generated by 0923 and 1228A1 GSCs demonstrated an extensive infiltration into the surrounding cerebral cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111783-g001">Figures 1C and 1D</xref>). In contrast to these GSC lines, 0827A2 GSCs showed limited infiltration capability <italic>in vivo</italic>, although they demonstrated significant migration capability <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111783.s001">Figures S1A and S1B</xref>). We therefore explored the cell autonomous and microenvironmental molecular signals responsible for glioma invasion on 0923 and 1228A1 GSCs xenografts.</p>

                <title>Gene Expression of Invasive Glioma Cells and Their Microenvironment</title>
                <p>To identify genes associated with glioma cell invasion and the tumor microenvironment, we utilized xenografts of 0923 and 1228A1 GSCs, which displayed an invasive phenotype <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111783-g001">Figure 1C and 1D</xref>). We investigated whether there are DEGs between cells in the tumor core and IGCs, as well as between the microenvironment at the area of invasion (AOI) and normal brain tissue distant from the tumor. Tissue samples were collected using LMD from three distinct regions of each injected mouse: tumor core area (region A), infiltration enriched region (region B, AOI) and “normal” brain area (region C, reactive mouse cells distant from the tumor). RNA from each region was isolated and subjected to a whole-genome expression array analysis. As depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111783-g001">Figure 1E</xref>, samples of region B were hybridized on human gene expression arrays, followed by a second hybridization on mouse expression arrays. Region A and C samples were hybridized to human and mouse gene expression arrays, respectively.</p>
                <p>Applying the algorithm described in the supporting information section (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111783.s009">File S1</xref>), we identified 756 human DEGs in the tumor core and the area of invasion, and 1566 mouse DEGs in the “normal” brain area and the AOI, common to both xenografted GSC lines. These differentially expressed gene sets were then designated as the glioma dataset and the microenvironment dataset, correspondingly. Hierarchical clustering of the DEGs in each dataset segregated the arrays according to the GSC lines. Moreover, a clear separation was noticed between the human arrays of the tumor core and the area of invasion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111783-g001">Figure 1F</xref>). Similarly, the invasive and the “normal” areas of the mouse brain were segregated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111783-g001">Figure 1G</xref>).</p>

                <title>Functional Networks in Glioma Invasion</title>
                <p>For every dataset, we focused on a subset of genes associated with significant cellular processes and canonical pathways (Table S2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111783.s009">File S1</xref>) that were identified by the MetaCore database. Other genes from the datasets were supplemented based on functional association as defined by literature references. To investigate the interconnection of genes expressed in the IGCs with other gene products, pathways, and biological processes, a global molecular network was formed using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software. Five major networks were identified: EMT, cell polarity, neurophysiological process, cell cycle (anaphase promoting complex, APC) and cell adhesion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111783-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Interestingly, 16 out of 20 genes involved in EMT (e.g. <italic>STAT3</italic>, <italic>CHI3L1</italic>, <italic>CD44</italic>) and 9 genes of cell polarity (e.g. <italic>PARD3</italic>, <italic>CDC42</italic>, <italic>PLAUR</italic>) were downregulated <xref rid="pone.0111783-Phillips1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111783-Lee2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0111783-Sturge1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. <italic>STAT3</italic>, which is downregulated, acts as a hub in the EMT network interacting with all other networks. On the other hand, majority of genes (13 out of 18) associated with neurophysiological process (e.g. <italic>OLIG2</italic>, <italic>WISP1</italic>, <italic>EPHA4</italic>, <italic>PLXNA4</italic>) and in the cell cycle (e.g. <italic>APC complex</italic>, <italic>CDC20</italic>, <italic>FBXO5</italic>) were upregulated <xref rid="pone.0111783-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0111783-Zimmer1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111783-g002">Figure 2B</xref> shows how these genes and networks relate to one another. These genes are related to key biological functions such as cell cycle, cellular growth and proliferation and cellular movement (data not shown). Similar analysis of the microenvironment dataset revealed a major network with direct and indirect functional relationships between gene products (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111783.s002">Figure S2B</xref>). Beta-catenin (<italic>CTNNB1</italic>), which plays a central role in the canonical Wnt pathway, acts as a major hub interconnecting with genes and gene products associated with tissue remodeling and wound repair (e.g. <italic>PLAU</italic>, <italic>CDH2</italic>, <italic>NCAM1</italic>, <italic>BMP7</italic>, <italic>TGFB3</italic>) <xref rid="pone.0111783-Harvey1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0111783-Matise1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.</p>
                <p>Further analysis identified 17 potential protein-protein binding interactions between the IGCs and the microenvironment residing host cells (Table S3 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111783.s009">File S1</xref>). Six out of the 17 interactions have been previously linked to invasion, migration or adhesion (<italic>EPHA4-Efnb3</italic>, <italic>SEMA5A-Plxnb3</italic>, <italic>AQP4-Dag1</italic>, <italic>FGFR1-Ncam1</italic>, <italic>FGF2-Sdc2</italic>, and <italic>APP-Aplp2</italic>) <xref rid="pone.0111783-Zimmer1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111783-Li2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0111783-Zecchini1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> whereas only 3 interactions have been previously reported in glioma (<italic>SEMA5A-Plxnb3</italic>, <italic>AQP4-Dag1</italic>, and <italic>FGF2-Sdc2</italic>) <xref rid="pone.0111783-Zimmer1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111783-Li2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0111783-Watanabe1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>.</p>

                <title>Therapeutic Significance of the Inhibition of <italic>OLIG2</italic> Expression</title>
                <p><italic>OLIG2</italic>, a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor, is selectively expressed in a subgroup of glioma cells and required for glioma formation in a murine GBM model <xref rid="pone.0111783-Ligon1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. <italic>OLIG</italic>2 expression by the IGCs <italic>in situ</italic> may suggest their stemness, which supports their invasive capability <italic>in vivo</italic>. We thus investigated whether <italic>OLIG2</italic> could serve as a therapeutic target in invading glioma cells. We examined the effect of <italic>OLIG2</italic> knockdown (shOLIG2) on the differentiation state, self-renewal, proliferation, cell migration and <italic>in vivo</italic> invasion of GSCs. As demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111783-g006">Figure 6A</xref>, the mRNA expression levels of the NSC markers: <italic>NANOG</italic>, <italic>OCT4</italic> and <italic>SOX2</italic> in 0923 shOLIG2 GSCs were significantly decreased compared to the shControl cells. Immunofluorescence labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111783-g006">Figure 6B</xref>) also confirmed the significant decrease of <italic>SOX2</italic> and <italic>NESTIN</italic> expression in 0923 shOLIG2 GSCs. Culturing the cells in medium containing serum abolished the expression of these markers in 0923 shOLIG2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111783-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). Unlike normal NSCs, GSCs weakly co-stained for both <italic>GFAP</italic> and <italic>TUJ1</italic> (markers for glial and neuronal lineages, respectively) as previously demonstrated <xref rid="pone.0111783-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Serum-containing medium increased the expression of <italic>GFAP</italic> and <italic>TUJ1</italic> in 0923 shOLIG2 cells in a more pronounced manner than in shControl cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111783-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). Next we preformed limiting dilution and proliferation assays to determine the effect of shOLIG2 on self-renewal and cell growth. 0923 shOLIG2 cells exhibit relatively poor self-renewal capability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111783-g006">Figure 6D</xref>) and reduced cell proliferation by 30% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111783-g006">Figure 6E</xref>). Intriguingly, the migration of 0923 shOLIG2 GSCs was decreased by 75% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111783-g006">Figure 6F</xref>). We further demonstrated the involvement of EMT in glioma invasion and tested by western blot analysis the effect of shOLIG2 on the expression of central regulators of EMT during neural crest cell migration and cancer: <italic>TWIST</italic>, <italic>SNAI2</italic> (<italic>SLUG</italic>) and <italic>SOX9</italic>. Our analysis revealed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111783-g006">Figure 6G</xref>) that 0923 shOLIG2 GSCs exhibit reduced levels of <italic>SNAI2</italic> and <italic>TWIST</italic> and elevated <italic>SOX9</italic> levels.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Surgical resection of gliomas is usually non-curative secondary to the invasive nature of the tumor <xref rid="pone.0111783-Gritsenko1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> and thus therapeutic targeting of IGCs is an attractive concept. This study presents a unique approach that led to the simultaneous identification of genes in glioma cells and brain microenvironment at the AOI <italic>in situ</italic>, which enabled us to construct and evaluate pathways that may underlie glioma invasion as both a cell autonomous and tumor-host interactive process.</p>
              <p>Previous studies of global gene expression in GBM invasion used LCM of patient specimens did not distinguish changes in the microenvironment at the site of invasion <xref rid="pone.0111783-Hoelzinger1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111783-Kislin1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Although the cell type-specific gene expression analysis of complex tissues was previously proposed, it is not applicable with complex solid tissues such as brain bearing tumor <xref rid="pone.0111783-ShenOrr1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Our novel approach of LMD enrichment and microarray analysis in GSCs xenografts allowed us to simultaneously explore the DEGs of both IGCs and host microenvironment. For instance, while Hoelzinger et al. <xref rid="pone.0111783-Hoelzinger1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> reported an increased expression of <italic>EFNB3</italic> in the tumor rim, we found it to be specifically upregulated in the microenvironment rather than in the invasive tumor cells, a distinction key to understanding complex cellular invasion pathways. In order to measure tumor and microenvironment specific gene expression at the AOI, we distinguished human and mouse specific microarray signals within the mixed sample by eliminating individual probes susceptible to cross-hybridization. The specificity of the results was validated based on the number of DEGs using a species-specific assay (NanoString). These probes were designed to only capture human or mouse genes, and a significant (70–80%) proportion was indeed validated, and is in line with previous reports using pure samples <xref rid="pone.0111783-Dallas1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>.</p>
              <p>Many of the DEGs common for both xenografted GSCs were at a low fold-change, but were nonetheless statistically significant. We then looked at the intersection of our DEGs with those previously reported in the invasive rim of 4 human GBMs in an attempt to correlate our xenograft data to a closely related one derived in a clinical setting <xref rid="pone.0111783-Kislin1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Although not entirely comparable as our invasive cells are collected at some distance from the tumor rim, this approach resulted in an overlap of 127 genes (Table S6 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111783.s009">File S1</xref>). Genes such as <italic>CDK1</italic>, <italic>BUB1</italic>, <italic>FBX05</italic>, <italic>ADAM23</italic> and <italic>PLXNA4</italic>, associated with cell cycle, cell adhesion or neurophysiological processes were found in both datasets. Though upregulated genes within the cell cycle functional category can imply activation of cellular proliferation, we observed the presence of inhibitory proteins of APC such as <italic>BUB1</italic> and <italic>FBX05</italic>, which could promote cell cycle arrest <xref rid="pone.0111783-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111783-Moshe1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. The downregulation of <italic>PLXNA4</italic>, a semaphorin receptor required for guidance of newly differentiated neurons, was also common to both datasets <xref rid="pone.0111783-Waimey1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Gene ontology and pathway mapping for gene function have a crucial role in translating gene expression data into models of biological function <xref rid="pone.0111783-Thomas1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Interestingly, our glioma dataset highlights the down-modulation of EMT related genes that implicate a phenotypic shift toward a mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) as a major process undergone by tumor cells at the AOI. Previous genomic profiling of metastatic tumors has shown that the disseminated tumor cells are strikingly similar to primary tumor cells <xref rid="pone.0111783-Nevo1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111783-Weigelt1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. These studies suggested that phenotypic transitions might be driven not only by cell intrinsic affecters but also by the influence of the microenvironment. Indeed, the present study describes a tumor invasion-specific microenvironment functional network that further supports this idea.</p>
              <p>Being exploratory and hypothesis generating, our analysis suggests some potential protein-protein interactions that have never been explored between glioma cells and host cells at the AOI. Recently the role of <italic>EPHA2</italic> and <italic>EPHA3</italic> in maintaining the undifferentiated state of GSC has been reported <xref rid="pone.0111783-Binda1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111783-Day1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Our data shows <italic>EFNB3</italic> enrichment at the AOI accompanied by <italic>EPHA4</italic> expression in the IGCs. Cell contact-mediated bidirectional <italic>EFNB3/EPHA4</italic> signaling and migration of interneurons during cerebral cortex development has been previously reported, suggesting the possible usage of this interaction during glioma invasion <xref rid="pone.0111783-Zimmer1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Expression of <italic>EFNB3</italic> in the cerebral cortex may provide the switch between cell-cell adhesion and cell migration by A-Disintegrin-And-Metalloproteases (ADAM)-mediated shedding <xref rid="pone.0111783-Janes1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Intriguingly, we observe that IGCs, host cells or both, show increased expression of <italic>ADAM10</italic>, <italic>ADAM15</italic> and <italic>ADAM19</italic> at the AOI.</p>
              <p>The presence of <italic>OLIG2</italic> positive tumor cells within the AOI strongly suggests that the invasive niche contains GSCs <xref rid="pone.0111783-Ligon1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Knockdown of <italic>OLIG2</italic> in 0923 GSCs decreased the expression levels of their NSC markers (<italic>SOX2</italic>, <italic>NANOG</italic>, <italic>OCT4</italic> and <italic>NESTIN</italic>), and reduced their self-renewal and proliferation abilities. Exposure of these cells to differentiation conditions reveals the potential of the shOLIG2 GSCs to differentiate more profoundly into distinct populations of glial and neuronal lineages than GSCs which express <italic>OLIG2</italic>. Moreover, <italic>OLIG2</italic> knockdown inhibited their migration potential <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Recently, Siebzehnrubl et al. <xref rid="pone.0111783-Siebzehnrubl1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref> demonstrated that critical stem cell regulators such as <italic>SOX2</italic> and <italic>OLIG2</italic> are induced by <italic>ZEB1-miR-200</italic> feedback loop in GBM. Our data support their model, as non-invasive cells in the tumor mass express relatively low levels of <italic>OLIG2</italic>. Our <italic>in vitro</italic> data further show that <italic>OLIG2</italic> can modulate <italic>TWIST</italic> and <italic>SNAI2</italic> protein expression, the central regulators of EMT cancer invasion <xref rid="pone.0111783-Mani1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Consistently, our microarray data also show a close correlation between <italic>OLIG2</italic>, <italic>TWIST</italic> and <italic>SNAI2</italic> expression within the AOI of xenografted 0923 GSCs.</p>
              <p>In epithelial cancer, EMT is evoked during tumor cell invasion and metastasis, leading to the generation of cancer cells with stem cell-like characteristics. Metastases are accompanied by a re-differentiation and a MET type transition, both of which are proposed to be a driving force of metastasis, suggesting that MET allows for growth and colonization of the invasive cell <xref rid="pone.0111783-Brabletz1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. Phillips et al. previously suggested that shifts towards the mesenchymal phenotype in glioma tumors are a pattern of disease progression similar to EMT in epithelial tumor types. We found markers of the mesenchymal phenotype to be downregulated in the IGCs including <italic>CHI3L1</italic> (<italic>YKL40</italic>), <italic>CD44</italic>, and <italic>STAT3</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0111783-Phillips1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. As EMT is a transient state, once a cell has invaded, its mesenchymal features disappear. Thus, it is likely that the AOI <italic>in situ</italic> contains both invasive and post-invasive (colonizing) glioma cell populations. We postulate that as cells exit the tumor mass and infiltrate brain parenchyma, <italic>OLIG2</italic> expression is enhanced, and as they colonize brain parenchyma, expression of EMT markers is diminished.</p>
              <p>While our approach of filtering out cross-hybridizing genes may have resulted in the loss of some differentially expressed genes, the exploratory nature of this study enabled us to capture for the first time multiple pathways that take place at the junction of tumor invasion and microenvironment <italic>in situ</italic>. This study revealed several distinct glioma pathways as well as many previously characterized developmental and neurophysiological processes that had never been described in glioma. These multiple pathways serve as a rich reservoir for therapeutic targets that warrant further investigation. Firstly, our data shows that direct targeting of proteins such as <italic>CD44</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0111783-Xu1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, <italic>CHI3L1</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0111783-Ku1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref> or <italic>PARD3</italic> may be ineffective at this stage of disease as they are already downregulated in glioma cells at the AOI. On the other hand, the identification of molecules selectively expressed by invasive glioma cells such as <italic>OLIG2</italic> may allow the development of therapeutic strategies that specifically target this population of cells <xref rid="pone.0111783-Fu1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. Furthermore, molecules selectively expressed by host cells within the AOI such as <italic>EFNB3</italic> may be equally amenable to therapeutic targeting.</p>
              <p>Specific therapeutic targeting of glioma invasion is a field in its infancy. Within the tumor-bearing CNS, complex, dynamic and synchronized interactions between glioma tumor cells and tumor-microenvironment residing cells (glial, neural and endothelial cells) may sustain glioma cell invasion. Recently, Sottoriva et al. detected the multiple coexisting cell lineages and expression subtypes at the individual GBM patient. They also suggested that these IGCs are a heterogeneous population of malignant cells that survived treatment <xref rid="pone.0111783-Sottoriva1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. Further studies are required in order to determine if invasion is mediated by clonal selection and/or global expression changes. The substantial degree of confirmation at both transcript and protein levels in xenografted GSCs and patient samples, as well as the functional proof of concept, strengthen our phenotypic observations. The data summarized here emphasize the importance of deciphering and understanding the global phenotypic and functional complexity of glioma cell invasion and its dynamic nature for the development of effective glioma treatments in the future.</p>
