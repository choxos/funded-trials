              <abstract>
                <p>Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is associated with considerable imbalances in intestinal microbiota that may underlie pathological conditions in both mothers and infants. To more definitively identify these alterations, we evaluated the maternal and infant gut microbiota through the shotgun metagenomic analysis of a subset of stool specimens collected from a randomized, controlled trial in diet-controlled women with GDM. The women were fed either a CHOICE diet (60% complex carbohydrate/25% fat/15% protein, n=18) or a conventional diet (CONV, 40% complex carbohydrate/45% fat/15% protein, n=16) from 30 weeks’ gestation through delivery. In contrast to other published studies, we designed the study to minimize the influence of other dietary sources by providing all meals, which were eucaloric and similar in fiber content. At 30 and 37 weeks’ gestation, we collected maternal stool samples; performed the fasting measurements of glucose, glycerol, insulin, free fatty acids, and triglycerides; and administered an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) to measure glucose clearance and insulin response. Infant stool samples were collected at 2 weeks, 2 months, and 4–5 months of age. Maternal glucose was controlled to conventional targets in both diets, with no differences in Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR). No differences in maternal alpha or beta diversity between the two diets from baseline to 37 weeks’ gestation were observed. However, women on CHOICE diet had higher levels of <italic>Bifidobacteriaceae</italic>, specifically <italic>Bifidobacterium adolescentis</italic>, compared with women on CONV. Species-level taxa varied significantly with fasting glycerol, fasting glucose, and glucose AUC after the OGTT challenge. Maternal diet significantly impacted the patterns of infant colonization over the first 4 months of life, with CHOICE infants showing increased microbiome alpha diversity (richness), greater <italic>Clostridiaceae</italic>, and decreased <italic>Enterococcaceae</italic> over time. Overall, these results suggest that an isocaloric GDM diet containing greater complex carbohydrates with reduced fat leads to an ostensibly beneficial effect on the maternal microbiome, improved infant gut microbiome diversity, and reduced opportunistic pathogens capable of playing a role in obesity and immune system development. These results highlight the critical role a maternal diet has in shaping the maternal and infant microbiome in women with GDM.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), defined as glucose intolerance that arises during pregnancy, has increased worldwide over the past decade, reaching up to 20% of all pregnancies depending on the diagnostic criteria (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). GDM is associated with increased risk for preeclampsia, cesarean section delivery, and preterm birth (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), with up to 50% of women developing type 2 diabetes within 10 years. Infants born to women with GDM have a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes, obesity, and other chronic inflammatory diseases (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p>
              <p>Diet is the primary treatment for GDM, and accordingly, the dynamic interactions between GDM and the maternal and infant gut microbiome have received substantial attention. The composition of the gut microbiota is altered in women with GDM during late pregnancy (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>–<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) and is associated in some cases with changes in blood glucose levels (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Women who develop GDM undergo shifts in gut microbiota composition characterized by an enrichment of potential opportunistic pathogens in the family <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic>, while beneficial bacteria like <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> or <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic> are depleted (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Higher abundances of <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> have been linked to prediabetes and untreated type 2 diabetes (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) and increased circulating levels of lipopolysaccharide in adults, which can promote the development of obesity and insulin resistance by inducing a chronic inflammatory state (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). On the other hand, <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> and <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic> produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as acetate, propionate, and butyrate, which help to decrease the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and control the overgrowth of <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> in adults (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p>
              <p>Further, maternal and early life exposures during pregnancy and lactation, such as maternal obesity or diabetes, influence the development of the infant microbiome and have an impact on the occurrence of common diseases, such as diabetes, allergic and atopic disease, cardiovascular disease, and obesity in the offspring (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Studies on the neonatal microbiome report lower richness and differences in microbial composition in infants born to women with GDM compared with women without a GDM diagnosis (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>–<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). However, to our knowledge, only one study has investigated the impact of GDM on the infant microbiome beyond 2 weeks of age (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) and no studies have investigated this paradigm between 2 weeks and 6 months of age. Evidence suggests that the microbiome within the first 2 months of life impacts immune cell development patterns up to 3 months of age (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), and others found an association between increased <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic> abundance at 3–4 months of age and childhood overweight/obesity at 1 and 3 years (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Therefore, a need exists for studies that investigate the microbiome of infants born to women with GDM within the first 4 months of life.</p>
              <p>Although diet is a major driver of microbiota composition and functions (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), the impact of maternal diet therapy in women with GDM on the maternal and infant microbiome and potential consequences of diet therapy remains unexplored. Diet therapy for women with GDM conventionally involves lower carbohydrate intake to blunt postprandial glucose excursion, at the cost of increasing dietary fats (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) since protein intake is typically constant and difficult to appreciably modify. A maternal high-fat diet, especially with an increase in saturated fats, promotes insulin resistance in human and animal models (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), can lead to increased fetal fat accretion (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), and may put the offspring at a higher risk of developing metabolic syndrome due to excess lipid exposure <italic>in utero</italic> (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Thus, alternate diets are needed to improve maternal/infant health in women with GDM without the unintended consequences that may arise from administering a high-fat CONV diet. From a microbiome perspective, a need for more highly controlled diet studies (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) is warranted to investigate the effects of dietary intervention in women with GDM and how diet impacts the maternal and infant microbiome and determine whether these alterations to the microbiome are linked to improvements in maternal and infant health outcomes. However, a previous study examining the maternal dietary effect on the maternal and infant microbiome in GDM had confounding influences of dietary intake that were not controlled (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Here, we conducted a randomized, controlled dietary intervention (RCT) in GDM, directly comparing a conventional CONV diet or a diet higher in complex carbohydrates and lower in fat [CHOICE, Choosing Healthy Options in Carbohydrate Energy (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>–<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>)]. Notably, all meals were provided for the duration of the study. The isocaloric nature of the diet was critical to ensure no differences in gestational weight gain (GWG) between diets. Furthermore, the percentage of saturated, polyunsaturated, and monounsaturated fats were identical and both simple sugars and fiber were also well controlled.</p>
              <p>In the larger RCT of 46 women and infants who completed the study, we previously found that between-group maternal glycemic profiles were nearly identical (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Although fasting free fatty acid (FFA) profiles were not different between the diet groups, the postprandial FFA profiles were lower with the CHOICE diet (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), likely suppressed by a higher postprandial insulin response. Between the diet groups, GWG was not different and insulin resistance indices were similar at 37 weeks, and the usual increase in the insulin resistance of pregnancy was blunted on both diets (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Infant adiposity by air displacement plethysmography (PEAPOD), the primary endpoint on which the RCT was powered, was also not different, and cord blood glucose, C-peptide, FFAs, and triglycerides (TGs) were similar (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). From the larger RCT of 46 women, we collected a subset of stool samples in 34 women at 30 and 37 weeks’ gestation and in 24 infants at 2 weeks, 2 months, and 4–5 months of age to examine the impact of a controlled, third-trimester diet on the maternal microbiome and on infant microbial colonization during the first 4 months of life. We hypothesized that the consumption of the CHOICE, compared with CONV, would favorably alter maternal and infant microbiome composition consistent with improvements to the maternal measures of glucose tolerance.</p>

All studies were performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. GDM was diagnosed using the Carpenter and Coustan criteria (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) between gestational weeks 24 and 28. Women were randomized to a diet group and entry criteria included the age of 20–36 years, a BMI of 26–39 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, a singleton pregnancy, no significant or obstetric comorbidities, no history of preterm labor or preeclampsia prior to term, and the treatment of GDM with diet alone. Informed consent was obtained from all women, and all women planned to breastfeed for at least 4 months and were otherwise healthy. Participants were excluded if they met any criteria for overt diabetes or were likely to fail the diet and require medical attention (fasting glucose &gt;115 mg/dl or fasting TGs &gt;400 mg/dl, which would place them at risk for TG-induced pancreatitis). Women taking beta blockers, antihypertensives, or glucocorticoids were excluded as were smokers and non-English speaking women. Maternal stool samples were excluded if they took antibiotics within 4 weeks of the sampling time. Infant stool samples were excluded if their mother received antibiotics at delivery, if they took antibiotics within 4 weeks of the stool sample collection, or if they were missing information on antibiotic use at the sample collection. From the original cohort of 46 women with GDM, 34 women in this subgroup had complete measurement data and stool samples from the study visits at 30 and 37 weeks’ gestation (n=16, CONV; n=18, CHOICE). Twenty-four infants had stool samples collected (n=14, CONV; n=10, CHOICE).</p>

                <p>The enrolled women with newly diagnosed GDM began dietary intervention between gestational weeks 30 and 31 and continued to delivery. Detailed information on the diets has been described (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Briefly, diets were eucaloric, contained similar amounts of fiber (~23.5 and ~29.3 g/day for CONV and CHOICE, respectively), and had the following macronutrient distributions: CONV, 40% complex carbohydrate/45% fat/15% protein; CHOICE, 60% complex carbohydrate/25% fat/15% protein. Both diets were matched for fat percentage (35% saturated fatty acids/45% monounsaturated fatty acids/20% polyunsaturated fatty acids) and simple sugars (≤18% of kilocalories) and were composed of foods with a low-to-moderate glycemic index. Daily kilocalories were distributed as 25% breakfast/25% lunch/30% dinner/20% snacks. We defined complex carbohydrates as “polysaccharides and starches primarily derived from grains, vegetables, and fruits that tend to attenuate a sharp postprandial rise in plasma glucose” (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). All menus were tailored to individual participant food preferences, and meals were prepared by the Clinical Translational Research Center Nutrition Services at University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus. Meals were picked up by the participants or delivered every 72 h when they met with investigators. Women were provided with formula to supplement or replace breastfeeding when necessary (Gerber Good Start, Arlington, VA, USA). <xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material"><bold>Supplementary Figure 1</bold></xref> shows a summary of the study design.</p>

                <p>Maternal blood measures were performed at two different visits at 30–31 and 36–37 weeks’ gestation. A fasting (10-h) blood sample was collected prior to a 2-h oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) at baseline (30–31 weeks) and again after 6–7 weeks on the diet (36–37 weeks). OGTT measurements were taken at 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min using a peripheral intravenous line. The Matsuda index was calculated using the standard method (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). HOMA-IR was calculated as [fasting insulin x (fasting glucose/18)]/22.5. Hepatic insulin resistance was calculated by multiplying glucose AUC by insulin AUC calculated during the first 30 min of the OGTT. GWG was determined by the change in weight from the first prenatal visit to delivery and weight gain on diet by the change in weight from time of diet randomization to delivery. Additional blood measures (i.e., TGs, FFAs, glycerol, glucose, C-peptide, and insulin) were performed at breakfast meal studies at baseline and 36–37 weeks’ gestation, where participants consumed a standardized breakfast meal (30% of total daily energy intake) after an overnight fast (≥10 h) as previously (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). When possible, cord blood was obtained to measure infant C-peptide, glucose, insulin, and HOMA-IR.</p>

The delivery mode was recorded as vaginal, cesarean section with labor, or cesarean section without labor; however, we grouped the cesarean section variables together due to low sample size. Birth weight and infant anthropometrics were obtained and newborn percent body fat was measured by air displacement plethysmography (PEAPOD) at delivery and the 2-week, 2-month, and 4–5 month postpartum visits (COSMED, Rome, Italy) (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>).</p>

                <title>Stool sample collection and metagenomics processing</title>
                <p>Maternal stool samples were collected at 30–31 and 36–37 weeks’ gestation by mothers within 24 h of their clinic visit and stored at -20°C until delivery to the laboratory, whereupon aliquots were separated and stored at -80°C until analysis. Infant stool samples were obtained at 2 weeks, 2 months, and 4–5 months, and DNA extraction was carried out as previously described using the QIAamp PowerFecal DNA kit (Qiagen Inc, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Triplicate shotgun metagenomic libraries were constructed for each stool sample (except for one pair of maternal samples, which was sequenced in duplicate) using the plexWell LP384 kit (seqWell Inc., Beverly, MA, USA) following the manufacturer’s protocol. The shotgun metagenomic sequencing of the pooled libraries was performed on the NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) at 2 × 150-bp read length by Novogene Inc. (Sacramento, CA, USA). Raw sequence reads were trimmed and processed for quality using BBMap (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Briefly, the default options in bbduk were used to remove the adapter sequence and quality trimming before removing contaminant sequences with the Kmer filtering option. The tadpole command was then used in the error correction mode using default parameters. The triplicate/duplicate runs were then concatenated for further processing. The average sequencing depth, average number of contigs, and average contig length are shown in <xref rid="ST1" ref-type="supplementary-material"><bold>Supplementary Table 1</bold></xref>. Metaphlan2 was used to retrieve the taxonomy and relative abundances using default settings (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). The participants’ sequence libraries at all timepoints were further concatenated for contig assembly using MEGAHIT (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>).

                  <title>Modeling</title>
                  <p>Models were constructed at the family level of taxonomy using alpha diversity, beta diversity, and taxonomic abundances—a deeper insight into species-level differences in taxonomic abundances was also calculated. Gene annotation abundances were investigated using the same modeling procedures. To evaluate these models, we used the function lmer from the lme4 package (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>) for alpha diversity and the gene annotation data (linear mixed effects models), adonis2 from the vegan package for beta diversity (PERMANOVA),and glmmer.nb from the lme4 package for taxonomic abundance comparisons (negative binomial regression). For each dataset, modeling was performed as follows: 1) our simplest model included the diet group, sampling timepoint, and the interaction of diet group and sample timepoint within the framework of a repeated-measures design. 2) Additional models were built by adding a single explanatory variable to the simple model (12 additional models in the maternal analysis and four in the infant analysis). 3) A full model was constructed by adding all variables into one multivariate regression. The corrected Akaike information criterion (AICc) was computed for each of the models, where a lower AICc is indicative of a better model fit and an AICc score of 2 or lower suggests a significantly better model fit (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). 4) If multiple explanatory variables from (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) had AICc scores 2 or lower than the simple model, the variables were added to a model together with group and time, and the AICc was calculated once more. 5) If there was a large difference between the AICc scores used in (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), the variable from (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) within the best-fitting model (i.e., the one with the lowest AICc) and variables in models within 2 AICc scores of the best-fitting model were included together in an additional model and the AICc again calculated. Once computed, the AICc scores were compared and the lowest AICc model was used for statistical analysis. If there were multiple models within 2 AICc points of each other, the simpler model of the two was used (e.g., if a model from (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) was close in AICc to our simple model (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>), we would choose the simple model). If both models are equally parsimonious, the lower AICc model was chosen. If a model failed to converge or was found to be singular between the taxon and the variable of interest, the model was discarded.</p>
                  <p>Once the final models were calculated, the P-values were compiled and corrected for the false discovery rate (FDR) using the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure. AICc was calculated using the MuMIn package (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>), except for the adonis2 models, which used a custom R script to calculate AICc from the residual sums of squares (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). In the negative binomial regression models, taxa at the family and species levels were included in the modeling if they were present in at least 60% of the samples and had at least 5,000 reads summed across all samples. The number of OTUS and percent read coverage after applying these filtering procedures are shown in <xref rid="ST1" ref-type="supplementary-material"><bold>Supplementary Table 1</bold></xref>. To define the gene annotation based on mapping genes in the KEGG Orthology database, we used KEGG orthologous terms present in at least 60% of the samples, where they were then summed into gene families for further analysis using lmer.</p>

                <title>Maternal microbial and gene-annotation diversity did not differ between the diet groups and were not associated with any maternal measures</title>
                <p>We first evaluated whether the overall structure of the maternal microbiome was altered by the dietary intervention. To this end, we assessed the significance of alpha- and beta-diversity measures from maternal stool samples at the family, species, and gene annotation levels. At the family level, both alpha diversity metrics—Shannon diversity and Chao1 (richness)—were best modeled by the simplest model, which included only the diet group, time, and their interaction. However, none of these variables were significantly associated with either alpha diversity metric (p&gt;0.05) (<xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material"><bold>Supplementary Figure 2</bold></xref>). At the species level, Shannon diversity was best modeled by the simplest model, but no terms were significant (p&gt;0.05) (<xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material"><bold>Supplementary Figure 3</bold></xref>). Chao1 was best modeled by the full model, which included the diet group, time, and their interaction as well as all 11 of the maternal measurements. However, none of these variables were significantly associated with Chao1 richness at the species level (p&gt;0.05). At the gene annotation level, we found results similar to those of the microbiome at the species level, where Shannon diversity was best modeled by the simplest model, but no terms were significant (p&gt;0.05), and Chao1 was best modeled by the full model, but no terms were significant (p&gt;0.05) (<xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material"><bold>Supplementary Figure 4</bold></xref>).</p>
                <p>In the family level, beta-diversity models, the simplest model fit the data best, but the diet group, time, and their interaction were not associated with maternal microbiome beta diversity (p&gt;0.05) (<xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material"><bold>Supplementary Figure 5</bold></xref>). Similar results were found at the species (simplest model, all p&gt;0.05) and gene annotation levels (full model, all p&gt;0.05) (<xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material"><bold>Supplementary Figures 6 and 7</bold></xref>).</p>

                  <title>Maternal microbiome displayed moderate associations with diet and maternal measures at the family level</title>
                  <p>Next, we identified individual taxa with differential abundances in maternal microbiota at the family level and found several taxa associated with maternal measures (<xref rid="T3" ref-type="table"><bold>Table 3</bold></xref> and <xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material"><bold>Supplementary Figure 8</bold></xref>). We found that <italic>Rikenellaceae</italic> was negatively associated with maternal fasting FFA levels (p=0.02). Other associations were found between <italic>Bifidobacteriaceae</italic> and insulin AUC and an increase in <italic>Bifidobacteriaceae</italic> abundance over time on CHOICE but a decrease on CONV. However, these associations did not survive FDR correction. Likewise, we found that <italic>Prevotellaceae</italic> abundance was positively associated with the Matsuda index and <italic>Erysipelotrichaceae</italic> was similarly associated with HOMA-IR, but these associations did not survive FDR correction.

                  <p>At the species level, we found that several taxa were associated with maternal diet and other maternal measures (<xref rid="T4" ref-type="table"><bold>Table 4</bold></xref> and <xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material"><bold>Supplementary Figure 9</bold></xref>). <italic>Bifidobacterium adolescentis</italic> was the main species responsible for the <italic>Bifidobacteriaceae</italic> increase on CHOICE and decrease on CONV (p=0.02). Similarly, <italic>Prevotella copri</italic> showed a trend decrease on CHOICE but increase on CONV (p=0.07). Two species of <italic>Alistipes</italic> were differentially associated with fasting glucose levels, with <italic>A. finegoldii</italic> displaying a negative relationship (p=0.04) while <italic>A. shahii</italic> had a positive relationship (p=0.03). <italic>A. shaii</italic>, <italic>A. finegoldii</italic>, <italic>Alistipes putredinis</italic>, and <italic>Bacteroides vulgatus</italic> were all negatively associated with fasting glycerol levels, but the association with <italic>A. shahii</italic> did not survive FDR correction. Four species, <italic>Streptococcus thermophilus, Eubacterium ramulus, Dorea longicatena</italic>, and <italic>Roseburia hominis</italic> were associated with glucose AUC after the OGTT challenge. However, only the association with <italic>E. ramulus</italic> was significant (p&lt;0.001), while the others showed trend associations after FDR correction (p&lt;0.1).

                  <p>Next, we evaluated the overall structure of the infant microbiome and whether it was altered by maternal dietary intervention. We assessed the significance of alpha- and beta-diversity measures in the infant stool samples at the family, species, and gene annotation levels. At the family level, we found no association between Shannon diversity and diet group, infant age, or the interaction of the two terms (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 1A</bold></xref>). The infant microbiome Chao1 index decreased over time in CONV infants and increased in CHOICE infants (p=0.009), resulting in a significantly higher richness score in the CHOICE infants compared with CONV at 4–5 months (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 1B</bold></xref>). Cesarean section delivery was associated with increased microbiome richness compared with infants born by vaginal delivery (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 1C</bold></xref>). At the species level, Shannon diversity was associated with a trend increase over time (p=0.06), while the Chao1 index was not associated with any terms (p&gt;0.05), as best modeled by the full model (diet, age, diet/age interaction and GWG, delivery mode, breastfeeding status, and sex) (<xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material"><bold>Supplementary Figure 10</bold></xref>). At the gene annotation level, results were similar to those found at the species level, and no terms were significant for the simplest model in Shannon diversity (p&gt;0.05) or for the full model in the Chao1 index (p&gt;0.05) (<xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material"><bold>Supplementary Figure 11</bold></xref>).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>To our knowledge, this is the first study to compare maternal and infant gut microbiome outcomes in a dietary intervention of two different diet compositions (all meals provided) in women with GDM. We ascertained how the diets impacted the maternal gut microbiome and the relationships with maternal metabolic characteristics and the infant microbiome under eucaloric diet conditions and equivalent GWG. Surprisingly, we found that the probiotic family <italic>Bifidobacteriaceae</italic>, specifically <italic>B. adolescentis</italic>, increased in the microbiota of women on the CHOICE diet. <italic>Bifidobacteria</italic> are generally beneficial bacteria that attenuate intestinal inflammation and dysbiosis, in part by enhancing SCFA production (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), inhibiting and reducing lipopolysaccharide-induced injury of the gut epithelium (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>), and by metabolizing resistant starches such as human milk oligosaccharides and other complex carbohydrates like fructooligosaccharides and galactooligosaccharides (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). <italic>B. adolescentis</italic> abundance is correlated with lower HbA1c and basal insulin requirements (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>), suggesting that it conveys an overall protective effect of the CHOICE diet on pancreatic β-cell function in women with GDM. Others have found similar increases in <italic>Bifidobacteria</italic> after supplementing adults with prediabetes with galactooligosaccharides for 12 weeks (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). Furthermore, other studies suggest that the supplementation of resistant starches in healthy adults also increases <italic>Bifidobacteria</italic> (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>), while the depletion of dietary carbohydrates in a gluten-free diet results in a likewise depletion of <italic>Bifidobacteria</italic> (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). Together, this suggests that higher intake of complex carbohydrates in the diet, in pregnant and non-pregnant individuals, increases <italic>Bifidobacteriaceae</italic> abundance in the microbiome.</p>
              <p>The maternal microbiome at the family and species levels also varied significantly with the fasting levels of FFAs, glycerol, and glucose AUC after the OGTT challenge. Specifically, we found a negative association between <italic>Rikenellaceae</italic> and fasting FFAs. Other studies in adults have found an inverse association between this family and the levels of visceral adipose tissue in elderly adults (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>), a negative association with obesity (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>), and depleted abundance in adults with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). Interestingly, species within the genus <italic>Alistipes</italic>, part of the family <italic>Rikenellaceae</italic>, were inversely associated with fasting glycerol and fasting glucose levels but not FFAs. <italic>A. finegoldii</italic> and <italic>A. putredinis</italic> were negatively associated with fasting glycerol levels along with <italic>B. vulgatus</italic>. Blood glycerol levels are a measure of adipose tissue lipolysis and TGs (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>) and feed directly into the gluconeogenesis pathway. Together, our data suggest that bacteria in the family <italic>Rikenellaceae</italic> help lower FFAs, but specific members of the family (i.e., <italic>Alisitpes</italic>) have a relationship with a different part of the same pathway, notably fasting glycerol and glucose levels.</p>
              <p><italic>B. uniformis</italic> was positively associated with HOMA-IR in our cohort, although this was only a trend association after FDR correction. Supplementation studies have found that <italic>B. uniformis</italic> can reduce body weight gain, liver TGs, and inflammation in the context of a high-fat diet in mice (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>, <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). However, in humans with metabolic syndrome, increases in the stool levels of <italic>B. uniformis</italic> had no effect on body composition or insulin sensitivity (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>). Pregnant women with type 1 diabetes have increased abundance of <italic>B. uniformis</italic> (<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>). More work needs to be done to elucidate the role of <italic>B. uniformis</italic> in diabetes risk.</p>
              <p>Maternal diet significantly impacted the patterns of infant colonization over time, with CHOICE infants showing increased microbiome alpha diversity (richness), greater <italic>Clostridiaceae</italic>, and decreased <italic>Enterococcaceae</italic>. To our knowledge, there are only two studies that have investigated the impact of maternal diet on the infant microbiome in humans. Lundgren et al. (<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>) observed that increased maternal fruit and vegetable intake was associated with higher levels of <italic>Streptococcus</italic> and <italic>Clostridium</italic> and decreased abundances of <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> in offspring at 6 weeks of age. Chu et al. (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) found that a maternal diet higher in fat was associated with greater <italic>Enterococcus</italic> abundance in the meconium and higher <italic>Bacteroides</italic> abundance in infants at 6 weeks of age. We found a similar result in our cohort, where <italic>Enterococcaceae</italic> abundance was increased in infants born to mothers on the higher-fat CONV diet. <italic>Enterococcaceae</italic>, like <italic>E. faecalis</italic>, is known to influence healthy intestinal immune system development, but the members of this family can also act as opportunistic pathogens (<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>). In healthy infants, this family decreased in abundance as other bacteria began to colonize and populate the gut, suggesting that early <italic>Enterococcaceae</italic> colonization is important for proper immune training but an overabundance in the early life could increase the risk of <italic>Enterococcus</italic> infection.</p>
              <p>The abundances of infant microbiome species were impacted by the maternal diet group as the infant aged. For example, <italic>C. perfringens</italic> was enriched in the gut of CONV infants; a relative abundance of 1.43% and 0.36% was observed at 2 months and 4–5 months of age, respectively. In contrast, <italic>C. perfringens</italic> started at a higher abundance at 2 weeks of age in CHOICE infants before dropping to 0.03% relative abundance at 2 and 4–5 months. Other groups have associated cesarean section delivery with a higher abundance of <italic>C. perfringens</italic> (<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>), which is consistent with our results. Moreover, the microbiome of germ-free mice colonized with gut microbes from infants born to women with obesity was enriched in <italic>Clostridia</italic> (<xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>) and the enrichment of this taxa has been associated with adolescent obesity (<xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>). This suggests that the higher-fat CONV diet exacerbated obesity-associated microbiome signals within a population that is already at risk for adverse health events due to the maternal GDM status. We found an association between a higher abundance of <italic>Lactobacillaceae</italic> and cesarean section delivery, which is surprising considering that vaginally delivered infants have a much higher exposure to vaginal <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> species compared with cesarean section–delivered infants. However, a recent systematic review by Shaterian et al. concluded that cesarean section delivery is associated with a higher abundance of <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> in the first 3 months of life, while vaginally delivered infants have higher abundances of this taxa after 3 months of age (<xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>), which matches our results. Moreover, gut <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> species do not appear to originate from the maternal vaginal microbiome (<xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>), likely due to differences in species-specific adaptations needed to colonize the vagina versus the human gastrointestinal tract. Together, this suggests that the delivery mode impacts <italic>Lactobacillaceae</italic> colonization not because of the direct transmission of <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> from a mother to a child but because of differential successional patterns of colonization prompted by early bacterial exposures. In our other comparisons, we the family <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic> was positively associated with maternal GWG and was predicted to increase in relative abundance by 0.5% for each kilogram increase in GWG. Other studies have noted a positive association between maternal overweight/obesity and infant <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic> abundance (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), which was linked to infant risk for overweight/obesity later in life (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). More studies are needed to determine whether individual genera/species within <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic> are contributing to infant adiposity and whether specific metabolites produced by this family are responsible for this association with overweight/obesity risk in offspring.</p>
              <p>Two species in infant stool were associated with the breastfeeding status: <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> and <italic>S. anginosus</italic>, both of which were enriched in the gut of infants who were exclusively breastfed. <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> is acquired from skin and can be found in breastmilk, may play a role in educating the immune system and can act as an opportunistic pathogen in neonates (<xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>). Less is known about the role of <italic>S. anginosus</italic> in the commensal human gut, although it has been shown to be a common member of the skin, respiratory, and intestinal microbiomes and has the potential to cause infection (<xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>). Breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life is the recommended practice to optimally support infant survival, nutrition, and development (<xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>). Our results suggest that exclusive breastfeeding results in distinct communities in the infant gut and increases the abundance of bacteria important for immune training.</p>
              <p>A major strength of our RCT study is that the mothers were well matched, the study design allowed for well-controlled dietary constituents that impact the microbiome (fiber, calories, all meals provided), and GWG was nearly identical. We also controlled for antibiotic exposure, excluding any maternal or infant stool sample when antibiotics were reported within 4 weeks of collection. Importantly, we collected maternal and infant stool samples at several timepoints, allowing us to interrogate how the maternal diet group related to changes in the microbiome across gestation and infant age. Another strength is that the gut microbiota of study participants was not confounded by anti-hyperglycemic agents. Our trial also had certain limitations, including the small sample size and the predominantly Caucasian participants, and thus needs confirmation in a larger RCT including women with different ethnicities. Additionally, due to limitations inherent in macronutrient research, we cannot be certain that the differences reported in women on CHOICE are due to a higher intake of carbohydrates rather than a lower intake of fats. However, we emphasize carbohydrate intake in this study since the administration of complex carbohydrates to women with GDM makes this study unique and provides an alternative to the higher-fat CONV GDM diet. Although the infant sample size was small, all results were corrected for FDR, and subspecies occurrence with divergent functionalities was identified with metagenomic sequencing. Many of the bacteria investigated were, on average, less than a percent of the total relative abundance in the participants’ microbiome. While the higher-abundance taxa will interact more with the host and gut environment, rare taxa have been shown to disproportionately contribute to shifts in a microbiome community over time (<xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>) and may act as metabolic keystones to bridge gaps between the functional repertoires of the microbiome as a whole (<xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>). The entire study cohort was powered to detect differences in postprandial FFA AUC, placental FATP2 expression, and neonatal adiposity (primary outcome) between groups. However, this subanalysis of the study trial may not be adequately powered to detect small differences in microbiota abundances and should thus be interpreted with caution. As this was an exploratory study, more work needs to be done in a larger cohort. In addition, although the two groups were extremely well matched for age, BMI, parity, and ethnic distribution (see <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>), we cannot exclude other socioeconomic factors or unknown environment differences in the two cohorts. The goal of these studies was to recruit, to the greatest extent possible, women with similar starting metabolic characteristics, the ability to follow their diets (compliance), and without the need to go on to require insulin therapy. More work needs to be done to elucidate the roles of rare taxa in the maintenance of a healthy microbiome and the functional pathways in a larger cohort, despite their relative rarity.</p>
              <p>Overall, our results show that an isocaloric diet high in complex carbohydrates and low in fat consumed by women with GDM is associated with a bacterial environment that is metabolically favorable, demonstrating greater bacterial diversity and a reduction in potential pathogens in infants during the first 4 months of life. Improving the gut microbiome diversity and reducing opportunistic pathogens capable of playing a role in obesity and immune system dysbiosis suggest the exciting possibility of using a targeted intervention to modulate these taxa and modify disease progression in a precision medicine–based approach in future studies. The potential implications of the abundance of these taxa for overall metabolic health across various phenotypes of infants from women with GDM await further elucidation.</p>
