                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Although <italic>Lactobacillus rhamnosus</italic> GG ATCC 53103 (LGG) has been consumed by 2 to 5 million people daily since the mid 1990s, there are few clinical trials describing potential harms of LGG, particularly in the elderly.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Objectives</title>
                  <p>The primary objective of this open label clinical trial is to assess the safety and tolerability of 1×10<sup>10</sup> colony forming units (CFU) of LGG administered orally twice daily to elderly volunteers for 28 days. The secondary objectives were to evaluate the effects of LGG on the gastrointestinal microbiome, host immune response and plasma cytokines.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Fifteen elderly volunteers, aged 66–80 years received LGG capsules containing 1×10<sup>10</sup> CFU, twice daily for 28 days and were followed through day 56. Volunteers completed a daily diary, a telephone call on study days 3, 7 and 14 and study visits in the Clinical Research Center at baseline, day 28 and day 56 to determine whether adverse events had occurred.

                  <p>There were no serious adverse events. The 15 volunteers had a total of 47 events (range 1–7 per volunteer), 39 (83%) of which were rated as mild and 40% of which were considered related to consuming LGG. Thirty-one (70%) of the events were expected, prompted symptoms while 16 were unexpected events. The most common adverse events were gastrointestinal (bloating, gas, and nausea), 27 rated as mild and 3 rated as moderate. In the exploratory analysis, the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 8 decreased during LGG consumption, returning towards baseline one month after discontinuing LGG (p = 0.038) while there was no difference in other pro- or anti-inflammatory plasma cytokines.</p>

              <p>Probiotics are live microorganisms which confer a health benefit on the host when administered in adequate amounts <xref rid="pone.0113456-Joint1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Until recently, probiotics were mostly found in yogurts and fermented milks, but probiotics are increasingly being found in a wide range of non-dairy drinks, nutrition bars, breakfast cereals, infant formula, relishes, condiments, sweeteners, candy, and pizza crust <xref rid="pone.0113456-NIH1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Probiotics are also sold as dietary supplements in capsules, tablets and powders and are widely available in drug stores, health food shops, supermarkets and on the Internet. The range of organisms that are sold as probiotics is ever increasing, as are the types of products containing probiotics, the health benefits that they are supposed to provide, and the volume of probiotic products being sold <xref rid="pone.0113456-Nandhini1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p>
              <p>Probiotics have been receiving more attention from the scientific community, mostly as a result of the Human Microbiome Project that is studying culture independent methods to characterize microbial communities in the oral cavity, skin, vagina, gut and respiratory tract as well as the metabolic profiles produced by these microbial communities <xref rid="pone.0113456-Human1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0113456-Gevers1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. To date, the Human Microbiome Project has mostly focused on the differences in the microbial communities and metabolic profiles in health and disease states. This analytic approach is of great interest to understanding whether probiotics can or cannot be designed to establish or restore a “healthy” microbiome/metabolome across the lifespan <xref rid="pone.0113456-Turnbaugh1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0113456-Petschow1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Concurrently, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued guidance indicating that an investigational new drug (IND) application is needed when live microorganisms are used to treat or prevent disease <xref rid="pone.0113456-Food1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Even for probiotics that have been in widespread use as foods or dietary supplements, studies assessing clinical effects must comply with FDA product quality and follow standard drug development procedures. This requirement is supported by the Southern California Evidence-based Practice Center (EPC) report on the safety of probiotics to reduce risk and prevent or treat disease <xref rid="pone.0113456-Hempel1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> which concluded that there has been a lack of assessment and systematic reporting of adverse events in the published trials and the literature is “not well equipped to answer questions on the safety of probiotic interventions with confidence” <xref rid="pone.0113456-Hempel1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p>
              <p><italic>Lactobacillus rhamnosus</italic> GG ATCC 53103 (LGG) is one of the most studied probiotics. LGG is a commensal bacteria that occurs naturally in the human gastrointestinal tract and was originally isolated by Drs. Gorbach and Goldin in 1983 and patented as a probiotic in 1985, based in part on its ability to resist acid and bile so that it would survive transit through the stomach and the intestines and its ability to attach to the intestinal mucosa <xref rid="pone.0113456-Gorbach1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Its precise pharmacologic effects and mechanisms of action are not known but include colonization resistance in the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts <xref rid="pone.0113456-Wong1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113456-Hudault1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>; immune modulation <xref rid="pone.0113456-Miettinen1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0113456-Fang1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> and direct antimicrobial effects <xref rid="pone.0113456-Ocana1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0113456-LievinLe1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. LGG is reported to be effective in preventing and treating diarrhea and other conditions <xref rid="pone.0113456-Floch1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113456-Floch2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. It is also promising for the prevention of respiratory tract infections in adults and young children <xref rid="pone.0113456-King1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. LGG, like other lactobacilli, are rarely pathogenic, although there are rare case reports of LGG causing invasive disease, mostly in immunocompromised patients or those with indwelling catheters who were consuming LGG <xref rid="pone.0113456-Land1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0113456-Zein1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. However, based on the Southern California EPC's concerns, information on the safety profile of LGG could be improved.</p>
              <p>Based on the immunomodulatory properties of LGG, its role as a possible mucosally administered vaccine adjuvant <xref rid="pone.0113456-Licciardi1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0113456-Davidson1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, and suboptimal influenza vaccine efficacy in the elderly <xref rid="pone.0113456-Jefferson1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, we were funded by the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine at NIH in 2006 to conduct a randomized trial of the probiotic LGG to evaluate its effect on the immune response to the inactivated and live attenuated influenza vaccine in healthy elderly volunteers. The FDA Center for Biological Evaluation and Research [FDA/CBER] asked us to complete a Phase I open label study under IND to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the use of LGG in healthy elderly volunteers, without administration of the influenza vaccine, prior to studying the effect of LGG on inactivated and live attenuated influenza vaccine. The development of this probiotic intervention is under FDA oversight that regulates “fit for intended purpose” product labeling and improved quality control. We conducted the FDA/CBER required Phase I open label study in healthy elderly paying particular attention to the CONSORT Statement Extension of better reporting of harms in randomized trials <xref rid="pone.0113456-Ioannidis1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> and the recent call for improvements in adverse event reporting <xref rid="pone.0113456-Hodkinson1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113456-Maggi1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>.</p>
              <p>The primary aim of this Phase I open label study was to provide information on adverse events that may occur in healthy elderly volunteers receiving LGG administered twice a day for 28 days. The secondary aims were to evaluate potential mechanisms of action of LGG in the healthy elderly by studying their gastrointestinal microbiome (C Fraser, manuscript in preparation) as well as immunologic responses to consumption of LGG for 28 days (G Solano-Aguilar, manuscript in preparation). This paper describes the detailed adverse event profile of the elderly volunteers and their serum cytokine profiles, particularly changes in pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines <xref rid="pone.0113456-Mirpuri1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>.</p>

                <p>Study volunteers were seen in the MGH Clinical Research Centers according to the schedule shown in <xref rid="pone-0113456-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. On December 1, 2010 we started phone screening for study volunteers. The last volunteer exited the study on August 5, 2011. Prior to the screening visit, all volunteers were informed about the study and, if interested in proceeding, they provided written, informed consent to participate, as well as consent for testing for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), because of the low, but possible, risk of developing invasive LGG infection in HIV infected individuals. They were also informed that screening laboratory tests included testing for Hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg) and Hepatitis C antibody (anti-HCV) as well as for illicit drugs and alcohol. Subjects were informed that positive tests for HIV, HbsAg or anti-HCV and Hepatitis C would be reported to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. Study physicians (PLH, MH) conducted all study visits.</p>

Volunteers who were eligible to participate after screening, based on review of all study data and laboratory tests, were informed of their status by the study coordinator within 7 days of the screening visit, and the baseline visit was scheduled (within 30 days of the screening visit). Ineligible volunteers were contacted as soon as possible by a study physician. Volunteers testing positive for HIV were asked to return for an additional visit so that the study physician could explain the test result, provide information and refer them for further counseling and evaluation. All volunteers with abnormal laboratories received a copy of their results so that they could discuss them with their primary care physician.</p>

We collected stool specimens for microbiome studies prior to LGG administration. Volunteers were given instructions and materials to properly collect a stool specimen, including that the specimen should be collected no more than 24 hours before the appointment, no urine should enter the specimen container, and once the specimen is collected it is to be stored in a provided Sytrofoam box surrounded by frozen gel packs. Stool specimens were refrigerated upon arrival at the Clinical Research Center until they could be processed and aliquotted by the laboratory later on the same day. Fresh stool aliquots were sent for LGG culture and colony counts, and the remaining aliquots were frozen at −80°C for batched LGG PCR and metagenomics and metatranscriptomics prior to LGG administration. Participating volunteers received their first dose of LGG under observation of the study physicians, prior to discharge. They were instructed to take 2 capsules of LGG a day for 28 days. Extra capsules were dispensed to check product quality – one capsule was sent for LGG culture and colony counts. Volunteers were reminded to contact the study physician or study coordinator at any time regarding any study related issues, including any symptoms or adverse events.

If the dates an event was reported did not match, the event was assigned to all of the days on which it was reported. Study physicians used the FDA Toxicity Grading Scales to grade event severity, but if an event was not described in the tables, severity was defined as follows:</p>

                </list>
                <p>For each event, study physicians reported the maximum severity during the course of the event and assessed its relationship to administration of LGG as either not related to LGG administration, remotely related (e.g. similar to events reported to have occurred before the trial), possibly related (temporally related to administration of LGG but possibly related to the volunteer's prior history), probably related (temporally related to administration of LGG and cannot be reasonably explained by the volunteer's prior history) or highly probably related (occurs immediately on ingestion of LGG). We also calculated the number of days on which each adverse event occurred during the 56 day observation period to address timing and duration of events reported once and recurrent events. Adverse events were reviewed by both study physicians during weekly meetings to ensure consistency of identification and assessment of adverse events.</p>
                <p>An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board, consisting of an Infectious Disease physician, a Gastroenterologist, and a Statistician monitored safety throughout the study. The DSMB met prior to subject enrollment and then approximately every 6 months until all volunteers completed the study.

LBS plates were incubated at 37°C in an anaerobic chamber (5% CO<sub>2</sub>, 10% H<sub>2</sub>, 85% N<sub>2</sub>) for 48 hours. Typical white, creamy LGG colonies with a distinct buttery smell <xref rid="pone.0113456-Clinical2" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref> were easily distinguishable from other lactobacilli on LBS agar. These colonies were counted in duplicate and the average result was reported as CFU/g of stool or capsule.

All volunteers had at least one adverse event (<xref rid="pone-0113456-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="pone-0113456-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>, 31 (70%) of the events were expected, prompted symptoms (30 of which were gastrointestinal complaints – predominantly bloating, gas, nausea) while 16 were unexpected and unrelated events. Of the 31 expected events, 28 were rated as mild and 3 as moderate. Thirty-seven (79%) were detected by volunteer self-report either on the symptom diary, telephone interview, or during the study visit. The additional 10 adverse events were 2 abnormal vital signs (a mildly elevated systolic blood pressure of 144 mm Hg and a mildly low systolic and diastolic blood pressure of 94/38 mm Hg close to this volunteer's normal blood pressure) and 8 abnormal laboratory tests in the mild range including 2 hemoglobin levels of 11.7 and 11.8 mg/dL, 2 glucose levels of 68 and 111 mg/dL, 3 blood urea nitrogen levels of 26, 27 and 30 mg/dL and 1 white blood cell count of 11.1×10<sup>3</sup>/µL. There was one severe, unexpected, unrelated event that occurred in one volunteer with a remote history of kidney stones who had a recurrence of kidney stones starting on study day 20. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0113456.s004">Results S1</xref> shows the timing and duration of the <italic>expected symptoms</italic> only during and after receipt of LGG. The 15 volunteers had a total of 124 days of prompted symptoms during the study, 67 (54%) while consuming LGG and 57 (46%) after LGG consumption, during the follow-up period. Ninety-four percent (116) of symptoms were transient, lasting minutes and required no treatment. There were 97 days (78% of the 124) when prompted gastrointestinal symptoms occurred, 67 during LGG consumption and 30 during the follow-up period. One-third (22) of the 67 days when transient and mild prompted GI symptoms occurred were during the first week of LGG consumption.</p>

One volunteer lost her capsules and could not provide any information on how many capsules she consumed. LGG was recovered in the stool of 11/15 (73%) volunteers at the end of the treatment period (study day 28) although the colony counts in the stool varied widely from 1.4×10<sup>3</sup> to 1.3×10<sup>8</sup>.

In the exploratory analysis, not adjusted for multiple comparisons, only the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 8 (IL-8) changed over time decreasing in association with LGG consumption (day 28) and returning towards baseline on day 56, using a Friedman test that compared all three timepoints (p = 0.038). The post-hoc Wilcoxon-Nemenyi-McDonald-Thompson test showed that IL-8 was significantly lower on day 28 versus day 56 (p = 0.029), but the differences between baseline and day 28 and baseline and day 56 IL-8 were not significantly different. There was no difference in any other pro- or anti-inflammatory cytokines over time.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Administration of the dose of 1×10<sup>10</sup> CFU of LGG twice daily was well tolerated by healthy elderly volunteers during 420 patient-days of LGG treatment and 420 patient-days of follow-up without LGG treatment, with no serious adverse events or significant harms. LGG was associated with mild and transient gastrointestinal symptoms in the first week of LGG administration and these symptoms did not interfere with the daily functions of the elderly volunteers involved in this study. Most of the gastrointestinal symptoms after the first week appeared intermittently during LGG treatment and during the follow-up period without any specific pattern relating to LGG consumption. Gas was the most common symptom and was responsible for the most days with symptoms. Mild and transient gas during the first week of LGG treatment was likely related to the administration of LGG, but symptoms of gas after the first 7 days were less likely associated with LGG consumption, particularly for gas occurring after LGG was discontinued. There were no clinically relevant changes on physical examination or laboratory tests. Although safety profiles of probiotics are likely to be strain specific, it is reassuring that these results are similar to those reported by Manglat et al <xref rid="pone.0113456-Mangalat1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref> and Oberhelman et al <xref rid="pone.0113456-Oberhelman1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref> in randomized masked trials of Lactobacillus <italic>reuteri</italic> DSM 17938 in younger adults. This study adds to the literature as there are few reports of use of LGG in individuals aged 65 and older.</p>
              <p>LGG was only cultured in stool samples on day 28 (last day of treatment), indicating that colonization with LGG, if it occurs, is likely transient. This result is consistent with prior studies <xref rid="pone.0113456-Bousvaros1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113456-Saxelin1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref> that indicate that within 4 weeks of discontinuing LGG, it can no longer be detected in stool by routine culture or polymerase chain reaction (PCR). It is possible that LGG could have fallen to levels below the limits of detection by day 56. However, there were no harms related to LGG administration between day 28 and 56 during the follow-up period after the completion of LGG.</p>
              <p>The effect of probiotics, including LGG, on cytokines has been variable and effects in in vitro systems and animal models may not be relevant to plasma levels in humans. Cytokine responses in human studies may also be influenced by underlying illness and may not be relevant to the study of the effects in healthy individuals. The effects of probiotics are also likely to be strain specific and may vary depending on underlying illnesses or presence of inflammatory stimuli. However, some studies in model systems report either increases of anti-inflammatory cytokines or decreases of pro-inflammatory cytokines <xref rid="pone.0113456-Mirpuri1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113456-Donato1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref> in association with exposure to LGG; one study specifically showed down-regulated IL-8 production <xref rid="pone.0113456-Lopez1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>.</p>
              <p>Breen et al reported wide variations in cytokine levels using different kits and assay systems <xref rid="pone.0113456-Breen1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. For this reason, great effort was placed on obtaining the plasma, promptly freezing the samples, using a single diagnostic kit for batched analysis and focusing on changes in plasma cytokines, rather than analysis of the absolute levels. It is intriguing that our preliminary study showed a decrease in plasma pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-8 at the end of LGG consumption with IL-8 levels returning to pretreatment levels on study day 56. This result needs evaluation in larger randomized trials. There was no association between any adverse event and subjects who did or did not lower their plasma IL-8 levels after consuming LGG, although the power to detect any difference was limited by the small sample size. Although not statistically significant, there was a similar magnitude of increase in plasma anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-13 on day 28. Future studies are needed to evaluate whether a potential mechanism of action of LGG in healthy adults is a reduction in systemic inflammation by decreasing pro-inflammatory cytokines and or increasing anti-inflammatory cytokines. Studies are also needed to evaluate other mechanisms of action in patients with acute and chronic illnesses.</p>
              <p>Our study has several limitations. First, as requested by the FDA, our study used an open label design, so our volunteers knew they were receiving LGG and this may have affected their reporting of adverse events. However, there were no serious adverse events and the majority of events were mild and of short duration, suggesting that LGG is unlikely to cause significant harms in the elderly. Second, although every effort was made to encourage our volunteers to be compliant with the protocol (e.g. taking study drug, avoiding products that contain probiotics, etc.) and to record on the daily diary if study drug was not taken, we do not know whether subjects followed these instructions throughout the entire 28 day study period. However, we did include capsule counts and stool cultures for LGG which provided some evidence of compliance in at least 11 of the 15 study subjects. Third, our cytokine result suggesting that LGG is associated with decreased levels of IL-8 is exploratory and not adjusted for multiple comparisons and needs to be confirmed in additional studies.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, this study that follows the CONSORT Statement Extension of better reporting of harms in randomized trials <xref rid="pone.0113456-Ioannidis1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> demonstrates that <italic>Lactobacillus rhamnosus</italic> GG ATCC 53103 (LGG) is safe and well tolerated in healthy adults aged 65 years and older.</p>
