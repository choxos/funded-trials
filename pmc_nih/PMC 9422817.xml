This study investigates whether the combination of trametinib (T) with durvalumab (D) can alter the immune tumor microenvironment (TME) by successfully priming and activating T-cells.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Open-label, single-center, phase II trial with primary endpoint of immune-related response rate for combination of T+D in refractory MSS mCRC pts (NCT03428126). T is 2 mg/day orally starting 1 week prior to D, which is given 1500 mg intravenously every 4 weeks. Simon 2-stage design used to enroll 29 pts into first stage, requiring a response in two or more pts to proceed to stage 2. Tumor biopsies were collected at baseline (BL) and early on-treatment (OT) at week 4.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Twenty nine treated pts include 48% females, median age 48 years (range 28–75), and median prior therapies 2 (range 1–5). No grade (G) 4 or 5 treatment-related adverse events (TRAE). The most common TRAE of any grade was acneiform rash, 17% being G3. One of 29 pts had confirmed partial response (PR) lasting 9.3 months (mo) for an overall response rate of 3.4%. Seven pts had stable disease (SD) and five pts (1 PR, 4 SD) demonstrated decrease in total carcinoembryonic antigen ng/mL (best percentage reduction: 94%, 95%, 42%, 34%, and 22%, respectively). Median progression-free survival was 3.2 mo (range 1.1–9.3 months). Three pts with both liver and lung metastases demonstrated discrepant responses in which clinical benefit was present in the lung metastases but not liver metastases. Comparison of BL and 4-week OT tumor tissue flow cytometry demonstrated no changes in T-cell infiltration but upregulation expression of PD-1 and Tim3 on CD8 T cells. However, expression of PD-1 and Tim3 as single markers and as coexpressed markers was observed to increase OT relative to BL (p=0.03, p=0.06 and p=0.06, respectively).</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>T+D demonstrated acceptable tolerability in pts with refractory MSS mCRC. The response rate in the first stage of the study did not meet efficacy criteria to proceed to the second stage. Specific site of metastatic disease may impact outcomes in novel immunotherapy combination trials.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p>Over the last decade, immunotherapy has revitalized cancer care and become a backbone of numerous clinical trials. Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), specifically, inhibitors of the PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 pathways have emerged as standard of care for many patients with advanced solid and hematologic malignancies. Of note, this approach has resulted in durable response and improved survival outcomes for melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Unfortunately, distinct from those with deficient mismatch repair (dMMR) proteins or microsatellite instability high (MSI-H) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), isolated ICB has proven to be ineffective for patients with microsatellite stable (MSS) mCRC.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Therefore, a critical focus remains to identify novel therapeutic combinations that can alter the tumor microenvironment (TME) and successfully promote favorable immune modulation.</p>
              <p>The landmark KEYNOTE-177 data revealing superiority of anti-PD-1 therapy over standard of care chemotherapy has effectively positioned ICB as the frontline option for the 4%–5% of patients with mCRC who are MSI-H/dMMR.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> For the majority of patients with MSS mCRC, meaningful disease control can be achieved with oxaliplatin or irinotecan based chemotherapeutic regimens. However, patients will eventually progress after their tumors become resistant to these therapies. There are currently only two approved oral agents in the advanced setting, regorafenib and TAS-102, but these are typically either poorly tolerated or demonstrate limited clinical benefit.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 5</xref> Therefore, novel combination immunotherapeutic approaches for MSS mCRC are desperately needed in the refractory setting.</p>
              <p>Previous work has established that the TME is distinct between MSI-H and MSS CRC. Specifically, relative to MSS disease, MSI-high CRC is characterized by increased infiltration by T-cells with both cytotoxic and Th1 phenotypes, but also expression of high levels of inhibitory immune surface markers such as PD-1, PD-L1, CLTA-4.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> MEK inhibition (MEKi) has been shown to alter the immune microenvironment in tumors by enhancing infiltration by effector CD8 +T cells, preventing CD8 +T cell exhaustion, and promoting CD8 +T cell activation.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7–9</xref> The effect of MEK inhibition on the priming of naïve T cells remains confounding and may be dependent on the model used. Ebert <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic> demonstrated that MEKi prevented the ability of naïve T cells to differentiate into memory cells but MEK signaling was not required for memory T cell activation.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Recently, Verma <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic> have also shown that inhibition of the MAPK pathway by MEKi induces strong antitumor activity through metabolic reprogramming of effector CD8 +T cells into stem cell-like memory T cells.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> These unique T cells showed enhanced cellular activation, high antigen-specific recall responses and prolonged survival but MEKi was required to occur in parallel with a TCR stimulation or the effect was lost.</p>
              <p>In CRC preclinical models, trametinib has been shown to have anti-tumor effects on the CT26 model.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> This murine colorectal tumor cell line contains homozygous <italic toggle="yes">KRAS</italic> G12D mutation and MAPK1/MET amplifications.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Liu <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic> showed that while Trametinib has modest suppression of tumors in vivo, this effect is enhanced by combination with PD-1 or PD-L1 blockade.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Survival was also improved with combination therapy over either agent in monotherapy.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Furthermore, when timed with a 1-week lead in with trametinib, a significant improvement in survival was observed.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Building on this preclinical data, we investigated whether or not a MEK inhibitor in combination with anti-PD-L1 can activate T-cells thereby modulating the immune TME of MSS mCRC and promoting tumor killing.</p>
              <p>We hypothesize that the efficacy of immune-checkpoint inhibitors in MSS CRC may be enhanced by improved priming and T-cell activation of the intratumoral environment through systemic administration of MEK inhibition in combination with an anti PD-L1 antibody for treatment refractory MSS CRC.</p>

                <p>This study is an investigator initiated, prospective, open-label, single-center phase II trial assessing the efficacy and safety of combination intravenous durvalumab with oral trametinib conducted at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. Patients over the age of 18 years with biopsy confirmed metastatic adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum and who had received prior fluoropyrimidine and either oxaliplatin or irinotecan chemotherapy were eligible to enroll. Only patients whose CRC had been characterized as proficient in MMR or MSS on the basis of immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 or PCR testing were eligible. Patients were also required to have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1 and an estimated life expectancy exceeding 12 weeks.</p>
                <p>Patients must have adequate hematologic function for study participation, defined as an absolute neutrophil count ≥1.0 x 10<sup>9</sup> /L, absolute lymphocyte count ≥0.5× 10<sup>9</sup> /L, platelet count ≥100×10<sup>9</sup> /L, and hemoglobin level ≥9.0 g/dL. In addition, patients must have had adequate renal function (defined as an estimated creatinine clearance &gt;30 mL/min according to the Cockcroft-Gault formula) and adequate hepatic function (defined as a total bilirubin level ≤1.5 × the upper limit of normal (ULN), an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level ≤2.5 × ULN, and an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level ≤2.5 × ULN). If liver metastases were present, an AST level ≤5.0 × ULN and an ALT level ≤5.0 × ULN were acceptable. Patients could not have had prior exposure to an immune checkpoint inhibitor or any other antineoplastic immunomodulatory agent.</p>

Two de-escalation dose levels of trametinib (1.5 mg, 1 mg) were present with maximum tolerated dose (MTD) determined as the dose level with &lt;2 DLTs out of six patients. Trametinib (T) was administered 2 mg/day orally starting 1 week prior to durvalumab (D) at 1500 mg intravenously every 4 weeks. Patients underwent radiographic restaging studies every 8 weeks. Mandatory biopsies were collected prior to therapy initiation (baseline, BL) and early on-treatment after 4 weeks (OT) for 15 patients at the MTD. Consensus molecular subtyping (CMS) was performed via a CLIA validated gene expression assay utilizing the NanoString platform on patient primary CRC tumor specimens.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p>

                <p>We performed singlet chromogenic immunohistochemistry to detect the protein expression of PD-L1. Briefly, tissue sections (4 µm) were stained in a Leica Bond Max automated stainer (Leica Biosystems Nussloch). The tissue sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated following the Leica Bond protocol. Antigen retrieval was performed for 20 min with Bond Solution #2 (Leica Biosystems, equivalent EDTA, pH 9.0) or Bond Solution # 1 (Leica Biosystems, equivalent Citrate Buffer, pH6. The primary antibody (PD-L1, clone SP263, Ventana, Cat# 790–4905, ready to use), was incubated for 15 min at room temperature and detected using the Bond Polymer Refine Detection kit (Leica Biosystems) with DAB as chromogen. The slides were counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated, and cover-slipped.</p>
                <p>The IHC stained slides where scanned with Aperio AT2 scanner (Leica Biosystem) at ×20 magnification; the images were visualized and analyzed with Halo (Indica Lab) image analysis software. The analysis of the expression of PD-L1 was performed by a pathologist in the tumor area with viable malignant cells (MCs). Necrotic areas and areas with artifacts were excluded from the analysis. PD-L1 was evaluated in MCs using a standard microscope approach and reported as percentage of MCs with any positive membrane expression.</p>

Stable disease (SD) was present in 7 patients (24%), progressive disease in 17 patients (58%), and not evaluable in 4 patients (14%). For the 7 patients with SD the median PFS was 5.4 months (range 3.9–9.3 months). 1 patient remained on therapy with persistent SD (&gt;10 months). Five pts (1 PR, 4 SD) demonstrated decrease in total carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) ng/mL (best percentage reduction: 94%, 95%, 42%, 34%, and 22%, respectively). Median PFS for the entire cohort was 3.2 months (95% CI 2.5 to 3.8 months) with a median OS of 6.9 months (95% CI 5.7 to 8.0 months) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1A, B</xref>). Of the 23 patients with known CMS, 4 of 12 CMS2 patients had SD, and 1 of 9 patients with CMS4 had SD. The one PR was CMS unknown. The PR patients course is shown in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1C</xref>. This patient was RAS/RAF wildtype but had two <italic toggle="yes">ATM mutations (E221fs*14 and S2812fs*</italic>) but demonstrated circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) increase following single agent trametinib and then ctDNA reduction with the addition of durvalumab (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1D</xref>).

In relation to liver and lung metastases, 1 patient had liver only metastases, 4 patients had lung only metastases, 6 patients had both liver and lung metastases. In an exploratory analysis of survival outcome by the presence or absence of liver metastases demonstrated an OS of 6.9 months (mo) versus not reached (NR), p=0.03 and PFS of 3.2 mo versus 4.4 mo, p=0.13, respectively (<xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental figure 1</xref>). iRC status by presence or absence of liver metastases demonstrated PR of 0% vs 11%, respectively, although not statistically significant. Due to the occurrence of discrepant responses between patients with lung predominant and liver predominant metastases identified during the conduct of the study, we performed an explorative analysis comparing iRC by site of metastatic disease, focusing on six patients with both lung and liver metastases. Of these six patients, overall iRC was PD in five and SD in one. However, when using iRC to each organ site (liver vs lung) for these patients, three patients had discrepant responses with best lung iRC of −96%, −5%, and 6%, while respective liver iRC was 17%, 133%, and 56%.

T regulatory cells were below the QC metric of 100 events and were excluded from analysis as shown in the gating strategy (<xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental figure 2</xref>). Overall the CD4 +TIL expressed PD-1, CD73, ICOS and Lag3 in most cases (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">figure 5B</xref>, n=5). Six paired cases passed QC for the CD8<sup>+</sup> TIL subset for assessment of changes in checkpoint and activation marker expression. CD73 expression was high and remained high. However, expression of PD-1 and Tim3 as single markers and as coexpressed markers was observed to increase OT relative to BL (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">figure 5C</xref>, p=0.03, p=0.06 and p=0.06, respectively). Lag3 expression was also observed to increase but did not reach significance (p=0.16). Within the CD4<sup>+</sup> TIL subset only four paired samples passed QC for assessment. CD73 was observed to be strongly induced in three out of four pairs but did not reach statistical significance (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">figure 5D</xref>, p=0.13). Surface expression of CTLA4 was also found to increase OT in 3 out of 4 cases (p=0.25). Other markers assessed were not found to be modulated at the time points assessed.</p>

              <p>We investigated the use of a novel combination of anti-PD-L1 with MEK inhibition for patients with refractory MSS mCRC. The rationale for this combination was based on the hypothesis that the efficacy of immune-checkpoint inhibitors in MSS CRC may be enhanced by augmenting priming and T-cell activation in the TME. Our study revealed the combination of MEK inhibition with an anti PD-L1 antibody was safe but demonstrated limited activity with only one PR. Interestingly we identified three cases where intrapatient discrepant tumor responses were seen between lung lesions and liver lesions, demonstrating the organ site specific differences in tumor immune microenvironments.</p>
              <p>The one responder in this clinical trial was a patient with lung predominant metastases with nonregional lymphadenopathy. In addition, while acknowledging our small cohort site and exploratory nature of analysis, a non-significant trend was seen favoring an improved PFS in patients without liver as opposed to those with liver metastases, 4.4 months vs 3.2 months, p=0.13. This is noteworthy considering two recent data sets highlighting site of metastatic disease impacting response on novel immunotherapy combination trials for patients with MSS mCRC.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17 18</xref> Specifically, non-liver metastases, such as lung appear to respond more favorably to novel immunotherapy combinations using backbones of anti-PD1 or anti-PDL1. The retrospective experience from City of Hope reported outcomes from 97 patients with refractory mCRC exposed to immunotherapy trials in combination with VEGFR, MEK, CTLA-4 and radiation. This revealed that patients without liver metastases (n=43) had a disease control rate of 56% compared with 2% for patients with liver metastases (n=54) (p&lt;0.001). Median PFS for patients with liver metastases was 1.5 months vs 4.5 months for those without liver involvement (HR 4.41, p=&lt;0.001).<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> In the REGOTORI clinical trial investigating toripalimab in combination with regorafenib 43 patients with MSS mCRC demonstrated a 15% response rate with a median PFS of 2.6 months (95% CI 2 to 4.3).<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Of note, patients without liver metastases developed a higher objective response rate than those with liver metastases (30% vs 8.7%).<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> While further investigation to understand site specific responses to novel immunotherapy trials are needed, one study described a preclinical rationale involving hepatic macrophages and their direct influence on the promotion of T-cell apoptosis.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Though small in numbers the finding of 3 cases with intrapatient response discrepancies by liver or lung organ site, suggests that further efforts to capture data on organ site-specific immune responses is warranted.</p>
              <p>Despite the initial signal noted from an early phase 1 study utilizing immunotherapy with a MEK inhibitor for MSS <italic toggle="yes">KRAS</italic> mutant mCRC, which reported a response rate of 20%, the subsequent phase III IMblaze370 trial for mCRC using the anti-PDL1, atezolizumab in combination with a MEK inhibitor cobimetinib was a negative trial with no improvement in OS compared with regorafenib.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20 21</xref> The randomized phase II CO.26 trial investigated the approach of dual checkpoint inhibition of durvalumab in combination with tremelimumab, a selective human IgG2 monoclonal antibody against cytotoxic T-cell lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) compared with best supportive care for refractory MSS CRC.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> With a median follow-up of 15.2 months, this combination had uncertain activity considering no improvement in PFS or response rates but a trend favoring OS benefit (6.6 months vs 4.1 months, HR 0.72; 90% CI, 0.54 to 0.97; p=0.07). Exploratory analysis suggested patients with tumor mutational burden of 28 or greater had the most benefit (HR 0.34; 90% CI 0.18 to 0.63; p=0.004) potentially identifying a selective biomarker, however further confirmatory studies are needed.</p>
              <p>In our analysis, although PD-1 expression was observed on TIL prior to therapy, PD-L1 expression was low as detected by IHC and mIF. This suggests that the PD1 axis is not strongly engaged in refractory MSS CRC patients. An unexpected increase in T regulatory cell frequency early OT with little induction of granzyme B or CD45RO was seen, which is in direct contrast to what has been previously observed in murine models. Although Ebert <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic> and Verma <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic> disagree on the effect of MEKi on the ability of T cells to be primed, they both agree that antigenic stimulation in the context of concurrent MEK inhibition is important. One possibility that could explain our lack of change in T-cell frequencies could be due to the fact that we cannot control antigenic stimulation in this setting. Combinations of MEKi, checkpoint blockade and anti-tumor vaccination could overcome this potential limitation.</p>
              <p>While we did not observe an increase in granzyme B or CD45RO expressing T cells early OT, we did observe interesting phenotypes at BL. While the CD4 compartment appeared to mainly express PD-1, ICOS, CD73 and Lag3, the CD8<sup>+</sup> TIL expressed a wide-range of activation and suppressive markers and a high expression of CD73. While these data are confounded by a small number of patients with paired biopsies, CD8<sup>+</sup> TIL were found to upregulate PD-1 and Tim3 which is the opposite of what would be expected based on murine models. In addition, the CD4<sup>+</sup> TIL were also found to highly upregulate CD73 in the three out of four paired cases assessed. CD73 is an extracellular ectonucleotidase that plays a role in the adenosine immunosuppressive pathway, inhibiting T-cell activation and proliferation.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Interestingly, preclinical models in CRC reveal CD73 is upregulated on tumor-associated myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) via TGF-ß inhibiting T cell and NK cell activity.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> These models have shown CD73 deletion increases CD8 +T cells and IFN-γ production to suppress growth as well as reduction of CD73 on CD4 +Foxp3+Tregs playing a critical role in reestablishing antitumor immunity.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Therefore, CD73 is believed to be involved in the underlying immunosuppressive TME of CRC.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Further investigation of the therapeutic targeting of CD73 as a viable therapeutic partner for continued novel immunotherapy approaches in MSS CRC may be warranted.</p>
              <p>The CMSs 1–4 have emerged as a novel approach to characterize mCRC.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Though limited by sample size this trial did find that 4 of 12 CMS2 patients demonstrated SD as best response, while only 1 of 9 CMS4 patients demonstrated SD as best response. In contrast to CMS2 tumors, which are characterized as having an ‘immune-desert’ TME, CMS4 tumors reveal a high expression of genes associated with Treg cells, MDSCs, monocyte-derived cells and TH17 cells, all contributing to the persistence of an ‘immune-excluded’ TME.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></p>
              <p>In conclusion, while the combination of T+D in our study demonstrated acceptable safety and tolerability for patients with refractory MSS mCRC, predetermined efficacy criteria were not adequate to allow for enrollment to the second stage. Though hypothesis generating three findings from this study suggest that the site of metastatic disease may appear to be relevant in MSS mCRC: one patient with PR had lung predominant metastases, a non-significant trend demonstrated improved PFS in non-liver metastases patients, and intrapatient lung and liver organ site responses were seen in three patients. Further investigation into site specific clinical trial design may be warranted for patients with refractory MSS mCRC. Additional efforts to increase utilization of CMS characterization in novel mCRC immunotherapy clinical trials may provide valuable correlative clues for improved understanding of treatment activity or lack thereof.</p>
