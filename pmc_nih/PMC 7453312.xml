              <p>Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common childhood cancer.<sup><xref rid="zoi200542r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Although more than 95% of children with ALL enter remission after a 4-week induction, approximately 20% relapse within 5 years.<sup><xref rid="zoi200542r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Second-line therapies are toxic, and salvage is poor.<sup><xref rid="zoi200542r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Durable first clinical remission is desirable and requires a prolonged maintenance phase with daily self-administered oral mercaptopurine. Low mercaptopurine systemic exposure increases relapse risk.<sup><xref rid="zoi200542r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200542r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200542r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Patient adherence to mercaptopurine is a primary determinant of mercaptopurine systemic exposure.<sup><xref rid="zoi200542r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Adherence to medication is a process by which patients take their medication as prescribed and typically consists of 3 phases: initiation, implementation, and discontinuation.<sup><xref rid="zoi200542r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200542r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> In the present study and our prior studies,<sup><xref rid="zoi200542r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> we focus on the implementation phase of mercaptopurine adherence, in which patients have initiated but have not yet discontinued mercaptopurine. In a previous Children’s Oncology Group (COG) study (AALL03N1), we measured mercaptopurine adherence electronically in children with ALL entering maintenance during the first clinical remission, using the Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS) TrackCap device (Aprex Corp).<sup><xref rid="zoi200542r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200542r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200542r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Poor mercaptopurine adherence (mean adherence rates, &lt;90% to 95%) was associated with a 2.5- to 3.9-fold higher relapse risk; up to 59% of ALL relapses were attributable to poor mercaptopurine adherence.<sup><xref rid="zoi200542r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200542r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200542r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> The most common reason for missing mercaptopurine was forgetfulness<sup><xref rid="zoi200542r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>; adherent patients and parents endorsed parental vigilance as a strategy to overcome forgetfulness.<sup><xref rid="zoi200542r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Given the critical need to improve mercaptopurine adherence in children with ALL, we conducted a randomized clinical trial (COG ACCL1033) in which children with ALL receiving mercaptopurine maintenance were randomly assigned to receive either education alone or a comprehensive adherence-enhancing intervention in addition to education. We wished to test the hypothesis that the adherence-enhancing intervention consisting of education and daily text message reminders to prompt directly supervised therapy (DST) would result in a higher proportion of patients with mercaptopurine adherence rates 95% or higher compared with education alone.</p>

The intervention consisted of education and daily personalized text message reminders from the treating oncologist to the patient and parent to prompt DST.

                  <p>The interactive multimedia educational program used video vignettes (created by W.L.) of patients and parents drawn from diverse sociodemographic backgrounds to address health beliefs, including perceived susceptibility to or severity of ALL, purpose of mercaptopurine, perceived benefits or barriers to mercaptopurine ingestion, and examples of how patients or parents overcame such barriers.

                <p>For the first 28 days, all participants in both the intervention and education groups received mercaptopurine from a MEMS device (eAppendix 2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-ZOI200542-1-s">Supplement 2</xref>) without intervention to calculate baseline adherence rates. The intervention began on day 29 and lasted for 16 weeks. Patients or parents in both groups viewed the educational video during scheduled clinic visits on day 29. For patients in the intervention group, the treating oncologist activated automated daily text message reminders on day 29 and renewed these reminders every 28 days until the study’s end. Research staff at participating sites provided details regarding prescribed mercaptopurine dose for each day of the trial and dates when mercaptopurine was withheld for toxicity or illness (eAppendix 2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-ZOI200542-1-s">Supplement 2</xref>).</p>

                <title>Study End Points</title>
                <p>The primary end points were defined as the proportion of patients with mercaptopurine adherence rate 95% or higher in both groups for the entire cohort, for patients aged 12 years and older, and for patients younger than 12 years. We assessed adherence using the MEMS adherence-monitoring device, which uses microelectronic technology to record the date and time of mercaptopurine bottle openings. We informed the patients and parents about the purpose of the MEMS device. The participating sites returned the MEMS device to the coordinating center (University of Alabama at Birmingham) upon study completion, where we downloaded the data. The MEMS-based adherence rate was defined as the ratio of days with MEMS device openings (<italic>N</italic>) to the number of days mercaptopurine was prescribed (<italic>D</italic>) for each patient, reported as a percentage (<italic>N </italic>/<italic> D </italic>×<italic> </italic>100). We removed the days when the prescriber withheld the mercaptopurine dose from the denominator. We calculated monthly mean adherence rates for each patient for the entire cohort and by age at study entry (&lt;12 years vs ≥12 years) and used these to derive the proportion of patients with adherence rates 95% or higher. We chose to examine the effect of interventions in patients aged 12 years and older and those younger than 12 years, on the basis of our prior work,<sup><xref rid="zoi200542r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> which showed that mean mercaptopurine adherence was substantially lower in patients aged 12 years and older compared with those younger than 12 years. End points examined in the exploratory analyses included longitudinal mean monthly adherence rates in the intervention vs education groups for the entire cohort, patients younger than 12 years, and patients aged 12 years and older, and by baseline mercaptopurine adherence rates (&lt;90% and ≥90%).</p>

                <title>Statistical Analysis</title>
                <p>Using an intention-to-treat analysis, we tested the efficacy of the intervention by comparing group differences in the proportion of adherent patients at each month after the intervention using logistic regression with generalized estimating equations. The proportions of patients with adherence rates 95% or higher in both groups were determined for the entire cohort, for patients aged 12 years and older, and for those younger than 12 years. To account for the 3 independent tests, a 2-sided Bonferroni-adjusted type I error of .017 was used for each test. To calculate sample sizes projected to have 80% power to detect meaningful differences, we assumed values for the proportion of patients with adherence 95% or higher in the education group according to our previous study,<sup><xref rid="zoi200542r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> as well as 2 additional values in increments of 0.5 (entire cohort, 0.56, 0.61, and 0.66; patients &lt;12 years old, 0.60, 0.65, and 0.70; patients ≥12 years old, 0.42, 0.47, and 0.52). We projected the following sample sizes: for the entire cohort, we would need 228 patients per group to detect a difference between the proportion of patients with adherence 95% or higher in the education group of 0.56 to 0.66 vs 0.70 to 0.79 in the intervention group, or an odds ratio (OR) of 1.9 to 2.0; for patients younger than 12 years, we would need 133 patients per group to detect a difference between the proportion of patients with adherence 95% or higher in the education group of 0.60 to 0.70 vs 0.78 to 0.86 in the intervention group, or an OR of 2.4 to 2.7; and for patients aged 12 years and older, we would need 95 patients per group to detect a difference between the proportion of patients with adherence 95% or higher in the education group of 0.42 to 0.52 vs 0.65 to 0.74 in the intervention group, or an OR of 1.9 to 2.0. Using generalized estimating equations, we also conducted exploratory analyses where we compared the longitudinal mean monthly adherence rates between the intervention and education groups among all patients, those younger than 12 years, those aged 12 years and older, and within subgroups of patients according to baseline mercaptopurine adherence rates (&lt;90% and ≥90%).</p>
                <p>Baseline patient characteristics that varied between treatment groups were included as covariates to obtain unbiased estimates of the intervention effect. We handled missing data by multiple imputation, assuming data missing at random, by generating 20 sets of complete data using the predictive mean matching method for continuous variables, and logistic and polytomous regression imputation for binary and categorical variables. We performed sensitivity analyses to assess the missing at random assumption.<sup><xref rid="zoi200542r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> We performed the analyses with SAS statistical software version 9.4 (SAS Institute) and R statistical software version 3.6.1 (R Project for Statistical Computing).

              <p>Of the 570 patients enrolled at 59 participating sites between July 16, 2012, and August 8, 2018, 444 (78.0%) were evaluable, including 230 in the intervention group and 214 in the education group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="zoi200542f1">Figure 1</xref>). The median age at study enrollment was 8.1 years (interquartile range [IQR], 5.3-14.3 years) overall, 8.6 years (IQR, 5.6-14.3 years) for the intervention group, and 7.5 years (IQR, 5.3-14.0 years) for the education group. Three hundred two patients (68.0%) were boys, 180 (40.5%) were non-Hispanic White, 170 (38.3%) were Hispanic, 43 (9.7%) were African American, and 51 (11.5%) were Asian or of mixed race/ethnicity. Of these, 378 (85%) had precursor B-cell disease and 66 (15%) had T-cell disease. All patients had received treatment per COG therapeutic protocols (AALL0932, 133 patients; AALL1131, 129 patients; AALL0232, 58 patients; AALL0434, 46 patients; AALL0331, 14 patients; AALL1231, 6 patients; and other, 58 patients). Overall, baseline characteristics were comparable between the 2 groups (<xref rid="zoi200542t1" ref-type="table">Table</xref>), with the exception of lower paternal education in the intervention group. Adherence monitoring occurred for 12 197 person-days before the start of the intervention and for 45 949 person-days over the course of the intervention. The date of final follow-up was January 2, 2019. At baseline, the mean (SE) adherence rates were comparable between the 2 groups for the entire cohort (intervention, 92.2% [0.9%] vs education, 93.5% [0.8%]), for the patients younger than 12 years (intervention, 93.3% [1.1%] vs education, 94.8% [0.9%]), and for the patients aged 12 years and older (intervention, 90.3% [1.5%] vs education, 91.0% [1.6%]). The trial ended when we completed our contract with MedActionPlan/CT and we had almost reached the prespecified target enrollment (444 / 456 = 97%).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>We designed this trial to enhance mercaptopurine adherence in children with ALL in response to the observed high prevalence of suboptimal mercaptopurine adherence and the association between mercaptopurine nonadherence and relapse risk.<sup><xref rid="zoi200542r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200542r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200542r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> We focused on the implementation phase of adherence per EMERGE criteria,<sup><xref rid="zoi200542r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> because sustained remission in childhood ALL depends on continued daily ingestion of mercaptopurine during maintenance, beyond initiation and before discontinuation at the end of therapy. We found that a multicomponent adherence-enhancing intervention did not result in a significantly higher proportion of patients with adherence rates 95% or higher when compared with education alone. However, exploratory analyses indicated that the intervention resulted in higher mean adherence rates in patients aged 12 years and older with baseline adherence rates less than 90%.</p>
              <p>Previous adherence-enhancing interventions in nononcology settings have used multiple components<sup><xref rid="zoi200542r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> with tailored ongoing support from allied health professionals, who often deliver intense education, professional counseling, or daily support. With the need to ensure that we could use our intervention in a multicenter setting without depending on professional support at each site, we used technologically sophisticated, yet simple, inexpensive, and easily adopted, intervention components. Importantly, the intervention components directly addressed barriers to adherence and incorporated facilitators unique to children with ALL.<sup><xref rid="zoi200542r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200542r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Indeed, we were able to use this intervention successfully at 59 geographically dispersed sites in a racially and ethnically diverse population.</p>
              <p>Multimedia educational programs are useful for enhancing adherence in those with limited English proficiency, are readily accessible via Internet or DVD, and do not require training of staff to present high-quality educational messages.<sup><xref rid="zoi200542r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200542r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200542r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> In our trial, we delivered education to both groups and, hence, were unable to examine the impact of education on mercaptopurine adherence. Text message reminders have been associated with improved adherence,<sup><xref rid="zoi200542r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> particularly in patients with asthma,<sup><xref rid="zoi200542r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> HIV,<sup><xref rid="zoi200542r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> and diabetes<sup><xref rid="zoi200542r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> and in kidney transplant recipients.<sup><xref rid="zoi200542r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> We established personalized text message reminders, consisting of individualized messages from the treating oncologist to their patient and parent daily at the time when medication was due. Text message reminders (including mercaptopurine dose and time of administration) addressed a primary barrier to adherence in children with ALL—that is, forgetting to take mercaptopurine.<sup><xref rid="zoi200542r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> DST constitutes supervision of ingestion of every dose. DST has been used successfully in patients with tuberculosis, where it reduced tubercular relapse,<sup><xref rid="zoi200542r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> and led the American Thoracic Society and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to recommend DST for all patients.<sup><xref rid="zoi200542r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> We used DST to incorporate the primary facilitator to mercaptopurine adherence—that is, parental vigilance.<sup><xref rid="zoi200542r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Although this multicomponent intervention did not result in a significantly higher proportion of patients with adherence rates 95% or higher, we did make some critical observations. First, we found that there was no difference in the mean adherence rates between the intervention and education groups in the patients younger than 12 years, likely because of high baseline adherence. In contrast, the patients aged 12 years and older did benefit from the intervention, particularly where the baseline adherence rate was less than 90%. The difference in mean adherence rate between the intervention and education groups in this subgroup was 8.8%. In our previous studies,<sup><xref rid="zoi200542r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200542r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> we found that adolescents (patients aged ≥12 years) are especially likely to have poor adherence, perhaps because of their increasing assumption of independence and decreasing parental supervision. These findings are similar to those of previous studies<sup><xref rid="zoi200542r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200542r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> in other populations, where patients with poor adherence drew maximum benefit from adherence-enhancing interventions. These findings also emphasize the importance of targeting interventions to only those at high risk of poor adherence, ensuring efficient resource utilization. Identifying patients at risk for poor adherence can be a challenge, given that patients at highest risk of poor adherence are most likely to self-report high adherence.<sup><xref rid="zoi200542r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> We have used demographic, behavioral, and mercaptopurine metabolite levels to develop a tool to identify patients at risk for poor adherence<sup><xref rid="zoi200542r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> and will test this in subsequent studies.</p>

                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p>The findings of this study should be interpreted in the context of certain limitations. The trial was designed to detect a significant difference in the proportion of patients with adherence rates 95% or higher between the intervention and education groups. Although the proportion of participants with adherence rates 95% or higher from baseline to postintervention period remained stable for the intervention group and decreased for the education group, we were unable to identify a significant difference in the proportion of patients with adherence 95% or higher between the 2 groups. For the younger children, the high baseline adherence rates (and the consequent ceiling effect) prevented us from examining the impact of the intervention on adherence rates. Among the older children, the impact of the intervention was most evident among those with baseline nonadherence. It is possible that baseline adherence could have been overestimated, given that initiation of electronic monitoring in itself has been shown to improve adherence.<sup><xref rid="zoi200542r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> We have previously observed a decrease in adherence of 3.2%<sup><xref rid="zoi200542r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> to 4.5%<sup><xref rid="zoi200542r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> over the 6 months of electronic monitoring in children with ALL; this may have mitigated the effect of the intervention. Here, we found that patients in the intervention group did not demonstrate a decrease in adherence, whereas those in the education group did show a decrease. Future interventions to improve mercaptopurine adherence in childhood ALL should target the entire maintenance period and will need additional reinforcements to prevent the decline in adherence. In addition, although we have established the infrastructure for follow-up of patients for disease relapse, we have not followed the cohort long enough for describing this outcome. These limitations notwithstanding, to our knowledge, this study is the first large randomized trial in pediatric oncology that addresses a clinically relevant problem, where more than 40% of patients aged 12 years and older are at risk for ALL relapse because of suboptimal mercaptopurine adherence.<sup><xref rid="zoi200542r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200542r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup></p>
