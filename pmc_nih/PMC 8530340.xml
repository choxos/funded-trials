                  <title>Objectives</title>
                  <p>Older adults are particularly vulnerable to the negative consequences of antipsychotic exposure and are disproportionally affected by higher mortality from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Our goal was to determine whether concurrent antipsychotic medication use was associated with increased COVID-19 mortality in older patients with preexisting behavioral health problems. We also report on findings from post-COVID follow-ups.</p>

                  <p>A total of 56 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 (mean age 76 years; median age 75 years) and 13 (23.2%) died. We found an increased mortality risk for patients who were prescribed at least one antipsychotic medication at the time of COVID-19 infection (Fisher’s exact test P = 0.009, OR = 11.1, 95% confidence interval: 1.4–96.0). This result remains significant after adjusting for age, gender, housing context and dementia (Logistic regression P = 0.035, Beta = 2.4). Furthermore, we found that most patients who survived COVID-19 (88.4%) recovered to pre-COVID baseline in terms of psychiatric symptoms. Comparison of pre- and post-COVID assessments of CGI-S for 33 patients who recovered from COVID-19 were not significantly different.</p>

                  <p>We observed a higher COVID-19 mortality associated with concurrent antipsychotics use in older patients receiving behavioral health services. The majority of patients in our geriatric clinic who recovered from COVID-19 appeared to return to their pre-COVID psychiatric function. More precise estimates of the risk associated with antipsychotic treatment in older patients with COVID-19 and other underlying factors will come from larger datasets and meta-analyses.</p>

              <p>Long-term antipsychotic medication use has been unequivocally associated with increased mortality risk in older adults [<xref rid="pone.0258916.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0258916.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Among many adverse medical effects, antipsychotics have been reported to be associated with an increased risk for serious respiratory adverse events [<xref rid="pone.0258916.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0258916.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] with a link to potential immune dysfunction [<xref rid="pone.0258916.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus infection disproportionally affects elderly with higher morbidity and mortality [<xref rid="pone.0258916.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0258916.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The infection fatality rate was estimated to reach 4.9% for people aged 65–74 years and 14.2% for those 75 years and older [<xref rid="pone.0258916.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In addition to older age, more risk factors have been identified, including but not limited to gender [<xref rid="pone.0258916.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0258916.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], dementia, living at institutional care facilities, and medical comorbidities [<xref rid="pone.0258916.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0258916.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Some of these risk factors may not be independent; for example, people with dementia are also more likely to live in care facilities. A population based observational study showed that living in care facilities is associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 mortality in comparison with living in independent housing, potentially through exposure to visitors and care workers, and due to poor underlying health [<xref rid="pone.0258916.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p>
              <p>Given that older adults are particularly vulnerable to the negative consequence of antipsychotic exposure as well as to COVID-19, we evaluated clinical data from a community-based geriatric psychiatric outpatient clinic in New York City (NYC) to determine whether long-term use of antipsychotics in the context of COVID-19 would increase the risk of mortality. Moreover, neurological and psychiatric complications are common during the acute phase of COVID-19, including delirium [<xref rid="pone.0258916.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, CNS vasculitis, encephalopathy, new-onset psychosis, neurocognitive syndrome and affective symptoms [<xref rid="pone.0258916.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0258916.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. An increased incidence of psychiatric disorders has been reported in early post-COVID follow-ups [<xref rid="pone.0258916.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0258916.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and psychiatric patients may require additional mental health support during the pandemic [<xref rid="pone.0258916.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0258916.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Therefore, we wonder whether older patients with preexisting mental illness show more post-COVID psychiatric consequences. We took advantage of our out-patient follow-ups to compare pre- and post COVID-19 overall clinical psychiatric symptom severity as a secondary outcome.</p>

              <title>Methods</title>
              <p>This study is a single-center retrospective observational study and approved by the Institutional Review Board of Northwell Health (# 20–0200). The outpatients and their caregivers reported COVID-19 diagnosis and related symptoms to the treating psychiatrists at the Zucker Hillside Hospital (ZHH) of the Northwell Health system. We included all patients who had COVID-19 between February 28<sup>th</sup> and October 1<sup>st</sup> 2020. The COVID-19 diagnosis was confirmed with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) during the symptomatic phase or confirmed using serology test after the suspected acute COVID-19 infection. The outcome is defined as whether the patient expired during the acute COVID-19 hospitalization. Clinical data including the use of antipsychotics at the time of COVID-19 (exposure variable), antidepressants, age, gender, dementia diagnosis (defined as ICD-10 codes starting with F01, F02, F03, F04, F09, G30, G31, and G32) as well as Clinical Global Impression severity scales (CGI-S) [<xref rid="pone.0258916.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] were extracted from hospital EHR and manually quality checked. The CGI-S, which is integrated in the EHR but not as a required field, is routinely used by the treating psychiatrists during clinical assessments. CGI-S scales from September 1<sup>st</sup> 2019 to the date of COVID-19 for each patient are defined as pre-COVID (T0) and from the date of COVID-19 till October 22<sup>nd</sup> 2020 (time point of EHR data extraction) are defined as post-COVID (T1) measures. Living arrangement, estimated timing of COVID-19 infection, and whether the patients survived were obtained through chart review. We estimated the date of COVID-19 infection using the date of the reported symptom onset by patients and their caregivers or the date of positive results of the RT-PCR test. In addition to CGI-S, the treating psychiatrists (who typically follow the same patients longitudinally) were surveyed in October 2020 for their impression of whether the patients recovered to their pre-COVID functional baseline. The acute symptoms of COVID-19 were treated at various health facilities including urgent care centers, primary care physicians’ and medical specialists’ offices and inpatient medical facilities. Following the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) statement [<xref rid="pone.0258916.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], a check list is presented as <bold><xref rid="pone.0258916.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref></bold>.</p>
              <p>Statistical analysis was performed using R version 3.5.0 [<xref rid="pone.0258916.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Given the limited sample sizes we use Fisher’s exact test to test for univariate association between binary variables such as patient survival with antipsychotic use [<xref rid="pone.0258916.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval are calculated using standard methods [<xref rid="pone.0258916.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. We used multivariable logistic regression to account for potential confounding factors including age, gender, living arrangement, and dementia diagnosis. As a sensitivity analysis, antidepressant use was added to the model. Shapiro-Wilk normality test indicated non-normal distribution of differences between CGI-S at T0 and T1 (P = 0.001). Accordingly, we used both paired t-test to compare the means and Wilcoxon paired signed rank test to compare the medians of individual pre- (T0) and post-COVID-19 (T1) CGI-S.</p>

Thirteen (23.2%) patients died while being hospitalized for confirmed COVID-19. In this cohort, gender is not significantly associated with mortality (Fisher’s exact test P = 0.31) but higher age is associated with higher risk of death (P = 0.05; Beta = 0.08), which is consistent with previously reported findings [<xref rid="pone.0258916.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In our cohort, female patients had a higher mean age than male patients (77.8 vs. 71.5 years old) (t-test P = 0.01). Institutional living arrangement (Fisher’s exact test P = 0.10) and dementia diagnosis (P = 0.16) are not significantly associated with COVID-19 mortality in this cohort.</p>

              <p>We observed a significant association between being prescribed an antipsychotic medication at the time of COVID-19 and an increased mortality risk (Fisher’s exact test P = 0.009, OR = 11.1, 95% confidence interval: 1.4–96.0) (<bold><xref rid="pone.0258916.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref></bold>). The association between antipsychotics and COVID-19 mortality remained significant (P = 0.035, Beta = 2.4) after adjusting for age, gender, living arrangements (home vs. institutions), and dementia diagnosis. Further adjusting for antidepressants use as a sensitivity analysis didn’t change the association (<bold><xref rid="pone.0258916.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Table</xref></bold>). In univariable analysis, antipsychotics use was not significantly associated with age, gender, living arrangements or dementia (<bold><xref rid="pone.0258916.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Table</xref></bold>). Among the 34 patients treated with antipsychotics, only two (5.9%) received monotherapy with a typical antipsychotic medication (haloperidol) and both recovered. Another two patients were prescribed a combination of a typical and an atypical antipsychotic medication and both expired. The remaining 30 patients were all taking atypical antipsychotics and 10 of them (33.3%) expired. The typical antipsychotics used are haloperidol, paliperidone, fluphenazine, trifluoperazine and the atypical antipsychotics include olanzapine, aripiprazole, quetiapine, risperidone, and clozapine. These antipsychotics were prescribed for a variety of conditions including dementia with behavior disorders, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, psychosis, and major depressive disorder. Other psychotropic medications include mood stabilizers such as lamotrigine and valproic acid, gabapentin, anxiolytics such as benzodiazepines or buspirone and cholinesterase inhibitors such as donepezil.</p>

              <p>The out-patient setting, in which patients being followed up by the same psychiatrist, further presents an opportunity to investigate how elderly patients with behavioral health conditions who survived COVID-19 recovered longitudinally in terms of psychiatric function. When surveyed, the treating geriatric psychiatrists reported that the majority of the patients—38 out of 43 patients (88.4%)—recovered to pre-COVID level of functioning. In addition, 33 patients had at least one CGI-S [<xref rid="pone.0258916.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] score—a structured rating on how mentally ill a patient presents—for both pre- and post-COVID visits.

              <p>As older adults are particularly vulnerable to adverse consequence of antipsychotic exposure [<xref rid="pone.0258916.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0258916.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and have higher mortality risk from COVID-19 [<xref rid="pone.0258916.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0258916.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0258916.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], we evaluated EHR data from a community-based geriatric psychiatry clinic during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in NYC. We investigated whether concurrent antipsychotics prescription is associated with increased risk of COVID-19 mortality in this geriatric population receiving behavioral health services. We found that concurrent antipsychotic exposure was associated with an increased mortality risk in context of acute COVID-19. This finding remains significant after controlling for age, gender, living arrangement, and the presence of dementia.</p>
              <p>A previous report showed that patients with a pre-existing psychiatric diagnosis while hospitalized for COVID-19 had a mortality rate that is twice as high compared to those without a psychiatric condition [<xref rid="pone.0258916.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The authors speculated that there may be a causal relationship between psychiatric disorders and/or psychotropic medication and the immune system. A systematic screening of protein-protein interactions to identify critical factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection found that typical antipsychotics may have antiviral effects against COVID-19 while atypical antipsychotics do not [<xref rid="pone.0258916.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. As a proof of concept, the authors then utilized medical billing data to confirm their drug repurposing targets and found that half as many of the new users of typical antipsychotics (N = 13) compared with the new users of atypical antipsychotics (N = 26) progressed to the point of requiring mechanical ventilation. Another observational study found a reduced risk for intubation or death from COVID-19 to be associated with antidepressants as home medications, if they were continued within 48 hours of hospital admission [<xref rid="pone.0258916.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. A significant association of antipsychotics use with intubation or death (Hazard ration = 1.98) was observed in the crude analysis, but not in the multivariate analysis of this earlier study. These findings underscore both the importance and complexity of investigating psychotropic medication use and COVID-19 outcomes.</p>
              <p>We found that despite mental status changes being a common symptom in COVID-19, geriatric behavioral health patients in our study did not show worsening of psychiatric function during the short-term post-COVID period. There had been considerations that COVID-19 may potentially trigger future neurodegeneration through neuroinflammatory mechanisms [<xref rid="pone.0258916.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. One large study that included adults at all ages indicated a bidirectional interplay between COVID-19 and psychiatric problems [<xref rid="pone.0258916.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. They found that survivors of COVID-19 appear to be at increased risk of psychiatric sequelae including dementia, and a psychiatric diagnosis might be an independent risk factor for negative outcomes of COVID-19. A potential mechanism may include damage to blood-brain barrier mediated by a massive increase in circulating pro-inflammatory factors [<xref rid="pone.0258916.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. It is critical that COVID-19 survivors receive longitudinal follow-up neuropsychiatric assessments to monitor and investigate the long-term neurocognitive outcome.</p>
              <p>Our study has several limitations. First, the odds ratio for the association of antipsychotics and mortality had wide confidence interval that is likely due to the small sample size. Second, adjusting for covariables in a small sample may lead to overfitting of the multiple logistic regression model. Third, mortality could be affected by additional demographic and clinical factors [<xref rid="pone.0258916.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] that were not accounted for, which further limits the generalizability of our findings. Despite the sample size limitation, our exploratory results nevertheless present an addition to the discussion on the interplay between COVID-19 and mental health [<xref rid="pone.0258916.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] as well as the post-COVID recovery [<xref rid="pone.0258916.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Given the retrospective observational character of our study, we emphasize that although we report a significant correlation between long-term antipsychotic medication usage and COVID-19 mortality, any hypothetical causal relation remains to be understood. Antipsychotics are frequently prescribed in geriatric patients to treat a wide spectrum of disorders. Our study is statistically underpowered to investigate the effects of subtypes of antipsychotic medication as well as the combined effects of different psychotropics and underlying behavioral health conditions.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>We observed a higher COVID-19 mortality associated with antipsychotics use in older patients receiving behavioral health services. The majority of COVID-19 survivors recovered without overt psychiatric sequelae during short-term follow-ups. Future studies with larger data sets and meta-analysis will provide more precise estimates of the degree of risk of antipsychotic treatment in the elderly with comorbid COVID-19 so that providers and consumers can consider risks, benefits, and alternatives.</p>

              <p>Dear Dr. Freudenberg-Hua,</p>
              <p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE’s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.</p>
              <p>Please submit your revised manuscript by Aug 14 2021 11:59PM. If you will need more time than this to complete your revisions, please reply to this message or contact the journal office at <email>plosone@plos.org</email>. When you're ready to submit your revision, log on to <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/</ext-link> and select the 'Submissions Needing Revision' folder to locate your manuscript file.</p>

              <p>Reviewer #1: This is a retrospective observational study in a community-based geriatric psychiatric clinic. The authors found that concurrent antipsychotic use was associated with increased risk of mortality from acute COVID-19 infection in older patients with preexisting behavioral health problems, even after adjusting for age, gender, living arrangement, and dementia. They also compared pre- and post-COVID CGI-S scores of the patients, and found that 88% of the patients recovered to pre-COVID level of functioning. The authors did a great job interpreting their results and their discussion was very interesting and important.</p>
              <p>• Major comments –</p>
              <p>o The odds ratio of mortality for patients using antipsychotics has a wide confidence interval, probably due to the small sample size. Furthermore, of the 56 people, 13 expired. Using the 10:1 event:variable rule of thumb to inspect potential overfitting of logistic regression, the authors should be very careful when interpreting their results.</p>
              <p>o The primary outcome is COVID-19 mortality. However, older adults are susceptible to other types of mortality. Were people counted as expired from COVID if their main cause of death on their death certificate was COVID? Please address in more detail how the authors handled competing risks.</p>
              <p>o The study’s secondary outcome: pre- and post- covid CGI-S was reported by the patient’s treating geriatric psychiatrists. In line 106, the authors mentioned CGI-S is extracted from EHR. But in line 165: “when surveyed, the treating geriatric psychiatrists reported …”. Please specify if CGI-S is routinely evaluated and extracted from EHR, or how the authors reduced the potential bias from outcome reporting.</p>
              <p>o The authors can consider a table that summarizes study characteristics of patients with and without antipsychotics use, because the clinical characteristics of these two populations may be very different.</p>
              <p>• Minor comments–</p>
              <p>o Line 143: The authors mentioned they adjusted for age, gender, living arrangements, and dementia diagnosis in their logistic regression, but given the excel supplementary file, should also add “adjusted for antidepressants”?</p>
              <p>o Line 144-149: Can consider summarizing a table of mortality stratified by typical, atypical, and combination antipsychotics.</p>
              <p>o Line 154: Not specified if psychotropic agents use were counted as antipsychotics use. If not, should be more explicit.</p>

              <p>Reviewer #1: This is a retrospective observational study in a community-based geriatric psychiatric clinic. The authors found that concurrent antipsychotic use was associated with increased risk of mortality from acute COVID-19 infection in older patients with preexisting behavioral health problems, even after adjusting for age, gender, living arrangement, and dementia. They also compared pre- and post-COVID CGI-S scores of the patients, and found that 88% of the patients recovered to pre-COVID level of functioning. The authors did a great job interpreting their results and their discussion was very interesting and important.</p>
              <p>• Major comments –</p>
              <p>1. The odds ratio of mortality for patients using antipsychotics has a wide confidence interval, probably due to the small sample size. Furthermore, of the 56 people, 13 expired. Using the 10:1 event:variable rule of thumb to inspect potential overfitting of logistic regression, the authors should be very careful when interpreting their results.</p>
              <p>&gt; We agree with reviewer #1 that the wide OR is due to the small sample size and that we should be careful to interpret the result. We have further emphasized that point in the Discussion (page 12). We wrote: “First, the odds ratio for the association of antipsychotics and mortality had wide confidence interval that is likely due to the small sample size. Second, adjusting for covariables in a small sample may lead to overfitting of the multiple logistic regression model.”</p>
              <p>2. The primary outcome is COVID-19 mortality. However, older adults are susceptible to other types of mortality. Were people counted as expired from COVID if their main cause of death on their death certificate was COVID? Please address in more detail how the authors handled competing risks.</p>
              <p>&gt; This is a valid statement. We didn’t obtain death certificate. The patients who died while hospitalized for COVID-19 were considered as COVID-19 mortality. However, it is well known that comorbidities contribute to COVID-19 mortality. In Discussion section on page 12 we added “Third, mortality could be affected by additional demographic and clinical factors(30) that were not accounted for, which further limits the generalizability of our findings.”</p>
              <p>3. The study’s secondary outcome: pre- and post- covid CGI-S was reported by the patient’s treating geriatric psychiatrists. In line 106, the authors mentioned CGI-S is extracted from EHR. But in line 165: “when surveyed, the treating geriatric psychiatrists reported …”. Please specify if CGI-S is routinely evaluated and extracted from EHR, or how the authors reduced the potential bias from outcome reporting.</p>
              <p>&gt; We thank the reviewer for pointing out the need to clarify. We made clarifications in the Methods section on page 5-6 “The CGI-S, which is integrated in the EHR but not as a required field, is routinely used by the treating psychiatrists during clinical assessments” and on page 6 “In addition to CGI-S, the treating psychiatrists (who typically follow the same patients longitudinally) were surveyed in October 2020 for their impression of whether the patients recovered to their pre-COVID functional baseline.” All patients included in this study were under the active psychiatric care of the study authors.</p>
              <p>4. The authors can consider a table that summarizes study characteristics of patients with and without antipsychotics use, because the clinical characteristics of these two populations may be very different.</p>
              <p>&gt; As requested by reviewer #1 we made an additional supporting Table S4 “Patient Characteristics stratified by antipsychotics use”. We added the sentence on page 8 “In univariable analysis, antipsychotics use was not significantly associated with age, gender, living arrangements or dementia (Table S4).”</p>
              <p>• Minor comments–</p>
              <p>o Line 143: The authors mentioned they adjusted for age, gender, living arrangements, and dementia diagnosis in their logistic regression, but given the excel supplementary file, should also add “adjusted for antidepressants”?</p>
              <p>&gt; We thank the reviewer #1 for the suggestions. As the reviewer mentioned in the Major comments, the sample size is too small to allow adjusting for many covariables. We did not adjust for antidepressants as a variable in our main model. In a larger study, all medications should be adjusted. We did a sensitivity analysis that included antidepressants and we wrote on page 8 “Further adjusting for antidepressants use as a sensitivity analysis didn’t change the association (Table S3)”. We included antidepressants in the supplementary table S2 thinking that other researchers who conduct meta-analysis might find this information helpful. </p>
              <p>o Line 144-149: Can consider summarizing a table of mortality stratified by typical, atypical, and combination antipsychotics.</p>
              <p>&gt; As indicated on page 9 line 294, only two patients received typical antipsychotics as monotherapy. Given the extremely small sample size we don’t think it’s meaningful to present a stratified table. The information is included in the Table S2 for those who are interested.</p>
              <p>o Line 154: Not specified if psychotropic agents use were counted as antipsychotics use. If not, should be more explicit.</p>
              <p>&gt; We did not analyze “other psychotropics” in this study and thus, we removed this category.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: TITLE</p>
              <p>I suggest a more focused title. “Acute and Post-acute Outcome” is too general. What do you mean for Acute and Post-acute Outcome? Please clarify</p>
              <p>&gt; We thank reviewer #2 for this constructive suggestion and we changed the title to “Mortality and psychiatric outcome among geriatric psychiatry outpatients with Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)”.</p>
              <p>INTRODUCTION.</p>
              <p>The present manuscript provides a very constructive background in terms of side effects of antipsychotic medication and COVID-19. However, I suggest a more specific review of the literature on the importance of psychological support in improving COVID-19 complications.</p>

Accordingly, we used both paired t-test to compare the means and Wilcoxon paired signed rank test to compare the medians of individual pre- (T0) and post-COVID-19 (T1) CGI-S.” We updated the results on page 10: “Comparing the aggregated T0 and T1 CGI-S scores, we found no significant difference (paired t-test for differences of the mean CGI-S: P=0.23 and Wilcoxon paired signed rank test for median: P=0.35) (Fig 2).”</p>
              <p>Since these tests are not significant, we did not explore the usage of other tests.</p>
              <p>- “pre- and post-COVID-19 CGI-S for patients with available data”. Please state the timing making explicit T0 and T1.</p>
              <p>&gt; We introduced the term T0 and T1 on page 6: “CGI-S scales from September 1st 2019 to the date of COVID-19 for each patient are defined as pre-COVID (T0) and from the date of COVID-19 till October 22nd 2020 (time point of EHR data extraction) are defined as post-COVID (T1) measures.”</p>
              <p>- “CGI-S scales from September 1st 2019 to the date of COVID-19 for each patient are defined as pre-COVID and from the date of COVID-19 till October 22nd 2020 (time point of EHR data extraction) are defined as post-COVID measures”. Could the interval of time between COVID-19 diagnosis and CGI-S scale affect the results?</p>
              <p>&gt; This is an interesting question, which could be addressed in a future study that has sufficient number of patients who are assessed at specific post-COVID time intervals. </p>
              <p>RESULTS.</p>
              <p>Please report data as mean and standard deviation or median and interquartile range.</p>
              <p>&gt; We updated the Table and on page 7 we wrote: “A total of 56 patients (mean age 76.0 ± 8.5 years; median age: 74.5 years; interquartile range: 13.0 years) (Table; Table S2) with confirmed COVID-19 were reported to the treating psychiatrists between February and September 2020.”</p>
              <p>DISCUSSION.</p>
              <p>“As older adults are particularly vulnerable to the negative consequence of antipsychotic exposure and to higher mortality risk from COVID-19”. Please add a reference.</p>
