              <abstract>
                <p>West Nile virus (WNV) is an emerging <italic>flavivirus</italic> capable of infecting the central nervous system (CNS) and mediating neuronal cell death and tissue destruction. The processes that promote inflammation and encephalitis within the CNS are important for control of WNV disease but, how inflammatory signaling pathways operate to control CNS infection is not defined. Here, we identify IL-1β signaling and the NLRP3 inflammasome as key host restriction factors involved in viral control and CNS disease associated with WNV infection. Individuals presenting with acute WNV infection displayed elevated levels of IL-1β in their plasma over the course of infection, suggesting a role for IL-1β in WNV immunity. Indeed, we found that in a mouse model of infection, WNV induced the acute production of IL-1β <italic>in vivo</italic>, and that animals lacking the IL-1 receptor or components involved in inflammasome signaling complex exhibited increased susceptibility to WNV pathogenesis. This outcome associated with increased accumulation of virus within the CNS but not peripheral tissues and was further associated with altered kinetics and magnitude of inflammation, reduced quality of the effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response and reduced anti-viral activity within the CNS. Importantly, we found that WNV infection triggers production of IL-1β from cortical neurons. Furthermore, we found that IL-1β signaling synergizes with type I IFN to suppress WNV replication in neurons, thus implicating antiviral activity of IL-1β within neurons and control of virus replication within the CNS. Our studies thus define the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway and IL-1β signaling as key features controlling WNV infection and immunity in the CNS, and reveal a novel role for IL-1β in antiviral action that restricts virus replication in neurons.</p>

                <title>Author Summary</title>
                <p>Since its introduction into North America in 1999, West Nile virus (WNV) has emerged as a leading cause of viral encephalitic disease in the United States. While low level inflammation is important for clearance of WNV, high levels of inflammation are associated with increased disease. The goal of this study was to identify host signaling pathways that control the balance of inflammation and protective immunity to WNV. Using a mouse model of infection, we identified a central nervous system (CNS)-intrinsic requirement for the NLRP3 inflammasome and IL-1β signaling in limiting WNV associated disease within the CNS. First, IL-1β signaling was essential for regulating the magnitude and kinetics of inflammation within CNS. Secondly, the absence of IL-1β signaling disrupted the quality of the effector T lymphocyte response against the virus. Finally, these dysregulated immune responses were linked to a direct ability for IL-1β signaling to synergize with type I IFN signaling and limit virus replication within cortical neurons, key target cells of WNV infection within the CNS. Together this study identifies the NLRP3 inflammasome and IL-1β signaling as key restriction factors that act to regulate viral load and the quality of inflammatory responses within the CNS to impart protective immunity against WNV infection.</p>

              <p>West Nile virus (WNV) is a single stranded, positive sense RNA virus of the <italic>flaviviridae</italic> family, and is a prototypical <italic>Flavivirus</italic> related to Yellow fever virus, Tick borne encephalitis virus, Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and Dengue virus <xref rid="ppat.1003039-Kramer1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1003039-Poidinger1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, all of which are major public health threats. Among these viruses, WNV has emerged into the Western hemisphere and continues its spread through into North America <xref rid="ppat.1003039-Gubler1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. WNV is normally maintained in mosquito and avian reservoirs, with infection of human and other animals occurring through contact with infected mosquitoes <xref rid="ppat.1003039-Hayes1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1003039-Samuel1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Infection is largely controlled acutely; however WNV can spread to the central nervous system (CNS), leading to encephalitic disease and death <xref rid="ppat.1003039-Davis1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1003039-Sejvar1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Overall however, the immune processes within the CNS that serve to control WNV infection and pathogenesis are not well defined.</p>
              <p>WNV pathogenesis has been studied in murine models of infection to show that the virus initially replicates in epithelial cells and skin Langerhans dendritic cells (DCs) at the site of mosquito inoculation <xref rid="ppat.1003039-Byrne1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. The virus then traffics to the draining lymph node, leading to secondary viremia and infection of the spleen where it can replicate in macrophage and DC subsets <xref rid="ppat.1003039-Samuel1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003039-Suthar1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. After amplification in peripheral tissues, WNV spreads to the CNS, where it replicates in neurons, causes neuronal destruction, and imparts inflammation leading to encephalitis that is comparable to human disease <xref rid="ppat.1003039-Samuel1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1003039-Sejvar1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Both innate and adaptive immune defenses serve to control tissue tropism and initial spread of virus into to the CNS <xref rid="ppat.1003039-Diamond1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1003039-Shrestha1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, while T lymphocyte responses are involved in mediating clearance of virus following CNS entry <xref rid="ppat.1003039-Shrestha2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1003039-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. In particular, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are thought to be the main contributors to late CNS clearance of WNV through mechanisms involving IFN-γ, TNF-α and perforin <xref rid="ppat.1003039-Shrestha1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1003039-Shrestha2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003039-Shrestha3" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p>
              <p>The inflammatory response is a key component in protective immunity against WNV infection. However, this response must be kept in check to limit bystander destruction of both peripheral and CNS tissues. For example encephalitis, which is marked by inflammatory cell recruitment to the CNS, has been shown to be both protective as well as destructive to CNS tissue during WNV infection <xref rid="ppat.1003039-King1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Recruitment of populations of peripheral CD45<sup>+</sup> leukocytes into the CNS has been shown to be important for limiting WNV pathogenesis <xref rid="ppat.1003039-Shrestha4" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1003039-Town1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. In contrast, in other studies CD45<sup>+</sup> leukocytes were shown to enhance susceptibility to WNV, likely due to increased immune-pathology associated with inflammatory cell-mediated destruction of CNS tissue. Thus, while inflammation is required for clearance of WNV in the CNS, the timing and magnitude of this inflammatory response must be tightly regulated to avoid off target pathology.</p>
              <p>IL-1 signaling is involved in multiple aspects of the immune response to infection including immune regulation of inflammation, modulation of adaptive immune programs and direct antiviral control of pathogens <xref rid="ppat.1003039-Ichikawa1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1003039-Kanneganti1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. These processes are driven by IL-1α and IL-1β which signal through the IL-1R1 (IL-1Rα) and MyD88 to drive downstream NF-κB activation and subsequent expression of genes whose products regulate the immune response to infection <xref rid="ppat.1003039-Ichikawa1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003039-Dinarello1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1003039-Muzio1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Activation of IL-1 requires two distinct signals, “signal 1” which drives mRNA expression in an NF-κB-dependent manner and “signal 2” which processes the cytokine to its functional form <xref rid="ppat.1003039-Martinon1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. “Signal 2” processing of IL-1β to its active form is mediated by inflammasomes, signaling structures comprised of NOD-like receptors (NLRs), adaptor molecules such as ASC and the effector, Caspase-1 <xref rid="ppat.1003039-Martinon1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1003039-Tschopp1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. In contrast, IL-1α is not processed by the inflammasome and is instead thought to processed and activated by other host protease pathways <xref rid="ppat.1003039-Dinarello2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> suggesting that the majority of immune responses driven by inflammasome activation are mediated by IL-1β and not IL-1α.</p>
              <p>Several distinct inflammasomes have been described based upon their inclusion of a specific NLR or signaling-initiator molecule, including the NLRP1, NLRC4, NLRP3, RIG-I and AIM2 <xref rid="ppat.1003039-Bryant1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Of these, the NLRP3 inflammasome has been the best characterized to mediate IL-1β secretion in response to RNA viruses <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>
<xref rid="ppat.1003039-Kanneganti1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003039-Rajan1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Inflammasome activation and IL-1β signaling are important for immunity against several viruses including Influenza A, hepatitis B, Sendai and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) <xref rid="ppat.1003039-Kanneganti1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> and drive host responses that regulate cellular infiltration to sites of infection <xref rid="ppat.1003039-Allen1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1003039-Sergerie1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, adaptive immunity <xref rid="ppat.1003039-BenSasson1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003039-Ichinohe1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> and direct viral control in combination with other host factors such as IFN-α/β (type I IFN), IFN-γ and TNF-α <xref rid="ppat.1003039-Ichikawa1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1003039-Daniels1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003039-Hurgin1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. In the context of CNS infection, IL-1 signaling has been associated with both protection and enhancement of disease. The synergistic effects of IL-1β and TNF-α were associated with protection against encephalitis by the neurotropic virus HSV-1 <xref rid="ppat.1003039-Sergerie1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> while IL-1β<sup>−/−</sup> animals showed increased pathogenesis and lethality to Sindbis virus <xref rid="ppat.1003039-Liang1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1003039-Prow1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Thus, IL-1 signaling likely functions in a context-dependent manner to control or exacerbate disease. Little is known about IL-1 signaling in immunity to <italic>flavivirus</italic> infection. Recently, JEV was shown to trigger IL-1β secretion from astrocytes and microglia <xref rid="ppat.1003039-Das1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, and this was subsequently shown to be dependent on the NLRP3 inflammasome <xref rid="ppat.1003039-Kaushik1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. In addition, IL-1β expression was shown to be important for recruitment of DCs to the lymph node after WNV infection <xref rid="ppat.1003039-Byrne1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Thus, inflammasome signaling may integrate with multiple immune pathways to participate in the control of <italic>Flavivirus</italic> infection.</p>
              <p>In this study, we systemically examined the role of IL-1 signaling in WNV infection to show that IL-1β signaling driven by the NLRP3 inflammasome acts to mediate protective immunity against infection. We reveal a novel role for IL-1β in specifically limiting viral replication within the CNS. Mechanistically, IL-1β synergizes with type I IFN to control virus replication. Moreover, we found that the lack of viral control in <italic>Il-1r<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice correlated with defects in CNS inflammation, T lymphocyte effector activity, and neuropathology. Our observations link the production of IL-1β in the CNS to restriction of WNV replication in neurons and limitation of CNS disease and thus we conclude that the NLRP3 inflammasome and IL-1 signaling are important determinants of immune regulation that impart protective CNS inflammation and control of WNV infection.</p>

                <p>In order to assess whether IL-1 was associated with human WNV infection, we examined cytokine expression in the plasma from individuals infected with WNV. Blood donors, testing positive for WNV RNA after routine blood screening were enrolled in a follow-up study to assess their plasma cytokine levels over a six-month period after their initial blood donation (index). We observed that the levels of IFN-γ and TNF-α, immune factors important in immunity to WNV, <xref rid="ppat.1003039-Shrestha1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003039-Shrestha4" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> were enhanced in individuals infected with WNV and the expression of these factors was maintained for long periods of time in these individuals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003039.s001">Figure S1A</xref>,B).</p>
                <p>In addition to these known host restriction factors, the levels of IL-1β were enhanced in the plasma of WNV<sup>+</sup> individuals and displayed significant increase over time (trend analysis) at 7, 21, 42, and 180 days post-index when compared to normal controls (Cntrl) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003039-g001">Figure 1A</xref>; trend analysis (p&lt;0.0001), inset). This was similar to the expression of the IL-1r antagonist (IL-1ra), a natural regulator of IL-1β <xref rid="ppat.1003039-Dinarello1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, which is known to track with expression of the cytokine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003039-g001">Figure 1B</xref>; trend analysis (p = 0.003), inset). In contrast, levels of IL-1α in the plasma were not altered by WNV infection at any time-point tested (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003039.s001">Figure S1C</xref>). These data are consistent with the expression of IFN-γ and TNF-α, and is in line with recent data demonstrating that WNV RNA persists at low levels out to 200 days post-index in whole blood of infected humans <xref rid="ppat.1003039-Lai1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref> and <italic>in vivo</italic> in peripheral tissues of mice <xref rid="ppat.1003039-Appler1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref> for extended periods of time.</p>

                    <p>IL-1 in plasma of WNV infected (n = 43) and control subjects (n = 21). Plasma from blood donors testing positive for WNV RNA was collected at time-points from 7 to 180 days post-Index and was compared to control (cntrl) samples. Samples were then assessed for IL-1β (<bold>A</bold>) or IL-1ra (<bold>B</bold>). IL-1β correlates inversely with WNV load. The level of WNV RNA was measured by real-time RT-PCR for days 7, 14, 21, 30, and 42 post-index (<bold>C, left axis</bold>). Levels of IL-1β at days 7, 21, and 42 post-index are displayed (<bold>C, right axis</bold>).

                <p>We found that WNV RNA levels decreased from day 7 to day 21 post-index (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003039-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). This correlated with the induction of IL-1β at day 7, suggesting that initial viral load might drive the expression of the cytokine. In contrast, an inverse correlation was found between the levels of WNV viral load and the levels of IL-1β in plasma during the first six weeks post-index (GEE estimate = −1.28, p = 0.01). Together, these data demonstrate that IL-1β expression but not IL-1α expression is associated with WNV infection in humans and indicates that WNV infection triggers the inflammasome signaling pathway to induce IL-1β during infection.</p>

WT mice presented with clinical signs of disease, including mild-paresis and weight loss, by day 6 post-infection (p.i.) with WNV. These responses peaked by day 10 p.i. and the majority of mice were fully recovered by day 16 p.i. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003039-g002">Figures 2B,C</xref>).

                <p>IL-1β, but not IL-1α, requires processing via the NLRP3-inflammasome for its functional secretion and activity against multiple viruses <xref rid="ppat.1003039-Dinarello2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Therefore we next examined whether NLRP3 signaling was responsible for the observed phenotype in <italic>Il-1r<sup>−/−</sup></italic> animals infected with WNV. We found that mice lacking NLRP3 (58.3% mortality) or its downstream effector, Caspase-1 (50% mortality), displayed increased susceptibility and clinical disease in response to WNV challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003039-g002">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003039.s002">S2A</xref>–D). This outcome was in contrast to infection of mice lacking NLRC4, which mediates a distinct inflammasome not associated with IL-1β processing in response to viral infection <xref rid="ppat.1003039-Kanneganti1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. In these mice, the absence of NLRC4 did not influence susceptibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003039-g002">Figure 2E</xref>) or clinical disease (Figures S2E,F) to WNV infection compared with WT controls. Thus, these observations are consistent with WNV infection triggering “signal 2” processing of IL-1β <italic>in vivo</italic> through the NLRP3 inflammasome to mediate immunity. In addition to inflammasome processing of IL-1β, we also examined the requirement for Myd88, the adaptor protein that propagates both IL-1 and TLR signaling <xref rid="ppat.1003039-Muzio1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Similar to our observations in <italic>Il-1r<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and NLRP3-inflammasome deficient animals, <italic>Myd88<sup>−/−</sup></italic> animals were highly susceptible to WNV challenge (100% mortality) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003039-g002">Figure 2F</xref>).

We observed no difference in the kinetics or magnitude of viral load detected between WT and <italic>Il-1r<sup>−/−</sup></italic> deficient animals within the spleen or serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003039-g003">Figures 3B,C</xref>), and this was consistent with the lack of appreciable IL-1β at the peak of viral replication in these tissues (Figures S2B, data not shown). In contrast, we observed a modest trend of increased viral load at day 2 post infection in the DLN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003039-g003">Figure 3A</xref>), suggesting a role for IL-1β signaling in immunity to WNV at early time-points. Despite only minimal differences in viral load in peripheral organs, viral load in the brains of <italic>Il-1r<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice was increased when compared to WT mice as early as day 8 p.i. and this persisted through day 10 p.i. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003039-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). A similar enhancement of viral load was observed in the brains of MyD88 and NLRP3-deficient animals (Figures S4A,B), as well as, in day 10 spinal cords of all IL-1 signaling-deficient animals (Figures S4C). The difference in viral control were not due to earlier entry of virus in the CNS as virus was first detected in the CNS at day 6 p.i. with similar magnitude of viral load in both strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003039-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). Instead, the initial differences in viral control occurred between day 7 and 8 p.i. and correlated to a time-point in which IL-1β was detected at high levels in WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003039-g003">Figure 3D,E</xref>). Together, these data suggest NLRP3 inflammasome activation of IL-1β and the subsequent actions of IL-1β operate to limit the replication and/or spread of WNV within the CNS.</p>
                <p>Type I interferon (IFN) signaling has been shown to contribute to control of tissue tropism and CNS control of WNV <xref rid="ppat.1003039-Suthar1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003039-Lazear1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1003039-Samuel2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Therefore, we tested whether type I IFN could be involved in the lack of viral control in the DLN and CNS of inflammasome-deficient animals. We did not observe a significant difference in secretion of IFN-β in the serum or spleen of infected <italic>Il-1r<sup>−/−</sup></italic> or WT animals (data not shown). In contrast, we did observe a significant reduction in IFN-β expression in the DLN at day 2 p.i. in <italic>Il-1r<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice as compared to their WT counterparts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003039.s003">Figure S3D</xref>). This difference correlated to a trend of increased viral load (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003039-g003">Figure 3A</xref>) but did not appreciably impact overall peripheral virus replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003039-g003">Figures 3B,C</xref>). In contrast to peripheral tissues, we observed differential expression of IFN-β within the CNS between WT and <italic>Il-1r<sup>−/−</sup></italic> animals. WT mice displayed early IFN-β expression within the CNS with peak levels at day 7 p.i. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003039-g003">Figure 3F</xref>). This was consistent with the peak of viral load in these mice suggesting a direct correlation between virus replication and type I IFN production. In contrast, <italic>Il-1r<sup>−/−</sup></italic> animals showed a delay in expression of IFN-β, with levels tracking with maximal viral load and peaking at day 9 p.i. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003039-g003">Figure 3F</xref>). Importantly, the magnitude of the peak of IFN-β expression was not significantly altered between WT and <italic>Il-1r<sup>−/−</sup></italic> animals despite significantly higher viral loads in the absence of IL-1β signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003039-g003">Figures 3E,F</xref>). These observations suggest that sustained IL-1β signaling in the CNS is important in maintaining efficient activity and/or early type I IFN signaling that controls WNV infection.</p>

                <title>IL-1β signaling regulates the CNS inflammatory response during West Nile virus infection</title>
                <p>IL-1β signaling has been associated with various immune functions including regulation of cell recruitment and inflammation, modulation of adaptive immunity and direct anti-viral activity. Therefore we assessed these activities as possible mechanisms by which IL-1β mediated WNV control in the CNS. We first examined CNS infiltration of total CD45<sup>+</sup> leukocytes as well as a subpopulation of CD45<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> cells (a population which is comprised of macrophage dendritic cell and neutrophil subsets) as these cell populations have been previously associated with immunity against WNV in the CNS <xref rid="ppat.1003039-Shrestha4" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1003039-Town1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Brains of WT or <italic>Il-1r<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice were harvested at day 6, 7, 8 and 10 p.i. with WNV and the kinetics of CD45<sup>+</sup> leukocyte infiltration were assessed by flow cytometry.</p>
                <p>We observed minimal infiltration of CD45<sup>+</sup> leukocytes in the brains of WT or <italic>Il-1r<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice at day 6 p.i.(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003039-g004">Figures 4C</xref>). However, by day 7 p.i., the numbers of total cellular infiltrates, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003039-g004">Figure 4B</xref>), as well as the frequency and total numbers of CD45<sup>+</sup> leukocytes (Figures S5A, 4C) and CD11b<sup>+</sup>/CD45<sup>+</sup> infiltrates (Figures S5B, 4A,D) was increased in WT animals. This was followed by a peak in accumulation of cell infiltrates at day 8 p.i. and subsequent reduction in cell numbers by day 10 p.i. (Figures S5A,B, 4A–C) which tracked with parallel kinetics of viral load in the CNS of WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003039-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). Conversely, <italic>Il-1r<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice displayed reduced numbers total cell infiltrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003039-g004">Figure 4B</xref>) as well as frequency and total numbers of CD45<sup>+</sup> leukocytes (Figures S5A, 4C) and CD11b<sup>+</sup>/CD45<sup>+</sup> (Figures S5B, 4A,D) at day 7 p.i in the CNS. Furthermore, despite reaching levels of infiltrates comparable to WT mice at day 8 p.i., <italic>Il-1r<sup>−/−</sup></italic> animals showed a continued increase in immune cell infiltrates through day 10 p.i., suggesting that the magnitude of inflammation was directly correlated to viral load (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003039-g003">Figure 3E</xref>) in the CNS in these animals.</p>

                <p>Resting microglia express CD11b but are distinguished from activated microglia or infiltrating myeloid cells by lower levels of CD45 expression. We observed the numbers of resting microglia, (CD11b<sup>+</sup>/CD45<sup>lo</sup>), were reduced in the CNS at early times (day 6–7p.i.) in WT and <italic>Il-1r<sup>−/−</sup></italic> animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003039-g004">Figures 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003039.s005">S5C</xref>) suggesting increased activation of a subset of microglia upon viral entry into the CNS in both strains of mice. However, while the numbers of non-activated microglial cells was restored to basal levels by day 10 p.i. in WT mice they remained predominantly active day 10 p.i. in <italic>Il-1r<sup>−/−</sup></italic> animals further suggesting that lack of IL-1β signaling imposes a disruption in CNS inflammatory homeostasis during WNV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003039-g004">Figures 4A,E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003039.s005">S5C</xref>).</p>
                <p>Pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6), and chemokines (CCL5, CCL2) which are involved in the recruitment of CD45<sup>+</sup> leukocytes, were also enhanced in the CNS of <italic>Il-1r<sup>−/−</sup></italic> animals at late time-points when compared to WT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003039-g004">Figures 4F–I</xref>) implying that the increase in these inflammatory mediators likely contributes to the increased inflammation within the CNS of <italic>Il-1r<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice. In contrast, IL-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003039-g004">Figure 4F</xref>) and CCL2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003039-g004">Figure 4I</xref>) were expressed at comparably lower levels at day 7 p.i. in the CNS of <italic>Il-1r<sup>−/−</sup></italic> animals and associated with reduced infiltration of peripheral inflammatory leukocytes. Interestingly we observed increased inflammatory responses in the CNS of NLRP3-deficient animals, which displayed high CNS viral load and enhancement of IL-6, TNF-α and CCL5 levels after WNV infection (Figures S5D–F). Together, these observations indicate that the NLRP3-inflammasome and IL-1β signaling act early during WNV infection to mediate efficient CNS recruitment of immune cells and control CNS viral load.</p>

                <title>IL-1β signaling controls West Nile virus infection in cortical neurons</title>
                <p>To determine how IL-1β signaling mediates CNS-intrinsic control of WNV, we examined WNV infection <italic>ex vivo</italic> in cortical neurons, a primary target cell for WNV replication within the CNS. While a direct antiviral role for IL-1β signaling in neurons has not yet been defined, a previous study demonstrated that neurons from <italic>Myd88</italic>
<sup>−/−</sup> animals presented with increased viral load after WNV infection when compared to their WT counterparts <xref rid="ppat.1003039-Szretter1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Thus, we reasoned that Myd88-dependent IL-1β signaling might promote an antiviral state in these cells. Cortical neurons were prepared from WT and <italic>Il-1r<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice as previously described <xref rid="ppat.1003039-Samuel3" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref> and were purified to greater than 95% based on staining for the neuronal marker, NeuN (data not shown). Cultures were infected with WNV (MOI = 1) and single-step growth curve analysis and their host response to WNV infection was examined.</p>
                <p><italic>Il-1r<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells showed significantly higher viral loads at 24 hr and 48 hr p.i. when compared to their WT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003039-g008">Figure 8A</xref>). This increase was also observed in multi-step growth curve analysis after infection with a lower MOI (0.01), although this was not maintained through 48 hrs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003039.s006">Figure S6A</xref>). We found that WT neurons produced IL-1β as early as 12 hr p.i. after virus challenge and this persisted throughout the course of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003039-g008">Figure 8B</xref>), thus suggesting that neurons might contribute in part to the total IL-1β response in the CNS. The production of IL-1β was detectable in <italic>Il-1r<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells but at generally lower levels than WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003039-g008">Figure 8B</xref>). Remarkably, we observed enhanced IFN-β production in <italic>Il-1r<sup>−/−</sup></italic> neurons at both MOIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003039-g008">Figures 8C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003039.s006">S6B</xref>), however this only effective at reducing viral load after low MOI infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003039-g008">Figure 8A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003039.s006">S6A</xref>). These observations demonstrate that IL-1β signaling contributes to the control of WNV infection in cortical neurons and may operate to enhance the antiviral response mediated by type I IFN signaling.</p>

                <title>IL-1β signaling synergizes with type I IFN to control WNV infection in cortical neurons</title>
                <p>To determine whether IL-1β could impart suppression of WNV replication in cortical neurons, cells were pre-treated for 24 hrs with either media alone, or IL-1β (10 ng/ml), infected with WNV (MOI = 1) and then assessed for viral load in the supernatant. IL-1β treatment of cells resulted in a reduction of detectable WNV at 24 hr (2.5 fold) and 48 hr (1.7 fold) p.i. compared to non-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003039-g008">Figure 8D</xref>). This level of reduction was similar to the fold increase in viral titers observed in <italic>Il-1r<sup>−/−</sup></italic> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003039-g008">Figure 8A</xref>; 24 hr, 2.3 fold, 48 hr, 2.1 fold) thus demonstrating that IL-1β imparts a response that contributes to the control of WNV replication. In WNV-infected <italic>Il-1r<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice we consistently observed increased levels of type I IFN, either in whole tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003039-g003">Figures 3F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003039-g007">7B</xref>) or from cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003039-g008">Figure 8C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003039.s006">S6B</xref>) but this level was insufficient to control the viral load. Thus the actions of IL-1β might function to enhance the antiviral effect of type I IFN against WNV infection.</p>
                <p>To test this idea, we conducted experiments in which cortical neurons were either left untreated or pretreated for 24 hrs with IL-1β (10 ng/ml), IFN-β (100 IU/ml) or both cytokines together, followed by WNV infection and assessment of viral load. Similar to our previous results, IL-1β treatment led to a 2.1-fold reduction in virus at 24 hr p.i while treatment of neurons with IFN-β reduced viral load by 13.5-fold at 24 hr p.i., consistent with previous studies <xref rid="ppat.1003039-Lazear1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1003039-Samuel2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003039-g008">Figure 8E</xref>). Remarkably, when neurons were pretreated with both IL-1β and IFN-β, we observed near complete control of WNV at 24 hr (1500-fold reduction of viral load compared to control; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003039-g008">Figure 8E</xref>). Further, these results were prolonged as the fold reductions by each cytokine were maintained through 48 hrs p.i. (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003039.s006">Figure S6C</xref>). We also observed that pre-treatment of neurons with both IL-1β and IFN-β in the context of WNV infection led to an increase in mRNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003039.s006">Figure S6D</xref>) and protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003039-g008">Figure 8F</xref>) of IFN-β and interferon stimulated genes (ISGs), STAT1, IFIT1, IFIT2 and IFIT3, molecules known to participate in control of WNV <xref rid="ppat.1003039-Daffis1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1003039-Perwitasari1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. This response was comparable to induction by type I IFN in the absence of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003039-g008">Figure 8F</xref>), suggesting that despite the known ability of WNV to antagonize these responses <xref rid="ppat.1003039-Keller1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003039-Suthar2" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, the synergy of IL-1β and type I IFN might act to overcome this antagonism and promote increased viral control. The induction of ISGs was not observed with IL-1β treatment alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003039-g008">Figure 8F</xref>), demonstrating that combined signals induced by viral infection, type I IFN and IL-1β were required for the synergistic activation of these antiviral genes. Therefore we conclude that IL-1β synergizes with type I IFN to enhance antiviral gene programs that control WNV infection in cortical neurons and thus, IL-1β acts as a key host restriction factor in the control of WNV infection.</p>

              <p>Our observations support a model in which IL-1β signaling functions as a host restriction factor to control WNV replication within the CNS. WNV restriction by IL-1β occurs in a manner dependent on the ability of IL-1β to synergize with type I IFN to promote a robust antiviral program in neurons. Further, the capability for IL-1β signaling to control viral load is essential for regulating protective CNS inflammation to control WNV disease, as a lack of IL-1β signaling associates with a breakdown of immunity marked by rapid and uncontrolled viral spread through the CNS, hyper-active inflammatory response and defective CD8<sup>+</sup> T lymphocyte effector activity. Thus, IL-1β is fundamental for the control of WNV infection and immunity.</p>
              <p>To date, three distinct inflammasomes have been described to participate in IL-1β activation in response to viral infection. These include the NLRP3 <xref rid="ppat.1003039-Allen1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003039-Thomas1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003039-Ichinohe1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003039-Rajan2" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, RIG-I <xref rid="ppat.1003039-Poeck1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref> and AIM2 <xref rid="ppat.1003039-FernandesAlnemri1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1003039-Hornung1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref> inflammasomes. While AIM2 is responsible for activation to DNA viruses, both NLRP3 and RIG-I have been associated with IL-1β activation in response to RNA viruses (reviewed in <xref rid="ppat.1003039-Kanneganti1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>). We found that the defects in immunity observed in <italic>Il-1r<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice infected with WNV were pheno-copied in mice deficient in NLRP3 or Caspase-1 suggesting that the NLRP3-inflammasome acts as the predominant pathway for triggering IL-1β production <italic>in vivo</italic> during WNV infection. This is not surprising as NLRP3 activation of IL-1β has been shown to occur in response to multiple RNA and DNA viruses including influenza, Sendai and adenoviruses <xref rid="ppat.1003039-Kanneganti1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> as well as JEV, a WNV related <italic>Flavivirus</italic>
<xref rid="ppat.1003039-Kaushik1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Further, our observations that NLRP3 signaling is important for limiting lethality and tissue destruction during WNV infection <italic>in vivo</italic> is consistent with models of influenza infection which have also shown a requirement for NLRP3 and IL-1β signaling in protective immunity against the virus <xref rid="ppat.1003039-Allen1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003039-Thomas1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003039-Ichinohe1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> as well as in limiting collagen deposition and necrosis of lung tissue <xref rid="ppat.1003039-Thomas1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> and thus demonstrate a broad range for NLRP3 signaling in immunity to virus infection. While NLRP3 and Caspase-1 deficient animals succumbed to WNV infection with similar kinetics and frequency we did observe a trend for increased virulence when compared to <italic>Il-1r<sup>−/−</sup></italic> animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003039-g002">Figure 2A,D</xref>). While this maps the majority of IL-1 signaling to NLRP3 activation, it is possible that other pathways might contribute to this response. As RIG-I has recently been shown to mediate both the activation of “signal 1” as well as “signal 2” in response to vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) in an NLRP3-independent manner <xref rid="ppat.1003039-Poeck1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref> and RIG-I <xref rid="ppat.1003039-Suthar1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003039-Keller1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003039-Fredericksen1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref> plays important roles in sensing and triggering of innate immune pathways against WNV virus, it is possible that this pathway may contribute in addition to NLRP3 in the full activation of IL-1β activation during WNV infection <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
              <p>The contribution of IL-1 signaling to protective immunity against virus infections has largely been attributed to its ability to drive chemokine signaling pathways that recruit immune cells to sites of viral replication <xref rid="ppat.1003039-Liang1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003039-Prow1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003039-Das1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Although CNS recruitment of CD45<sup>+</sup> monocytes and T lymphocytes was largely increased during WNV infection, in the absence of IL-1 signaling, we did observe a reduced frequency and total number of these cells at day 7 post infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003039-g004">Figure 4</xref>) and this is consistent with previous studies that showed that IL-1β was important for optimal cellular recruitment to the DLN after WNV infection <xref rid="ppat.1003039-Byrne1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Therefore, it is possible that this reduction in initial leukocyte and lymphocyte recruitment is sufficient to allow for enough virus to seed infection in neurons and increase the likelihood of CNS spread. Interestingly, despite early differences in cellular recruitment and inflammation in the CNS, by later time-points, we observed a dramatic enhancement in inflammation in <italic>Il-1r<sup>−/−</sup></italic> animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003039-g004">Figure 4</xref>). This is in contrast to recent studies examining WNV infection in Myd88 <xref rid="ppat.1003039-Szretter1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> and TLR7 <xref rid="ppat.1003039-Town1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> deficient animals which show dramatic reduction in cellular infiltrates and inflammation within the CNS. Thus, it is likely, that while IL-1β signaling contributes to cellular recruitment, TLR signaling via MyD88 might play a dominant role in maintaining these responses over time.</p>
              <p>As CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells represent a key component in late CNS control of WNV, it is interesting that IL-1 signaling defects were associated with decreased effector activity of these cells. Our data suggest that increased viral load influence this defect directly by driving increased inflammatory cytokine responses and a reduced frequency of antigen-specific cells to total CD8<sup>+</sup> cells. However, in addition, it is also possible that IL-1β signaling itself is required to directly promote the optimal T cell effector response. This outcome is similar to observations of influenza infection in which IL-1R and NLRP3-inflammasome deficient animals display defective CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T lymphocyte responses in the absence of increased inflammation <xref rid="ppat.1003039-Ichinohe1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Furthermore, MyD88 signaling was found to act in a T cell intrinsic manner to control both proliferation and acquisition of effector responses during LCMV <xref rid="ppat.1003039-Bartholdy1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1003039-Rahman1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref> and vaccinia virus infection <xref rid="ppat.1003039-Quigley1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1003039-Zhao1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>, while direct IL-1 signaling in has been shown to influence the development of multiple T lymphocyte effector populations under multiple experimental conditions <xref rid="ppat.1003039-BenSasson1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Our data are in agreement with a role for IL-1β signaling in driving T cell effector activity during viral infection. Such action might occur against WNV infection by either of two mechanisms: First, IL-1β signaling could indirectly limit inflammation and overstimulation of cells in the CNS that otherwise occurs under conditions of uncontrolled virus replication and dissemination <xref rid="ppat.1003039-Suthar1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003039-Szretter1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1003039-Town1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Secondly, IL-1β signaling could directly drive a response, likely in a Myd88-dependent manner, to positively regulate immune cell effector activity against WNV.</p>
              <p>We observed a significant reduction in type I IFN in the DLN at day 2 p.i. in <italic>Il-1r<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice that correlated with a modest increase in viral load (Figures S3D, 3A). This result is notable because the observation occurred at a time-point that is associated with the accumulation of macrophages and DC subsets trafficking into the DLN from the site of primary infection, wherein type I IFN signaling is associated with control of the virus in these cell types <xref rid="ppat.1003039-Suthar1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. We have also observed reduced type I IFN responses and increased viral replication in primary <italic>Il-1r<sup>−/−</sup></italic> macrophages and DCs infected with WNV <italic>in vitro</italic> (Ramos, HJ; unpublished observations). Furthermore, it has been proposed that viral entry to the CNS could in part be mediated by a “Trojan horse” mechanism in which immune cells harboring WNV infiltrate into the CNS and seed viral infection in neurons <xref rid="ppat.1003039-Samuel1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Together, these observations raise the possibility that the lack of type I IFN in the DLN in <italic>Il-1r<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice is associated with decreased control of virus within macrophages and DCs, which then infiltrate and seed the CNS with virus in an enhanced manner that promotes the robust inflammatory disease observed in <italic>Il-1r<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice. In this sense IL-1β would serve to control virus levels in infected inflammatory cells and thereby restrict virus seeding into the CNS that might occur through infiltration of infected cells.</p>
              <p>Type I IFN and to a lesser extent, IFN-γ, and TNF-α, have also been shown to mediate anti-viral responses to WNV <xref rid="ppat.1003039-Shrestha1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003039-Shrestha4" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> and our results now implicate IL-1β as a component of innate antiviral signaling and response against WNV infection. In support of this, a protective role for IL-1β in combination with TNF-α was shown to be important to the control of hepatitis B virus <xref rid="ppat.1003039-Ichikawa1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1003039-Daniels1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. In addition, <italic>in vitro</italic> studies in hepatocyte cell lines revealed that this effect was mediated by the ability of IL-1β to augment type I and type II IFNs antiviral activities in mechanisms dependent on STAT-1 and P38 MAP kinase <xref rid="ppat.1003039-Ichikawa1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. This phenomenon of IL-1β synergy has also been observed in epithelial cell infection with VSV <xref rid="ppat.1003039-Hurgin1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Therefore, we propose that in the context of WNV infection, IL-1 acts synergistically with type I IFN, and possibly type II IFN and/or TNF-α to mediate an antiviral program to control WNV in the CNS.</p>
              <p>We found that IL-1β treatment of WT cortical neurons <italic>ex vivo</italic> resulted in reduced levels of detectable virus in the supernatants of infected neurons however, this response was not sufficient by itself to fully inhibit the virus. Interestingly, the viral suppression we observed occurred between 24 and 48 hrs of treatment suggesting that IL-1β signals a response in neurons that restricts virus amplification rather than initial infection. This kinetics are suggestive of a mechanism by which products of IL-1β -responsive genes serve to impart control of WNV replication, thus suppressing virus spread within the CNS. Indeed, our data demonstrate that IL-1β acts synergistically in the innate antiviral response along with IFNs and possibly other cytokines to ultimately control virus replication. In line with this notion, we observed that IL-1β and type I IFN synergized to enhance the expression of ISGs such as the IFIT family members IFIT1,2,3. This is of interest as recent studies have implicated these antiviral effectors in the control of CNS specific viruses such as VSV <xref rid="ppat.1003039-Fensterl1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>. Furthermore, recent data had identified IFITs as important in anti-viral control of WNV <xref rid="ppat.1003039-Daffis1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1003039-Perwitasari1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref> and this is dependent on their ability to block the viral replication cycle <xref rid="ppat.1003039-Daffis1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. Therefore, IL-1β might control WNV through its ability to modulate ISGs that impart antiviral actions against WNV replication.</p>
              <p>Control of WNV replication in the CNS is paramount for protection against disease. Our study shows that IL-1β production and signaling are important for protective immunity against WNV suggesting that the NLRP3-inflammasome and IL-1 signaling also likely impact immunity to other <italic>Flaviviruses</italic>. It has been observed that dengue, yellow fever (YFV), St. Louis encephalitis (SLEV) and WNV all trigger IL-1β expression from populations of myeloid derived cells <italic>in vitro</italic>, while YFV, SLEV and WNV have each been linked to suppression of IL-1β signaling at various levels <italic>in vitro</italic>
<xref rid="ppat.1003039-Chang1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1003039-Kong1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>. Taken together, these observations along with those made in this study identify IL-1β as a key host restriction factor in immunity against <italic>Flavivirus</italic> infection.</p>

Blood donors who tested positive for WNV RNA by routine donation screening using the WNV Procleix Transcription Mediated Amplification (TMA) assay were asked to return to their local blood donation center for enrollment after informed consent was completed under a University of California, San Francisco Institutional Review Board approved protocol. Upon enrollment, blood donors agreed to return to their blood center for subsequent follow up visits. Infection was confirmed using follow-up samples showing sero-conversion to anti-WNV IgM. Samples were collected at regional blood centers and were shipped by overnight courier to BSRI. Blood was processed within 24 hours and plasma aliquots were frozen immediately for long term storage. The WNV<sup>+</sup> subjects were 58% male with an average age of 51 years old. The control subjects (Cntrl.) used in this study were 21 BSRI staff members who consented to donate blood for this study and they were 43% male with an average age of 48 years old.</p>
