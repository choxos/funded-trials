                <p>Implementing interventions that manipulate food store environments are one potential strategy for improving dietary behaviors. The present study evaluated intervention effects, from the <italic>El Valor de Nuestra Salud</italic> (The Value of Our Health) study, on in-store environmental changes within Latino/Hispanic-focused food stores (<italic>tiendas</italic>). Sixteen <italic>tiendas</italic> were randomly assigned to either: a six-month structural and social food store intervention or a wait-list control condition. Store-level environmental measures of product availability, placement, and promotion were assessed monthly from baseline through six-months post-baseline using store audits. Linear mixed effects models tested for condition-by-time interactions in store-level environmental measures. Results demonstrated that the intervention was successful at increasing the total number of fruit and vegetable (FV) promotions (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) and the number of FV promotions outside the produce department (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) among <italic>tiendas</italic> in the intervention versus control condition. No changes in product availability or placement were observed. Results suggests changing the marketing mix element of promotions within small stores is measurable and feasible in an in-store intervention. Difficulties in capturing changes in product availability and placement may be due to intervention implementation methods chosen by <italic>tiendas</italic>. It is important to build upon the lessons learned from these types of interventions to disseminate evidence-based in-store interventions.</p>

              <title>1. Introduction</title>
              <p>The importance of the in-store food environment on food purchasing is supported by previous cross-sectional and intervention research. For example, shelf space [<xref rid="B1-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], number of store displays [<xref rid="B2-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B4-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], and promotions [<xref rid="B6-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] influence customers’ purchasing of foods and beverages. Previous interventions that used information-only strategies via print promotions (e.g., shelf labels) observed an increase in sales of targeted foods, including fruits and vegetables (FVs); however, one promotion-related study found no intervention effects on sales of FVs [<xref rid="B8-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Furthermore, interventions that increased the availability of FVs did not always find increased purchases of these foods [<xref rid="B9-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. For example, one systematic review reported that several interventions targeting the availability of FVs (e.g., increasing the number of FVs stocked) observed increases in the overall sales or individual-level purchases of healthy foods such as FVs, however, two interventions using FV availability approaches observed no improvement in the overall purchasing of healthy foods such as FVs [<xref rid="B9-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In a separate systematic review, mixed results were reported for interventions targeting the placement or location of FVs throughout the store (e.g., FVs placed in the front versus the back of the store) and the impact on purchases [<xref rid="B10-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. One intervention placed FV displays near the front of the store to increase their visibility and reported increases in FV purchases among customers; however, other similar interventions reported no improvement in FV purchases [<xref rid="B10-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. A different systematic review concluded that multipronged strategies to increase both the supply (e.g., availability of healthy foods) and demand (e.g., strategies to encourage purchasing at the point-of-purchase [POP]) of FVs were more likely to increase purchases of FV among customers than in-store interventions using single strategies to increase either supply or demand [<xref rid="B12-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In fact, intervention trials utilizing multipronged strategies observed increases of 25–50% in produce sales based on sales data [<xref rid="B12-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This is significant given previous research indicating that food purchases may be reflective of one’s overall dietary intake [<xref rid="B13-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Therefore, in-store interventions to promote purchasing and consumption of FVs is a viable community-level intervention to improve diet. However, given the mixed evidence, it is important to identify whether in-store intervention strategies are effectively implemented to further understand the influence of such strategies on diet.</p>
              <p>In-store interventions are often conceptualized using the Model of Community Nutrition Environments [<xref rid="B14-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This model postulates that in-store environmental characteristics, such as the availability and promotion of healthy and unhealthy foods and beverages, may have direct or indirect influences on food purchasing [<xref rid="B14-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Likewise, Rose et al.’s multi-dimensional conceptual model posits that in-store environmental characteristics can influence food purchasing via characteristics such as increasing shelf space for targeted products [<xref rid="B15-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. These models, in conjunction with the key strategic elements of the marketing mix (product availability, placement, promotion, and price) [<xref rid="B16-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], are often used to inform in-store interventions targeting the purchase of healthy foods such as FVs. To our knowledge, limited research has examined the impact of intervention strategies on marketing mix elements related to FVs at the store environment-level. Understanding which marketing mix elements are most amendable to change is important for the dissemination and implementation of in-store interventions, and ultimately, to improve dietary behaviors [<xref rid="B17-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p>
              <p>Previous studies and systematic reviews on in-store interventions provide evidence for the feasibility of implementation and potential to improve the food store environment [<xref rid="B8-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B12-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B18-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In studies that aimed to increase the availability of healthier foods such as FVs, low-fat milk, and low-fat baked goods in food stores, they were able to successfully increase the overall number of these products within targeted stores based on observed data [<xref rid="B20-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Similarly, an intervention to promote the sales of FVs reported success in increasing measured shelf space for these foods in a large discount supermarket [<xref rid="B24-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Additionally, numerous studies have previously reported success in increasing the number of print promotions (e.g., posters, shelf labels) for healthier foods within stores based on store audits [<xref rid="B12-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B25-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].

              <p><italic>El Valor</italic> was an in-store intervention that tracked changes in customers’ purchasing and intake among those serving on an evaluation cohort (Ayala et al., in preparation). The study occurred in Latino/Hispanic-focused food stores, otherwise known as <italic>tiendas</italic> [<xref rid="B29-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].

                <title>2.2. Intervention Description</title>
                <p><italic>El Valor</italic> was a six-month structural and social intervention implemented within the <italic>tienda</italic> environment and involved the <italic>tiendas</italic> owners/managers and employees. The first two months of the intervention focused on store-level strategies and the last four months were focused on customer-directed strategies. A timeline of the intervention is provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-17-00065-f001">Figure 1</xref>. Customer-directed intervention details [<xref rid="B30-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and primary outcome results are described elsewhere (Ayala et al., in preparation). Because our interest here was to determine whether the intervention was effective at modifying the targeted marketing mix elements for fresh, canned, and frozen FVs, only store-level strategies to modify the <italic>tienda’s</italic> environment for these FVs were examined. To increase the availability and variety of FVs, managers and employees received training on merchandising FVs throughout the <italic>tienda</italic>. To enhance the placement and promotion of FVs throughout the <italic>tienda</italic>, managers received $2000 to purchase new equipment and marketing materials. Decisions on what equipment to purchase was decided between the <italic>tienda</italic> manager and the research intervention coordinator. Managers were encouraged to purchase new fresh FV displays (e.g., cold food bar to promote the sale of ready-to-eat FVs) and/or hardware to improve existing FV displays (e.g., shelf extensions). The promotional strategies involved a four-month FV promotion campaign directed at the customers and included nine bi-weekly food demonstrations (latter not discussed here). The in-store promotional materials, or POP, included: (a) shelf-talkers; (b) aisle violators; (c) posters; (d) a banner; (e) a produce fact sheet; and (f) blank signs (with the <italic>El Valor</italic> logo) that <italic>tienda</italic> managers and employees could use to promote or price FVs. Some of the POP materials remained in place for the four-month period while other POP materials were rotated every two weeks to highlight the <italic>El Valor</italic> recipe and the FV items promoted at the food demonstration. POP materials were also placed outside of the FV department to cross-market FV with other product categories. For example, <italic>tienda</italic> managers were encouraged to use the POP materials in the butcher department to promote meat-vegetable pairings and to apply other cross merchandising opportunities (e.g., POP materials placed in cereal department to promote bananas). Examples of POP materials are included in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijerph-17-00065">Supplementary Material 1</xref>.</p>

                <title>2.3. Tienda Recruitment</title>
                <p><italic>Tiendas</italic> were systematically sampled following an extensive enumeration process. The systematic enumeration was conducted using five sources: (1) county food permits, (2) the county health department directory of food retailers, (3) the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program active vendor list, (4) the Supplement Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) authorized retailer list, and (5) a previous observational study conducted in the target area [<xref rid="B32-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. After the removal of duplicates, non-food stores, stores identifiable as not a <italic>tienda</italic> (e.g., super centers, liquor stores, etc.), excluding zip codes where 2000 Census data indicated that the proportion of Latino/Hispanic residents was less than 20%, and excluding San Diego’s South County because of competing intervention activities, 566 entries were included in the enumeration list. This was further reduced to 339 after initial telephone and internet verification for eligibility. Given time and resource constraints, during the final phases of recruitment, the study team identified four additional zip codes near the study offices that contained census tracts representing at least a 20% Latino/Hispanic population. From these areas, additional entries were added to the previously enumerated list of possible <italic>tiendas</italic>. After removing entries identified as non-food stores, 382 entries were available for verification.</p>
                <p>A store screening checklist was used to determine if the store met <italic>tienda</italic> eligibility criteria to participate in the study. Eligibility criteria for <italic>tiendas</italic> were based on the following: (1) customer-base was largely Latino/Hispanic, (2) some or all employees were bilingual (English/Spanish language) or Spanish-speaking, (3) stores used bilingual (English-Spanish) and/or Spanish language in their in-store product signage, (4) stores offered products and services from Mexico and other Latin American countries, and (5) had a service butcher and a produce department. Full-service supermarkets were excluded. Of the 382 entries left on the enumeration list, 71% (n = 273) were not eligible and 1.5% (n = 6) were duplicates. An additional 26 stores were identified during ground truthing leaving 129 <italic>tiendas</italic> in the recruitment pool. From this recruitment pool, 84 were approached for participation and 21 refused to participate, 14 were not approached for other exclusionary reasons (e.g., owned by participating owner; proximity to another participating store) and 31 were not approached given that the recruitment goal of 16 <italic>tiendas</italic> was met. To minimize sources of variance across study conditions and the potential for cross-contamination, <italic>tiendas</italic> were pair-matched on store size, having a prepared food department, and being at least one mile away from the other <italic>tienda</italic> prior to data collection and randomization to study condition.</p>

                <p>Store audits were conducted by trained research staff. Audits occurred at varying times of day, Monday through Friday. To avoid potential social desirability bias, store owners/managers were unaware of what specific days or times research staff would be conducting the audits. In addition, store owners/managers were unaware that the primary focus was on the availability and promotion of FVs during these observations. Longer store audit assessments were conducted at baseline and six-months post-baseline; abbreviated assessments were conducted in between these two time-points every month. The audit captured the availability of fresh (bulk and pre-cut), canned and frozen FVs, shelf space dedicated to fresh (bulk and pre-cut) FVs, the number of fresh (bulk and pre-cut) FVs displays available, and the promotion of FVs. To assess inter-rater reliability, 100% of baseline and 37.5% of six-month post-baseline store audits were conducted independently by two research assistants at the same time and compared.</p>

                <p>The store audit assessed the availability of fresh (bulk and pre-cut), canned, and frozen FVs at all time-points. Data on the availability (dichotomous: yes [coded as ‘1’]/no [coded as ‘0′]) of fresh, canned, and frozen FVs were collected for a predetermined list of 73 fresh FVs, 16 frozen FVs, and 28 canned FVs, including frozen bags and cans of mixed FVs [<xref rid="B33-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In the current study, availability was defined as follows: (1) the total number of unique types of fresh FVs available (e.g., papaya, banana, avocado, zucchini); (2) the total number of unique types of frozen FVs available (e.g., strawberries, broccoli); and (3) the total number of unique types of canned FVs available (e.g., peaches, beets). Availability scores were computed by summing the available fresh, frozen, and canned FVs (continuous) [<xref rid="B34-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. For example, if fresh, canned, and frozen spinach were available in a <italic>tienda</italic>, this was counted as three. An additional availability score was computed to capture the availability of FV items targeted in the intervention (continuous). These items were listed on recipe cards and included in the POP materials: apples, bananas, grapes, mangos, oranges, strawberries, bell peppers, broccoli, cabbage, carrots, celery, corn, garlic, green beans, green onions, leafy lettuce, mushroom, onions, peas, spinach, squash, and tomato. To compute this variable, all available fresh, canned, and frozen targeted FVs were summed. This operationalization is consistent with research demonstrating that customers are influenced by multiple exposures to a food item versus just a single exposure [<xref rid="B35-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B36-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p>
                <p>Store audits at all time-points also assessed the variety of fresh (bulk and pre-cut) FVs stocked within a <italic>tienda</italic> for each unique fresh FV available.

If the display contained items that were not fresh FVs, the length and width for these areas were also recorded and later subtracted to obtain an accurate measurement of shelf space solely dedicated to fresh FVs. All measurements were rounded to the nearest inch and then recorded in feet. Displays that only stocked prepared or cooked FVs were not measured (e.g., potato salad).

Data imputations were conducted for store audit data for three <italic>tiendas</italic> for the last monthly audit prior to the six-month post-baseline assessment. These <italic>tiendas</italic> were on a different data collection schedule and therefore had fewer assessments. In these cases, values from the previous data collection point were used for a conservative estimate of each marketing mix element. For this study, baseline, monthly abbreviated assessments collected during the intervention phase (months 3–5), and six-month post-baseline data were used to examine intervention effects as they were occurring in the <italic>tienda</italic>. Analyses were performed using SAS software, Version 9.4 of the SAS System for Windows (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).</p>

Presented are results from mixed models estimating condition-by-time effects in marketing mix elements. The first part of the present study’s hypothesis was that compared to <italic>tiendas</italic> in the control condition, <italic>tiendas</italic> in the intervention condition would have increases in product availability (i.e., increases in the availability of overall and intervention-targeted fresh, canned, and frozen FVs and varieties of fresh FVs).

The second part of the hypothesis was that <italic>tiendas</italic> in the intervention condition would have increases in placement (i.e., increases in shelf space dedicated to fresh FVs and number of fresh FV displays) compared to <italic>tiendas</italic> in the control condition. Similar to product availability, non-significant condition-by-time interactions were observed. Lastly, the third part of the hypothesis was that <italic>tiendas</italic> in the intervention condition would have increases in promotion of FVs (i.e., overall number of FV promotions and number of non-FV cross-product category promotions) than <italic>tiendas</italic> in the control condition. Significant condition-by-time interactions were observed on FV promotions (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) and non-FV cross product category promotions (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). During the intervention period, the number of FV promotions increased from 10.9 at baseline to 82.5 during the intervention period, demonstrating a stark increase in FV promotions for the intervention condition. At six-months post-baseline, FV promotions for the intervention condition remained steady with a mean of 84. For the control condition, there was a non-significant increase of FV promotions; 18 at baseline, 16.8 during the intervention period, and 21 at six-months post-baseline. Similar trends were observed for non-FV cross product category promotions. For the intervention condition, the mean number of non-FV cross product category promotions increased from 6.5 at baseline to 44.5 during the intervention period. At six-months post-baseline, the mean number of non-FV cross product category promotions remained steady (42.6).

              <p><italic>El Valor</italic> was an in-store intervention aimed at increasing the purchasing and consumption of FVs among Latinos/Hispanics in San Diego County by modifying the in-store food environment. The present study’s results demonstrate that the intervention was successful in increasing the number of FV promotions and non-FV cross product category promotions in intervention compared with control <italic>tiendas</italic>. However, no intervention effects were observed for the overall number of available fresh, canned, and frozen FVs, varieties of fresh FVs available, availability of targeted FVs in any form, amount of shelf space dedicated to fresh FVs, and number of fresh FV displays.</p>
              <p>These findings support research demonstrating that changing the environment of food stores by increasing the presence of marketing materials such as promotions is both feasible to achieve and measurable to observe [<xref rid="B23-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B25-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B49-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="B50-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="B51-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="B52-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Two previous in-store intervention studies utilizing promotion approaches, such as the use of marketing materials, achieved 75% implementation fidelity for the number of marketing materials placed within the store [<xref rid="B51-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="B52-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Another study reported observing changes in POP signs at mid-intervention and post-intervention [<xref rid="B28-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. However, unlike other intervention studies, <italic>El Valor</italic> was not successful in capturing changes in other aspects of the marketing mix elements such as the availability of fresh, canned, and frozen FVs, shelf space dedicated to fresh FVs, and fresh FV displays [<xref rid="B11-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B21-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B23-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B26-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B53-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="B54-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="B55-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. For example, two previous in-store interventions reported successful increases in the availability of fresh and/or canned FVs [<xref rid="B53-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="B56-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], while another study reported success in replacing shelf space dedicated to snack foods with shelf space dedicated to FVs [<xref rid="B11-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p>
              <p>In a systematic review of store owner/manager’s perspectives on in-store interventions, it was found that store owners/managers are receptive to intervention strategies that are easy to implement and fit into their current work schedule and space [<xref rid="B57-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Increasing the presence of marketing materials is a less intrusive in-store environmental strategy for store owners/managers, which may be a reason why <italic>El Valor</italic> was able to improve this marketing mix element. Additionally, stores often receive incentives, such as marketing materials, from food distributors, therefore, the provision of marketing materials is a practice that store owners/managers already engage in and are likely to continue [<xref rid="B58-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. The provision of marketing material incentives by food distributors may also partially explain the slight, but non-significant, increase in FV promotions and non-FV cross product category promotions within the control condition [<xref rid="B58-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Another possible explanation for this increase in the control condition is that small business owners, such as store owners/managers, often use innovative methods to increase profits. By agreeing to participate in <italic>El Valor</italic> but then being randomized to the control condition, store owners/managers may have utilized their own methods to promote FVs.</p>
              <p>Regarding the intervention’s inability to see observable increases in product availability and placement, this may be due to the types of changes in which the <italic>tienda</italic> owners/managers engaged. For example, some <italic>tienda</italic> managers/owners chose to replace existing displays and equipment for new displays and equipment, therefore not changing the amount of shelf space dedicated to FVs and/or number of FV displays present but rather improving the quality of displays. This was partially due to space constraints to stock and/or install new products and displays, a barrier identified in other small store interventions [<xref rid="B12-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B26-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B57-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="B59-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,<xref rid="B60-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Previous in-store interventions overcame one of these barriers by working closely with store owners/managers to commit to stocking just 1–3 additional FV varieties [<xref rid="B26-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Additionally, <italic>tiendas</italic> in this study already began with a greater number of FVs available and greater shelf space dedicated to FVs compared to other small stores involved in intervention research [<xref rid="B34-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B37-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B42-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="B61-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Therefore, improving methods to capture alternative changes in FV availability and placement (e.g., measures that capture the quality of a replacement FV display) in stores that already stock FVs need to be developed and utilized in food environment research.</p>
              <p>Another barrier to increasing product availability and placement for healthy foods, such as FVs, is time and effort [<xref rid="B57-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Store owners/managers are more likely to stock unhealthy foods because often the distributors of these foods provide direct assistance with the delivery and stocking of these foods [<xref rid="B57-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. In future intervention trials, potential strategies to successfully improve the availability and placement of FVs may include using adaptive intervention approaches. Adaptive intervention approaches include a pre-determined sequence of decision rules that specify how the intensity or type of intervention strategy should change depending on data collected [<xref rid="B62-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>,<xref rid="B63-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. For example, if data collected during the intervention period demonstrates that stores are not improving product availability and placement, additional skill training and technical assistance could be provided to further support stores at improving these marketing mix elements. An adaptive intervention is not feasible in a randomized controlled trial with rolling random assignment, however, such an intervention design would work well with a Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) design [<xref rid="B64-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>].</p>
              <p>The present study does have a few limitations. <italic>El Valor</italic> targeted the marketing mix elements of product availability and placement, but the present study showed no improvement in those elements. This may be due to a mismatch between the measurement approach utilized in this study and intervention implementation, which did not solely target increased stocking of FVs but also targeted quality improvements in the presentation, or displays, of FVs. Additionally, the present study did not account for differences in the locations or types of FV displays and promotions utilized, which may have varying degrees of influence on purchasing and therefore should be studied [<xref rid="B65-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>,<xref rid="B66-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Strengths of the present study include the sample size, its cluster randomized controlled design, and its use of systematic data collection via objective measurements of the in-store environment. Additionally, this study fills a research gap as it focused on <italic>tiendas,</italic> a food environment that has not been well represented in the literature in terms of in-store interventions.</p>

              <title>5. Conclusions</title>
              <p>Results suggest that changing the marketing mix element of promotions within small stores, similar to the ones used in this study, is measurable and feasible in an in-store intervention such as <italic>El Valor</italic>. Longitudinal studies are needed to further examine the direct influence of the marketing mix elements, such as promotions, on the purchasing of healthy and unhealthy foods. The type of food store in which such studies are conducted need to be considered as the ability to implement marketing mix strategies may differ in small stores versus supermarkets [<xref rid="B8-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B10-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Supermarkets may not have the flexibility to change marketing mix elements due to their organizational policies. However, an alternative for future researchers interested in supermarkets food environment research is the use of simulated, or virtual, stores to test intervention strategies for eventual buy-in from supermarkets [<xref rid="B10-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Additionally, formative research and/or adaptive intervention approaches should be conducted to understand how to influence product availability and placement within stores given previous evidence demonstrating the relationship between these dimensions and dietary behaviors [<xref rid="B11-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B37-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B67-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. One potential way to effectively manipulate multiple aspects of the in-store environment is by involving multiple partners [<xref rid="B58-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="B68-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. For example, FV distributors and/or farmers could provide store owners/managers with technical assistance and training in acquiring and maintaining fresh FVs. Such a strategy can help build partnerships between important players in the food industry, build the capacity of stores to properly stock fresh FVs, and also foster sustainable changes [<xref rid="B69-ijerph-17-00065" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Lastly, additional sensitive measures of the in-store environment need to be developed for small food stores that decide to implement alternative changes, such as the replacement of existing displays, in FV availability and placement.</p>
