                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are often used in alcohol use disorders. Clinical trials with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors for alcohol use disorders, however, have yielded mixed results. The goal of this project was to assess whether a single i.v. dose of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor reduces craving for alcohol and/or simultaneously increases striatal dopamine concentration in individuals with alcohol dependence.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Alcohol-dependent (DSM-IV-TR criteria) volunteers and matched controls (n = 10/group) underwent a double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subjects study. Participants received i.v. citalopram (40 mg) or saline (counter-balanced) followed by a cue-induced craving assessment and [<sup>18</sup>F]-fallypride positron emission tomography scanning.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>In the alcohol-dependent individuals, the citalopram (compared with saline) resulted in decreased cue-induced craving for alcohol. For the whole study group, cue-induced alcohol craving was inversely correlated with thalamic (but not striatal) dopamine D<sub>2/3</sub> receptor availability.</p>

                  <p>Acute serotonin reuptake inhibition reduces cue-induced alcohol craving. Furthermore, thalamic dopamine abnormalities and the striatal hyperdopaminergic hypothesis of alcohol use disorder are supported.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Misuse of alcohol is a major global public health issue. Alcohol misuse remains extremely common in the United States, where it is estimated that roughly 6.4% of the population age 12 years or older meets criteria for alcohol use disorder (<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">NSDUH, 2015</xref>), and alcohol misuse results in roughly 88 000 deaths per year (including alcohol-related motor vehicle accidents) (<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">Stahre et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
              <p>Alcohol use disorders are frequently comorbid with depressive symptoms in psychiatric clinical populations, and the combination results in an increased severity of both conditions, including an increased risk for suicidality (reviewed in <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Nunes and Levin, 2004</xref>). Human and animal data have provided ample justification to test antidepressants in clinical trials for alcohol use disorders with (and without) comorbid depressive symptoms; however, results from these studies have been disappointing, especially with regard to continued alcohol use (<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Nunes and Levin, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Kenna, 2010</xref>).</p>
              <p>Citalopram, a highly selective selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), has been used clinically since 1989, is available in generic formulations, and is FDA-approved for the treatment of major depressive disorder (<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Bezchlibnyk-Butler et al., 2000</xref>). The i.v. administration of serotonergic agents has been studied as a means to speed the time needed to remit depressive symptoms in patients with major depressive disorder (reviewed in <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Moukaddam and Hirschfeld, 2004</xref>).</p>
              <p>In alcohol-dependent (AD) participants, visual and olfactory cues reliably increase craving in a manner that is sensitive to pharmacological and environmental manipulation (<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Ray et al., 2007</xref>). Cue-induced craving accompanies increased blood flow, specifically in the nucleus accumbens/ventral striatum in AD individuals, as an indirect measure of increased dopamine signaling, and this cue-induced craving is associated with lower baseline levels of dopamine D<sub>2/3</sub> receptor availability (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Heinz et al., 2004</xref>, 2005). Additionally, AD individuals, on average, have been shown to have lower striatal dopamine receptor D<sub>2/3</sub> receptor availability than control participants, as measured with positron emission tomography (PET) and the dopamine D<sub>2/3</sub> receptor radioligand [<sup>18</sup>F]-desmethoxyfallypride (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Heinz et al., 2004</xref>)</p>
              <p>Chronic oral citalopram (20 mg/d for 14 days) results in decreased striatal dopamine receptor binding potential compared with placebo (using PET scanning and the dopamine D<sub>2/3</sub> receptor ligand [<sup>11</sup>C]-raclopride), an indication of increased intrasynaptic dopamine concentration, but a single dose of oral citalopram has not been shown to affect striatal dopamine binding potential (<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">Tiihonen et al., 1996</xref>). A single i.v. infusion of citalopram (40 mg) decreased dopamine D<sub>2/3</sub> receptor binding potential in the human striatum to a degree comparable with that seen in the earlier study of chronic oral citalopram dosing (<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">Tiihonen et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, we chose to study single-dose i.v. citalopram administration to test for SSRI-induced changes in cue-induced craving for alcohol and concomitant dopamine signaling in subcortical regions in AD research participants compared with matched healthy nondrinking control participants.</p>

                <title>Overview of Study Procedures</title>
                <p>All procedures were approved by the Veterans Administration Greater Los Angeles institutional review board. Participants were enrolled and screened on the first visit. Qualifying participants were invited back for 3 subsequent visits: a structural MRI scan and 2 study medication/[<sup>18</sup>F]-fallypride PET scanning days (citalopram 40 mg i.v., or saline placebo, double-blinded, administered in counter-balancing order) more than 1 week apart. All completing participants had breathalyzer-confirmed exhaled alcohol concentration of 0 and alcohol withdrawal scores (confirming no intoxication and minimal alcohol withdrawal symptoms) on all study visits (Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol [CIWA] &lt; 10). On study medication/PET scanning days, the following procedures were completed in order: (1) breathalyzer, withdrawal, and psychiatric symptomatology screening; (2) i.v. citalopram (or saline placebo) infusion (1 hour); (3) cue-induced craving assessment (approximately 20 minutes); and (4) [<sup>18</sup>F]-fallypride PET scanning (approximately 3 hours). Smoking was allowed during study days but proscribed for 2 hours prior to PET scanning.</p>

                <title>Research Participants</title>
                <p>AD and healthy control (HC) participants were screened via the SCID-IV, excluding any participants with any Axis I psychiatric diagnosis within the last 6 months (aside from nicotine dependence in both groups and alcohol dependence in the AD group). Fourteen potential AD and 17 potential HC participants were enrolled and screened. Ten participants in each group completed the study. Alcohol dependence in potential participants was confirmed using the SCID-IV diagnostic criteria. AD participants were active drinkers with no history of complicated alcohol withdrawal symptoms who agreed to stop drinking by 6:00 pm on the day prior to all study procedure days; significant alcohol withdrawal symptoms on study procedure days (CIWA &gt; 10) was exclusionary. Inclusion criteria included age 21 to 55 years and no recent use (last 30 days) of any psychoactive medications.

Although fallypride has a greater affinity for dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptors than D<sub>3</sub> receptors, a prior finding that the thalamus contains a higher level of D<sub>3</sub> receptors than D<sub>2</sub> receptors indicates that some of the thalamic differences we have observed may actually represent reduced thalamic D<sub>3</sub> receptors in alcoholics compared with matched controls (<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Sun et al., 2012</xref>).

Interestingly, these results parallel those of a prior study showing that methylphenidate-induced craving for cocaine in cocaine-dependent subjects was also correlated with reduced thalamic dopamine receptor availability, indicating that aberrant thalamic dopamine signaling may represent a more widespread feature of substance use disorders (<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">Volkow et al., 1997</xref>).</p>

                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p>A limitation of the study is the modest sample size, which was (at least partly) due to the detailed study methods (including 2 full day sessions, including PET scanning, per participant). Another limitation was that, due to the extensive collinearity between smoking and alcohol dependence in the sample, we were unable to effectively disentangle any specific effect of smoking status on any of the measures reported. Additionally, we did not keep track of smoking behavior on study days of our smoking participants (aside from proscribing smoking for 2 hours prior to PET scanning), which may have influenced dopamine binding potential measurements. We did not keep track of the last drink consumed by participants prior to study procedures, though all participants were breathalyzer-negative during all procedures. Our samples represent approximately equal numbers of males and females and therefore may obscure any gender-specific effect on any of the reported measures. We excluded participants with active psychiatric illness and those taking psychoactive medications; thus, these findings may not generalize to clinical samples of patients with alcohol use disorder where psychiatric comorbidities are common.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>A single dose of i.v. citalopram reduces cue-induced craving for alcohol in AD participants. As noted above, it is unlikely that our observed decrease in cue-induced craving with a single dose of i.v. citalopram is due to any changes in brain dopamine release. Cue-induced craving for alcohol is highly correlated with thalamic dopamine D<sub>2/3</sub> receptor availability in a mixed group of AD and HC research participants. The overall results are broadly consistent with the striatal hyperdopaminergic hypothesis of alcohol dependence, whereby increased dopamine release, rather than reduced postsynaptic dopamine receptor activity, is likely to be the major striatal dopaminergic neurochemical alteration.</p>
