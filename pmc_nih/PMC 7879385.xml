              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Currently, the management of localized or recurrent prostate cancer is largely based on
risk stratification using clinicopathologic variables incorporated into national and
international consensus guidelines. However, numerous studies demonstrated that standard
prognostic clinicopathologic variables, such as Gleason score, T stage, and
prostate-specific antigen (PSA), have modest performance to accurately identify men with
more biologically aggressive disease.<sup><xref rid="coi200112r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> There is a significant need to develop and incorporate into clinical
practice the prognostic biomarkers that can add to or replace these risk stratification
schemes to more accurately determine which tumors are indolent and which are biologically
aggressive.</p>
              <p>Decipher (Decipher Biosciences Inc), a 22-gene genomic classifier (GC) derived from a
commercial, high-throughput, clinical-grade whole transcriptome profiling platform, was
developed to improve the estimation of patient prognosis.<sup><xref rid="coi200112r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> The GC was developed in a radical prostatectomy (RP)
cohort, and the signature was trained to predict the development of distant metastasis (DM).
In validation studies using retrospective institutional cohorts, the GC was consistently
superior in its prognostic and discriminatory ability when compared with clinicopathologic
variables for multiple oncologic end points.<sup><xref rid="coi200112r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="coi200112r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="coi200112r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="coi200112r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="coi200112r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="coi200112r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup></p>
              <p>However, to date and to our knowledge, no clinically available genomic biomarker has been
validated in the context of a phase 3 randomized trial in prostate cancer. Therefore, this
secondary analysis sought to clinically validate the GC in the NRG/RTOG 9601 randomized
trial of men with recurrent prostate cancer after RP.<sup><xref rid="coi200112r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> It was hypothesized that the GC would independently
predict the development of DM and could be used to help personalize the use of hormone
therapy with salvage radiation therapy (sRT). Furthermore, it was hypothesized that the GC
would also independently stratify the risk of prostate cancer–specific mortality
(PCSM) and overall survival (OS).</p>

                <p>The NRG/RTOG 9601 study was a double-blind trial conducted from March 1998 to March 2003
of men receiving sRT with either a placebo or 150 mg bicalutamide daily for 2 years (trial
protocol available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-COI200112-1-s">Supplement 1</xref>).<sup><xref rid="coi200112r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> The
trial was sponsored by the National Cancer Institute with original ethical approval and
conducted through NRG Oncology/RTOG. Eligible patients were required to have recurrent
disease after RP with a PSA of 0.2 to 4.0 ng/mL, pathologic T3 disease (tumor spread
beyond the prostate) or T2 disease (tumor contained within the prostate) with a positive
surgical margin and no evidence of nodal or metastatic disease. Salvage radiation therapy
was delivered to the prostate bed at a dose of 64.8 Gy in 1.8 Gy per fraction using 2- or
3-dimensional radiotherapy techniques. All enrolled patients gave written informed consent
obtained as documented in the original trial publication.<sup><xref rid="coi200112r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Approval for this ancillary study (NRG-GU-TS002
CSC0075) was granted from the National Clinical Trials Network Core Correlative Sciences
Committee (NCTN-CCSC). This study followed the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials

                <title>RNA Processing and Analysis</title>
                <p>After NCTN-CCSC approval, an NRG biobank pathologist (J.P.S.) performed a pathology
review of all available RP samples, the highest-grade tumor focus was identified, and
specimens from corresponding blocks or unstained slides were deidentified and sent to
Decipher Biosciences Inc for RNA extraction. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue
samples were taken from freshly cut tissue slides or punch biopsy samples from submitted
RP blocks or were from archived unstained tissue slides submitted at the time of
enrollment. Decipher Biosciences Inc was blinded to all patient, tumor, and outcomes data
from the trial at this stage. Tumor RNA was extracted after macrodissection guided by a
histologic review of a matched hematoxylin and eosin slide of the tumor lesion. For all
cases analyzed, at least 0.5 mm<sup>2</sup> of tumor with at least 60% tumor cellularity
was required for the assay. For all samples, specimen selection, RNA extraction, and
microarray hybridization were done in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement
Amendments–certified laboratory facility (Decipher Biosciences Inc). Quality control
was performed using Affymetrix Power Tools (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and normalization
was performed using the Single Channel Array Normalization algorithm.<sup><xref rid="coi200112r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Per the Clinical Laboratory
Improvement Amendments and standard operating procedures, each sample was required to meet
prespecified criteria from tumor sampling, RNA extraction, cDNA amplification, and a
series of microarray quality control (QC) metrics. Of the 760 patients enrolled in
NRG/RTOG 9601 between March 1998 and March 2003, 522 patients (69%) had RP tissue with
sufficient tumor to attempt genomic profiling (eFigure 1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-COI200112-1-s">Supplement 2</xref>). A total
of 486 of 760 samples (64%) had RNA of sufficient quality for microarray profiling and
generation of a GC score. A subsequent 352 of 522 samples (67%) passed microarray QC and
comprised the final cohort for analysis, with equal distribution between treatment arms
(176 patients in each arm). The tissue blocks obtained from this trial were aged a median
of 21 years (range, 17-29 years). Quality control pass rates were 87% from tissue blocks
but only 32% from archived tissue slides submitted at the time of patient enrollment. Only
samples that passed all of these criteria were included in the final analysis, but
sensitivity analyses were also performed on the larger cohort of 486 samples with GC
scores.</p>

                <p>For samples passing QC, GC scores were calculated on a continuous scale from 0 (lowest)
to 1 (highest). Each score is associated with the probability of 5-year metastasis.
Previously locked commercial GC cut points of 0.45 and 0.60 used for clinical testing were
applied to define the 3 GC risk groups (low, intermediate, and high).<sup><xref rid="coi200112r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Additionally, the
NCTN-CCSC–approved application prespecified a lower GC cut point of 0.40, the cut
point originally used in analysis of older, archived samples.<sup><xref rid="coi200112r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Once the GC scores were generated, the gene
expression data were linked to the clinical and outcomes data kept by NRG for

                <title>End Points</title>
                <p>The primary end point of this ancillary project was the independent association of the GC
with the development of DM. This outcome was assessed with multivariable analyses (MVAs)
after adjusting for patient, treatment, and tumor characteristics. Secondary end points to
be analyzed in a similar fashion included PCSM and OS. All end points were defined per the
NCTN-CCSC trial protocol. Exploratory end points included the ability of the GC to
prognosticate time to second biochemical recurrence, metastasis-free survival (metastasis
or death as events), and progression-free survival (biochemical recurrence, local failure,
metastasis, or death as events).</p>

              <sec id="H2-5-COI200112">
                <title>Statistical Analysis</title>
                <p>The statistical analysis plan was prespecified, reviewed, and approved by the NCTN-CCSC.
This plan included sample size justifications for both prognostic and predictive
evaluations (ie, interaction test between the biomarker and hormone therapy) of GC that
assumed a 30% sample loss rate and 12-year DM rate of 23% (eMethods in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-COI200112-1-s">Supplement 2</xref>). These
assumptions provided 90% power to detect an HR of 1.13 (for a 10% change in GC) using a
2-sided α of .05. With the additional assumptions of equal sample loss in both arms,
a 12-year DM rate of 14.5% for the treatment vs 23% for the placebo arm, and that 50% of
samples would have a higher GC (score &gt;0.4), a GC by treatment interaction HR of 0.49
would result in only 35% power. Therefore, a priori, the study was sufficiently powered
for the prognostic evaluation but underpowered for the predictive evaluation of GC
response to treatment.</p>
                <p>Test statistics for between-group comparisons were provided using the Fisher exact test
or the χ<sup>2</sup> test for categorical variables and Wilcoxon rank sum test or
Kruskal-Wallis test for continuous variables across 2 or more groups, respectively.</p>
                <p>Distant metastasis and PCSM rates were estimated in GC risk groups using cumulative
incidence functions (treating death without an event and death from other causes as
competing risks) and compared using the Gray test. Overall survival was estimated by the
Kaplan-Meier method, and the log-rank test was used for comparison. To assess the
prognostic performance of GC, univariable analyses and MVAs of Cox proportional hazards
models (nonevents treated as censored) with the Firth method to account for small event
size (unless stated otherwise) were conducted in the full cohort and in
subcohorts.<sup><xref rid="coi200112r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Subgroup
analyses were performed in the sRT-only cohort (defined a priori) and the early salvage
(ie, patients enrolled with PSA&lt;0.7 ng/mL) cohort. Adjusted variables defined a priori
and used in the full-cohort MVAs were age, race/ethnicity, Gleason score, T stage, entry
PSA, margin status, PSA nadir status, and treatment arm. Only variables that reached the
significance level of <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05 in univariable analyses were
included in the subsequent MVAs to reduce the number of fitted variables; the same rule
applied to subgroup analyses.</p>
                <p>The interaction effect of treatment arm and GC was assessed for DM, PCSM, and OS without
adjusting for any covariables. Similarly, interaction models of the treatment arm with GC
risk groups (intermediate and high were combined owing to sample size constraints) were
built to estimate event rates at 12 years, which then were used to calculate the
difference in rates between treatment and placebo for each GC risk group (bootstrapped 95%
CIs were obtained from 200 resampled data sets). Sensitivity analyses were carried out to
ensure the robustness of our findings, including adjusting models with continuous
variables, such as age, PSA, and GC score, as categorical; comparing results across Cox
proportional hazards models, Cox proportional hazards models with the Firth method, and
Fine-Gray models accounting for competing risks; and adjusting for the time from surgery
to enrollment.</p>
                <p>Statistical analyses were performed from September 2019 to December 2019 using R, version
3.5.1 (R Foundation). All statistical tests were 2-sided, and <italic>P</italic> values
less than .05 were deemed statistically significant.</p>

                <p>There was not a statistically significant interaction between GC score and hormone
treatment effect for DM (HR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.82-1.30;

this lack of significance, the estimated absolute benefits in DM, PCSM, and OS observed
with hormone therapy were different by GC risk groups; the 12-year benefit from the
addition of hormone therapy was approximately 3-fold greater in intermediate and high GC
scores than in low GC scores (all patients, low vs intermediate and high: DM, 5.0% vs

                <p>The GC score was prognostic in the subset of patients treated with earlier sRT when PSA
was less than the median entry value (0.7 ng/mL) (eTable 5 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-COI200112-1-s">Supplement 2</xref>). The DM
benefits from additional hormone therapy were estimated to be 0.4% vs 11.2% in low and
higher GC risk groups, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="coi200112f2">Figure

                <p>The GC was then analyzed both continuously and categorically, adjusting for age,
race/ethnicity, Gleason score, T stage, margin status, entry PSA, and treatment arm. In

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>To date and to our knowledge, no multigene expression biomarker has been rigorously
validated as a prognostic or predictive test in patients with prostate cancer who are
receiving radical therapy.<sup><xref rid="coi200112r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> This
circumstance has resulted in lack of complete support from consensus guideline panels for
standard of care use of genomic biomarkers, given the potential for bias from institutional
retrospective cohorts. The present study is, to our knowledge, the first prospectively
designed validation study of a GC conducted from a large NCTN double-blinded randomized
clinical trial in men receiving sRT with either placebo or bicalutamide daily for 2 years.
In this study, the GC was prognostic for DM, PCSM, and OS when evaluated as a continuous
score and as a 3-tier GC risk group system. The difference between GC low risk and higher
risk groups for the prespecified primary end point of DM was large and statistically
significant. Specifically, patients with intermediate and high GC scores had an 88%
increased risk of DM vs those with low GC scores. The GC identified substantial
heterogeneity within a given clinicopathologic subgroup, and many patients with adverse
pathologic features harbored lower genomic risk. In MVAs, GC was independently
prognostic.</p>
              <p>In our current study, the GC was strongly and independently prognostic, though it did not
have a statistically significant interaction with hormonal therapy. The final GC cohort was
limited to 352 patients, and our prespecified statistical plan did not have adequate power
to identify a statistical interaction between the GC and hormone therapy for any end point
in the study. Although predictive biomarkers can help personalize therapeutic
intervention,<sup><xref rid="coi200112r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="coi200112r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> prognostic biomarkers can also identify patients at
low risk of recurrence and those who are unlikely to experience meaningful clinical benefit
from treatment intensification. This situation is illustrated by patients with lower GC
scores having a 2.4% absolute improvement in 12-year OS compared with 8.9% in patients with
higher GC scores. This approximate 4-fold difference may help guide shared decision-making.
For some patients, the risk of toxic effects, cost, and possible effects on quality of life
from long-term hormone therapy may erode further OS benefit. Patients with shorter
comorbidity-adjusted life expectancy may also have lesser benefit. However, the estimated
8.9% absolute improvement in OS in patients with a higher GC score may affect the
risk-benefit ratio to favor the addition of hormone therapy to sRT.</p>
              <p>The importance of accurate prognostication perhaps is even greater in patients receiving
earlier sRT at a PSA below 0.7 ng/mL. Indeed, a recent secondary analysis of RTOG 9601
demonstrated that pre-sRT PSA level in itself may be a prognostic biomarker for outcomes of
antiandrogen treatment with sRT.<sup><xref rid="coi200112r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="coi200112r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> This study demonstrates that within
patients receiving earlier sRT, patients with higher GC scores derived an 11.2% improvement
in 12-year DM and a 4.6% improvement in OS from the addition of hormone therapy. The CIs for
these estimates cross 0% and are wide given the reduced sample size, but they illustrate the
potential utility of personalizing shared decision-making beyond using PSA to drive hormone
therapy utilization.</p>
              <p>One challenge in the conduct of this study was the median age of the RP tissue being older
than 20 years, which was reflected in the approximately 70% QC pass rate. Notably, the
majority of the failures were from tissue cases submitted as unstained slides, suggesting
that archived tissue blocks should be the preferred sample type for cooperative group
biorepository initiatives. Importantly, the patient characteristics of the samples that did
and did not pass QC were similar, reassuring that there was no selection bias introduced.
However, it is possible that the age of the samples could shift the GC categorical cut
points, and it is recommended that the GC be primarily interpreted on a continuous scale
from 0 to 1. This maximizes statistical power and better assesses the relative risk increase
across the GC scale.</p>
              <sec id="H2-8-COI200112">
                <title>Strengths and Limitations</title>
                <p>Strengths of this correlative analysis include the prospective, randomized, and
double-blinded design of the NRG/RTOG 9601 trial, the long clinical follow-up, a
well-balanced and profiled cohort, the stringent Clinical Laboratory Improvement
Amendments–certified laboratory facility procedures to profile the whole human
transcriptome from clinical samples, and the NCTN-CCSC prespecified statistical plan to
validate the GC. Limitations to this study include the fact that only a subset of clinical
samples from the NRG/RTOG 9601 trial was available for profiling with the GC (31.3% of
patient tissue was not available from the trial) and that one-third (or 22.4% of total
trial) of the remaining clinical samples did not pass QC. As mentioned previously, this
more limited sample size may explain the lack of a statistically significant interaction
term observed between treatment and the GC. Ongoing randomized trials in the sRT setting
have also prospectively incorporated GC testing (Decipher), seeking to validate these
findings.<sup><xref rid="coi200112r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="coi200112r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup></p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>In summary, the findings from this ancillary analysis of a randomized clinical trial
represent the first validation in prostate cancer of a high-throughput, clinical-grade,
whole transcriptome–based GC from a prospective randomized trial, and the findings add
to the evidence base supporting the use of the GC to guide shared decision-making after RP.
The results of this and other studies strongly suggest that not all men with biochemically
recurrent prostate cancer after surgery derive equal absolute benefits from the addition of
hormone therapy to sRT.</p>
