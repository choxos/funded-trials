                <p id="P4">HIV-1-infected individuals require lifelong antiretroviral therapy (ART) because treatment interruption leads to rapid rebound viremia. Here we report on a phase 1b clinical trial in which a combination of 3BNC117 and 10–1074, two potent monoclonal anti-HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies that target independent sites on the HIV-1 envelope spike, was administered during analytical treatment interruption. Participants received three infusions of 30 mg/kg of each antibody at 0, 3 and 6 weeks. Infusions of the two antibodies were generally well tolerated. The nine enrolled individuals with antibody-sensitive latent viral reservoirs maintained suppression for 15 to &gt; 30 weeks (median = 21 weeks), and none developed viruses resistant to both antibodies. We conclude that the combination of anti-HIV-1 monoclonal antibodies 3BNC117 and 10–1074 can maintain long-term suppression in the absence of ART in individuals with antibody-sensitive viral reservoirs.</p>

              <p id="P5">During infection, HIV-1 is reverse transcribed and integrated as a provirus into the host genome. Although the vast majority of infected cells die by apoptosis or pyroptosis<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>, a small percentage survive and harbor transcriptionally silent integrated proviruses that comprise a reservoir that can be reactivated. Once established, the latent reservoir has an estimated half-life of 44 months resulting in the lifelong requirement for antiretroviral therapy<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. Passive administration of potent broadly neutralizing monoclonal anti-HIV-1 antibodies (bNAbs) represents a potential alternative to antiretroviral drugs because, in addition to neutralizing the virus, antibodies engage the host immune system and have long half-lives<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>–<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="P6">In human clinical trials, viremic individuals receiving either 3BNC117 or VRC01, two related bNAbs that target the CD4 binding site on the HIV-1 envelope spike, or 10–1074, a bNAb that targets the base of the V3 loop and surrounding glycans, showed significant responses<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. Moreover, in HIV-1-infected individuals undergoing analytical treatment interruption (ATI) of antiretroviral therapy, four infusions of 3BNC117 maintained suppression for a median of 10 weeks as compared to 2.3 weeks in historical controls<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. In contrast, six infusions of VRC01 maintained suppression for 5.6 weeks<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. The difference in activity between VRC01 and 3BNC117 in pre-clinical experiments<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>, and clinical trials<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> is consistent with the lower relative neutralization potency of VRC01.</p>
              <p id="P7">Across all bNAb clinical trials to date, and similar to monotherapy with antiretroviral drugs, treatment with any single bNAb was associated with the emergence of antibody-resistant viral variants<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. Like antiretroviral drugs, combinations of bNAbs are more effective than individual antibodies in humanized mouse and macaque models of infection<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>–<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. In contrast, antibody combinations showed little if any efficacy in suppressing viremia during ATI in humans<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. However, these earlier studies were performed using bNAbs which were less potent than 3BNC117 and 10–1074. Here we re-examine the question of whether bNAb combinations can maintain viral suppression during ATI in HIV-1-infected humans.</p>

                <p id="P8">To evaluate the effects of the combination of 3BNC117 and 10–1074 on maintaining HIV-1 suppression during ATI, we conducted a phase 1b clinical trial (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). HIV-1-infected individuals on ART were pre-screened for 3BNC117 and 10–1074 sensitivity of bulk outgrowth culture-derived viruses using the TZM-bl neutralization assay<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. Consistent with previous results, 64% and 71% of the outgrowth viruses were sensitive to 3BNC117 and 10–1074, respectively, and 48% were sensitive to both (IC<sub>50</sub> ≤ 2μg/ml, <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1a</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>.</p>
                <p id="P9">Study eligibility criteria included ongoing ART for at least 24 months with plasma HIV-1 RNA levels of &lt; 50 copies/ml for at least 18 months (with one blip &lt; 500 copies/ml allowed) and &lt; 20 copies/ml at screening, as well as CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell counts &gt; 500 cells/µl (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1b</xref> and <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). Enrolled participants received 3 infusions of 30 mg/kg each of 3BNC117 + 10–1074 at 3-week intervals beginning 2 days before treatment interruption (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). Individuals whose regimens contained non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors were switched to an integrase inhibitor-based regimen 4 weeks before discontinuing ART (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1b</xref> and <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). Viral load and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell counts were monitored every 1–2 weeks (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). ART was reinitiated and antibody infusions were discontinued if viremia of &gt; 200 copies/ml was confirmed. Time of viral rebound was defined as the first of two consecutive viral loads &gt; 200 copies/ml. Fifteen individuals were enrolled, but four of them showed viral loads of &gt; 20 copies/ml two weeks before or at the time of the first bNAb infusion and they were excluded from efficacy analyses (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1b</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 2</xref>).</p>
                <p id="P10">Antibody infusions were generally safe and well tolerated with no reported serious adverse events or antibody-related adverse events except for mild fatigue in two participants (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). The mean CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell count was 685 and 559 cells/µl at the time of first antibody infusion and at rebound, respectively (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2b</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). Re-initiation of ART after viral rebound resulted in resuppression of viremia (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). We conclude that combination therapy with 3BNC117 + 10–1074 is generally safe and well tolerated.</p>
                <p id="P11">The serum half-life of each antibody was measured independently by TZM-bl assay and anti-idiotype ELISA (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2c, d</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). 3BNC117 had a half-life of 12.5 and 17.6 days by TZM-bl and ELISA, respectively (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2c, d</xref>). The half-life of 10–1074 was 19.1 and 23.2 days by TZM-bl and ELISA, respectively; longer than 3BNC117 in both assays (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0002 and <italic>P</italic> = 0.02, <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2c, d, e, f</xref>). These measurements are similar to those observed when each antibody was administered alone in ART-treated HIV-1-infected individuals<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. We conclude that the pharmacokinetic profiles of 3BNC117 and 10–1074 are not altered when they are co-administered.</p>

                <title>Combination bNAbs Maintain Viral Suppression</title>
                <p id="P12">For the 11 individuals who had complete viral suppression (HIV-1 RNA &lt; 20 copies/ml) during the screening period and at day 0, combination antibody therapy was associated with maintenance of viral suppression for 5 to &gt; 30 weeks (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b, c</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). The median time to rebound was 21 weeks compared to 2.3 weeks for historical controls who participated in non-interventional ATI studies<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> and 6–10 weeks for monotherapy with 3BNC117<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). Altogether, 9 of the 11 participants maintained viral suppression for over 15 weeks, while 2 rebounded at weeks 5 and 7 (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b, c</xref>).</p>
                <p id="P13">Quantitative and qualitative viral outgrowth assays (Q<sup>2</sup>VOA) were used to retrospectively analyze the replication-competent latent viral reservoir in all individuals. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the trial participants were infected with epidemiologically distinct clade B viruses (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3</xref>). Q<sup>2</sup>VOA analysis revealed that the pre-infusion latent reservoir in the two individuals rebounding early, 9245 and 9251, harbored 10–1074- or 3BNC117-resistant viruses, respectively (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). Therefore, these two individuals were effectively subjected to antibody monotherapy because there was pre-existing resistance in the reservoir to one of the two bNAbs. Consistent with this idea, the delay in rebound in these two participants was within the range anticipated for antibody monotherapy<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). In addition, all four of the individuals excluded from the analysis due to incomplete viral suppression showed pre-existing resistance or viruses that were not fully neutralized by one or both of the antibodies and these individuals rebounded before week 12 (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4</xref>, <xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">5</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 4</xref>).</p>
                <p id="P14">To examine the viruses arising in the early rebounding individuals, we performed single genome analysis (SGA) on rebound plasma. In addition to the pre-existing sequences associated with resistance in the 10–1074 target site (N332T + S334N, <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>), rebound viruses in 9245 also carried an extended V5 loop and potential <italic>N</italic>-linked glycosylation sites that could interfere with 3BNC117 binding (<xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 6</xref>). Conversely, genetic features associated with resistance to 3BNC117 were found in the pre-infusion reservoir of 9251 and were accompanied by mutations in the 10–1074 target site in the rebounding viruses (S334N, <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref> and <xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 6</xref>). For both individuals, resistance of rebound viruses to both antibodies was confirmed by the TZM-bl neutralization assay (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b, c</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). Thus, bulk outgrowth cultures used for screening failed to detect pre-existing resistance in the reservoir of 2 of the 11 individuals studied. This result is not surprising given that bulk cultures are dominated by a limited number of rapidly growing viral species which may not be representative of the diversity in the latent reservoir.</p>
                <p id="P15">The median time to rebound in the 7 individuals that had no detectable resistant viruses in the pre-infusion latent reservoir, and rebounded during the study period, was also 21 weeks and different from 6–10 weeks for monotherapy with 3BNC117<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). In these participants, viral suppression was maintained for 15 to 26 weeks after ART discontinuation (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). The 2 remaining participants (9254 and 9255) completed study follow-up at 30 weeks without experiencing rebound (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). Notably, viral rebound never occurred when the concentration of both administered antibodies was above 10 μg/ml. The average 3BNC117 serum concentration (determined by TZM-bl assay) at the time of rebound in sensitive individuals that rebounded during study follow-up was 1.9 μg/ml (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). In contrast, the average serum concentration of 10–1074 at rebound was 14.8 μg/ml (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). The difference in the antibody concentrations at the time of rebound is consistent with the longer half-life of 10–1074 which resulted in a period of 10–1074 monotherapy (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>, <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2c, d, e, f</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). Finally, these 9 individuals showed little or no pre-existing neutralizing antibodies against a diagnostic panel of viruses before bNAb infusion (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 5</xref>).</p>

                <p id="P16">To examine the relationship between rebound viruses and the circulating latent reservoir, we compared <italic>env</italic> sequences obtained from plasma rebound viruses by SGA with sequences obtained by Q<sup>2</sup>VOA from both pre-infusion and week 12 samples. In addition, we measured sensitivity of rebound outgrowth viruses and/or pseudoviruses to 3BNC117 and 10–1074 by the TZM-bl neutralization assay (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b, c</xref>, <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, <xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 7</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 4</xref>).

              <p id="P20">First generation anti-HIV-1 bNAbs were generally ineffective in suppressing viremia in animal models and humans leading to the conclusion that this approach should not be pursued<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. The advent of new methods for anti-HIV-1 antibody cloning<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> and subsequent discovery of a new more potent generation of bNAbs revitalized this area of research<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="P21">bNAb monotherapy with 3BNC117 or VRC01 is not enough to maintain control during ATI in HIV-1-infected humans<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. Similar results were obtained in participant 9251 who effectively received 10–1074 monotherapy due to pre-existing resistance to 3BNC117. In contrast, the combination of 3BNC117 and 10–1074 is sufficient to maintain viral suppression in sensitive individuals when the concentration of both antibodies remains above of 10 μg/ml in serum. Rebound occurred when 3BNC117 levels dropped below 10 μg/ml effectively leading to 10–1074 monotherapy, from which nearly all individuals rapidly escaped by mutations in the 10–1074 contact site. The observation that 9 individuals infected with distinct viruses were unable to develop double resistant viruses over a median 21 week period suggests that viral replication was severely limited by this antibody combination.</p>
              <p id="P22">In human studies, monotherapy with 3BNC117 is associated with enhanced humoral immunity and accelerated clearance of HIV-1-infected cells<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>. In addition, when administered early to SHIV<sub>AD8</sub>-infected macaques, combined 3BNC117 + 10–1074 immunotherapy induced host CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses that contributed to the control of viremia in nearly 50% of the animals<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. However, virus-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells responsible for control of viremia in these macaques were not detected in the circulation, and their contribution to viral suppression was only documented after CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell depletion<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. In most controller macaques, complete viral suppression was only established after rebound viremia that followed antibody clearance.</p>
              <p id="P23">Two individuals in this study remained suppressed for over 30 weeks after ATI, 9254 and 9255. Neither one had detectable levels of ART in the blood or carried the B*27 and B*57 HLA alleles that are most frequently associated with elite control<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>. The first, 9254, reports starting ART within 4–5 months after probable exposure to the virus with an initial viral load of 860,000 copies/ml. Despite relatively early therapy, and excellent virological control for 21 years on therapy, this individual had an IUPM of 0.68 by Q<sup>2</sup>VOA at the 12-week time point (<xref rid="F14" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 10b</xref>). The second individual, 9255, showed several viral blips that were spontaneously controlled beginning 15 weeks after ATI when antibody levels were waning. This individual was infected for at least 7 months before starting ART with an initial viral load of 85,800 copies/ml and had an IUPM of 1.4 at the 12-week time point. A small fraction of individuals on ART<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> show spontaneous prolonged virologic control after ART is discontinued, and this number appears to increase when ART treatment is initiated during the acute phase of infection<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>–<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>. Whether antibody-enhanced CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses contribute to the prolonged control in the 2 of 9 individuals receiving combination immunotherapy, and whether this effect can be enhanced by latency reactivating agents, or immune checkpoint inhibitors remains to be determined.</p>
              <p id="P24">A significant fraction of the circulating latent reservoir is composed of expanded clones of infected T cells<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>–<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup>. These T cell clones appear to be dynamic in that the specific contribution of individual clones of circulating latently infected CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to the reservoir of individuals receiving ART fluctuates over time<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. Individuals that maintain viral suppression by antibody therapy appear to show similar fluctuations in reservoir clones that do not appear to be associated with antibody sensitivity. Whether the apparent differences observed in the reservoir during immunotherapy lead to changes in the reservoir half-life cannot be determined from the available data and will require reservoir assessments in additional individuals at multiple time points over an extended observation period.</p>
              <p id="P25">Individuals harboring viruses sensitive to 3BNC117 and 10–1074 maintained viral suppression during ATI for a median of almost 4 months after the final antibody administration. However, HIV-1 is a highly diverse virus with varying levels of sensitivity to specific bNAbs. As a result, maintenance therapy with just the combination of 3BNC117 and 10–1074 would only be possible for the approximately 50% of clade B-infected individuals that are sensitive to both antibodies. This problem may be overcome by addition of or substitution with other antibodies<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup>, or long-acting small molecule antiretroviral drugs.</p>
              <p id="P26">In macaques, the therapeutic efficacy of anti-HIV-1 antibodies is directly related to their half-life<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>, which can be extended by mutations that enhance Fc domain interactions with the neonatal Fc receptor<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup>.

Study participants were enrolled sequentially according to eligibility criteria. Participants received 3BNC117 and 10–1074 intravenously at a dose of 30 mg/kg body weight of each antibody, at weeks 0, 3 and 6, unless viral rebound occurred. ART was discontinued 2 days after the first infusion of antibodies (day 2). Plasma HIV-1 viral RNA levels were monitored weekly and ART was resumed if viral load increased to ≥ 200 copies/ml or CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell counts decreased to &lt; 350 cells/µl in two consecutive measurements. Time of viral rebound was determined by the first viral load &gt; 200 copies/ml. Study participants were followed for 30 weeks after the first infusion. Safety data are reported until the end of study follow-up. All participants provided written informed consent before participation in the study and the study was conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice.

The appropriate stock volume of 3BNC117 and 10–1074 was calculated according to body weight and diluted in sterile normal saline to a total volume of 250 ml per antibody. Monoclonal antibody infusions were administered sequentially and intravenously over 60 minutes. Study participants were observed at the Rockefeller University Hospital or the University Hospital Cologne for one hour after the last antibody infusion. Participants returned for weekly follow-up visits during the ATI period for safety assessments, which included physical examination and measurements of clinical laboratory parameters such as hematology, chemistries, urinalysis, and pregnancy tests (for women). Plasma HIV-1 RNA levels were monitored weekly during the ATI period and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell counts were measured every 1 to 2 weeks. After ART was re-initiated, participants returned for follow up every 2 weeks until viral re-suppression was achieved, and every 8 weeks thereafter. Study investigators evaluated and graded adverse events according to the DAIDS AE Grading Table (version 2.0, November 2014) and determined causality. Leukapheresis was performed at the Rockefeller University Hospital or at the University Hospital Cologne at week −2 and week 12. Blood samples were collected before and at multiple times after 3BNC117 and 10–1074 infusions. Samples were processed within 4 h of collection, and serum and plasma samples were stored at −80°C. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated by density gradient centrifugation. The absolute number of PBMCs was determined by an automated cell counter (Vi-Cell XR; Beckman Coulter) or manually, and cells were cryopreserved in fetal bovine serum plus 10% DMSO.</p>

                <p id="P34">3BNC117 and 10–1074 serum concentrations were measured by a validated sandwich ELISA. High bind polystyrene plates were coated with 4 µg/ml of an anti-idiotypic antibody specifically recognizing 3BNC117 (anti-ID 1F1-2E3 mAb) or 2µg/ml of an anti-idiotypic antibody specifically recognizing 10–1074 (anti-ID 3A1–4E11 mAb), and incubated overnight at 2–8 °C. After washing, plates were blocked with 5% Milk Blotto (w/v), 5% NGS (v/v), and 0.05% Tween 20 (v/v) in PBS. Serum samples, QCs and standards were added (1:50 minimum dilution in 5% Milk Blotto (w/v), 5% NGS (v/v), and 0.05% Tween 20 (v/v) in PBS) and incubated at room temperature. 3BNC117 or 10–1074 were detected using a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated mouse anti-human IgG kappa-chain-specific antibody (Abcam) for 3BNC117 or an HRP-conjugated goat antihuman IgG Fc-specific antibody for 10–1074 (Jackson ImmunoResearch) and the HRP substrate tetra-methylbenzidine. 3BNC117 and 10–1074 concentrations were then calculated from a standard curve of 3BNC117 or 10–1074 run on the same plate using a 5-PL curve-fitting algorithm (Softmax Pro, v5.4.5). Standard curves and positive controls were created from the drug product lots of 3BNC117 and 10–1074 used in the clinical study. The capture anti-idiotypic mAbs were produced using a stable hybridoma cell line (Duke Protein Production Facility;<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>). The lower limit of quantitation for the 3BNC117 ELISA is 0.78 µg/ml and for the 10–1074 ELISA is 0.41 µg/ml. The lower limit of detection was determined to be 0.51 µg/ml and 0.14 µg/ml in HIV-1 seropositive serum for the 3BNC117 and 10–1074 ELISA, respectively. For values that were detectable (i.e., positive for mAb) but were below the lower limit of quantitation, values are reported as &lt; 0.78 µg/ml and &lt; 0.41 µg/ml for 3BNC117 and 10–1074 ELISA, respectively. If day 0 baseline samples had measurable levels of antibody by the respective assays, the background measured antibody level was subtracted from subsequent results.

Briefly, serum samples were tested using a primary 1:20 dilution with a 5-fold titration series against HIV-1 Env pseudoviruses Q769.d22 and X2088_c9, which are highly sensitive to neutralization by 3BNC117 and 10–1074, respectively, while fully resistant against the other administered antibody. In the case of the post-infusion time points of 10–1074, instances where serum ID<sub>50</sub> titers against X2088_c9 were &gt; 100,000, serum samples were also tested against a less sensitive strain, Du422 (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). To generate standard curves, 3BNC117 and 10–1074 clinical drug products were included in every assay set-up using a primary concentration of 10 μg/ml with a 5-fold titration series.

                <p id="P60">Maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees of full-length <italic>env</italic> sequences of viruses isolated from Q<sup>2</sup>VOA, rebound plasma SGA, and rebound PBMC outgrowth cultures from 3 out of 7 participants (9242, 9243 and 9252) that rebounded before week 30 (9241, 9244, 9247 and 9246 are depicted in <xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 7</xref>). Open and closed black rectangles indicate Q<sup>2</sup>VOA-derived viruses from week −2 and week 12, respectively. Viruses obtained at the time of rebound are indicated by red rectangles (plasma SGA) and red stars (rebound PBMC outgrowth cultures). Asterisks indicate nodes with significant bootstrap values (bootstrap support ≥ 70%). Clones are denoted by colored lines mirroring the colors of slices in <xref rid="F14" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 10a</xref>. Boxes indicate IC<sub>80</sub>s (µg/ml) of 3BNC117 and 10–1074 against representative viruses throughout the phylogenetic tree and clones, when possible (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). Asterisks in boxes indicate IC<sub>100</sub> values of &gt; 50 μg/ml.</p>
