                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Tobacco use remains the leading cause of death and disability in the USA and is disproportionately concentrated among low socioeconomic status (SES) populations. Community Health Centers (CHCs) are a key venue for reaching low SES populations with evidence-based tobacco cessation treatment such as Quitlines. Electronic health record (EHR)-based interventions at the point-of-care, text messaging (TM), and phone counseling have the potential to increase Quitline reach and are feasible to implement within CHCs. However, there is a lack of data to inform how, when, and in what combination these strategies should be implemented. The aims of this cluster-randomized trial are to evaluate multi-level implementation strategies to increase the Reach (i.e., proportion of tobacco-using patients who enroll in the Quitline) and Impact (i.e., Reach × Efficacy [efficacy is defined as the proportion of tobacco-using patients who enroll in Quitline treatment that successfully quit]) and to evaluate characteristics of healthcare system, providers, and patients that may influence tobacco-use outcomes.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">This study is a multilevel, three-phase, Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART), conducted in CHCs (<italic>N</italic> = 33 clinics; <italic>N</italic> = 6000 patients). In the first phase, clinics will be randomized to two different EHR conditions. The second and third phases are patient-level randomizations based on prior treatment response. Patients who enroll in the Quitline receive no further interventions. In phase two, patients who are non-responders (i.e., patients who do not enroll in Quitline) will be randomized to receive either TM or continued-EHR. In phase three, patients in the TM condition who are non-responders will be randomized to receive either continued-TM or TM + phone coaching.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par33">Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable death and disability in the United States (US) and 30% of all cancers are directly attributable to tobacco use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Over the last several decades, tobacco use has become increasingly concentrated among individuals living in poverty, with low education, and the uninsured and unemployed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Consequently, the implementation and dissemination of “evidence-based tobacco control strategies” was identified as a priority recommendation for reducing health disparities by the National Institutes of Health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par34">Despite conclusive evidence that evidence-based tobacco cessation treatment is both effective and cost-effective, it is grossly underutilized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Although 70% of current tobacco users want to quit and over 50% attempt to quit each year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], over 90% of those quit attempts fail, in large part because the majority (80%) fail to utilize any form of evidence-based treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Low SES tobacco users have less awareness and access to evidence-based cessation treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], are less likely to participate in treatment, and have even less success in quitting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p>
              <sec id="Sec3">
                <title>Evidence-based tobacco cessation: Quitlines</title>
                <p id="Par35">One of the most significant advances in tobacco control over the last several decades has been the creation of tobacco cessation Quitlines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Quitlines provide both pharmacotherapy and behavioral interventions via phone counseling, online platforms, and text messaging. The efficacy of Quitlines and their potential to reach an extraordinarily large number of tobacco users are extensively documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Quitlines serve all 50 states as well as Puerto Rico, Guam, and the District of Columbia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Nevertheless, Quitlines are grossly underutilized, reaching only about 1–2% of all smokers annually [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and even modest increases in their reach could impact tobacco use prevalence at the population level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p>

                <title>Tobacco cessation and primary care</title>
                <p id="Par36">Primary care provides an ideal setting to address tobacco cessation because there is an established relationship and coordination of care, tobacco use can be routinely assessed, and 80% of all tobacco users see a physician at least annually [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Federally Qualified Health Centers and Community Health Centers (referred to collectively as CHCs) are extraordinary venues for reaching low SES populations with evidence-based treatment for tobacco cessation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In 2018, CHCs provided primary care to over 28 million patients, ~ 40% were minorities and ~ 70% had incomes below the federal poverty level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and others include aggressive, targeted, proactive strategies to increase the utilization of Quitlines including formal partnerships with primary care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par37">Electronic health record (EHR)-based strategies at the point of care can dramatically increase the reach of Quitline treatment, are feasible, and can fit within existing clinical systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Ask–Advise–Connect (AAC; also called “eReferral”) utilizes widely available, standards-based EHR capabilities to systematically assess the tobacco use status of patients, advise them to quit, and directly and electronically connect interested tobacco users with evidence-based Quitline treatment. Prior research has clearly documented the efficacy of AAC (a 13-to-30-fold increase in the proportion of tobacco users who receive evidence-based treatment from a Quitline compared to the previously recommended standard of care) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], yet it has not been widely adopted and implemented in primary care settings. Additionally, there is a potential for increasing the effectiveness of AAC by combining it with other approaches (text messaging, counseling).</p>
                <p id="Par38">Text messaging is effective for improving tobacco cessation outcomes and engagement with treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Text messaging may be a scalable approach for increasing the reach of evidence-based treatment for tobacco use given that mobile phones and text messaging are widely used even in low SES populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], are very low cost, can be automated, and can potentially reach a high proportion of tobacco users [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par39">Proactive counseling is another effective strategy for improving engagement with tobacco cessation treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] because it helps patients overcome barriers to accessing and adhering to tobacco cessation interventions. It is highly feasible in primary care given increasing integration with behavioral health and the widespread use of health educators and patient navigators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p>

                <title>Multilevel implementation strategies to improve Quitline engagement</title>
                <p id="Par40">Multilevel implementation strategies (MLIs) target change in more than one contextual level (e.g., healthcare system, provider, patient) to influence health behavior, health care practice change, and health outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Although multiple national organizations have underscored the need to implement MLIs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], there are few data addressing how and when to implement MLIs for tobacco cessation in primary care or how interventions at multiple levels interact and influence each other.</p>

              <sec id="Sec6">
                <title>Adaptive interventions</title>
                <p id="Par41">Adaptive interventions can be used to operationalize the sequencing and integration of MLIs. An adaptive intervention is an intervention design involving a sequence of intervention decisions that are individualized such that ongoing information from the individual (e.g., patient) or organization (e.g., clinic) is used to guide whether and how to intervene over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Modifying intensity or type of strategy over time can improve outcomes if an individual or organization is not responding or may reduce costs and burden if more resource intensive strategies are not necessary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Adaptive stepped care interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] have the potential to conserve scarce resources (e.g., counseling) for the patients that need them most and minimize unnecessary treatment burden. The Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) is an experimental design developed explicitly for the purpose of optimizing adaptive interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>].</p>

                <title>Aims and objectives</title>
                <p id="Par42">The overall objective of this research, entitled “QuitSMART Utah,” is to increase the Reach and Impact of evidence-based tobacco cessation treatment in order to reduce the prevalence of tobacco use among low SES populations. The scientific premise of the study is based on (1) substantial consensus that evidence-based tobacco cessation treatments delivered via Quitlines are effective but grossly underutilized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], (2) data demonstrating that EHR based strategies at the point of care can dramatically increase the reach of Quitline treatment, are feasible, rely on ubiquitous EHR capabilities, and can fit within existing clinical workflows [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], (3) results demonstrating that technology-based approaches such as text messaging can increase the reach of evidence-based treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], and (4) evidence highlighting the effectiveness of proactive counseling in increasing the reach of and impact of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par43">The aims of QuitSMART Utah are threefold: (1) evaluate healthcare system, provider, and patient level implementation strategies to increase the Reach of evidence-based treatment for tobacco use (delivered via Quitline). Reach is defined as the proportion of smokers who enroll in Quitline delivered treatment. (2) Evaluate healthcare system, provider, and patient-level implementation strategies to increase the Impact of Quitline treatment. Impact is defined as Reach × Efficacy, where efficacy is defined as the proportion of tobacco users who enroll in Quitline delivered treatment that successfully quit. (3) Evaluate characteristics of healthcare system, providers, and patients that may influence tobacco use outcomes.</p>

                <title>Conceptual framework</title>
                <p id="Par45">The conceptual framework illustrates how various frameworks and models inform the development or adaptation of components of the MLIs and describe potential mediators, moderators, and outcomes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). We use Implementation Mapping (IM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] to organize our conceptual framework. IM is a systematic process for planning implementation strategies. It is based on Intervention Mapping, a planning framework that has been used extensively in the development and implementation of multilevel interventions. Our conceptual framework includes RE-AIM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>], Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>], and the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. RE-AIM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] defines our primary outcomes of Reach and Impact (Reach × Efficacy). SCT identifies the determinants of behavior (e.g., motivation, self-efficacy, behavioral capability) and methods for influencing these determinants at multiple levels (e.g., patient, clinic) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. CFIR includes a comprehensive, multi-level taxonomy of factors that influence implementation (e.g., inner and outer settings of the organization, implementation processes). SCT and CFIR are synergistic in that SCT specifies the core determinants and predictive relations driving implementation behaviors, while CFIR guides the consideration of what implementation behaviors are important to target and describes contextual factors that can influence implementation.

                <p id="Par46">In designing the MLIs, we identified SCT determinants (e.g., self-efficacy, motivation, behavioral capabilities) among primary care providers (PCPs), staff, and patients in four of the five CFIR domains (i.e., strategy characteristics, inner setting, outer setting, characteristics of involved individuals) and chose strategies that addressed these factors (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

The project is being conducted in partnership with AUCH, CHCs, the Utah Department of Health (UDOH) Tobacco Prevention and Control Program (TPCP), and the investigator team. The investigator team, UDOH, and AUCH jointly identified tobacco control as a priority among CHCs in Utah, specifically, the need to integrate e-referral between clinics and the Utah Tobacco Quit Line (UTQL). UDOH provides UTQL treatment free of cost to all residents of Utah and has partnered with the investigator team to facilitate data sharing between the UTQL, UDOH, and the investigator team.</p>

                  <p id="Par53">To date, procedures for increasing tobacco cessation treatment uptake in primary care, including AAC, have generally utilized opt-in policies in which the EHR provides the option for clinical staff to initiate advice to tobacco users to quit and to offer an automated, electronic connection to the Quitline.</p>

                  <title>AAC-Opt Out</title>
                  <p id="Par54">AAC-Opt Out is based on work in behavioral economics on “nudges,” which refer to “any aspect of the choice architecture that alters people’s behavior in a predictable way without forbidding any options or significantly changing their economic incentives” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Setting up the default option in a specific way constitutes a nudge and can have extremely potent effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. In the opt-out approach, the EHR requires clinical staff to advise tobacco users to quit and offer a connection to the Quitline prior to moving forward or to opt-out. Opting out is simple and generally requires only a single keystroke, consistent with nudge choice architecture providing an easy way to avoid the intervention.</p>

              <p id="Par74">QuitSMART Utah is a pragmatic, cluster-randomized clinical trial with the objective of increasing the Reach and Impact of evidence-based tobacco cessation treatment among low SES populations. The innovative SMART design will provide key guidance on which strategies are most effective for implementing the linkage between primary care and Quitlines, as well as whether progressively more resource intensive strategies provide unique, incremental effectiveness over and above the implementation of less resource intensive approaches. QuitSMART Utah will provide critical data regarding the impact of pragmatic and scalable strategies at both the clinic and patient level and advance the field of implementation science by testing key constructs hypothesized to influence implementation effectiveness. The ultimate goal is to decrease tobacco use at the population level and reduce the disproportionate burden of tobacco related morbidity and mortality among low SES populations.</p>
              <p id="Par75">There are several operational and practical challenges to conducting QuitSMART Utah including (1) EHR technical capabilities that can impact the ability to both implement the AAC conditions exactly as envisioned and to randomize individual clinic sites to study conditions in the first step of the SMART design, (2) CHC decisions to change EHR vendors during the project, (3) change in the UTQL vendor during the project, and (4) obtaining approval from multiple IRBs, including a Tribal IRB.</p>

                <title>EHR technical capabilities</title>
                <p id="Par76">During the first phase of the SMART design, clinics will be randomized to receive ether the opt-in or opt-out condition for implementing AAC. Adapting AAC for the wide variety of EHR vendors in a consistent way across different EHRs is challenging. For example, the investigative team has implemented AAC-In and AAC-Out in several healthcare systems using an EHR product that provides the technical capability to embed logic such that a “pop-up” alert window can be triggered after a patient is identified as a tobacco user. To get past the pop-up window, the clinical team must either provide advice and an offer of connection to evidence-based cessation treatment or “opt-out.” However, not all of the EHR products used by CHCs provide the capability to embed logic that can trigger these kinds of prompts/reminders. These limitations may impact the ability to implement AAC-In and AAC-Out precisely as conceptualized, and the team is actively attempting to find “work-arounds.”</p>
                <p id="Par77">The study includes 11 CHCs and 33 individual clinics. Although all of the CHCs agreed to allow individual clinic sites to be randomized to AAC study condition, technical constrains with at least one of the EHRs may make this challenging. For those CHCs, the alternative would be to randomize the CHC systems, rather than clinics, to AAC-In or AAC-Out. This would reduce the study power for the phase 1 randomization, and we are actively looking for solutions to this challenge. The clinic assignment will not affect power to detect differences for the comparisons in the second and third phases since we will randomize individuals within clinics. Additionally, we have recruited more CHCs and clinics than were included in our original sample size calculation. As such, power for detecting differences in the AAC-Out vs. AAC-In condition may be relatively unaffected.</p>

Since the new EHR product will be implemented after the scheduled trial kick-off, this CHC will need to join the trial later than other CHCs. Nevertheless, because the CHC is changing to one of the three EHRs that are already part of the study, we will have experience modifying that EHR platform.</p>

Gaining approval from multiple IRBs from distinct entities (i.e., academic, department of health, tribal) can present a number of challenges, as the entities may have conflicting procedural requirements. For example, two of the three IRBs have policies that a study must be approved by other IRBs before their board can approve the study (i.e., the university IRB requires tribal IRB approval prior to reviewing the project; the tribal IRB requires university approval prior to reviewing the project).

Approval from the Tribal IRB is a time-intensive process, designed to build relationships between the researchers and the communities with whom the research is being conducted to ensure the rights of the community are protected.

              <p id="Par82">QuitSMART Utah will be conducted in real-world practice settings that reach underserved populations. There is minimal disruption to clinical workflow to maximize external validity and the potential for broad population-level scale up. Some of the challenges mentioned above will likely be relevant in future real-life dissemination of the implementation strategies developed and tested here. Thus, thorough documentation of these issues and the solutions applied to overcome them is critical. Our team will assess and describe these issues as well as any others to provide guidance for future implementation and dissemination efforts. Eventual broad-scale dissemination of the results and implementation strategies developed in QuitSMART Utah could increase tobacco cessation at the population level and reduce the disproportionate burden of tobacco-related morbidity and mortality among low SES populations.</p>

                <title>Update to study design and statistical analysis</title>
                <p>In the time from submission of this manuscript to acceptance, there has been a change in the study protocol. First, two clinics within a single CHC organization combined to form one clinic. Therefore, our total sample of clinics will change from 33 clinics to 32 clinics. Second, the study team was unable to develop an ‘Opt-Out’ version of AAC in one of the EHR systems due to technical limitations (as described in the discussion). Therefore, the Phase 1 randomization will occur only among the CHC clinics that use the two EHR systems that can be configured to both AAC-In and AAC-Out (<italic>n</italic> = 21 clinics). Clinics that use the third, nonconfigurable EHR will not be randomized in phase 1 (<italic>n</italic> = 11 clinics), and will all receive the EHR intervention of AAC-In. Patients in clinics using the nonconfigurable EHR will be randomized in the patient level randomizations (Phase 2 and Phase 3). Our primary analyses of the AAC-Out vs AAC-In comparison will be restricted to the 21 clinics with EHRs that allow them to be randomized to either condition, and will thus exclude the clinics that use the EHR that cannot be configured to AAC-Out. Comparisons of TM vs. CO and of TM+MAPS vs. TM will be performed for patients who receive care in all 32 clinics. The updated power calculations for the AAC-Out vs. AAC-In comparison continue to assume an intraclass correlation for each outcome of 0.02, and now assume a coefficient of variation of the clinic sizes of 0.96 based on a census of the 21 participating clinics that use the two configurable EHRs. The 21 clinics have a projected total of 4,019 patients out of the projected total of 6,000 patients across all 32 participating clinics. Our updated power analyses indicate that the minimum detectable effect for Reach of the AAC-Out vs. AAC-In comparison is an 8.1 percentage point increase in AAC-Out relative to an estimated reach of 10% in AAC-In. The corresponding minimum detectable effect for Impact is 4.8 percentage points in AAC-Out relative to an assumed Impact of 2.0% in AAC-In. In addition to these changes in the design and power calculations, we have also modified our plans for addressing missing abstinence data in the computation of the Impact Outcome. We now plan to apply multiple imputation in cases where patients who fail to respond to the abstinence questionnaire.</p>
