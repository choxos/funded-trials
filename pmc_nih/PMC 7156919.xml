We postulated that co-administration of Env protein with either a DNA or NYVAC vector during priming would result in early generation of antibody responses to the Env V1/V2 region, which are important markers for effective protection against infection. We aimed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of a multivalent HIV vaccine including either DNA or NYVAC vectors alone or in combination with Env glycoprotein (gp120) followed by a co-delivered NYVAC and Env protein boost.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>We did a single-centre, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 1b trial at the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois (Lausanne, Switzerland). We included healthy volunteers aged 18–50 years who were at low risk of HIV infection. We randomly allocated participants using computer-generated random numbers to one of four vaccination schedules or placebo (4:1), and within these schedules participants were allocated either active treatment (T1, T2, T3, and T4) or placebo (C1, C2, C3, and C4). T1 consisted of two doses of NYVAC vector followed by two doses of NYVAC vector and gp120 Env protein; T2 comprised four doses of NYVAC vector and gp120 Env protein; T3 was two doses of DNA vector followed by two doses of NYVAC vector and gp120 Env protein; and T4 was two doses of DNA vector and gp120 Env protein followed by two doses of NYVAC vector and gp120 Env protein. Placebo injections were matched to the corresponding active treatment group. Doses were administered by injection at months 0, 1, 3, and 6. Primary outcomes were safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine schedules. Immune response measures included cross-clade and epitope-specific binding antibodies, neutralising antibodies, and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity measured 2 weeks after the month 1, 3, and 6 vaccinations.

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>Between Aug 23, 2012, and April 18, 2013, 148 healthy adult volunteers were screened for the trial, of whom 96 participants were enrolled. 20 individuals were allocated to each active treatment group (groups T1–4; n=80) and four were assigned to each placebo group (groups C1–4; n=16). Vaccines containing the NYVAC vector (groups T1 and T2) were associated with more frequent severe reactogenicity and more adverse events than were vaccines containing the DNA vector (groups T3 and T4). The most frequent adverse events judged related to study product were lymphadenopathy (n=9) and hypoaesthesia (n=2). Two participants, one in the placebo group and one in the DNA-primed T3 group, had serious adverse events that were judged unrelated to study product. One participant in the T3 group died from cranial trauma after a motor vehicle accident. Across the active treatment groups, IgG responses 2 weeks after the 6-month dose of vaccine were 74–95%. Early administration of gp120 Env protein (groups T2 and T4) was associated with a substantially earlier and higher area under the curve for gp120 Env binding, production of anti-V1/V2 and neutralising antibodies, and better antibody-response coverage over a period of 18 months, compared with vaccination regimens that delayed administration of gp120 Env protein until the 3-month vaccination (groups T1 and T3).</p>

                  <title>Interpretation</title>
                  <p>Co-administration of gp120 Env protein components with DNA or NYVAC vectors during priming led to early and potent induction of Env V1/V2 IgG binding antibody responses. This immunisation approach should be considered for induction of preventive antibodies in future HIV vaccine efficacy trials.</p>

                <p id="para30">We searched PubMed between 2005 and 2012 for preclinical and clinical studies of HIV vaccination schedules incorporating co-administration of DNA vector in combination with envelope (Env) proteins during priming and boosting phases. Several preclinical studies have shown promising results of such a vaccination schedule conferring protection from infection; however, similar schedules have not been tested in clinical trials.</p>

                </p>
                <p id="para50">We did a double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1b, clinical trial in healthy adult volunteers at low risk of HIV infection. Participants were allocated to one of four multicomponent HIV vaccine schedules that included priming with either DNA or NYVAC vectors alone or in combination with Env glycoprotein (gp120) followed by a co-delivered NYVAC and Env protein boost. Vaccines containing the NYVAC vector were associated with more frequent severe reactogenicity and more adverse events than were vaccines containing the DNA vector. Immune response measures included cross-clade and epitope-specific binding antibodies, neutralising antibodies, and antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. IgG antibody responses were high after vaccination across all active treatment groups. Early administration of gp120 Env protein (ie, during priming) was associated with a substantially earlier and higher induction of gp120 Env binding and antibodies against the V1/V2 region and with better antibody response coverage over a period of 18 months compared with regimens delaying gp120 Env protein administration until the 3-month vaccination.</p>

                </p>
                <p id="para70">DNA vectors in combination with Env proteins provide vaccination regimens capable of inducing potent antibody responses. These responses were identified as immune correlates of protection in the RV144 trial. Therefore, a DNA vector and Env protein vaccine could represent a valuable simplification in HIV vaccination regimens aimed at inducing antibody responses. Further research in clinical efficacy trials is needed to correlate the value of the rapid appearance of antibody responses with protection.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="para80">HIV vaccine development over the past 35 years has tested several different ideas for vaccines and vaccination regimens. The primary mechanism of protection of most licensed vaccines is with antibodies. Early ideas that were tested included HIV envelope (Env) protein-based vaccines with the objective of inducing neutralising antibodies. In two efficacy trials, called VAX003 and VAX004,<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> an Env glycoprotein subunit-based vaccine (recombinant monomeric gp120) was tested in two populations at risk of HIV infection in Thailand. In these two trials, bivalent monomeric gp120 induced type-specific, but not heterologous, neutralising antibodies against primary HIV-1 isolates and did not show protection against HIV infection.</p>
              <p id="para90">The absence of induction of protective antibody responses caused a substantial strategic shift in the area of HIV vaccines. Based on the importance of HIV-specific CD8 T cells in the control of virus replication during chronic infection, interest shifted from antibody-mediated vaccines to candidates inducing HIV-specific cellular immunity. Vaccine candidates included viral vectors such as poxvirus and adenovirus and DNA vectors expressing predominantly HIV structural proteins. An adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) vector-based vaccine expressing the Gag, Pol, and Nef proteins was tested in two vaccine trials, Step<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> and Phambili.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> This Ad5 vector-based vaccine showed no protection against HIV, and increased risk of HIV infection was seen in some vaccinated subgroups versus placebo in the Step trial.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> In another trial,<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> a vaccine regimen consisting of a DNA vector prime and a different Ad5 vector boost did not protect against HIV infection. Both the DNA and Ad5 vector-based vaccines expressed A, B, and C gp140 Env proteins in addition to the Gag and Pol proteins (Nef protein was expressed by the DNA vector-based vaccine only).</p>
              <p id="para100">These trials of vector-based vaccines showed that multiple immunisations (in particular, heterologous prime and boost combinations with two different vectors) could induce potent and long-lasting cellular immunity. Subsequently, the area of HIV vaccine development shifted back to the antibody idea with the variation of designing viral vectors or DNA and viral vector regimens in combination with Env proteins. In the phase 3 RV144 trial,<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> a prime and boost regimen consisting of a recombinant canarypox vector expressing HIV-1 Env protein, Gag protein, and protease (ALVAC-vCP1521) and bivalent recombinant monomeric gp120 Env protein (AIDSVAX B/E) showed modest protection (31%) 42 months after the first vaccination despite the absence of neutralising antibodies. Binding IgG antibodies directed at conserved regions of the V1/V2 loop, and antibodies mediating antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) in the presence of low plasma IgA, correlated with reduced risk of HIV infection.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> The highest level of protection from HIV infection (60%) was seen during the first year of follow-up after the first vaccination in RV144, then protection waned over time in association with a drop in anti-V1/V2 titres,<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> indicating that regimens eliciting high and durable levels of antibodies to HIV might have enhanced efficacy. IgG3 binding antibody responses to gp120 Env protein correlated strongly with reduced risk of HIV infection in the RV144 trial.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para110">In the HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN) 096 study, we aimed to test the hypothesis that co-administration of vaccines containing Env protein during priming in a heterologous prime and boost regimen would induce early generation of an antibody response against the V1/V2 region. Previous studies in mice and macaques showed robust early antibody development if protein was co-administered during priming.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> A novel immunisation schedule was designed with the objective of accelerating the induction of protective antibody responses by vaccination, thereby extending the period of protection seen in the RV144 trial. We aimed to compare vaccine regimens comprising co-administration during priming of either a DNA or NYVAC vector and gp120 Env protein versus DNA or NYVAC vectors alone followed by a NYVAC vector and gp120 protein boost.</p>

We included in our trial healthy adult volunteers judged to be at low risk of HIV infection. To meet inclusion criteria for enrolment, individuals had to be aged 18–50 years and in good general health, complete a questionnaire showing understanding of the study, be able and willing to provide informed consent, have access to a participating HVTN clinical research site, be willing to be followed up for the planned duration of the study and to be contacted annually after completion of scheduled clinic visits for a total of 5 years after the initial study injection, agree not to enrol in another study of an investigational research agent, be willing to receive HIV test results, be amenable to HIV risk reduction counselling, and be willing to be assessed by clinic staff for their risk for HIV infection. Pregnant women were excluded; volunteers who could become pregnant had to agree to consistently use effective contraception and to not seek pregnancy through alternative methods. Laboratory inclusion criteria, tested within 56 days before study enrolment, included negative HIV-1 and HIV-2 tests, amounts of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and creatinine lower than 1·1 times the institutional upper limit of normal, negative blood tests for chronic hepatitis B and C, normal urine on dipstick (ie, no glucose, no [or trace] protein, and no [or trace] haemoglobin; if trace haemoglobin was present on dipstick, red blood cells had to be within the institutional normal range on microscopic urinalysis), a haemoglobin amount greater than or equal to 11·0 g/dL for volunteers who were born female and greater than or equal to 13·0 g/dL for volunteers who were born male, a white-blood-cell count of 3300–12 000 cells per μL, a total lymphocyte count greater than or equal to 800 cells per μL, remaining differential either within the institutional normal range or with site doctor approval, and a platelet count of 125 000–550 000 cells per μL.</p>

                <p id="para230">The first primary outcome was to assess the safety and tolerability of the four vaccination schedules, which we measured by recording local and systemic reactogenicity signs and symptoms, laboratory measures of safety, and adverse events and serious adverse events. The site principal investigator was initially responsible for assessing and reporting safety events, which were then reviewed weekly by a Protocol Safety Review Team (PSRT) consisting of doctors who were the Chair and co-Chair of the protocol, the funder's medical officer, and an HVTN medical monitor, and a clinical safety specialist who was a nurse. An independent safety monitoring board consisting of specialists in infectious disease, virology, immunology, and vacccinology also reviewed safety events quarterly. The safety monitoring board reviewed safety data while aware of treatment allocations, whereas the principal investigator and PSRT were unaware of treatment allocations. Details of local and systemic reactogenicity will be published in a separate report.</p>
                <p id="para240">The other two primary outcomes were to assess immunogenicity and durability of the four vaccination schedules and to compare immunogenicity and durability between the NYVAC vector alone and NYVAC vector plus gp120 Env protein prime strategies (T1 <italic>vs</italic> T2) and between the DNA vector alone and DNA vector plus gp120 Env protein prime strategies (T3 <italic>vs</italic> T4). Immune response measures were HIV-specific cross-clade binding IgG Env antibody responses 2 weeks after the month 6 vaccination (for immunogenicity) and between 2 weeks and 12 months after the month 6 vaccination (for durability).

These patterns were similar for IgG responses to the V1/V2 region of gp120 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">figure 3B</xref>). IgG responses 2 weeks after the month 3 vaccination were high for all antigens (74–100% overall, 94–95% to the vaccine insert).</p>

The difference between these two groups waned over time, and responses and magnitudes of response were similar after the month 6 vaccination. In groups with gp120 Env protein co-administration during priming (groups T2 and T4), IgG response trajectories were similar between NYVAC vector and gp120 Env protein co-administration (group T2) and DNA vector and gp120 Env protein co-administration (group T4) after the month 3 and month 6 vaccinations (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">figure 3B</xref>).</p>
              <p id="para350">For all groups, responses and magnitudes of response dropped between 2 weeks and 12 months after the month 6 vaccination, and no differences were noted in aggregate vaccine-matched response magnitudes between groups at 12 months after the month 6 vaccination (data not shown). No differences in vaccine-matched or V1/V2 IgG responses and magnitudes of response were seen between females and males (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix pp 11, 12</xref>). The kinetics of IgG3 anti-Env responses to aggregate vaccine-matched and V1/V2 proteins were very similar to the kinetics of total IgG responses (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 13</xref>).</p>
              <p id="para360">The area under the IgG binding antibody response curve from month 0 to 12 months after the month 6 vaccination was significantly higher when gp120 Env protein was co-administered with DNA vector (group T4) than with DNA vector alone (group T3; p=0·0005 for the aggregate vaccine-matched response for T4 <italic>vs</italic> T3; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">figure 3C</xref>). A higher area under the IgG binding antibody response curve was seen for eight of the ten antigens tested; the exception was 96ZM65.1gp140 and the antigens in the vector such as gp41 and p24. The effect of co-administration of gp120 Env protein with the NYVAC vector did not differ with respect to the aggregate vaccine-matched response (p=0·25 for T2 <italic>vs</italic> T1); however, an increased area under the IgG binding antibody response curve was apparent for three of the ten antigens tested, including gp70_B.Case A_V1_V2 and AE.A244 V1V2 Tags/293F (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">figure 3C</xref>). Co-administration of gp120 Env protein with DNA vector priming (group T4) versus NYVAC vector priming (group T2) yielded a significantly higher area under the IgG binding antibody response curve for the aggregate vaccine-matched response and for three of the ten antigens tested (p=0·032 for T4 <italic>vs</italic> T2; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">figure 3C</xref>). Thus, priming with a DNA vector co-administered with gp120 Env protein (group T4) generated the most rapid, potent, and durable binding antibody responses among the four vaccine regimens tested.</p>
              <p id="para370">For most antigens, IgA responses and magnitudes of response peaked 2 weeks after the month 6 vaccination for groups T1 and T3, and were generally low and constant over time for groups T2 and T4 (data not shown).

Aggregate vaccine-matched responses 2 weeks after the month 6 vaccination ranged from 26% (group T4) to 82% (group T3). Responses and magnitudes of response 2 weeks after the month 6 vaccination were generally lower in groups with gp120 Env protein co-administration during the priming phase (groups T2 and T4).

For the 96ZM65.1_Δ11gp120.avi/293F and MN_gp120gDneg/293F Monomer antigens, magnitudes of response among positive responders were significantly higher for the DNA vector (group T3) versus NYVAC vector (group T1) primed groups (p=0·026 and p&lt;0·0001, respectively). The peak net percentage granzyme B activity was ascertained as secondary readout for ADCC. The results obtained were consistent with the profiles of the AUC net percentage granzyme B activity (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 14</xref>).<fig id="fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity</p><p>Responses (upper panels) and AUC net percentage of granzyme B activity (lower panels) are shown for three different antigens in the study groups.

The analysis clearly indicates that early antibody responses (including binding IgG Env, IgG3 V1/V2 aggregate vaccine-matched, and MN.3 neutralising antibody) are affected positively by co-administration during priming of gp120 Env protein with NYVAC vector (group T2) or DNA vector (group T4), with peak response and high magnitude present as early as 2 weeks after the month 1 vaccination. Antibody responses peaked at 2 weeks after the month 6 vaccination in the groups that did not receive gp120 Env protein during priming (groups T1 and T3).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="para420">Our data indicate that early administration of gp120 Env protein leads to early elicitation of binding and neutralising immune responses, with no effect on T-cell responses. The overall area under the IgG binding antibody response curve with early administration of gp120 Env protein is higher and hence might offer enhanced efficacy as a vaccine regimen. The higher area under the IgG binding antibody response curve is more a result of earlier induction of antibodies and less an outcome of greater durability or overall magnitude of response.</p>
              <p id="para430">Previous phase 1/2 clinical studies (eg, the EV01 trial<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> and the EV02 trial<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref>) have investigated the immunogenicity of NYVAC vector-based vaccine regimens in homologous or heterologous DNA vector-based priming and NYVAC vector-based boost combinations. In these studies, responses and magnitudes of responses for both CD4 and CD8 T cells were greatly increased in the regimens with a DNA vector-based prime and a NYVAC vector-based boost. It is important to underscore that both the NYVAC and DNA vector-based vaccines used in the EV02 trial<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref> and another trial (EV03) were different from those used in HVTN 096 with respect to the clade C subtype, the number of NYVAC vectors and DNA vectors used, and the optimisation of HIV immunogen expression. The immunogenicity results obtained in HVTN 096 are highly consistent with those obtained in the EV01 trial<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> and EV02 trial<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref> and indicate that, in study groups not containing proteins in the prime (T1 and T3), peak responses and magnitudes of response occurred 2 weeks after the month 3 vaccination for CD4 T cells and 2 weeks after the month 6 vaccination for CD8 T cells. CD4 T-cell responses were durable and remained unchanged in both responses and magnitudes of response by 6 months after the month 6 vaccination. These results, therefore, further confirm the superiority of heterologous prime and boost DNA and NYVAC vector-based regimens compared with homologous prime and boost NYVAC vector-based regimens.</p>
              <p id="para440">The RV144 study identified binding IgG antibodies directed at conserved regions of the V1/V2 loop, and antibodies mediating ADCC in the presence of low plasma IgA, as immune correlates of reduced risk of HIV infection.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> Of note, the highest protection from infection was seen during the first year of follow-up, then protection waned over time, which was associated with a substantial drop in antibody responses correlating with protection.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> Based on the results from RV144, it is important to increase the levels of protection seen during the first year and to maintain a durable antibody response over time so we can substantially improve the modest protection recorded at 42 months after the first vaccination.</p>
              <p id="para450">HVTN 096 was designed to ascertain whether gp120 Env protein co-administration at priming could induce rapid and durable generation of the antibody responses that were shown to correlate with protection against infection in RV144. In HVTN 096, we used the same bivalent gp120 Env protein vaccine as was used in RV144. Use of a mismatched clade Env protein vaccine compared with clade C immunogens expressed in the NYVAC and DNA vector-based vaccines offered the opportunity to assess the induction of cross-clade immune responses. The vaccine regimens tested in HVTN 096 induced broad cross-clade antibody responses.</p>
              <p id="para460">Co-administration of gp120 Env protein at priming resulted in rapid and potent generation of the antibody responses recorded in RV144. Binding IgG Env antibody responses, including anti-V1/V2, were detected 2 weeks after the second dose of gp120 Env protein co-administration (with either the NYVAC or DNA vector) in almost 100% of participants, and levels of antibodies were close to peak amounts that were generally seen 2 weeks after the month 3 vaccination. Antibody responses and magnitudes of responses peaked 2 weeks after the month 6 vaccination in study groups without gp120 Env protein co-administration at priming. Rapid and potent generation of antibody responses occurs also when gp120 Env proteins are administered as monovalent vaccine.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Therefore, the rapid induction of antibody responses seen in HVTN 096 most likely results from early co-administration of gp120 Env protein, with no evidence seen of an interaction between gp120 Env protein and DNA or NYVAC vectors.</p>
              <p id="para470">Responses for binding IgG antibodies directed to V1/V2 were similar between HVTN 096 and RV144 at 2 weeks after the month 6 vaccination, whereas the magnitudes of responses were superior in HVTN 096 for two of three V1/V2 antigens. However, both responses and magnitudes of responses of binding IgG antibodies directed to V1/V2 were superior in HVTN 096 versus HVTN 100. These findings confirm previous observations of the immune response advantage of NYVAC vector-based vaccines versus ALVAC vector-based vaccines administered with Env protein in non-human primates.<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36</sup></xref> However, the different gp120 proteins and formulations used in HVTN 096 and HVTN 100 might have also had an effect on the differences seen in antibody responses. Binding IgG antibody responses to gp120 or gp140 proteins were similar between HVTN 096, HVTN 100, and RV144, whereas the magnitude of these responses was generally superior in HVTN 096.</p>
              <p id="para480">Binding IgG Env antibody responses to aggregate vaccine-matched Env proteins and to V1/V2 dropped over time in all study groups in HVTN 096. However, binding antibody responses were detected 6 months after the month 6 vaccination in many individuals in all study groups: responses ranged from 58% to 81% for aggregate vaccine-matched Env proteins and from 47% to 58% for AE.A244 V1V2 Tags/293F. Vaccine-induced Env V1/V2 IgG3 responses were associated with lower risk of infection in RV144.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> IgG3 responses to aggregate vaccine-matched and V1/V2 Env proteins were also present in all vaccine study groups in HVTN 096 and had kinetics similar to total IgG responses. Consistent with the findings of RV144, IgG3 responses in HVTN 096 waned over time. ADCC activity against two of three vaccine-matched Env proteins was detected in many (70–95%) individuals 2 weeks after the month 6 vaccination.</p>
              <p id="para490">Overall, the four vaccine regimens assessed in HVTN 096 were all immunogenic, with T-cell responses and a subset of antibody responses that were higher, on average, in the regimens containing the DNA vector. Co-administration of Env protein at priming is not only associated with rapid generation of protective antibody responses but also has better antibody response coverage over a period of 18 months compared with regimens without protein co-administration at priming. Although early Env protein co-administration could be associated with improved protection from infection during the first year of vaccination, the decline in responses and magnitudes of responses over time is not prevented satisfactorily by co-administration of Env protein at priming. Therefore, additional vaccinations, improved formulation of Env proteins with more potent adjuvants, or both need to be tested to induce durable antibody responses.</p>
              <p id="para500">The generalisability of the immune correlates identified in the RV144 study has not yet been confirmed in other efficacy trials. Furthermore, since the vaccines analysed in the HVTN 096 study are different to those assessed in RV144, the protective capacity of the vaccine-induced immune responses in HVTN 096 remains unknown. The results from HVTN 096 provide the basis for designing new studies assessing the benefit of early Env protein co-administration with other candidate vaccines or improved formulations and underscore the importance of further developing DNA and poxvirus vector-based vaccine regimens.</p>
