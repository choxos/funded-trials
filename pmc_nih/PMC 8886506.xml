                  <p>Excess gestational weight gain (GWG) among women with overweight or obesity synergistically increases their already elevated risk of having gestational diabetes, a caesarean delivery, a large for gestational age infant, and post-partum weight retention, and increases their child's risk of obesity.

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>We did a randomised controlled trial in five antenatal clinics of Kaiser Permanente; Oakland, San Leandro, Walnut Creek, Fremont, and Santa Clara, CA, USA. Women at 8â15 weeks' gestation with singletons, pre-pregnancy BMI 25Â·0â40Â·0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and aged 18 years or older were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive the telehealth lifestyle intervention or usual antenatal care. Randomisation was adaptively balanced for age, BMI, and race and ethnicity. Data collectors and investigators were masked to group assignments. The core lifestyle intervention consisted of two in-person and 11 telephone sessions on behavioural strategies to improve weight, diet, and physical activity, and stress management to help women meet a trial goal of gaining at the lower limit of the Institute of Medicine (IOM) guidelines range for total GWG: 7 kg for women with overweight and 5 kg for women with obesity. Usual antenatal care included an antenatal visit at 7â10 weeks' gestation, an additional seven antenatal visits, on average, and periodic health education newsletters, including the IOM GWG guidelines and information on healthy eating and physical activity in pregnancy. The primary outcome was weekly rate of GWG expressed as excess GWG, per Institute of Medicine guidelines and mean assessed in the intention-to-treat population. The trial is registered at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov" id="interrefs10">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="ClinicalTrials.gov" xlink:href="NCT02130232" id="interrefs20">NCT02130232</ext-link>.</p>

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>Between March 24, 2014, and Sept 26, 2017, 5329 women were assessed for eligibility and 200 were randomly assigned to the lifestyle intervention group and 198 to the usual care group. Analyses included 199 women in the lifestyle intervention group (one lost to follow-up) and 195 in the usual care group (three lost to follow-up). 96 (48%) women in the lifestyle intervention group and 134 (69%) women in the usual care group exceeded Institute of Medicine guidelines for rate of GWG per week (relative risk 0Â·70, 95% CI 0Â·59 to 0Â·83). Compared with usual care, women in the lifestyle intervention had reduced weekly rate of GWG (mean 0Â·26 kg per week [SD 0Â·15] <italic>vs</italic> 0Â·32 kg per week [0Â·13]; mean between-group difference â0Â·07 kg per week, 95% CI â0Â·09 to â0Â·04). No between-group differences in perinatal complications were observed.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="para10">There is a growing global epidemic of obesity and excessive gestational weight gain (GWG) in pregnancy. In the USA, 60% of women enter pregnancy with overweight or obesity,<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> whereas it is 30% in Europe and 10% in Asia.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> In the USA, approximately 64% of pregnant women with overweight or obesity exceed the Institute of Medicine guidelines for GWG.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> A 2018 report showed that 51% of pregnant women in Europe and 37% of pregnant women in Asia exceeded the Institute of Medicine guidelines for GWG, regardless of their BMI.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref>

              <p id="para20">Observational studies<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> show that excess GWG among women with overweight or obesity synergistically increases their elevated risk of having gestational diabetes, a caesarean delivery, a large for gestational age infant, and post-partum weight retention, and increases their child's risk of obesity. Thus, improving GWG among women with overweight or obesity is a public health priority and a serious concern for health-care delivery systems. Pregnancy is a unique time when women are in frequent contact with the health-care system and are often motivated to make lifestyle changes out of concern for their infants. However, it is only recently that intensive behavioural lifestyle interventions with in-person counselling have been effective in reducing excess GWG among women with overweight or obesity.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Intensive interventions, requiring in-person counselling with multiple visits to clinic might not be feasible for many women, can decrease treatment efficacy, and could be difficult to implement in health-care delivery settings.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> Telehealth is increasingly used in such settings to increase efficiency and has been shown to be effective in improving perinatal outcomes.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref>

                    <bold>Evidence before this study</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para50">Observational studies strongly suggest that excess gestational weight gain (GWG) is associated with increased risk of perinatal complications; however, lifestyle interventions among women with overweight or obesity were found ineffective in reducing excess GWG or perinatal complications, although these studies had relatively small sample sizes. We searched Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and PubMed for literature published from Jan 1, 2008, to Dec 31, 2019, in English language, with the search terms âpregnancy and weight gain,â âoverweight or obesity,â and âlifestyle interventionâ. All the randomised controlled trials aimed at reducing GWG among women with overweight or obesity that we reviewed strongly suggested the need for novel lifestyle interventions to show whether it was possible to reduce excess GWG in this population. In the past 5 years, after starting our trial, intensive in-person lifestyle interventions, analysed individually and in meta-analysis, have been effective in reducing excess GWG among women with overweight or obesity, although they were not effective in reducing perinatal complications. Intensive interventions, requiring in-person counselling with multiple visits to clinics, might not be feasible for many women, can decrease treatment efficacy, and could be difficult to implement in health-care delivery settings.</p>
                  <p id="para60">
                    <bold>Added value of this study</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para70">The GLOW trial compared a theory-based behavioural intervention, delivered primarily by telehealth, with usual antenatal care for women with overweight or obesity with the goal to reduce excess GWG. Compared with usual care, the intervention substantially reduced the proportion of women exceeding the Institute of Medicine guidelines for weekly rate of GWG. The intervention also reduced total caloric intake, proportion of calories from saturated fat, sedentary behaviours, markers of insulin resistance, and serum leptin concentration. These favourable changes were not reported in the previous trials or trials published after the start of our trial. However, in our trial no between-group differences in perinatal complications were observed, consistent with most trials aimed at reducing GWG.</p>
                  <p id="para80">
                    <bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para90">The GLOW intervention is an evidence-based programme that can be adapted and adopted by health-care delivery systems to prevent excess GWG and improve healthy behaviours and markers of insulin resistance among women with overweight or obesity. Although larger trials with longer follow-up periods are needed to assess the effect of reduced GWG on perinatal and long-term outcomes, obesity prevention efforts in women of reproductive age are urgently needed to possibly reduce the adverse health consequences associated with obesity.</p>

                <p id="para130">Women randomly assigned to the usual care received standard KPNC antenatal medical care, which included an antenatal visit at 7â10 weeks' gestation, an additional seven antenatal visits on average, and periodic health education newsletters, including the Institute of Medicine GWG guidelines and information on healthy eating and physical activity in pregnancy. Medical staff unaware of group assignment weighed women at each antenatal visit. In addition to standard KPNC antenatal care, women in the usual care group received four study newsletters that focused on women's health and safety during pregnancy without addressing GWG.</p>
                <p id="para140">In addition to usual antenatal care, women randomly assigned to the intervention received a lifestyle intervention adapted from the DPP<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> and primarily delivered by telehealth, designed to be feasible among pregnant women and adoptable by health-care delivery settings.

The first and last sessions were in person and the remaining 11 were delivered by telephone. At the initial in-person session women were advised of their GWG goal for the end of pregnancy. The trial goal for GWG was defined as total GWG that did not exceed the lower limit of the Institute of Medicine guidelines<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> range: no more than 7 kg for women with pre-pregnancy BMI 25Â·0â29Â·9 kg/m<sup>2</sup> or 5 kg for women with pre-pregnancy BMI 30Â·0 kg/m<sup>2</sup> or higher. Women were provided a printed workbook to discuss at each session; a scale to encourage self-weighing; and a personalised electronic or paper-based graph to track their weight. Participants and coaches reviewed weight change in relation to the GWG goal at each intervention session.

                <p id="para160">Pre-pregnancy weight was abstracted from electronic health records and defined as the latest pre-pregnancy weight measured by KPNC medical staff within 6 months before the last menstrual period; or, for women without a measured pre-pregnancy weight, as the earliest pregnancy weight measured by KPNC medical staff before 10 weeks' gestation. Pre-pregnancy weight from electronic health records and height measured at the baseline study clinic visit were used to calculate pre-pregnancy BMI. Overweight was defined as a pre-pregnancy BMI of 25Â·0â29Â·9 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and obesity as 30Â·0â40Â·0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Women's weight and height were measured according to a rigorous protocol<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> at study clinic visits along with demographic characteristics.

Multiple linear regression was used to provide point and interval estimates of the overall difference between usual care and intervention groups in mean weekly rate of GWG and total GWG, as well as to examine the differences in mean diet, physical activity, and metabolic markers. All analyses were adjusted for the variables used in the adaptive randomisation procedure,<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> as well as pre-pregnancy weight for GWG outcomes. Prespecified subgroup analyses of GWG with interaction tests for heterogeneity in group effect were done for pre-pregnancy BMI (overweight, obesity). For metabolic biomarkers, log transformations for normality were done when appropriate. Analysis results for these variables are presented on the original measurement scale via transformation of regression coefficients, providing point and interval estimates of the ratio of geometric means. Mediation analyses<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> were done to examine the proportion of the intervention's effect on changes in metabolic markers that was mediated by rate of GWG per week between the two study clinic visits (ie, between 8â15 and 29â38 weeks of gestation).</p>

The intervention's effect on reduced GWG might be explained by the observed reductions in total caloric intake, proportion of calories from saturated fat, and sedentary behaviour among women in the intervention group. Significantly lower weekly rate of GWG among women in the intervention group than in the usual care group explained a large number (68â90%) of the significantly lower pregnancy-induced increases in serum concentrations of fasting insulin, homoeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance, and leptin observed in that group, which might have in turn led to lower cord blood concentrations of C-peptide and leptin.</p>

Indeed, in our study, women in the intervention group had smaller increases in total caloric intake and saturated fat and decreased sedentary behaviour compared with women in the usual care group. The GLOW intervention significantly reduced the adverse pregnancy-induced changes in insulin, homoeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance, and leptin between 8â15 and 29â38 weeks' gestation; the intervention's effect on these metabolic markers was largely mediated by the reduced rate of GWG per week during the same time period in pregnancy.

However, the meta-analysis was limited by the absence of standardisation of the intensity of the interventions and definitions of outcomes.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref>
</p>
              <p id="para380">Observational studies have reported an association between first trimester excess GWG and large for gestational age infants; therefore, perhaps interventions should start earlier in pregnancy or even before conception to affect birthweight.<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> Another possible strategy would be continuing the telehealth intervention into the post-partum period to prevent infants being large for gestational age in a subsequent pregnancy. It is possible that the GLOW intervention might reduce the risk of child adiposity in later childhood because its positive effect on GWG, diet, physical activity, insulin resistance, and leptin could reduce the risk of obesity in the offspring potentially through epigenetic pathways.<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> However, it is also possible that positive effects on the woman's lifestyle might no longer be evident once interventions are discontinued, potentially affecting the child's lifestyle and adiposity.</p>
              <p id="para390">Finally, it should be noted that in our study's intervention group, as well as in previous intervention groups,<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> there was an increase in the number of women with GWG below the Institute of Medicine guidelines. This increase raises concerns because observational studies have reported that both excess and suboptimal GWG among women with normal weight, but not among women with overweight or obesity, were associated with childhood obesity.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> Therefore, there is the need for longer follow-up of women and their children to elucidate the effect of GWG interventions on childhood obesity.</p>
              <p id="para400">Strengths of the GLOW trial include the large sample size, the ability to recruit a racially and ethnically diverse population, including Asian women (a group underrepresented in previous trials), and the identification and enrolment of potential participants very early in gestation. The intervention's use of telehealth, which has been shown to be successful in a health-care delivery setting to improve perinatal outcomes<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> among women with gestational diabetes, is also a strength. This modality can be easily translatable to other clinical settings, one of the reasons being that cost per intervention participant was modest. Additional strengths include the use of measured weights from electronic health records.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> The validity of weights from these records is supported by the similarity of the between-group difference of â0Â·07 kg per week in weekly rate of GWG (calculated using measured pre-pregnancy weights) and last pregnancy weight from the records with the between-group difference of â0Â·11 kg per week in rate of GWG per week between the two study clinic visits (calculated using weights measured according to a rigorous study protocol).</p>
              <p id="para410">There were also some limitations to our study. Participants were not masked to study group, which could have biased responses to self-reported measures of diet and physical activity. Additionally, women in the usual care group did not receive any extra contacts with research study intervention staff, while women in the intervention group did; therefore, it is not possible to assess whether the observed between-group differences in GWG were attributable to increased contact time or to the intervention content itself. However, the latter is plausible given that even lifestyle intervention trials with active comparison groups have yielded improved GWG.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref>
</p>
              <p id="para420">In conclusion, the GLOW intervention, delivered primarily by telehealth and designed to be feasible in health-care delivery settings, was effective in substantially decreasing excess GWG, improving pregnancy diet, sedentary behaviour, markers of insulin resistance, leptin concentrations, and cord blood concentrations of C-peptide and leptin. This intervention could be an evidence-based programme that health-care delivery systems can further adapt to the needs of their clinical settings to prevent excess GWG and improve health behaviours and markers of insulin resistance among women with overweight or obesity. No between-group differences in perinatal complications were observed; however, the GLOW trial was not powered to assess differences in these outcomes. Notably, although larger trials with longer follow-up periods are needed to assess the effect of reduced GWG on perinatal and long-term outcomes, obesity prevention efforts in women of reproductive age are urgently needed to reduce complications associated with obesity.</p>
