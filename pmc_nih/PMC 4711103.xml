                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Fecal microbiota transplants (FMT) are an effective treatment for patients with gut microbe dysbiosis suffering from recurrent <italic>C. difficile</italic> infections. To further understand how FMT reconstitutes the patient’s gut commensal microbiota, we have analyzed the colonization potential of the donor, recipient and recipient post transplant fecal samples using transplantation in gnotobiotic mice.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>A total of nine samples from three human donors, recipient’s pre and post FMT were transplanted into gnotobiotic mice. Microbiome analysis of three donor fecal samples revealed the presence of a high relative abundance of commensal microbes from the family <italic>Bacteriodaceae</italic> and <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic> that were almost absent in the three recipient pre FMT fecal samples (&lt;0.01 %). The microbe composition in gnotobiotic mice transplanted with the donor fecal samples was similar to the human samples. The recipient samples contained <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic>, <italic>Lactobacillaceae</italic>, <italic>Enterococcaceae</italic> in relative abundance of 43, 11, 8 %, respectively. However<italic>,</italic> gnotobiotic mice transplanted with the recipient fecal samples had an average relative abundance of unclassified <italic>Clostridiales</italic> of 55 %, approximately 7000 times the abundance in the recipient fecal samples prior to transplant. Microbiome analysis of fecal samples from the three patients early (2–4 weeks) after FMT revealed a microbe composition with the relative abundance of both <italic>Bacteriodaceae</italic> and <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic> that was approximately 7 % of that of the donor. In contrast, gnotobioitc mice transplanted with the fecal samples obtained from the three at early times post FMT revealed increases in the relative abundance of <italic>Bacteriodaceae</italic> and <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic> microbe compositions to levels similar to the donor fecal samples. Furthermore, the unclassified <italic>Clostridiales</italic> in the recipient samples post FMT was reduced to an average of 10 %.</p>

                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p>We have used transplantation into gnotobiotic mice to evaluate the colonization potential of microbiota in FMT patients early after transplant. The commensal microbes present at early times post FMT out competed non-commensal microbes (e.g. such as unclassified <italic>Clostridiales</italic>) for niche space. The selective advantage of these commensal microbes to occupy niches in the gastrointestinal tract helps to explain the success of FMT to reconstitute the gut microbe community of patients with recurrent <italic>C. difficile</italic> infections.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p><italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> infections are the major causative agent for infective antibiotic associated diarrhea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Infections are most commonly acquired in healthcare settings although community acquired infections are increasingly being reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In addition to recent use of antibiotics, other risk factors include old age, use of gastric acid suppressing drugs and underlying chronic disease including inflammatory bowel disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The numbers of infections have been rising during the last decade with estimated health care costs in the billions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p>
              <p>The standard treatments for <italic>C. difficile</italic> infection consist of metronidazole, vancomycin, or fidaxomicin, which results in a rate of recurrence at about 20 %; after a third recurrence, the risk of further episodes is even higher [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) for treatment of recurrent <italic>C. difficile</italic> has had remarkable success rates for alleviation of the symptoms and restoration of health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p>
              <p>The reason why FMT is so effective in restoring a microbiome in the gastrointestinal tract of the patients is unknown. Presumably, an effective long-term stable reconstruction would require the commensal microbes in the FMT to access and occupy the niches in the gastrointestinal space following transplantation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Although there have been numerous reports on the composition of the patients microbiota following FMT, there have been no studies to examine the potential of the donor microbes to colonize the recipients post transplant. To gain insights into this issue, we have examined this aspect of microbiome reconstruction following FMT by transplanting human fecal samples into gnotobiotic mice. Since these mice are devoid of microbes, previous studies have shown that the unoccupied (open) niches in the gastrointestinal tract readily accept fecal transplantation and recapitulate the major elements of the human microbiome in the gnotobiotic mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. From the analysis of fecal samples from gnotobiotic mice with transplanted with donor, recipient and post FMT samples, we demonstrate that the microbiota of recipient early post FMT possess the capacity to reconstitute gnotobiotic mice with a microbiome community that is similar to the donor.</p>

              <p>Three patients that had undergone fecal transplants were chosen for this study. All of the three recipients were positive for <italic>C. difficile</italic> at least once and had undergone several rounds of antibiotic treatments without complete resolution of the repeated episodes of colitis. The characteristics of the recipients with respect to age, antibiotic treatment and comorbidities in addition to the <italic>C. difficile</italic> infection can be found in the Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Data Set S1. Each recipient agreed to a fecal transplant with individual donors, usually a spouse or other family member. The transplants were accomplished by nasogastric administration. The details for preparation of the donor sample and administration can be found in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Text S1. For all three transplants, fecal samples were collected from donor, recipient and recipient post transplant (collected 2–4 weeks post fecal transplant). By convention, for a given specific transplant (e.g. transplant number 1) we refer to the donor (D), recipient (R) and Recipient post Transplant (RpT) with a prefix letter and the specific transplant number (e.g. D1, R1, RpT1). The Recipient post Transplant samples also carries a suffix which represent time post transplant i.e. RpT1w2 means that the sample is taken 2 week post fecal transplant. The human samples when transplanted in mouse carries a prefix “M” (for example when human sample RpT1w2 is transplanted in mouse it is named MRpT1w2). The list of all human and mouse samples used for microbiota analysis is presented in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Data Set S1.</p>
              <p>A total of 9 samples from three human donors, recipients and RpT were collected and transplanted into gnotobiotic mice each as three replicates (27 mouse samples). A total of 36 samples were sequenced with an average sequence depth of 95,464 reads per sample (range 58,972–172877 reads per sample). After quality filtering the sample depth across all samples was normalized to 49,243 reads per sample and used for analysis. A total of 469 operational taxonomic unit (OTU) were identified.</p>

                <p>Comparison of the microbe communities from recipient and donor samples using principle coordinate analysis (PCoA) generated from weighted UniFrac metrics revealed each formed separate clusters (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The microbe communities from the post FMT patients (RpT) generally clustered in between the donor or recipient samples on the PCoA plot. The donor samples showed a high abundance of commensal microbes from the families <italic>Bacteriodaceae</italic> (mean 25 %) and <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic> (mean 30 %). The <italic>Bacteriodaceae</italic> and <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic> were almost absent in recipient samples (&lt;0.01 % of the abundance of the donors). The recipient samples contained <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic>, <italic>Lactobacillaceae</italic>, <italic>Enterococcaceae</italic> in relative abundance of 43, 11, 8 % respectively (these microbes were less that 0.01 % in the donors) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Data Set S2). Following FMT, the RpT samples from all three patients at 2–4 weeks showed an increase in the proportional abundance of both <italic>Bacteriodaceae</italic> and <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic> to approximately 7 %. In addition, the RpT samples showed a decrease in the abundance of families <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic>, <italic>Lactobacillaceae</italic>, <italic>Enterococcaceae.</italic> The Shannon’s diversity metric of the recipients (mean 2.63 ± 0.95) was also found to be significantly lower than the donor population (mean 5.18 ± 0.62) (<italic>p</italic> &lt;0.05).

Collectively, our analysis demonstrates that the microbe compositions of the donor and recipient pre FMT are clearly different.

                <title>Transplant of donor and recipient pre and post FMT microbiota into gnotobiotic mice</title>
                <p>It has been previously shown that gnotobiotic mice accept and recapitulate the major elements of the human microbiota after transplant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. We wanted to use this feature of gnotobiotic mice to examine the colonization potential of the microbiota from the recipients prior to and after transplant. Following transplant, the mice were housed for 4 weeks for equilibration and the microbiome from fecal samples from each mouse was then analyzed.</p>
                <p>Similar to what we observed from the analysis of the microbiome composition of the donor and recipient pre FMT, the beta diversity comparison using PCoA plots of the weighted UniFrac analysis showed separate clustering of mouse transplanted donor (MD) from the mouse transplanted recipient (MR) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). The microbiota of MD samples was found to be statistically different (<italic>p</italic> &lt;= 0.001) than the MR samples. The pattern was consistent with all three cases (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b, c and d</xref>). The transplantation of the fecal samples from RpT from all three of the FMT patients into gnotobiotic mice (MRpT) resulted in a microbe composition in the mice that clustered with the donor (MD): no statistical difference between MD and MRpT samples was found (<italic>p</italic> &gt;0.05).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Comparison of the microbiota community in gnotobiotic mice transplanted with fecal samples from donors, recipients pre and post transplant.

                <p>The taxa analysis substantiated the microbe clustering seen on the PCoA plots. In particular, the composition of the MRpT from each of the samples from the mice was similar to the composition of the MD with respect to the abundance of the predominant families of commensal microbiota <italic>Bacteroidaceae</italic> and <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). In contrast, transplantation of the recipient samples into gnotobiotic mice resulted in a microbe composition with an abnormally higher proportion of unclassified <italic>Clostridiales</italic> (referred to as <italic>Clostridiales; Other</italic> which includes all <italic>Clostridiales</italic> which cannot be classified at family level, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Data Set 2) at an average abundance of 55 %. This relative abundance is approximately 7000 times increased from the relative abundance in the recipient samples (i.e. pre-transplant into gnotobiotic mice). Thus, the microbes within the unclassified <italic>Clostridiales</italic> in the recipients have the capacity to colonize and amplify following transplantation into gnotobiotic mice. Further examination of the sequences from the unclassified <italic>Clostridiales</italic> revealed two major OTUs. One OTU (denovo6164) shows 100 % similarity to <italic>C. difficile</italic> (accession number gi:822490352) while the second OTU (denovo14687) shows 100 % similarity to Bacterium NLAE (accession number gi:379364487). Consistent with the increased abundance of the unclassified <italic>Clostridiales</italic> in the MR samples, there was a lower Shannon’s diversity (2.8) as compared to MD (4.6). The Shannon metric of diversity of the MRpT samples was higher than that of the MR samples and similar to that of the MD (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Taxa distribution of the microbial composition of mouse transplanted with donor, recipient pre and post FMT.

                <p>To further highlight the commensal microbe expansion in the gnotobiotics, we next compared the relative abundance of the <italic>Bacteriodaceae</italic> and <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic> in the human and mouse transplants. The microbes of the human donor samples demonstrated the capacity of the <italic>Bacteriodaceae</italic> and <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic> to colonize gnotobiotic mice following transplantation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Even though the RpT samples had lower abundance of <italic>Bacteriodaceae</italic> and <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic>, the abundance of both increased following transplant into gnotobiotic mice to a similar abundance as gnotobiotic mice transplanted with the donor samples, highlighting the capacity of both <italic>Bacteriodaceae</italic> and <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic> to effectively colonize and even expand following transplantation (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Data Set 2). In parallel, we found the relative abundance of microbes of the unclassified <italic>Clostridiales</italic> also increased in the MRpT from the human RpT to an average abundance of 10 % from 0.2 % (Data Set 2). However, this increase was only 50 times greater that that found in the human RpT samples as compared to the 7000 times greater for the transplant of the recipient samples in gnotobiotic mice (i.e. human R to MR).<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><p>Comparison of relative abundance of selected taxa (family level).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Previous studies have analyzed the microbiome of donor and FMT recipient pre and post-transplant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Similar to the results we found with our three patients, these studies found that before FMT, the microbial composition of the recipient was of low diversity and different from the donor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Similar to our observation, Shahinas et al. studied 2-week post-FMT samples and noted 50 % samples show noticeable early reconstitution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. It is not surprising in our study then, that early after FMT the microbe composition of the recipients was different from both the donor and the recipient.</p>
              <p>One of the early events for a successful transplant is the ability of the transplanted microbiota to access the gastrointestinal niches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Once the donor microbes reach the niches, they must also compete for nutrients and space to expand their numbers. To gain insights into the reconstitution of the microbial community in the FMT patients, we took advantage of the capacity of gnotobiotic animals since these mice are devoid of microbes and all of the niches in the gastrointestinal tract would be open for colonization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p>
              <p>We first analyzed the microbe communities in mice transplanted with the donor or recipient fecal samples. The microbial composition of the mice transplanted with the donor did not cluster with that of mice transplanted with the recipients, consistent to what we saw from the analysis of the donor and recipient obtained from humans. Furthermore, we did not find a difference in the relative abundance of <italic>Bacteroidaceae</italic> and <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic> in the human and compared to the gnotobioitic. As evidenced from the analysis of the recipient’s microbiota, the microbe composition was very different from that of the donor with increased relative abundance of families <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic>, <italic>Lactobacillaceae</italic>, <italic>Enterococcaceae,</italic> consistent with a dysbiotic microbe composition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Transplantation of the recipient fecal samples into gnotobiotic mice though revealed a different composition from that of the recipient with an increase in the relative abundance of the unclassified <italic>Clostridiales</italic>. Thus, even though the unclassified <italic>Clostridiales</italic> microbes represented a minor percentage of the recipient microbes, they had the capacity to amplify and occupy the vacant niches in the gntobiotic mice. The reason why these microbes were not major constituents of the recipient microbe population is unknown. One possibility is that the unclassified <italic>Clostridiales</italic> might have a selective growth advantage in the mouse gut over the other microbes in the recipient’s sample (i.e. families <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic>, <italic>Lactobacillaceae</italic>, <italic>Enterococcaceae</italic>). Additional experiments will be required to address this possibility.</p>
              <p>We next characterized the colonization potential of the recipient’s fecal sample at early times post FMT. Even though the microbe composition 2–4 weeks after FMT in the three recipients differs from both the donor and pre FMT microbiota, the transplantation of the RpT fecal samples into gnotobiotic animals resulted in a microbe composition that clustered with the donor. We found the proportion of the commensal microbes of the families <italic>Bacteroidaceae</italic> and <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic> were increased following transplantation into the gnotobiotic mice to levels similar to that of the mice transplanted with the donor samples. This result suggests that the commensal microbes, represented by families <italic>Bacteroidaceae</italic> and <italic>Lachnospiraceae,</italic> in the RpT transplanted into the gnotobiotic mice with the open niches probably out compete the non-commensal microbes present in the sample after FMT for niche space in the gnotobiotic mice. Support for this conclusion comes from previous studies that have shown commensal gut microbes such as <italic>Bacteroides,</italic> have evolved species-specific physical interactions with the host that mediate stable and resilient gut colonization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p>
              <p>One of the important functions of the commensal gut microbes is to provide an environment to protect against over growth of pathogenic microbes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Indeed, the use of multiple antibiotic treatments to treat <italic>C. difficile</italic> is thought to stress the regenerative properties of the gut microbiota that can promote conditions conducive for over growth of pathogens leading to the dysbiotic microbe composition. It was clear though from the analysis of the RpT transplants in gnotobiotic mice that the microbes of the families <italic>Bacteroidaceae</italic> and <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic> had the capacity to reconstruct a microbe community that had the capacity to inhibit the expansion of the unclassified <italic>Clostridiales</italic> still present in the fecal samples. In the MRpT samples the presence of the microbes of the families <italic>Bacteroidaceae</italic> and <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic> (abundance 7 % of that found in the donor) resulted in 50 fold expansion of unclassified <italic>Clostridiales</italic> as opposed to the 7000 fold expansion on the recipient sample that had reduced amounts of the families <italic>Bacteroidaceae</italic> and <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic> (less that 0.01 % of the donor). It is not clear whether the reduced expansion of the unclassified <italic>Clostridiales</italic> is due solely to the <italic>Bacteroidaceae</italic> and <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic> out competing for niche space since from the studies of the recipient transplants in gnotobiotic mice the unclassified <italic>Clostridiales</italic> have the capacity to colonize the gnotobiotic mice. Another possibility is that the mouse diet, which is known to impact the gut microbiome composition, might have favored the further expansion of the <italic>Bacteroidaceae</italic> and <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic> over the unclassified <italic>Clostridales</italic>. Additional studies will be needed to understand the community dynamics that controls the continued reconstruction of the microbe community at these later times following FMT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p>

Due to low quality of single base toward the 3′ ends of the read, the last base were trimmed for all reads, making the read length as 250 bases. Any read with an average base quality Q score of &lt;20 and the reads with unknown bases (“N”) were discarded. The remainder of the steps was performed with the Quantitative Insight into Microbial Ecology (QIIME) suite, version 1.8 as described below [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].

The pellets were processed for DNA and 16S rDNA microbiome analysis is performed. All mice were bred and maintained and all animal experimentation was approved in accordance with guidelines and approval of the University of Alabama at Birmingham Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.</p>
