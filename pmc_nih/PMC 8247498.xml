                  <p>Current type 2 diabetes (T2D) management contraindicates intensive glycemia treatment in patients with high cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk and is partially motivated by evidence of harms in the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial.

                  <p>ACCORD was a randomized controlled trial that investigated whether intensively treating glycemia in individuals with T2D would reduce CVD outcomes. Using a novel approach to cluster HbA<sub>1c</sub> trajectories, we identified groups in the intensive glycemia arm with modified CVD risk. Genome-wide analysis and polygenic score (PS) were developed to predict group membership. Mendelian randomization was performed to infer causality.</p>

            <p>The Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) was a landmark trial to examine the effect of intensive glycemia treatment targeting glycated hemoglobin A<sub>1c</sub> (HbA<sub>1c</sub>) &lt;6% versus more modest therapy targeting HbA<sub>1c</sub> 7.0â7.9%. The study was conducted in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) at high cardiovascular risk, with a primary end point of time to first occurrence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), specifically nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), nonfatal stroke, or cardiovascular death. Notably, the intensive glycemia arm of the trial was terminated prematurely because of an increase in cardiovascular and overall mortality (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The findings from ACCORD have had important implications regarding guidelines for glycemic management (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>â<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Although there was a significant increase in mortality in the intensive glycemia arm, heterogeneity was observed (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>â<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). In addition, potential benefits in some measures of neuropathy, eye complications, and microalbuminuria were observed (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Epidemiological analysis of ACCORD demonstrated that individuals at greatest risk of mortality and MACE were those intensively treated who did not reach the target HbA<sub>1c</sub> (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p>
            <p>We previously developed a risk score based on two genetic variants that predicted White individuals with modified risk of cardiovascular mortality and displayed a significant interaction with glycemia control (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Here, we expanded our approach to a racially diverse population, characterizing a glycemia-responsive group in the intensive glycemia arm of ACCORD using a novel application of dynamic time warping to measure the similarity of patient HbA<sub>1c</sub> trajectories. We then clustered patients into clinical groups based on HbA<sub>1c</sub> trajectory and identified a group of patients intensively treated in ACCORD with significantly lower risk of mortality, MACE, and multiple other cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes compared with other intensively treated patients. We also demonstrated causal inference regarding this relationship using Mendelian randomization. Furthermore, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify genetic variants associated with membership in a low-risk clinical group and used machine learning to construct a polygenic score (PS) to predict patients likely to benefit from ACCORD-like intensive intervention. Importantly, this study generates new hypotheses that patients predicted to be in this low-risk clinical group have significantly lower risk of CVD outcomes compared with the same predicted group receiving standard glycemia treatment.</p>

Briefly, 10,245 individuals with T2D and either a history of CVD or two or more risk factors for CVD were randomly assigned to receive standard glycemia treatment (HbA<sub>1c</sub> 7â7.9%; <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 5,119) or intensive glycemic treatment (HbA<sub>1c</sub> &lt; 6%; <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 5,126). Patients were further randomized to determine whether intensively treating blood pressure or dyslipidemia was effective at reducing MACE. Participants were scheduled to have their HbA<sub>1c</sub> tested at each 4-month visit and had to have â¥3 HbA<sub>1c</sub> measurements recorded to be included in the analysis. Missing values were mean imputed with the HbA<sub>1c</sub> immediately preceding and following. Trial outcomes included first occurrence of MACE (i.e., nonfatal heart attack, nonfatal stroke, cardiovascular death), all-cause mortality, CVD mortality, congestive heart failure, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, total stroke, expanded macrovascular events, and coronary heart disease. Cohort details are provided in <ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.2337/figshare.14109806" ext-link-type="uri">Supplementary Table 1</ext-link>. In addition, microvascular outcomes including neuropathies, nephropathies, and retinopathies were also investigated. The GWAS and PS development were performed using the 8,054 individuals who consented to genetic studies.

                <p content-type="flushleft">HbA<sub>1c</sub> trajectories from individuals randomized to intensive glycemia treatment (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 4,946) and truncated to each trial outcome were compared using a modified dynamic time-warping approach (etwDTW) that weighted the cost of earlier HbA<sub>1c</sub> differences more than later differences. Dynamic time warping compares two trajectories and calculates a score for how similar they are to each other. To ensure that HbA<sub>1c</sub> impacts after a CVD outcome did not bias the results, HbA<sub>1c</sub> trajectories were truncated to ensure that only pre-CVD event HbA<sub>1c</sub> values were used. For this reason, nine versions of truncated HbA<sub>1c</sub>s were developed, one for each of the nine CVD outcomes of interest. Through the pairwise comparison of patient-truncated HbA<sub>1c</sub> trajectories, dissimilarity matrices were generated for each outcome. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering with the Ward method was used to cluster HbA<sub>1c</sub> trajectories based on etwDTW dissimilarity for each outcome (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Because clustering was performed on the truncated HbA<sub>1c</sub> trajectories for each outcome, a consensus cluster was developed that integrated clustering for each outcome into a single dendrogram. To do this, the cophenetic distances of the dendrogram of each outcome were summed to generate a cophenetic dissimilarity matrix (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Hierarchical clustering with the Ward method was used again to cluster HbA<sub>1c</sub> trajectories across all outcomes based on cophenetic dissimilarity. Individuals who clustered together were considered to be part of the same clinical group; the optimal number of clinical groups (<italic toggle="yes">k</italic>) was determined by comparing the risk of outcome for each dendrogram split using Cox proportional hazards, and the number of clusters preceding a nonsignificant split was selected (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &gt; 0.05) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). For each clinical group, composite trajectories were created by averaging the individual HbA<sub>1c</sub> values across each time point.

GRCh37/hg19 was used as the reference genome build, and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with genotyping rates &gt;97% were merged using PLINK (version 1.9). Prephasing and imputation were performed using SHAPEIT2 (version 2.r778) and IMPUTE2 (version 2.3.0), respectively, using set 2 and the 1000 Genomes Phase 1 integrated haplotypes reference panel (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Variants with an info metric &lt;0.5 and minor allele frequency &lt;3% were excluded.

SNPs imputed across all participants were annotated as IMPU. Genotypic data are available at the National Center for Biotechnology Information database for genotypes and phenotypes (phs001411.v1.p1). The final genotyped data set consisted of 8,054 unique individuals and 1,238,999 variants. Additional details regarding genetic data processing can be found in Marvel et al.

                <p content-type="flushleft">Several approaches to constructing a PS were evaluated. Sets of SNPs from the GWAS were chosen using a clumping procedure based on 28 unique combinations of hyperparameters (<ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.2337/figshare.14109806" ext-link-type="uri">Supplementary Table 4</ext-link>). A PS was derived based on each set of clumped variants and each <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> value threshold (CT-PS). In addition, a penalized logistic regression framework was used to derive a stacked clumping and thresholding PS (SCT-PS) using the R package bigsnpr (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). This approach generated multiple PS for each individual, and penalized regression was then used to derive an optimal combination of each PS, from which the weighted allele counts were summed to create the final SCT-PS to predict clinical group membership.</p>
                <p>Next, we developed models using genetic and baseline clinical factors to predict patients in the group that benefited from intensive glycemia treatment (C4). Patients randomized to intensive treatment were partitioned into a training set (66%; <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 2,270) and a test set (33%; <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 1,169). Cross-validation was performed on the training data; least absolute shrinkage and selection operator was used to select baseline clinical features and their interactions with the PS, and these were included in a logistic regression model (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Each model was developed using clinical features only, PS only, or clinical features and PS. Models developed on the training data were then tested on the 33% of data withheld as the test set and evaluated based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve in the test set. The SCT-PS without clinical variables performed comparable or better than other approaches and was selected because of parsimony and clinical utility.

Mendelian randomization attempts to identify causal relationships between an exposure variable and an outcome by using genetic data as instrumental variables to randomize the population. Here, in each treatment arm, each CVD outcome was tested using the SCT-PS as the instrumental variable and median HbA<sub>1c</sub> before an event as the exposure variable. Significant causal relationships were assessed using the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method. The IVW estimate is the ratio of the gene-outcome association to the gene-exposure association, standardized by the SE of the gene-outcome association. The IVW estimates for every CVD outcome in each treatment arm were then meta-analyzed to identify overall causal associations.</p>

The SCT-PS model had sensitivity, specificity, and balanced accuracy of 95%, 93%, and 94%, respectively, when applied to the withheld test set (<ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.2337/figshare.14109806" ext-link-type="uri">Supplementary Table 13</ext-link>).</p>
                <p>Next, we evaluated whether the C4 subtype benefited from intensive glycemia treatment rather than displaying reduced risk regardless of treatment strategy. Applying the SCT-PS to identify predicted C4 patients in the intensive arm (in the withheld test set) and in the standard arm, we demonstrated that predicted C4 patients who received intensive glycemia treatment had significantly reduced risk compared with predicted C4 patients receiving standard treatment for MACE (HR 0.45; 95% CI 0.28â0.72; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 9.56 Ã 10<sup>â4</sup>), coronary heart disease (HR 0.52; 0.34â0.79; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.002), total mortality (HR 0.53; 0.28â0.99; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.047), and nonfatal MI (HR 0.47; 0.26â0.83; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.01). Moreover, the risk across all CVD outcomes was significantly reduced in predicted C4 individuals receiving intensive treatment (HR 0.53; 0.40â0.69; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 4.02 Ã 10<sup>â6</sup>) (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic toggle="yes">A</italic></xref>). Sensitivity analysis and propensity score matching demonstrated that the SCT-PS reduction in risk was stable across sample-size imbalances and potential demographic differences between cohorts (<ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.2337/figshare.14109806" ext-link-type="uri">Supplementary Figs. 15</ext-link> and <ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.2337/figshare.14109806" ext-link-type="uri">16</ext-link>).

The SCT-PS outperformed in White patients (HR 0.41; 0.26â0.65; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 1.0 Ã 10<sup>â4</sup>), but significant reductions in risk were also observed in non-White patients (HR 0.71; 0.52â0.97; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.03) (<ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.2337/figshare.14109806" ext-link-type="uri">Supplementary Figs. 18</ext-link> and <ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.2337/figshare.14109806" ext-link-type="uri">19</ext-link>).

Interestingly, the predicted C4 group in the test set failed to reach a statistically significant reduction in microvascular outcomes compared with the predicted C4 group receiving standard treatment (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.05) (<ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.2337/figshare.14109806" ext-link-type="uri">Supplementary Fig. 20</ext-link>).</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p content-type="flushleft">The failure of ACCORD to show benefit from intensive glycemia treatment has significantly affected clinical management of patients with advanced T2D and risk of CVD. However, individual heterogeneity within a complex disease classification may complicate findings from research studies and clinical trials (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>â<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Here, we propose that a genetic subtype with T2D exists that is responsive to intensive glycemia treatment, despite the lack of efficacy observed across the overall cohort.</p>
              <p>It has been recognized that patients treated intensively in ACCORD who attained a lower HbA<sub>1c</sub> had reduced risk of death compared to those treated intensively with little HbA<sub>1c</sub> reduction, albeit this risk reduction was insignificantly lower than with standard treatment (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). However, to our knowledge, this is the first study showing a genetic subgroup (C4) in ACCORD with statistically significant reductions in risk across all CVD outcomes (HR 0.34; 95% CI 0.17â0.67; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 2.01 Ã 10<sup>â3</sup>) (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Significant reductions were observed for each individual CVD outcome, with the most significant reductions for total and nonfatal stroke, with HRs of 0.21 (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 2.43 Ã 10<sup>â4</sup>) and 0.021 (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 4.67 Ã 10<sup>â4</sup>), respectively. Cardiac eventsânonfatal MI and coronary heart disease also displayed large reductions in risk, with HRs of 0.27 (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 9.30 Ã 10<sup>â11</sup>) and 0.35 (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 1.71 Ã 10<sup>â15</sup>), respectively. Interestingly, congestive heart failure showed the weakest reduction in risk, with an HR of 0.70 (0.50â0.98; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.04) (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic toggle="yes">D</italic></xref>). We also observed a significant reduction across all microvascular outcomes (HR 0.86; 0.77â0.97; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.002). However, when the SCT-PS for C4 was applied to the withheld test set of patients, the predicted C4 groups showed a benefit in CVD outcomes (HR 0.53; 0.40â0.69; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 4.02 Ã 10<sup>â6</sup>), but no statistically significant benefit in microvascular outcomes was seen (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &gt; 0.05) (<ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.2337/figshare.14109806" ext-link-type="uri">Supplementary Fig. 20</ext-link>). It may be that C4 does not benefit from reduced microvascular outcomes with intensive glycemia treatment, or it may be that the withheld test set was underpowered to detect the relatively smaller effect sizes observed for microvascular outcomes (HR 0.86; <ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.2337/figshare.14109806" ext-link-type="uri">Supplementary Fig. 5</ext-link>) compared with the effect sizes for CVD outcomes (HR 0.34; <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic toggle="yes">D</italic></xref>).</p>
              <p>We investigated whether genetic variants indicated a different genetic profile for individuals responsive to intensive treatment (i.e., C4). Although no SNPs reached genome-wide significance (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 5 Ã 10<sup>â8</sup>), several SNPs reached the predefined threshold for suggestive significance (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 5 Ã 10<sup>â6</sup>) and could be considered candidates for follow-up studies. The association with Rs220721, located in <italic toggle="yes">MAS1</italic>, and C4 membership reached suggestive significance (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 4.34 Ã 10<sup>â7</sup>). Although substantial literature implicates the MAS1 receptor in CVD, and to some extent T2D, these molecular pathways are complex and not well understood (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). The MAS1 receptor is a constitutively active GPCR expressed in many tissues and interacts with angiotensin-(1â7), a MAS1 agonist, and may play a role in ischemic stroke and CVD (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Angiotensin-(1â7) regulates insulin secretion through MAS-dependent cAMP signaling in pancreatic islet cells and reduced hyperglycemia in a rat model of T2D (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Pharmacological antagonism and <italic toggle="yes">Mas</italic><sup>(â/â)</sup> mice displayed significant reductions in insulin secretion, suggesting a potential role for MAS1 in glycemic response (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). SNPs in <italic toggle="yes">MAS1</italic> are in linkage disequilibrium with IGF-2 receptor (<italic toggle="yes">IGF2R</italic>) (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic toggle="yes">B</italic></xref>), and genetic variation in <italic toggle="yes">IGF2R</italic> has been previously associated with coronary heart disease and shown to affect circulating levels of IGF2R, which has been associated with T2D (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>â<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Additional studies to determine the role of genetic variation in <italic toggle="yes">MAS1</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">IGF2R</italic> in relation to intensive glycemia response are needed.</p>
              <p>These findings generate new hypotheses regarding the existence of a genetic subtype within T2D (C4) that is responsive to intensive glycemia treatment. Through developing an SCT-PS with 94% balanced accuracy in the withheld test set, we demonstrated that predicted C4 patients who received intensive treatment had a reduction in CVD outcomes versus the predicted C4 patients who received standard treatment (HR 0.53; 95% CI 0.40â0.69; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 4.02 Ã 10<sup>â6</sup>). This overall reduction in CVD outcomes in the predicted C4 group was largely driven by reductions in nonfatal MI and coronary heart disease (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic toggle="yes">A</italic></xref>). It also seems that HbA<sub>1c</sub> stratification was the largest contributor to the reduction in CVD outcomes, compared with relatively smaller contributions from LDL and SBP control (<ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.2337/figshare.14109806" ext-link-type="uri">Supplementary Fig. 9</ext-link>). Furthermore, Mendelian randomization demonstrated evidence of a causal relationship between the SCT-PS, median on-trial HbA<sub>1c</sub>, and CVD outcomes for patients receiving intensive treatment (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.001) but not standard treatment (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &gt; 0.05) (<ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.2337/figshare.14109806" ext-link-type="uri">Supplementary Fig. 14</ext-link>). Together, this indicates there was indeed benefit to receiving intensive glycemia treatment for some patients (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic toggle="yes">A</italic></xref>). These results are further supported by sensitivity analysis and propensity score matching, which demonstrated the robust nature of the model (<ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.2337/figshare.14109806" ext-link-type="uri">Supplemental Material</ext-link>). Lastly, the SCT-PS seemed to outperform a previous cardiovascular mortality PS to predict, in a racially diverse population, a group that benefits from intensive glycemia treatment (<ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.2337/figshare.14109806" ext-link-type="uri">Supplementary Fig. 22</ext-link>). With additional validation, it may be possible to accurately identify patients in this subtype likely to benefit from intensive glycemia treatment.</p>
              <p>These results have not been replicated in an independent cohort, which is made difficult by the limited number of trials with available genetic data that have evaluated intensive glycemia treatment in patients with high CVD risk and longer duration of disease. Therefore, it is unknown at this point if these results would be generalizable beyond ACCORD. Since ACCORD, medications such as GLP-1 agonists and SGLT2 inhibitors have become available, and these are also beneficial for CVD risk, which may have different impacts on outcomes for these subtypes. Given safety concerns, it is unlikely that a trial like ACCORD would be repeated. However, we did infer a causal relationship between the SCT-PS, HbA<sub>1c</sub> response with intensive treatment, and reduction in CVD risk. Other studies have proposed distinct etiological subtypes of T2D (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>â<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). However, it is not clear if the subtypes here represent distinct T2D etiologies or just subtypes relevant for treatment response. Although additional work is needed to validate these findings, they indicate important developments in this landmark clinical trial with implications for precision medicine and suggest that additional review by advisory groups is warranted.</p>
