              <p id="P7">Pazopanib was approved as first-line treatment for advanced renal cell carcinoma (aRCC) based on the phase III VEG105192 study in which pazopanib significantly prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) compared with placebo (median, 9.2 vs. 4.2 months; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001), and this benefit was observed in treatment-naive and cytokine pretreated patients.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> The randomized phase III COMPARZ study demonstrated noninferior efficacy of first-line pazopanib versus sunitinib.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> The primary end point of noninferior PFS with pazopanib versus sunitinib was met (8.4 vs. 9.5 months; hazard ratio [HR], 1.05; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.90-1.22), and the secondary end points of objective response rate (ORR) and overall survival (OS) supported the comparable efficacy of the 2 agents in favorable- and intermediate-risk patient populations. Differences in the safety profile revealed that Grade 3/4 adverse events (AEs) and symptomatic AEs were more frequent with sunitinib compared with pazopanib, and most (11/14) health-related quality of life measures significantly favored pazopanib over sunitinib, a finding that was confirmed in the PISCES patient preference study.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Our objectives in this post hoc analysis of COMPARZ were to characterize pazopanib responders and evaluate whether patient subpopulations achieved better outcomes. Furthermore, because of previous observations showing a relationship between pazopanib or sunitinib exposure and efficacy and safety,<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> and recent attempts to improve sunitinib’s safety profile with alternative sunitinib dosing regimens,<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>-<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> an additional objective was to evaluate the effect of dose modifications on efficacy and safety outcomes in COMPARZ.</p>

                <p id="P8">The COMPARZ study was an international randomized, open-label, noninferiority phase III trial.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Briefly, 1110 patients with clear-cell aRCC were randomized 1:1 to receive pazopanib (800 mg once daily; n = 557) or sunitinib (50 mg once daily for 4 weeks, followed by 2 weeks without treatment; n = 553) in 6-week cycles. The primary end point was PFS as assessed by independent review. The study was powered to demonstrate noninferiority of pazopanib versus sunitinib. Secondary end points included OS, safety, and quality of life. COMPARZ was approved by the institutional review board or ethics committee at each participating center and was conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines. Additional post hoc analyses of COMPARZ are reported herein.</p>

                <title>Dose Modifications and Efficacy</title>
                <p id="P15">Dose modifications occurred in similar proportions of patients in the pazopanib and sunitinib groups (see <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Table 1</xref> in the online version). None, any, 1, and ≥2 dose reductions occurred in 56%, 44%, 27%, and 18% of patients with pazopanib and 49%, 51%, 29%, and 21% of patients with sunitinib. None, any, 1, and ≥2 dose interruptions occurred in 56%, 44%, 25%, and 19% of patients with pazopanib and 51%, 48%, 25%, and 24% of patients with sunitinib. For the pazopanib and sunitinib arms, patients who underwent dose modifications had a lower median average daily dose, with most dose reductions occurring within the first 3 to 6 months of treatment (see <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Figure 1</xref> in the online version). However, median average daily dose increased for patients in the pazopanib group who underwent 1 dose reduction, which might be because of the small number of patients remaining at this later time point (n = 20 at ≥2 years; n = 1 at ≥3 years).</p>
                <p id="P16">For the pazopanib and sunitinib arms, patients who underwent dose modification had a higher median cumulative dose compared with patients who underwent no dose modification, which is likely explained by the longer time of study treatment for these patients (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Median PFS for patients with no versus any dose reductions was 7.3 months (95% CI, 5.3-8.3) versus 12.5 months (95% CI, 10.9-15.0; HR, 1.693; 95% CI, 1.365-2.099; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001) for pazopanib and 5.5 months (95% CI, 4.3-8.1) versus 13.8 months (95% CI, 11.1-16.4; HR: 1.872; 95% CI, 1.484–2.361; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001) for sunitinib (<xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> and <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="P19">This post hoc analysis of COMPARZ demonstrated that time to response was excellent with both drugs, although numerically shorter with pazopanib compared with sunitinib; the proportion of patients with a (≥10 months) response was similar for pazopanib (14%) versus sunitinib (13%); and patients who experienced clinical benefit from pazopanib or sunitinib were more likely to have experienced AEs requiring dose modifications.</p>
              <p id="P20">Time to response for pazopanib in this post hoc analysis is consistent with findings from the trial that led to approval of first-line pazopanib for aRCC, in which the median time to response was also 11.9 weeks according to independent review.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> With sunitinib, the median time to response in this post hoc analysis was 17.4 weeks, and although this cannot be compared directly with the sunitinib pivotal trial, a pooled analysis of 1059 metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients treated with sunitinib across 6 clinical trials (including the pivotal trial) found a median time to response of 10.6 weeks.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> The patient population in the pooled clinical trial analysis was treatment-naive or cytokine pretreated, treated with sunitinib 50 mg/d (4/2 schedule) or continuous sunitinib 37.5 mg/d,<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> and were thus a more heterogeneous patient population than in COMPARZ.</p>
              <p id="P21">In this post hoc analysis of the COMPARZ trial, pazopanib and sunitinib were associated with a similar proportion of patients who had a response duration ≥10 months, as well as associated with comparable median PFS and median OS in patients with baseline bone, lung, and kidney metastasis. The noninferior efficacy and differentiated safety profile of first-line pazopanib and sunitinib treatment is supported by large real-world analyses.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>-<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup></p>
              <p id="P22">Patients who underwent dose modifications because of AEs continued therapy for longer periods of time, had significantly improved PFS, OS, and ORR, received a higher median cumulative dose, and ultimately had more toxicity reported compared with patients who underwent no dose modifications. Within each dose modification group, select AEs (PPE and hematologic AEs) were more common with sunitinib compared with pazopanib and liver enzyme elevations were more common with pazopanib, consistent with the primary analysis.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> This highlights the need for better therapy management for these patients, which might include dose reduction and treatment interruptions, which could ultimately lead to improved clinical outcomes.</p>
              <p id="P23">Although other analyses of clinical studies support that increased exposure to pazopanib and sunitinib is associated with improved clinical outcomes, the current post hoc analysis of COMPARZ extends this by suggesting that dose modifications when required because of toxicity do not compromise efficacy. Further, this analysis suggests that patients who do undergo dose reductions because of AEs continue treatment longer and are more likely to experience clinical benefit from pazopanib and sunitinib compared with patients who experience minimal toxicity. Thus, dose reductions and dose interruptions are safe for patients who experience toxicity from pazopanib or sunitinib. A retrospective analysis of 2 prospective sunitinib trials similarly demonstrated improved median PFS and ORR in patients who underwent dose reduction because of AEs compared with patients who remained on the standard 50 mg/d, 4/2 schedule.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> A real-world study of 591 metastatic RCC patients treated with first-line pazopanib or sunitinib in Italy also suggested that dose modifications when necessary for AEs do not compromise efficacy.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> In contrast, a chart review of 10 oncology centers in Europe (n = 291) found significantly shorter survival for aRCC patients who received a low relative dose intensity (RDI) of pazopanib or sunitinib (RDI &lt;0.7),<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> as might be expected based on pharmacokinetic data demonstrating a positive relationship between pazopanib/sunitinib exposure and survival.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> However, 19% of patients in the European chart review had initiated treatment at a lower than standard dose, and thus lower doses received in this patient population were not all due to toxicity.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Finally, a recent study in the adjuvant setting showed that higher pazopanib levels were associated with improved disease-free survival and did not increase treatment discontinuations or Grade 3/4 AEs, with the exception of hypertension.<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> This highlights the important role of drug exposure on clinical outcomes; dose modifications should only be considered for patients who require this intervention because of AEs.</p>
              <p id="P24">The relationship between exposure and efficacy end points has been demonstrated for several approved vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), including pazopanib and sunitinib.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Higher sunitinib exposure has been shown to be associated with longer time to progression and greater OS in a pooled clinical trial analysis of metastatic RCC patients.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Similarly, survival benefits have been shown for pazopanib. In a large phase II trial of pazopanib in /metastatic RCC patients, a steady-state trough concentration of 20.5 μg/mL was identified as the cutoff associated with improved PFS and tumor shrinkage, and a relationship between increased pazopanib exposure and the frequency of AEs, such as hypertension and liver enzyme elevations, was shown.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Indeed, high interpatient variability in drug exposure is observed with VEGFR TKIs, such as pazopanib and sunitinib,<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> and patients achieving higher drug exposure are also more likely to experience toxicity as well as survival benefit. This higher toxicity might lead to dose reductions or interruptions, which might explain the superior clinical outcomes (PFS, OS, and ORR) in patients with dose modifications compared with patients without dose modifications.</p>
              <p id="P25">With sunitinib, the safety profile at the approved dose of 50 mg/d for 4 weeks followed by 2 weeks off treatment (4/2 schedule) has led to investigation of alternative off-label dose schedules, such as the 2/1 schedule<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> and continuous 37.5 mg/d dosing (Renal EFFECT trial).<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Although the Renal EFFECT study did not lead to a change in practice, the 2:1 schedule for patients experiencing toxicity with the 4:2 schedule has been widely used. Outcomes from a single-arm phase II trial of individualized sunitinib dosing also support dose/schedule individualization in patients experiencing AEs.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> In this individualized-dosing study, dose reductions and schedule changes were implemented in patients experiencing grade ≥2 toxicity, and patients experiencing minimal toxicity received dose escalation (18.4%). The median PFS was 12.5 months and median OS was 38.5 months. The ORR (46.1%) and stable disease rate (38.5%) translated into a clinical benefit for 84.6% of patients with no decline in quality of life scores during therapy. Although multiple studies have assessed the effect of nonstandard intermittent dosing schedules with sunitinib to maintain therapeutic drug concentrations, prolong duration of therapy, minimize AEs, and/or maintain efficacy, we are unaware of any clinical studies prospectively investigating intermittent pazopanib dosing schedules in patients with aRCC. However, a recent preclinical study reported that a high-dose intermittent pazopanib dosing schedule was able to extend median OS in an animal model of advanced metastatic RCC resistant to continuous pazopanib,<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> suggesting potential clinical utility for intermittent pazopanib dose scheduling for selected patients with aRCC.</p>
              <p id="P26">The association between tolerability and clinical outcomes underscores that clinical outcomes are not adversely affected in patients with treatment-related AEs who undergo dose reductions and remain on therapy. This supports individual dosing titrated according to toxicity. Although patients without toxicity have worse outcomes, the consequences of this on dosing and treatment strategy are less clear. Dose reductions should only be applied following presentation of treatment-related AEs dose reductions are not an intervention that improves long-term outcomes, but rather a necessity to keep patients on treatment. Whether patients who experience minimal toxicity should be dose escalated is a valid question that should be addressed by future studies. Initial observations suggest TKI dose escalation during treatment may be appropriate for selected patients with metastatic RCC. In a retrospective analysis of 25 patients whose disease progressed during sunitinib treatment, 36% had a PRand 28% had stable disease for a median of 7.5 months after dose escalation.<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> In the phase II study of individualized sunitinib treatment previously discussed, 18.4% of patients were dose escalated.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Axitinib titration was associated with improved response rates in a randomized phase II trial.<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> In a retrospective analysis of 22 patients who received an escalated TKI dose (axitinib [17], sunitinib [3], pazopanib [2]) after progressive disease, 4 (22%) patients experienced a PR and 78% had a decreased disease burden after dose escalation.<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> Individualizing axitinib dose and treatment duration based on toxicity with planned breaks of therapy has been reported to be feasible and active.<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup></p>
              <p id="P27">Limitations of this study are the post hoc, retrospective nature of the analyses. Furthermore, no adjustments were made for multiple comparisons, limiting the conclusions that can be drawn from the efficacy by baseline metastatic site data.</p>
              <p id="P28">In summary, these results suggest that clinicians treating aRCC patients with sunitinib or pazopanib should reduce the dosage and/or give treatment breaks if required because of AEs, which might allow patients to remain longer on treatment and continue to obtain clinical benefit. Differences revealed between first-line pazopanib and sunitinib may also aid treatment choice for clinicians, such as the shorter time to response and lower frequency of PPE and hematologic AEs with pazopanib, and lower frequency of ALT/AST elevations with sunitinib.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p id="P29">In this post hoc analysis of the COMPARZ study, patients who required dose reductions and dose interruptions due to AEs experienced longer time on treatment, received greater cumulative doses, and had significantly improved PFS, OS, and ORR compared with patients who did not require dose modifications. This indicates that dose modifications can be safely implemented without compromising pazopanib or sunitinib efficacy, and that AEs might be used as a surrogate marker of adequate dosing for individual patients.</p>
