              <abstract>
                <p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are stable, small non-coding RNAs that modulate many downstream target genes. Recently, circulating miRNAs have been detected in various body fluids and within exosomes, prompting their evaluation as candidate biomarkers of diseases, especially cancer. Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is the most common AIDS-associated cancer and remains prevalent despite Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy (HAART). KS is caused by KS-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), a gamma herpesvirus also associated with Primary Effusion Lymphoma (PEL). We sought to determine the host and viral circulating miRNAs in plasma, pleural fluid or serum from patients with the KSHV-associated malignancies KS and PEL and from two mouse models of KS. Both KSHV-encoded miRNAs and host miRNAs, including members of the miR-17–92 cluster, were detectable within patient exosomes and circulating miRNA profiles from KSHV mouse models. Further characterization revealed a subset of miRNAs that seemed to be preferentially incorporated into exosomes. Gene ontology analysis of signature exosomal miRNA targets revealed several signaling pathways that are known to be important in KSHV pathogenesis. Functional analysis of endothelial cells exposed to patient-derived exosomes demonstrated enhanced cell migration and IL-6 secretion. This suggests that exosomes derived from KSHV-associated malignancies are functional and contain a distinct subset of miRNAs. These could represent candidate biomarkers of disease and may contribute to the paracrine phenotypes that are a characteristic of KS.</p>

                <p>Circulating microRNAs (miRNAs), such as those found in exosomes, have emerged as diagnostic tools and hold promise as minimally invasive, stable biomarkers. Transfer of tumor-derived exosomal miRNAs to surrounding cells may be an important form of cellular communication. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is the etiological agent of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), the most common AIDS-defining cancer worldwide. Here, we survey systemically circulating miRNAs and reveal potential biomarkers for KS and Primary Effusion Lymphoma (PEL). This expands previous tissue culture studies by profiling clinical samples and by using two new mouse models of KSHV tumorigenesis. Profiling of circulating miRNAs revealed that oncogenic and viral miRNAs were present in exosomes from KS patient plasma, pleural effusions and mouse models of KS. Analysis of human oncogenic miRNAs, including the well-known miR-17-92 cluster, revealed that several miRNAs were preferentially incorporated into exosomes in our KS mouse model. Gene ontology analysis of upregulated miRNAs showed that the majority of pathways affected were known targets of KSHV signaling pathways. Transfer of these oncogenic exosomes to immortalized hTERT-HUVEC cells enhanced cell migration and IL-6 secretion. These circulating miRNAs and KS derived exosomes may therefore be part of the paracrine signaling mechanism that mediates KSHV pathogenesis.</p>

              <p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNAs that are capable of fine-tuning gene expression through translational repression and/or mRNA degradation. In the past, miRNAs have emerged as important regulators in nearly every cellular process, but perhaps the largest biological consequence of miRNA dysregulation is in cancer <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Cho1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Feederle1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-OHara1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-OHara2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Baraniskin1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-OHara3" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The relationship between intra-tumor miRNA signatures and cancer progression has been well established, leading to the discovery of specific miRNAs or miRNA clusters that modulate gene expression in cancer <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Abend1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Hansen1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Lei1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. We and others have shown that miRNA signatures can classify tumors into distinct classes and are predictive of disease outcome <xref rid="ppat.1003484-OHara1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-OHara2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-OHara3" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Boeri1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Moltzahn1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. In our prior study, we found that the host miRNA profile differed depending on the degree of transformation among cells, even though all samples were infected by the same virus and thus expressed similar levels of viral miRNAs <xref rid="ppat.1003484-OHara3" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. This suggests that host miRNA profiles impart information about viral infection above that provided by detecting the presence of the infectious agent.</p>
              <p>MiRNA regulation is complex in malignancies associated with viral infection such as herpesvirus-associated cancers <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Feederle1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-OHara3" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Marshall1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Pfeffer1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Viral infection can trigger changes in the miRNA profile through the expression of viral genes that modulate the host miRNA repertoire. Some viruses such as Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) and Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) in addition encode their own miRNAs, which fine-tune host gene expression to promote latent viral persistence, immune evasion, and tumor progression <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Hansen1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Lei1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Haecker1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Samols1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Qin1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Gottwein1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. These viral miRNAs are often expressed within the tumor and can reveal important information regarding viral latency and disease progression <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Zhu1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Furthermore, recent studies have highlighted important functions of the viral miRNAs in regulation of the viral life cycle, immune evasion and angiogenesis through validated mRNA targets <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Abend1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Haecker1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Boss1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Nachmani1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Ziegelbauer1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Lu1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Lu2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. In KSHV-associated cancers, the KSHV miRNAs can account for as much as 20% of all mature miRNA species within a cell and are highly conserved among isolates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003484.s001">Figure S1</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Marshall1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Haecker1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Gottwein1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>).</p>
              <p>KSHV is the etiological agent of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), the most common AIDS-defining cancer worldwide <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Jemal1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. KSHV is also associated with the B cell lymphoma Primary Effusion Lymphoma (PEL) and with the plasmablastic variant of Multicentric Castleman's Disease (MCD). Despite the availability of Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy (HAART), KS continues to occur in the US and worldwide. Treatment of KS remains a challenge and stable, minimally invasive biomarkers for diagnosis are lacking <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Krown1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Krown2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Therefore, the discovery of plasma miRNA biomarkers for KSHV-associated malignancies could improve diagnostics through early detection and could influence treatment through non-invasive monitoring of tumor responses. MiRNA biomarkers can be sampled from blood, saliva, or other bodily fluids, offering a feasible diagnostic test even in resource-poor regions such as the “KS belt” in sub-Saharan Africa <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Jemal1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Dollard1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Viral microRNAs are the most attractive candidate biomarker because of their specificity for KSHV. However, a combination of viral microRNAs with cellular microRNA biomarkers is even more useful, as it may help differentiate among stages of KS progression or response to therapy and as it can identify cellular microRNAs that are common among KS and other cancers. We previously determined the cellular and viral miRNA profile in KS tumor biopsies as well as in PEL and found that the expression of viral miRNAs varies with disease state <xref rid="ppat.1003484-OHara1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-OHara2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-OHara3" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. In addition to the viral miRNAs, key cellular miRNAs are involved in KSHV transformation and KS progression <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Hansen1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Lei1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Bellare1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Cai1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>.</p>
              <p>The detection of circulating miRNAs in plasma, serum and other bodily fluids suggests their utility as minimally invasive biomarkers for cancer diagnostics <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Moltzahn1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Fan1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Hunter1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Kroh1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Mitchell1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. These circulating miRNAs are unusually stable (i) due to their packaging in microvesicles or exosomes, (ii) due to their RNA folding and size and/or (iii) due to their presence in Ago-containing ribonucleic acid:protein (RNP) complexes <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Hunter1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Mitchell1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Arroyo1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Turchinovich1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. At this point it is unclear which of these mechanisms is the most efficient. Evidence suggests that all three mechanisms contribute to diagnostic utility by increasing miRNA stability. There are a variety of vesicles that are secreted from cells, each with slightly varying content and surface marker composition. Microvesicles can range in size from 30 nm–1000 nm and each follow different pathways of biogenesis (reviewed in <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Meckes1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Thery1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>). Recent studies have additionally shown that microvesicles from tumor cells may have altered morphology, size and surface markers, including the expression of tumor antigens compared to microvesicles that are released from non-tumor cells <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Cho2" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Wolfers1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Yang2" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. MiRNAs have been detected in microvesicles, exosomes and/or nanovesicles. This study refers to these vesicles collectively as exosomes based on common surface marker expression and morphological characteristics.</p>
              <p>Transfer of exosomes and their contents from tumor cells to surrounding, uninfected cells may be an important form of cellular communication and has been demonstrated in cell culture models, for instance in EBV-associated cancers <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Meckes2" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Pegtel1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Additionally, exosomes may provide a means of paracrine signaling from virally infected cells to adjacent, non-permissive cells <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Dreux1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. This study attempts to bridge the gap between clinical samples and cell culture models. To do so we compared the detailed, circulating miRNome of KS in clinical human samples and in KS mouse models <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Staudt1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-An1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Sin1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. This confirms the presence of circulating KS and KSHV-specific miRNAs <italic>in vivo</italic> in the context of KSHV infection. Multiple KSHV miRNAs and members of the miR-17-92 cluster of cellular miRNAs were detected within patient exosomes. These circulating miRNA signatures may serve as a new mechanism of paracrine signaling for mediating KSHV pathogenesis and may represent a reservoir for novel biomarkers.</p>

                <title>Clinical samples and mouse models of KSHV-associated malignancies</title>
                <p>To date, most studies on viral exosomes have used tissue culture models of infection. To expand on these studies, we utilized a series of clinical samples and two novel robust mouse models of KSHV pathogenesis <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Staudt1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-An1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Sin1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. The sample groups and number of samples included in each group are outlined in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003484.s018">Table S1</xref>. Briefly, human plasma from healthy, KSHV-negative controls or from AIDS patients with either KS or a non-KS malignancy was used to isolate exosomes. The HIV viral load and CD4+ T cell counts were similar in both KS and non-KS malignancy groups (data not shown). KS tumor biopsies and primary PEL pleural fluid were also included and served as positive controls for the presence of KSHV compared to control human plasma. We also used two mouse models previously characterized in our lab <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Staudt1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-An1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Sin1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>: the 801 latency locus transgenic mouse model which expresses all viral miRNAs in B cells <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Sin2" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>; and a xenograft model using TIVE L1 tumor cells, which maintain KSHV <xref rid="ppat.1003484-An1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. These cells are xenografted into SCID mice, which results in robust and reproducible tumor formation <xref rid="ppat.1003484-An1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. H&amp;E staining revealed similar phenotypes of KS and our TIVE xenograft mouse model while both of these differed from the staining observed in PEL (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003484.s002">Figure S2</xref>).</p>
                <p>The KSHV-TIVE model <xref rid="ppat.1003484-An1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref> represents another instance of extended yet incomplete KSHV lytic transcription, as recently demonstrated in KSHV-infected lymphatic endothelial cell cultures under puromycin selection <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Chang1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref> and previously in KSHV-infected mouse endothelial cells <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Mutlu1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. Similarly, a KSHV cell line model of transformed rat mesenchymal precursors yields some lytic gene expression but with minimal amounts of virions produced <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Jones1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. The KSHV-TIVE endothelial cell model maintains KSHV in the absence of selection and like other long-term KSHV-infected endothelial cell cultures they remain tightly latent. Neither sodium butyrate nor exogenously provided RTA/Orf50 are able to induce infectious virus production (R.Renne, personal communication) or complete, genome-wide lytic transcription in TIVE L1 cells <xref rid="ppat.1003484-An1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. Subcutaneous implantation into mice can activate many viral genes, although these represent only approximately half of the genes turned on during lytic reactivation in PEL cells and are insufficient to produce infectious virions. A similar, abortive lytic expression profile has been observed in KSHV-infected human TIVE-L1 cells <xref rid="ppat.1003484-An1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref> as well as in KSHV-infected mouse and rat endothelial cells <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Mutlu1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Jones1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. This incomplete transcription program is incompatible with virion production and in the case of KSHV-infected LEC has been termed a novel latency program <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Chang1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. For this reason, we refer to the TIVE xenograft mouse model as a latent KSHV model due to the lack of virions produced.</p>

Agilent RNA analysis showed that exosomes expressed small RNAs but lacked both 18S and 28S ribosomal RNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003484.s003">Figure S3</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003484-g001">Figure 1</xref> shows the distribution of miRNAs in different sample subsets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003484-g001">Figure 1B–E</xref>). Each boxplot shows the expression levels for the different sample groups. The expression of individual microRNAs are denoted by solid circles. As demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003484-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, the majority of miRNAs present in control human plasma (KSHV−) in the supernatant fraction are susceptible to RNase, representing free, circulating miRNAs. These miRNAs are likely not encapsulated in Ago-RNP complexes nor microvesicles <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Arroyo1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. The exceptions were miRNAs miR-16, miR-195 and miR-197, which could be detected despite RNase treatment. This RNase resistance of these particular miRNAs is consistent with prior observations <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Arroyo1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Levels of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> cel-mir-39 spike-in were abolished ∼16,000-fold after RNase treatment and were decreased when incubated with pleural fluid prior to RNA isolation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003484.s004">Figure S4</xref>).

MiRNAs are readily detected in all sample types tested including tumor biopsies and exosomes from control plasma or serum and malignant effusions such as pleural fluid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003484-g001">Figure 1E</xref>), though the miRNA yield was highest in tumor tissue. Although we used human plasma and serum from mice in the majority of experiments, we also performed miRNA profiling with control mouse plasma. Importantly, we did not observe significant differences in the levels of miRNAs found in plasma versus serum in this study. The comparison of this small subset of miRNAs across the different variables shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003484-g001">Figure 1B–E</xref> did not afford us the statistical power to identify differences among individual miRNAs expressed in these samples.

Enriched exosomes from the Exoquick protocol revealed similar structures via electron microscopy compared to exosomes enriched by differential ultracentrifugation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003484-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). However, while Exoquick samples did contain exosomes (determined by size and morphological characteristics), they yielded images with high background by electron microscopy due to the crowding agent present in the ExoQuick solution. This background was not due to contaminating cellular debris, as high-speed centrifugation and elimination of cellular debris using a sucrose cushion failed to eliminate background in the EM images (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003484.s005">Figure S5</xref>). By comparison, differential ultracentrifugation yielded exosomes of similar size and morphology with minimal background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003484-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Patient pleural fluid and BCBL1 cell supernatant yielded exosomes that appeared similar by EM.

The increased expression observed in the mouse samples most likely reflects the ratio of input used to the total fluid volume present in human and mouse.

                <title>KSHV miRNAs are detectable in the exosome-enriched fraction</title>
                <p>Increased expression of KSHV miRNAs correlates with disease state and tumor progression in endothelial cells <xref rid="ppat.1003484-OHara1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-OHara3" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. EBV viral miRNAs have been detected in exosomes isolated from cultured lymphoma cell lines, NPC patients and xenografted mice <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Meckes2" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Pegtel1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, but thus far it has not been shown that KSHV miRNAs are also loaded into exosomes. To address this question, we examined patient-derived exosomes for the presence of KSHV-encoded miRNAs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003484-g002">Figure 2I</xref> shows the qPCR products separated by size on a Caliper nanofluidics platform. Exosomes derived from serum of three independent KSHV-positive TIVE L1 xenograft tumor mice and PEL fluid contained KSHV miR-K2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003484-g002">Figure 2I</xref>). Total RNA from KSHV-positive latently-infected BCP-1 PEL cells were used as a positive control. KSHV miRs K12-4-5p, K12-4-3p, K12-5, K12-6-5p, K12-10a and K12-11 were also detected in pleural fluid and xenograft tumor mice (data not shown). KSHV miRNAs were undetectable in the KSHV-negative BJAB cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003484-g002">Figure 2I</xref>). This shows that systemically circulating exosomes contain appreciable levels of mature KSHV miRNAs and therefore exosomes containing KSHV miRNAs can travel from the subcutaneous tumor graft into the bloodstream and are stable enough to circulate systemically. Since we harvested the blood at day 10–15 after tumor cell injection, this result is likely to reflect steady-state levels of exosomal miRNAs. Notably, the L1 TIVE xenograft model does not generate infectious virus <xref rid="ppat.1003484-An1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. Hence, exosome encapsulated KSHV miRNAs show promise as a highly sensitive marker for latent KSHV tumor cells.</p>
                <p>In order to study exosome-associated viral miRNAs in more detail, we used the BCBL1 PEL cell line to assess KSHV miRNA expression. We found that 14 out of 14 KSHV microRNAs tested were expressed at detectable levels in exosomes from latent BCBL1 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003484.s007">Figure S7</xref>). Methods for purifying virions and exosomes can lead to co-precipitating of both exosomes and virions, therefore making it difficult to physically separate them for analysis. To distinguish the source of these viral miRNAs as exosomal or virion-associated, we purified exosomes using three different techniques. In addition to using the ExoQuick method of purification, we also utilized differential ultracentrifugation and a new bead affinity purification technique that positively selects for CD63+ exosomes, an exosomal marker not present on KSHV virions. Expression of KSHV microRNAs was then assessed following enrichment of exosomes using either method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003484-g003">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003484.s007">Figure S7</xref>). In addition, we passed the samples through a 0.2 µm filter prior to exosome isolation but after the removal of cellular debris. Although KSHV virions are approximately 180 nm in size, they tend to aggregate, a phenomenon well-recognized in earlier studies studying infectivity of cell-free virus <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Myoung1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Renne1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Sakurada1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>. This aggregation of virions makes it difficult to clear even a 0.2 µm filter. This was experimentally confirmed by filtering concentrated KSHV stocks, which resulted in a decrease in titer of approximately 4 logs (data not shown). Exosomes, however, which range in size from 30–100 nm, can easily pass through a 0.2 µm filter, as is evident from EM imaging of filtered patient-derived exosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003484-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Consistent with this, the expression levels of KSHV miRNAs were only slightly affected by filtering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003484-g003">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003484.s007">Figure S7</xref>). By contrast, filtering of exosome samples resulted in a dramatic decrease in viral load (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003484-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). We observed similar expression patterns of viral miRNAs in exosomes isolated and filtered following both ExoQuick and ultracentrifugation methods. This was confirmed by Caliper gel electrophoresis, which showed the presence of KSHV miRNA products in both the exosome and filtered exosome fractions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003484.s007">Figure S7</xref>). A lower shifted band corresponding to primer dimers was detected in the no template control reactions. Note also that the Caliper images represent non-quantitative accumulation of product after 55 cycles, whereas quantification was based on the exponential phase of the PCR reaction.</p>

                <p>Using the CD63+ exosome isolation method, we consistently observed expression of KSHV miRNAs regardless of filtration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003484-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). The levels of viral miRNAs were not significantly different in exosome preparations from latent or lytically induced PEL cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003484-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). If these miRNAs were predominantly present within virions, we would expect a robust increase in viral miRNA levels concomitantly with increased virion production following reactivation as we observed for KSHV load (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003484-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Furthermore, RNase treatment of samples slightly decreased viral miRNA levels in the CD63− supernatant but did not affect KSHV miRNA expression in CD63+ fractions, suggesting that these miRNAs are primarily protected within exosomes (data not shown). Analysis of exosomes isolated by CD63 affinity capture confirmed the presence of CD9, another well established exosomal marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003484-g003">Figure 3F</xref>). CD9 levels were unaffected by filtering samples and RNase treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003484-g003">Figure 3F</xref>). Taken together, this demonstrates that the KSHV miRNAs are predominantly contained within exosomes released from latently-infected tumor cells.</p>

                <title>Analysis of viral load in exosome-enriched samples</title>
                <p>Having determined that viral miRNAs were present in exosomes, we next sought to analyze the distribution of KSHV DNA among our samples and biochemical fractions. There are two mechanisms that lead to KSHV viral DNA being detectable in body fluids: (i) virions <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Lin1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>, (ii) tumor cell-released free viral DNA, as has been demonstrated for EBV <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Lechowicz1" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Lei2" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Lei3" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Lit1" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>. To eliminate the contribution of cell-free viral DNA, we treated all samples with DNase prior to DNA isolation. We evaluated BCBL1-derived exosomes purified using different techniques for the presence of KSHV DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003484-g003">Figure 3B, C</xref>). Exosome-enriched samples were passed through a 0.2 µm filter, which led to a drastic decrease in KSHV load using both purified virus stock and exosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003484-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, data not shown). Although the viral load increased following reactivation, filtering of exosomes from lytic BCBL1 cells abolished viral load to approximately the limit of detection. DNase treatment of samples, which effectively eliminated freely circulating tumor-associated DNA, further decreased KSHV load in filtered fractions (data not shown).</p>
                <p>We also compared the presence of viral DNA in exosome and supernatant fractions of samples enriched by CD63 bead affinity purification or differential centrifugation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003484-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Viral DNA was detected in the exosome-depleted supernatant fraction (CD63−) after bead affinity purification but was undetectable in the CD63+ exosome fraction. Conversely, viral DNA was enriched in the exosome pellet following differential ultracentrifugation, as both virions and exosomes sediment at similar densities during centrifugation. This establishes CD63-based affinity capture as an efficient way to separate exosomes and virions. Since we detected KSHV miRNAs, but not KSHV DNA in the CD63-affinity purified exosomes, this suggests that the primary source of the viral miRNAs we observe is exosomes rather than virions.</p>
                <p>We also evaluated viral load in exosomes purified using the ExoQuick method. The advantage of the ExoQuick method compared to CD63 capture is greater efficiency (using only 250 µl as input), which is essential when profiling large numbers of clinical samples. We found KSHV DNA in both exosomal and free supernatant fractions of plasma and pleural fluid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003484-g003">Figure 3D,E</xref>). The highest viral load was found in exosomes derived from PEL pleural fluid. No viral DNA was detected in our negative control samples or in exosomes purified from non-KS, HIV+ patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003484-g003">Figure 3D, 3E</xref> lanes CHP and AMT respectively). Both ExoQuick and ultracentrifugation methods yielded KSHV DNA in the KS patient plasma and PEL fluid exosome fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003484-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Thus, neither differential centrifugation not ExoQuick can with certainty be used to separate exosomes from virion particles. However, CD63+ exosomes contain little KSHV DNA, especially following filtering of exosome samples. This novel method confirms that the majority of the signal detected in the viral load assay was due to free DNA and KSHV virion DNA.</p>

                <title>KSHV protein and virions are not detected in exosome-enriched samples</title>
                <p>To further address the possibility that virions may also be present in our exosome fraction and may contribute to our results, we looked for KSHV virions and viral proteins in our exosome-enriched samples. We did not detect any virions by EM following ExoQuick or ultracentrifugation isolation of exosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003484-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). We analyzed more than 20 grids for the presence of virions in our exosome-enriched samples. Quantitative analysis of exosome-enriched pellets by differential centrifugation revealed 2,319 exosomes and no virions on three sample grids. The supernatant fraction was also imaged by EM for the presence of exosomes and only 13 exosomes were detected, validating ultracentrifugation as an efficient method for exosome isolation. We also compared the number of exosomes from latent and lytic BCBL1 cell supernatants by EM. Both latent and lytic samples had similar numbers of exosomes detected on representative grids, averaging 135 and 126, respectively (while the DNase resistant viral load differed by &gt;10-fold). This suggests that the presence of exosomes in our samples may be static and independent of virus production.</p>
                <p>Finally, we probed exosome-enriched samples for KSHV structural proteins. KSHV K8.1 was readily detected in BCBL1 PEL cells following lytic reactivation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003484.s008">Figure S8</xref>). However, PF-derived exosomes, which contained the highest viral load of our samples, did not express K8.1. These data confirm that our exosome-enriched samples do not contain appreciable levels of KSHV virions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003484.s007">Figures S7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003484.s008">S8</xref>). Although KSHV protein and DNA are not found in exosomes, we find systemically circulating KSHV miRNAs in exosomes derived from patients, tissue culture models and mouse models of KS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003484-g002">Figure 2I</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003484.s007">Figures S7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003484.s008">S8</xref>). This establishes exosome-associated viral miRNAs as new biomarkers for KSHV-associated cancers. It also suggests that detecting viral miRNAs may offer greater sensitivity of diagnosing viral infection than viral load measurements.</p>

                <title>miRNA profiling reveals distinct oncomiR and exosome signatures</title>
                <p>To obtain a more complete picture, we profiled the host miRNA repertoire in each of our sample groups using both exosomal and exosome-depleted supernatant preparations. The <italic>C. elegans</italic> cel-mir-39 spike-in was used as an internal normalizing control. Unsupervised clustering analysis revealed two distinct clusters, which are shown as projected onto the first three principal components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003484-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Unsupervised clustering groups samples and the different miRNAs based on similar expression levels. The result is typically shown as a heatmap. Principal component analysis is used to reduce the complexity of the data further without loss of statistical power. It combines the multiple measurements of each sample (or each miRNA) to such that the data can be represented in three dimensions (the principal component axes). Individual analysis of the human and mouse profiling samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003484-g004">Figures 4B,C</xref>) illustrates the more divergent clusters representing miRNAs elevated in tumor versus control samples in the mouse model. We expected to see more defined clusters in our mouse models since the xenografts represent biological replicates with limited variability compared with human clinical samples. The miRNA profile in the human samples alone clearly separated samples into KSHV-associated and control groups.</p>

                    <p>Profiling of miRNAs led to the discovery of distinct signatures for oncomiRs and exosome subsets. Cluster separation of miRNA expression by principal component analysis (PCA) of (A) all miRNAs profiled, (B) human samples, (C) mouse samples and (D) oncogenic miRNAs in human samples. MiRNAs were clustered by their levels of expression to reveal two distinct clusters of expression patterns: one with generally high expression in KS and PEL samples (purple, cluster 1) and one with high expression in another subset of samples specific to a control, malignancy or exosome-specific (shown in yellow, cluster 2). Each solid circle represents one microRNA and lines are drawn from each point to the centroid or mean position of points in a given cluster. This centralized point allows for the largest difference between clusters and minimizes the distance of points within a given cluster to the centroid. Heatmaps reflective of unsupervised clustering analysis are shown for oncomirs in (E) mouse and (F) human samples.

                <p>We further examined the expression of individual oncomirs and tumor suppressor miRNAs in the mouse exosome subset by heatmap analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003484-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). Oncomirs were defined as host miRNAs readily studied for their role in tumorigenesis and related cancer signaling pathways while tumor suppressor miRNAs have been demonstrated to functionally inhibit these processes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003484.s019">Table S2</xref>). We identified this subset of oncogenic miRNAs because (a) we previously extensively validated these assays <xref rid="ppat.1003484-OHara1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-OHara2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Chugh2" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref> and (b) they represent miRNAs with experimentally verified expression and function. The most distinct expression pattern was the apparent separation between TIVE xenograft and control mouse serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003484-g004">Figure 4E</xref>, Panel i). The majority of oncomiRs in this cluster were increased in exosomes from KS xenograft tumor models and were only minimally or not detectable in the control mice (ctrl versus xeno). We next compared miRNA expression profiles of control and xenograft mice to our latency locus transgenic mouse model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003484-g004">Figure 4E</xref>, Panel ii). In this novel model, only the KSHV latent genes and miRNAs are expressed in B cells <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Sin2" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. However, none of the viral structural genes are present. We found that exosomes derived from the transgenic model differed from that of control mice and shared some oncogenic miRNA expression with the xenograft mice. As this transgenic mouse model phenotype represents B cell hyperplasia, these highly expressed miRNAs may be reflective of change in the miRNome regulated by the KSHV latency locus prior to tumor formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003484-g004">Figure 4E</xref>).</p>
                <p>We further compared the exosomal miRNA profile of transgenic mice to that of PEL-associated exosomes from primary pleural fluid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003484-g004">Figure 4E</xref>, panels iii, iv). This yielded similarities in induced exosomal oncogenic miRNA expression between the 801 transgenic mouse model and PEL patient fluid (Panel iii, Cluster 1). Interestingly, we also identified a subset of microRNAs that was solely induced in the KSHV latency locus transgenic mouse model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003484-g004">Figure 4E</xref>, Panel iv, Cluster 2). <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003484.s009">Figure S9</xref> further compares the exosomal miRNA profile in an independent set of transgenic and control mice and indicates elevated levels of oncogenic miRNA expression in the transgenic mouse model.</p>
                <p>Analysis of miRNA profiles in both Clusters 1 and 2 also revealed a subset of oncogenic miRNAs that were exclusively expressed in exosomes, suggesting that these miRNAs may be preferentially incorporated from the tumor site into exosomes for intercellular communication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003484-g004">Figure 4E</xref>, Panels iii,iv, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003484.s010">Figure S10</xref>). Taken together, we find that the most elevated oncomiR levels in exosomes were observed in the TIVE xenograft tumor group, as these mice were bearing large, well-vascularized tumors, which facilitates expression and release of miRNAs. This demonstrates for the first time that exosomal miRNAs, including KSHV miRNAs, can be detected in mouse models of KS.</p>
                <p>Our human clinical samples of AIDS-KS recapitulated the trends in oncogenic miRNA expression observed in our mouse models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003484-g004">Figure 4F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003484.s011">Figure S11</xref>). Cluster 1 represents a subset of oncogenic miRNAs that are most highly expressed in exosomes derived from PEL pleural fluid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003484-g004">Figure 4F</xref>). Several miRNAs in this cluster were also elevated in KS patient-derived exosomes. This pattern of miRNA expression may reflect a signature of KSHV-associated malignancies. A subset of miRNAs within this cluster could also represent miRNAs overexpressed in KS and other cancers since we observed oncogenic miRNA induction in other AIDS malignancies as well as KS-associated exosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003484-g004">Figure 4F</xref>). Cluster 2 shows another subset of miRNAs with elevated expression in exosomes from KS or AIDS malignancy patients. This cluster also includes several miRNAs that seem to be preferentially expressed within exosomes compared to the supernatant fraction.</p>
                <p>We noticed little difference in the miRNA profile from control plasma exosomes versus RNase-treated control plasma exosomes, indicating that exosomes are indeed resistant to RNase treatment <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Arroyo1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003484-g004">Figure 4F</xref>, lanes CHP exo and RNase-CHP exo). We also compared the miRNA profile in pleural fluid-derived exosomes exposed to RNase to determine if they responded similarly to our exosomes from control human plasma. Exosomes from PEL patient pleural fluid exhibited higher levels of miRNA expression. RNase treatment only slightly changed the miRNA profile, similar to that observed in control exosomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003484.s012">Figure S12</xref>). This demonstrates that different patient samples respond similarly to RNase treatment and further validates that the majority of our signal was derived from exosome-contained miRNAs.</p>
                <p>Since patient samples may display a high degree of genetic variability and therefore miRNA signatures could differ, we sought to address the issue of individual variance of patient miRNA profiles using three PEL patients. Pleural fluid-derived exosomes were independently isolated and the miRNA expression profile was compared to that of control human exosomes. Many of the “PEL signature” miRNAs were expressed in all three patients, suggesting that these could be used as novel biomarkers of PEL present in pleural fluid (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003484.s013">Figure S13</xref>). Another subset of miRNAs was expressed in 2 out of 3 patients. Since PEL is a rare malignancy, we obtained only three patients, each of varying disease states. Different factors such as disease state, co-infection with EBV or HIV status could contribute to absence of these biomarkers in one of the patients. However, despite the inherent genetic variability among patients, we could identify multiple miRNAs that were expressed at high levels in all three PEL patients compared to controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003484.s013">Figure S13</xref>).</p>

                <title>Analysis of oncomiRs, the miR-17-92 cluster miRNAs and exosomal miRNA subsets</title>
                <p>We further analyzed the expression of the oncomiR cluster in the exosome sample subsets. For this analysis, we defined a relative expression score based on the CT where a higher expression score corresponds to a lower CT. Specifically, we calculate the expression class by binning CTs such that a CT of 20–25 corresponds to an expression value of 3. MicroRNAs expressed with CTs of 25–30 are assigned an expression value of 2.5. Scores are assigned in 0.5 increments until CT of 45+ equals zero, or not detected. In addition to patient-derived exosomes, we determined the miRNA profile for KS biopsies and PBMCs derived from control human plasma. The full profiling data is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003484.s014">Figure S14</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003484-g005">Figure 5A</xref> demonstrates that, as expected, KS biopsies (KS, left) displayed the highest expression of oncomirs. By comparison, a large number of oncomirs were undetectable (expression score = 0) in biofluids. KS-associated exosomes also contained oncomirs in moderate (expression score = 1) and some at very high levels (expression score = 2). While oncomiRs are readily expressed in both control and malignant samples, we found that the number of highly expressed oncogenic miRNAs was lower in control exosomes (Neg). Note that members of the miR-17–92 cluster are denoted by blue dots and are highly expressed in KS biopsies and KS-associated exosomes compared with controls (expression score&gt;1.5). The levels of oncogenic miRNAs were abolished in exosome-depleted supernatant fractions treated with RNase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003484-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). The exceptions were miRNAs including miR-16, miR-195 and miR-197, which were previously shown to be RNase-resistant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003484-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Arroyo1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>). This demonstrates that most oncogenic miRNAs were present in exosomes. Oncomirs specifically expressed in tumor samples at the highest expression level included miR-106a, miR-17, miR-454, let-7e, miR-451, miR-886-5p, miR-601 and miR-625 (expression score of ≥2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003484-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Note, that a high expression score is the result of both the underlying high level of expression of the specific miRNA species and the sensitivity of the particular qPCR assay.</p>

                <p>One of the most well-studied oncogenic miRNA clusters is the miR-17-92 cluster. The 6 mature miRNA species in this cluster tend to be co-regulated <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Mendell1" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref> and we previously found this miR cluster upregulated in KS <xref rid="ppat.1003484-OHara1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-OHara2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Members of the paralog cluster miR-106b/25 are also well-known for their role in tumorigenesis and share target genes with the miR-17-92 cluster <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Poliseno1" ref-type="bibr">[70]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Smith1" ref-type="bibr">[71]</xref>. We therefore investigated whether KS-associated exosomes contained members of these two miRNA clusters. In our clinical and mouse model samples, levels of the miR-17-92 and miR-106b/25 clusters were induced in exosomes derived from KSHV-associated mouse serum, primary human pleural fluid and KS biopsies compared with control exosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003484-g005">Figure 5B, C</xref>). Since we did not observe a similar enrichment of all tumor-associated miRNAs within the exosomes, these miR-17-92 members are likely to be preferentially incorporated into exosomes. Members of these oncogenic clusters were slightly elevated in exosomes from KS patient plasma, although this was not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003484-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). However, exosomes derived from pleural fluid expressed much higher levels of the miR-17-92 and miR-106b-25 cluster members, with the exception of miR-25 and miR-92a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003484-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). The increased expression of oncogenic miRNAs within PF-derived exosomes may be because of direct contact of the pleural fluid to PEL cells, suggesting that malignant effusions may be a very effective source for obtaining exosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003484-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). Induction of the miR-17-92 cluster member miRNAs was most pronounced when we compared exosomes derived from the xenograft mouse model to control mouse exosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003484-g005">Figure 5C</xref>, p≤.000059). Therefore, we find that exosome-associated oncomirs are uniquely upregulated in samples from KS tumor-bearing animals and primary PEL patients. Interestingly, even the B cell hyperplasia latency locus transgenic mouse model showed increased levels of these miRNAs in systemically circulating exosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003484-g005">Figure 5C</xref>, p≤0.05).</p>
                <p>Several miRNAs seemed to be preferentially incorporated into exosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003484-g004">Figure 4E,F</xref>). Therefore, we analyzed these in detail. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003484-g005">Figure 5D</xref>, miRNAs miR-19a, miR-21, miR-27a, miR-130 and miR-146a were enriched within exosomes and virtually undetectable as free, circulating miRNAs in the supernatant. Their relative expression levels were significantly elevated in mouse models of KS (p≤4×10<sup>−5</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003484-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). To confirm these results, we performed Caliper gel electrophoresis analysis on the qPCR products, which confirmed that these miRNAs were overexpressed in exosomes from our transgenic and TIVE xenograft mouse models (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003484.s015">Figure S15</xref>). Taken together, these data reveal that members of the miR-17-92 cluster are exclusively incorporated into exosomes and may exhibit diagnostic potential and contribute to tumor development and pathogenesis of malignancies such as KS.</p>

                <title>GO pathway analysis of oncomir targets</title>
                <p>To gauge the importance of the KS exosome signatures, we analyzed the oncogenic miRNAs upregulated in tumor-derived exosomes using Gene Ontology pathway analysis and found that many of the miRNAs targeted pathways previously shown to be central to KSHV pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003484-t001">Table 1</xref>; asterisks). PI3K/Akt signaling is central to “Pathways in Cancer”, which had the highest correlation to upregulated miRNAs. It is known to be dysregulated following KSHV infection <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Bhatt1" ref-type="bibr">[73]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Roy1" ref-type="bibr">[74]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[75]</xref>. Many of the other pathways listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003484-t001">Table 1</xref> contribute to both the KEGG Pathways in Cancer and the Pancreatic Cancer pathway. For instance, MAPK is important in the control of replication and KSHV reactivation from latency while KSHV inhibits TGF-beta signaling through mechanisms including miRNA-targeted silencing <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Xie1" ref-type="bibr">[76]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[77]</xref>. KSHV LANA has been shown to bind GSK3-beta, leading to an upregulation of beta catenin in KS and PEL through the regulation of Wnt signaling <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Fujimuro1" ref-type="bibr">[78]</xref>. TLR signaling has previously been shown to play a role in both primary infection of monocytes and reactivation from latency <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Gregory1" ref-type="bibr">[79]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-West1" ref-type="bibr">[80]</xref>. Finally, two of the pathway hits—focal adhesion and adherens junctions—are known to be important in viral entry, cytoskeletal remodeling and cell adhesion during KSHV infection and KS tumorigenesis including in adjacent KSHV-negative spindle cells within the KS lesion <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Mansouri1" ref-type="bibr">[81]</xref>.</p>
                <p>As control, we also analyzed the GO pathways associated with the miRNA signature of an unrelated virus (WNV). This confirmed that the roles of the signaling pathways were unique to our exosome profiling of KSHV-associated malignancies (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003484-t001">Table 1</xref>). We also performed GO pathway analysis using two additional, independent analysis databases: Panther and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003484.s021">Table S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003484.s022">S5</xref>). These revealed highly significant pathways targeted by oncomirs including angiogenesis, integrin signaling, transformation, migration and invasion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003484.s021">Tables S4</xref>, 5). Previous studies of the oncogenic miR-17-92 cluster have also revealed roles in similar pathways such as NFkB signaling, angiogenesis, TLR, MAPK, STAT and TGF-beta signaling <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Mendell1" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[82]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Mestdagh1" ref-type="bibr">[83]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-OeztuerkWinder1" ref-type="bibr">[84]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Petrocca1" ref-type="bibr">[85]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Wang2" ref-type="bibr">[86]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Philippe1" ref-type="bibr">[87]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Yin1" ref-type="bibr">[88]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Yin2" ref-type="bibr">[89]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Brock1" ref-type="bibr">[90]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Trenkmann1" ref-type="bibr">[91]</xref>. Since many of the GO analysis pathway hits have been previously functionally validated, it is likely that some of the exosomal miRNAs found overexpressed in this study contribute to KSHV signaling. One function that many of these pathways shared is the involvement in cell migration, which is important for tumorigenesis and noted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003484-t001">Table 1</xref>. We therefore used cell migration as a bioassay to show that our exosome-enriched samples yielded intact, functional exosomes.</p>

                <title>Treatment of hTERT-HUVECs with patient-derived exosomes enhances cell migration</title>
                <p>Since cell migration was a shared functional outcome of several of the gene ontology pathway hits, we sought to test the effect of KS and PEL-derived exosomes on the migration of endothelial cells. hTERT-immortalized HUVECs <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Wang3" ref-type="bibr">[92]</xref> were treated with exosomes isolated using the ExoQuick kit. Exosomes derived from patient PEL pleural fluid were added to cells for 24 hours and the wound healing scratch assay was performed to test the migration capability of these cells. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003484-g006">Figure 6A</xref> demonstrates that hTERT-HUVECs treated with patient-derived exosomes displayed enhanced cell migration by 8 hours post-initiation of the scratch assay. Cells treated with exosomes derived from control human plasma (CHP) showed delayed migration compared with cells receiving the exosomes derived from pleural fluid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003484-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). This confirms that this effect was not due to ExoQuick itself, since control exosomes isolated using this protocol did not increase migration. Since we also detected KSHV DNA in the supernatant fraction of pleural fluid and the presence of virions can also affect migration, we analyzed the migration capability of cells treated with exosome-depleted supernatant (PF sup). hTERT-HUVECs exposed to PF supernatant also displayed enhanced migration compared to control exosomes but cells treated with pleural fluid-derived exosomes still migrated more rapidly. As a positive control, we also treated hTERT-HUVECs with IL-6, which resulted in increased migration similar to that observed with the pleural fluid supernatant fraction (IL-6 versus PF sup). Of note, exosomes are known to carry proteins as well as miRNAs <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Meckes2" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. At this point, we cannot assign this exosome phenotype to either moiety. The data also suggests that while cytokines and virus present in the supernatant can affect cell migration, patient-derived exosomes further accelerate this process.</p>

Cells were then treated with patient pleural fluid-derived exosomes for 24 hours prior to beginning the scratch assay. (B) Scratch assay performed with annexin blocking of exosomes. Scratch assay images are shown at 0 h, 8 h and 16 h post-scratch at 100× magnification. CHP – control human plasma; PF Exo – pleural fluid exosomes; PF Sup – exosome-depleted pleural fluid supernatant; IL-6 – interleukin 6. (C) Box plots of scratch assay data. Cells treated with exosomes only are shown in red with the horizontal bar representing the mean of experiments for each group. Data for annexin blocking of exosomes is shown in blue. The closure index represents the amount of closure detected at 8 hours post-scratch for samples as compared to mock. (D) Dunnett confidence interval (CI) comparing each treatment to control human exosomes. Black circles represent the 95% CI for each sample, with parentheses denoting the range observed. Dotted grey line represents CHP compared to CHP as a baseline comparison. (E) Migration assay using the xCelligence system. hTERT-HUVECs were treated with exosomes for 24 hours and serum-starved for 6 hours. 30,000 cells were plated per well of an xCelligence CIM-Plate 16 (upper chamber) and FBS was used as a chemoattractant (lower chamber). Reads were taken every 2 minutes continuously for 24 hours. Data is shown as Cell Index and increased cell index reflects increased migration to the lower chamber. (F) Supernatants from the scratch assay (A, B) were assessed for levels of IL-6 (pg/ml) by ELISA.

                <p>Exosomes isolated from cell culture models and patients have been shown to express phosphatidylserine (PS) on their surface <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Thery1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Keller1" ref-type="bibr">[93]</xref>. Since Annexin V can bind PS on the surface, annexin blocking of exosomes has been previously used as a means of inhibiting exosome fusion and transfer of exosomal contents <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Meckes2" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Pegtel1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Keller1" ref-type="bibr">[93]</xref>. Therefore, we also performed the scratch assay in the presence of annexin blocking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003484-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). Exosomes and supernatants were incubated with Annexin prior to initiation of the scratch assay. Annexin blocking did not seem to affect the migration of hTERT-HUVECs treated with control (CHP) exosomes. However, the enhanced migration potential of cells treated with pleural fluid-derived exosomes was reversed with annexin blocking, demonstrating that this phenotype is due to exosomal transfer. Cells treated with exosome-depleted supernatants from pleural fluid were not affected by annexin blocking. Similarly, IL-6 enhanced cell migration regardless of annexin blocking. Therefore, any virus or cytokines present in this supernatant enhanced migration via a different mechanism independent of exosomes.</p>
                <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003484-g006">Figure 6C</xref> provides a boxplot representation of the scratch assay data. This confirms that cells treated with pleural fluid-derived exosomes exhibit increased migration, which is reversed by treatment with annexin. This is also observed following treatment of cells with exosomes derived from the PEL cell line BCBL1. We formally tested the individual contributions of each factor to the increased migration phenotype using a Dunnett confidence interval test which evaluates the significance of different treatments compared to a common control and adjusts for potential bias due to multiple comparisons being performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003484-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). As represented by the black circles (with brackets representing the 95% confidence interval (CI)), treatment with IL-6 or exosomes from either pleural fluid or PEL cells independently led to significantly increased closure of the wound compared to exosomes isolated from KSHV-negative control human plasma (CHP). By contrast exosome-free, mock treated cells behaved similarly to cells treated with exosomes from KSHV-negative CHP.</p>
                <p>All scratch assays were performed in triplicate for three independent biological replicates over a span of two weeks. In each biological replicate, we observed the same phenotype. <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003484-t002">Table 2</xref> shows the linear, multivariate analysis of the data, which measures the difference between two experimental conditions after adjusting for all other factors. Exosomes derived from pleural fluid of a PEL patient (p≤10<sup>−11</sup>) or from the BCBL1 PEL cell line (p≤10<sup>−7</sup>) significantly enhanced migration of hTERT-HUVECs at 8 hours post-infection compared to CHP (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003484-t002">Table 2b–d</xref>). When comparing the supernatant and exosome fractions of pleural fluid and PEL cell supernatants, exosomes were more potent (p≤0.031), but we still observed a significant effect on HUVEC migration for the supernatant (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003484-t002">Table 2j</xref>). This is not entirely unexpected, since supernatants from PEL patients and PEL cells have large amounts of soluble IL-6, IL-10 and VEGF <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Sin1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. Still exosomes independently confer an enhanced migration phenotype to hTERT-HUVECs. Annexin blocking of exosome fusion supports this (p≤10<sup>−7</sup>) and resulted in reversal of the enhanced migration effect of PEL-derived exosomes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003484-t002">Table 2k</xref>, columns b–d). This demonstrates that our purified exosomes have biological activity, and second that the KS and PEL patient-derived exosomes confer a phenotype of enhanced migration to endothelial cells, which is likely to contribute to KS-associated angiogenesis.</p>

                <p>We next analyzed migration of hTERT-HUVECs treated with exosomes using the xCelligence system, which allows for highly accurate, quantitative measurements of cell migration in real-time. The xCelligence Cell Invasion and Migration (CIM) Plate 16 consists of an upper and lower chamber separated by a microporous membrane coated with gold microelectrode sensors on the bottom side. As cells migrate toward the chemoattractant in the bottom chamber, the impedance signal increases and results in a corresponding increase in Cell Index (proprietary readout, Roche application note). hTERT-HUVECs were treated with patient-, cell line- or mouse model-derived exosomes. Cells were then serum starved and plated into the upper chamber of the CIM Plate. Migration towards the chemoattractant FBS was continuously monitored every two minutes for a period of 24 hours. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003484-g006">Figure 6E</xref> shows that hTERT-HUVECs treated with KSHV-associated exosomes exhibited increased migration compared with cells treated with exosomes from control human plasma (red). This assay independently demonstrates that exosomes from patient PEL fluid, the BCBL1 PEL cell line, and a xenograft mouse model of KS confer an enhanced migration phenotype to hTERT-HUVEC cells.</p>
                <p>Since IL-6 plays a significant role in KSHV pathogenesis, we analyzed the levels of IL-6 present in the scratch assay supernatants by ELISA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003484-g006">Figure 6F</xref>). hTERT-HUVECs treated with patient-derived exosomes secreted high levels of IL-6. IL6 secretion in response to exosome treatment was decreased when the exosome fraction was incubated with annexin V (p≤0.003). These experiments suggest that efficient exosome transfer drives enhanced cell migration, possibly through the increased induction of cytokines such as IL-6. Note, though, that these experiments did not distinguish between miRNA and protein components of the exosomes. In sum, the exosomal signature associated with KSHV-related malignancies could not only be a reservoir of clinically important diagnostic biomarkers but may also be a novel mechanism of paracrine signaling that mediates KSHV-associated pathogenesis and tumorigenesis.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Circulating miRNAs, especially those within exosomes, have emerged as novel biomarkers <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Hunter1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Kroh1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Andre1" ref-type="bibr">[94]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Li2" ref-type="bibr">[95]</xref>. Their main advantage is stability and ease of detection as all miRNAs can be profiled with a common platform. We previously established and validated such a miRNA profiling platform <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Chugh1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. Bodily fluids such as plasma can be obtained using minimally invasive techniques and lend themselves to repeat sampling, for instance to follow therapy. In the case of PEL, periodic (in extreme cases every few days) draining of pleural cavities is medically indicated.</p>
              <p>Although the exosomal miRNA profile of malignancies associated with EBV have been previously reported <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Meckes2" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Pegtel1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, this is the first study to examine the circulating miRNA profile of KSHV-associated cancers. This is also one of a few studies to compare patient tumors to xenograft mouse models <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Gourzones1" ref-type="bibr">[96]</xref>. We extend previous findings on exosomal miRNAs, which were largely based on cell culture models. KSHV-encoded miRNAs were detectable in systemically circulating exosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003484-g002">Figure 2I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003484-g003">Figure 3</xref>), including in xenograft mouse models of KS. This suggests that viral miRNAs can have effects far from the site of the infected cell. Furthermore, viral microRNAs could potentially serve as highly specific biomarkers of KSHV-associated malignancies, particularly if the lesions are internal and comprised of mostly latently infected cells. We found similar levels of viral miRNAs in exosomes derived from latently infected PEL cells compared to PEL cells undergoing lytic reactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003484-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Most KS tumor cells and most PEL are latently infected and even if lytic gene expression is observed in a subset of cells, virions are seldom produced <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Dittmer1" ref-type="bibr">[97]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Roy2" ref-type="bibr">[98]</xref>.</p>
              <p>A significant complication of characterizing exosomal miRNAs in virally associated diseases is that miRNAs may be incorporated into virions. Previous studies have shown that viral RNAs can be detected within herpesvirus virions, including KSHV and EBV <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Bechtel1" ref-type="bibr">[99]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Jochum1" ref-type="bibr">[100]</xref>. Recently, Lin et al. demonstrated the presence of viral, as well as cellular miRNAs in purified KSHV virions <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Lin1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>. Exosomes are difficult to physically separate from virions due to their similar sedimentation velocities, buoyant densities, biogenesis and heterogeneous nature of exosomes <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Meckes2" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Dreux1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. Others have circumvented this issue using cell culture models that are incapable of virus production, such as HCV subgenomic replicon (SGR) cells <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Dreux1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. Analogous to this model, we employed several latent models of KSHV infection, including the latently infected TIVE xenograft mice, the latency locus transgenic mice and the BCBL1 latent PEL cell line <xref rid="ppat.1003484-An1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Sin2" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. We believe that the majority of miRNAs we detect here are exosomal, rather than virion-associated. To support this interpretation, we offer three lines of evidence.</p>
              <p>First, we were able to detect all viral miRNAs in latent BCBL1 exosomes and filtering samples led to decreased viral load but did not significantly affect levels of KSHV miRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003484-g003">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003484.s007">Figure S7</xref>). We detected similar amounts of KSHV miRNAs in exosomes isolated from latent PEL supernatant as in exosomes from supernatant of induced PEL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003484-g003">Figure 3</xref>). In the same samples, we observed a greater than 10-fold increase in viral DNA. This suggests that KSHV miRNAs are released into exosomes from latently infected PEL, analogous to exosomal EBV miRNAs which are released from latently infected cells <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Meckes2" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Gourzones1" ref-type="bibr">[96]</xref>. Note, that we are able to detect KSHV miRNAs in exosomes from 250 µl of latently infected cell supernatant, whereas at least 500 mls were previously used to enrich for virion-associated miRNAs <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Lin1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>. We could also detect KSHV miRNAs in the bloodstream of mice, which carry KSHV latently-infected TIVE-E1/L1 xenografts. These cells do not generate infectious virions <xref rid="ppat.1003484-An1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref> and (R. Renne, personal communication).</p>
              <p>Second, we were able to isolate exosomes by CD63-mediated affinity purification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003484-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Herpesvirus virions and exosomes co-purify in almost all centrifugation schemas designed to enrich for exosomal fractions (i.e. differential ultracentrifugation, sucrose gradients, ExoQuick solution). By contrast, anti-CD63 Dynabeads positively select exosomes which carry CD63 as one of their surface markers <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Mathivanan1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Caby1" ref-type="bibr">[101]</xref> while CD63(−) virions are eliminated. This resulted in an enrichment of KSHV miRNAs and concomitant depletion of viral DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003484-g003">Figure 3</xref>), demonstrating that indeed viral miRNAs are present in exosomes. We were also unable to detect any contaminating virions in our samples enriched for exosomes by electron microscopy and structural viral proteins were absent in our exosome-enriched samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003484-g002">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003484.s008">Figure S8</xref>).</p>
              <p>Thirdly, KSHV miRNAs could be detected in exosomes isolated from the serum of our xenograft mouse model. These xenograft mice harbor latently infected cells, which do not generate infectious virus. This suggests that viral miRNAs are constantly released and circulate systemically in exosomes in mice (and patients) who harbor KSHV latently infected cells. Taken together, these data suggest that KSHV latently infected cells can release viral miRNAs and further demonstrates that exosomes are the source of these circulating miRNAs.</p>
              <p>Human oncogenic miRNAs were easily detected in tumor-derived exosomes isolated from patient plasma and pleural fluid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003484-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Further analysis confirmed increased levels of the well-studied miR-17-92 cluster miRNAs. Our data also show potentially important similarities and differences in the miRNA profile from AIDS patients with KS compared to patients with other non-viral AIDS-associated malignancies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003484-g004">Figure 4F</xref>). This subset of exosomal miRNAs could reflect differences between the varying progression of different malignancies in AIDS patients or similarities among AIDS-associated cancers and merits further study. Exosomal miRNAs are readily detected in pleural fluid samples, representing an alternate sample source with potentially higher correlation to disease state for patients with malignant effusions. Since pleural fluid is more proximal to the tumor site than plasma, which circulates throughout the body, we reason that the circulating miRNome from malignant effusions may be more reflective of the tumor itself. However, further studies comparing the miRNA signatures of pleural fluid-derived exosomes from PEL and other non-KSHV-associated malignancies such as lung cancer are necessary to reveal diagnostic biomarkers unique to PEL.</p>
              <p>We also demonstrated that human and viral miRNAs are present in circulating exosomes in xenografted mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003484-g002">Figures 2</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003484-g004">4</xref>). We used the TIVE L1 <xref rid="ppat.1003484-An1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref> xenograft model, which has been shown to be predictive of anti-KS therapies <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Roy2" ref-type="bibr">[98]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[102]</xref>. The KSHV miRNAs that we consistently detected in these mouse models could only stem from the human graft. Due to the high conservation of cellular miRNAs within the oncogenic clusters, the cross-species detection of miRNAs using the human assays makes it difficult to distinguish miRNAs of human versus mouse origin in these models (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003484.s020">Table S3</xref>, ABI product information, miRBase). In some cases, the mature miRNAs share 100% sequence homology across the entire length, not just the seed region (miRBase, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-GriffithsJones1" ref-type="bibr">[103]</xref>) and in many cases the targets have co-evolved as well <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Mendell1" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref>. We observed greater levels of miRNAs in the mouse exosomes compared to human exosomes, which may be due to the fixed 250 µl sample size with respect to the overall amount of blood circulating within a human (approximately 5 L) or mouse (approximately 0.0015 L).</p>
              <p>Specific host miRNA markers of tumorigenesis also emerged in our mouse models. We showed previously that host miRNAs are distinct for different stages of KS tumor progression <xref rid="ppat.1003484-OHara3" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Therefore, tumorigenic miRNAs combined with viral miRNAs would offer a very specific biomarker signature and may also identify biomarkers for other related cancers. Therefore, we analyzed expression of the oncogenic miR-17-92 and 106b/25 clusters and found that they were significantly enriched in exosomes from TIVE tumor-bearing mice compared with controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003484-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Several of the oncogenic miRNAs expressed in exosomes were previously found at highly expressed levels in the TIVE cell line independently (R. Renne, personal communication). The mir-17-92 cluster was previously shown to be upregulated in KS tumor biopsies <xref rid="ppat.1003484-OHara1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-OHara2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. This is the first demonstration that the miR-17-92 cluster miRNAs are incorporated into exosomes from KSHV-associated malignancies. These oncogenic miRNAs have also been detected in exosomes derived from leukemia cells and those derived from breast milk <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Umezu1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Admyre1" ref-type="bibr">[104]</xref>, suggesting that their function is at least in part to mediate paracrine phenotypes. Viral and cellular miRNAs originating from the tumor enter the mouse circulatory system and are readily detected in serum. Since our mouse model exosome signatures recapitulate the clinical KS signatures, this supports the validity of xenograft mice as a reliable model system for KS.</p>
              <p>We also observed a subset of miRNAs that were highly induced in exosomes and were virtually undetectable in the free, circulating miRNA fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003484-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). The miRNAs detected exclusively in the exosome fractions are either known to be oncogenic or shown to be upregulated by KSHV infection <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Punj1" ref-type="bibr">[105]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Medina1" ref-type="bibr">[106]</xref>. This suggests that certain miRNAs are preferentially incorporated into exosomes and that many proliferative and tumor-associated miRNAs fall into this class. Recently, Palma et al <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Palma1" ref-type="bibr">[107]</xref> found that selectively exported miRNAs from malignantly transformed cells may be incorporated into customized exosomal particles distinct from the microvesicles that originate from untransformed cells. It is conceivable that these have different systemic stability and thus become enriched in a blood sample. This may be the case with KSHV-induced miRNAs as well since we found miRNAs originating from our transgene model also to be enriched in this fraction.</p>
              <p>Exosomes serve as a means of intercellular communication with surrounding cells and the contents of exosomes can be shared between cells through the mechanism of exosomal transfer <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Meckes2" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Pegtel1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Exosomes can deliver functional miRNAs to recipient cells and consequently downregulate expression of target genes <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Meckes2" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Pegtel1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Valadi1" ref-type="bibr">[108]</xref>. Leukemia cell-derived exosomes have recently been shown to affect endothelial cell function through microRNA transfer <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Umezu1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. Moreover, tumor-derived microRNAs were recently reported to play a functional role through binding to Toll-like receptors, thereby inducing an inflammatory response and influencing tumor growth and metastasis <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Fabbri1" ref-type="bibr">[109]</xref>. This <italic>in vivo</italic> relevance was further demonstrated by inhibiting tumor-secreted miRNAs, which altered tumor formation in mice <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Fabbri1" ref-type="bibr">[109]</xref>. Dendritic cell-derived exosomes can be used to prime the immune response as cancer immunotherapy to suppress tumor burden <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Chaput1" ref-type="bibr">[110]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Escudier1" ref-type="bibr">[111]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Zitvogel1" ref-type="bibr">[112]</xref>. Exosomes have also been recently tested in clinical trials to reduce tumor size <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Chaput1" ref-type="bibr">[110]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Escudier1" ref-type="bibr">[111]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Zitvogel1" ref-type="bibr">[112]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003484-Dai1" ref-type="bibr">[113]</xref>. Collectively, these studies further demonstrate the <italic>in vivo</italic> relevance of exosomes and their potential as mediators of disease phenotypes.</p>
              <p>In this study, we find stable, systemic KSHV miRNAs and oncomiRs. GO pathway analysis of predicted targets of the oncogenic miRNAs expressed in exosomes revealed a variety of pathways targeted by KSHV during pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003484-t001">Table 1</xref>). Since several of these pathways shared a role in cell migration, we further tested the effects of patient-derived exosomes on migration of hTERT-HUVECs. Treatment of cells with exosomes from pleural fluid led to earlier, enhanced migration of endothelial cells, giving these patient-derived exosomes a functional biological role (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003484-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that miRNAs specifically expressed within exosomes play a role in disease progression and mediate paracrine effects, which are a hallmark of KSHV tumorigenesis.</p>

Samples were normalized using equal input and values are shown as dCT of the sample without cel-mir-39. ND, not detected or below the limit of detection.</p>

(A) The exosomal markers Hsp90 alpha (A, B), Hsp90 beta (C), flotillin-2 (D) and beta actin (E) were analyzed by Western blot in human samples isolated by UC and EQ techniques. All exosome markers were detected in pleural fluid exosomes isolated by either ultracentrifugation (UC) or Exoquick (EQ) solution, confirming that both of these protocols yield populations of purified exosomes. Since these markers are cellular proteins that are enriched in exosomes (ExoCarta, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.exocarta.org">www.exocarta.org</ext-link>), these proteins were also expressed in cell lysates from BCBL1 PEL cells (denoted as “Cells”). As expected, the exosomal markers were absent in the supernatant fraction. Note, only 250 µl of pleural fluid was used as input for the Exoquick protocol and ∼35 mls pleural fluid was used as starting volume for the ultracentrifugation method. Sample were normalized by equal input volumes for each technique.</p>

Prior to ExoQuick enrichment, supernatants were passed through a 0.2 micron Whatman filter to decrease the amount of virus present in the sample. RNA from BCBL1 cells was used as a positive control for expression of KSHV miRNAs. PCR-grade water was used as input for the cDNA reaction for a no template control (NTC). Total RNA was isolated using Triazol and samples were normalized to equal amounts of total RNA input. Taqman microRNA assays (Life Technologies) for 14 KSHV miRNAs were used to determine levels of expression by qPCR, which are shown as fold above background for three technical replicates. qPCR products were diluted 1∶10 and run on a Caliper nanofluidics platform (similar to traditional gel electrophoresis). The KSHV miRNA products run at ∼60 bp with the primers and Taqman probe annealed. Cells, exosomes and filtered exosomes expressed KSHV miRNAs to similar levels. A shifted band consisting of the primer dimers can be seen in the NTC lanes. Abbreviations: Exo, exosomes; Exo-F, filtered exosomes; NTC, no template control.</p>

Predicted targets were obtained using Ingenuity and were narrowed down to include only experimentally validated targets. These targets were then overlayed with the functional pathway tool and the top represented pathways are shown. The number of target genes involved in each pathway is shown along with the univariate p value as determined by Ingenuity software. Several pathways are bolded to denote their importance in tumorigenesis and KSHV pathogenesis. As a control, we used miRNAs induced by WNV infection of hTERT-HUVEC cells.</p>

Pathway analysis was performed and the number of target genes involved in the top pathways are denoted. WNV-induced predicted targets were used as a control experiment and revealed different target pathways. The total number of predicted target genes for the KS-associated exosomal microRNAs and WNV-induced microRNAs were 188 and 106, respectively. Differences between KSHV oncomir targets and WNV-induced targets were significant as determined by paired T test (p = 1.56E-06).</p>
