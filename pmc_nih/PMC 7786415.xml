              <p>Another important lifestyle factor with convincing evidence for decreased incidence of CRC is physical activity (PA).<sup><xref rid="bibr15-1534735420967101" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Previous studies have observed associations between PA and colon cancer, with risk reduction ranging from 16% to 24%.<sup><xref rid="bibr16-1534735420967101" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="bibr17-1534735420967101" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr18-1534735420967101" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Adherence to dietary and PA recommendations, such as those outlined by the American Cancer Society (ACS), World Cancer Research Fund, and American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR) is associated with reduced odds of having 3 or more adenomas colorectal adenomas.<sup><xref rid="bibr19-1534735420967101" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="bibr20-1534735420967101" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr21-1534735420967101" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Thus, the objective of this pilot study was to evaluate a 12-week rice bran/navy bean intervention among individuals at high risk for CRC, while measuring and educating participants on PA. We assessed the feasibility of recruiting and retaining participants, compliance to study foods, compliance to, and acceptability of study procedures, and finally, evaluated the effects of the intervention on fiber intake, whole grain intake, Healthy Eating Index (HEI), and PA. Our <italic>primary hypothesis</italic> was that the rice bran/navy bean intervention via study foods and as powder supplements would be feasible to improve healthy eating indices in all categories of fiber intake when compared to a fiber powder.</p>

Participants were eligible if they met the following criteria: (1) a healthy adult (≥18 years of age) who had 1 or more adenomatous polyps removed within the previous 3 years, (2) had not received adjuvant treatment such as chemotherapy or radiotherapy with their surgical removal of polyps/tumors, (3) not pregnant or lactating, or planning to become pregnant during the study, (4) no history of food allergies and/or major dietary restrictions, (5) ability to complete study questionnaires in English, and food logs electronically, and (6) willing to provide blood, urine, and stool samples as required by study protocol. The University’s Research Integrity and Compliance Review Board approved this study protocol (IRB 17-7464H). Written informed consent was obtained from all individuals.</p>
                <p>Participants who met eligibility criteria and consented to participate were randomized by body mass index (BMI) and sex to one of the 2 study groups. Participants completed 3 scheduled study visits at baseline (week 0), midpoint (week 6), and post-intervention (week 12). Fasted blood samples were collected at 3 scheduled visits by venipuncture. Blood was processed for serum lipid panel. Study ID-labeled containers were given to participants for self-collection of stool (week 0 and week 12) and urine (week 0, week 6, and week 12). Blood, stool and urine samples were analyzed for non-targeted and targeted metabolomics (data not reported here). Participants visited the study site bi-weekly to pick up study foods/powders, return empty containers from completed study foods, and check compliance.

The Automated Self-Administered 24-hour (ASA24<sup>®</sup>) Dietary Assessment Tool was used to calculate the Healthy Eating Index (HEI) for each participant. ASA24<sup>®</sup> is a web-based tool that enables multiple, automatically coded, self-administered 24-hour recalls and/or single or multi-day food records, also known as food diaries. It is based on the 2015 Dietary Guidelines for Americans.

Participants wore the activPAL for 7 consecutive days, 24 hours per day, for the week immediately following the baseline study visit. Participants were asked to record times of activPAL removal and sleep/wake-up times.

Non-wear periods were excluded from analyses; these were defined using participant logs and verified via visual inspection of the accelerometer data. A cadence based linear regression was used to estimate total MET hours and time spent in sedentary (METs &lt;1.5), light (METs 1.5-2.99), and moderate-to-vigorous (METs ≥3) intensity activity per day.<sup><xref rid="bibr26-1534735420967101" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Each variable was summed between all valid days and divided by valid days to calculate daily values.</p>

Participant recruitment and retention was based on accrual and study attrition. Compliance to the dietary intervention was determined by (1) recording the study meals and snacks that participants consumed each day divided by the total number provided to calculate percent compliance, and (2) the percent of daily caloric intake due to rice bran/navy bean consumption.

                <p>Compliance to study procedures was based on completion of blood draws, urine and stool sample collections. For the activPAL accelerometer, compliance was defined as ≥10 hours of wear time per day, for ≥4 days, with at least on weekend day. Acceptability of study foods was based on responses to a participant satisfaction questionnaire, administered at the end of intervention. Continuous data were summarized and presented as median, range, and median percent change from baseline to post-intervention within the intervention and control group.</p>

                <title>Recruitment and Retention</title>
                <p>We aimed to recruit 20 participants to complete the 12-week intervention within the course of approximately 1 year. Recruitment and study participation occurred between September 2017 to December 2018 and consisted primarily of announcements to the University’s faculty/staff list serve via emails, and flyers distributed to gastroenterology centers and the regional cancer center. A total of 68 individuals were assessed for eligibility, 23 enrolled, for a 33.8% accrual rate. Of the 23 participants randomized to one of the 2 study groups, 20 completed the intervention between September 2017 and December 2018, for a retention rate of 86.9%. Three participants withdrew from the trial due to constipation (N = 1), preferred to join weight watchers (N = 1), or didn’t like the food (N = 1). No adverse events were reported.

All participants, N = 20 (100%) supplied urine samples for three-time points (baseline, week 6 and week 12). Of the 20 participants who completed the intervention, N = 19 (95%) supplied stool samples at baseline and post-intervention. Of the 40 activPAL data collections (20 participants × two-time points), N = 20 (100%) were compliant with procedures and provided valid data. At the completion of the intervention, 16 (80%) of participants completed the intervention satisfaction questionnaire. Detailed information from this questionnaire is shown in <xref rid="table3-1534735420967101" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. Overall, participants were very satisfied with their experience in the study and would encourage others with increased risk of CRC to participate. The majority of comments provided were related to study foods and personal preferences.</p>

              <p>A dietary fiber intervention using a combination of rice bran and navy bean among individuals at high risk for CRC (i.e., previous adenomatous polyps removed) has potential to become a high impact lifestyle intervention for primary and secondary CRC prevention. Notably, no previous studies have examined the feasibility and acceptability of the dietary combination of rice bran and navy bean for increasing dietary fiber and while also addressing other healthy lifestyle factors such as physical activity. The results from this pilot study support the feasibility and acceptability of a rice bran and navy bean intervention that included physical activity education. Recruitment was timely, compliance to study foods and procedures was high, and the intervention was overall well-received, with participants providing constructive feedback regarding study foods and procedures. Results from this study also provided support for practical means to improve daily fiber intake, overall diet quality, and specifically, whole grain intake.</p>
              <p>Total HEI score increased in both the intervention and control group, and HEI whole grain score increased to a greater extent in the intervention group. The HEI-2015 scoring system ranges from 0 to 100 and has an overall HEI score that is made up of 13 components that reflect the different food groups and key recommendations in the 2015 to 2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans.<sup><xref rid="bibr29-1534735420967101" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> Higher HEI scores have been associated with decreased risk for CRC in men and women.<sup><xref rid="bibr30-1534735420967101" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> The total HEI-2015 score for Americans is 59 out of 100, indicating that average American diet does not conform to dietary recommendations.<sup><xref rid="bibr31-1534735420967101" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggests eating 6 ounces of grains each day and half of your grain intake as whole grains (based on a 2000-calorie diet), which would equate to a HEI score of 10 out of 10.<sup><xref rid="bibr32-1534735420967101" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> Studies have shown that increase of whole grains is associated with decreaded risk of colorectal cancer recurrence and mortality,<sup><xref rid="bibr33-1534735420967101" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> and insufficient whole grain consumption is a leading dietary factor associated with preventable cancer burden.<sup><xref rid="bibr34-1534735420967101" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> At baseline, none of the participants in the current study achieved a HEI whole grain score of 10, but at post-intervention N = 11 in the intervention group scored a 10 (compared to N = 0 in the control group at post-intervention). Taken together, our findings support improvement in overall HEI score with fiber supplementation, and improvement in whole grain component score for the intervention group. Contributions of other macronutrients, and total caloric intake are shown in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/1534735420967101">Supplemental file 1</ext-link>.</p>
              <p>While both the control and intervention groups received daily fiber, the intervention group maintained higher amounts at week 6 and week 12. There is a general guideline, 14 g of fiber per 1000 calories intake in the diet.<sup><xref rid="bibr35-1534735420967101" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> Currently the dietary reference intakes (DRI) for adult’s total fiber ranges between 21 and 38 g/day depending on age and sex, with less than 3% of Americans meeting recommended intake.<sup><xref rid="bibr36-1534735420967101" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> Dietary fiber is a major macronutrient with convincing evidence for decreased risk of CRC.<sup><xref rid="bibr37-1534735420967101" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> Hayes et al<sup><xref rid="bibr38-1534735420967101" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> reported that dietary fiber was associated with decreased risk of colon adenoma. The National Institutes of Health-AARP Diet and Health Study showed fiber specifically from whole grains and legumes (namely, beans) was associated with a lower risk of CRC.<sup><xref rid="bibr39-1534735420967101" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Although the results of this intervention are promising, several limitations should be considered. There was a small sample size, yet it was sufficient for a pilot trial design and supports feasibility for recruiting larger cohorts to evaluate changes in efficacy outcomes such as colonic inflammation and recurrence of polyps-neoplasia. Also, a majority of participants enrolled were already achieving high levels of PA at baseline, and thus we did not anticipate substantial increases in PA due to the education intervention. Future investigations with this dietary intervention may seek out sedentary or inactive individuals, and include a supervised PA intervention component.</p>
              <p>One strength of this study was the novel and practical approach using “real foods” (eg, snacks, casseroles, etc.) that are commonly consumed, yet with inclusions of rice bran/bean powders. This approach allowed for flexibility in participants’ free-living environment, and likely contributed to the high compliance rates. While preliminary, our results demonstrate increased rice bran/navy bean consumption with subsequent improvements in whole grains and overall diet quality. These results are encouraging when integrated with the monitoring of physical activity. Further, the investigation of microbiome and metabolome changes are additional tools that will help us to better understand the metabolic mechanisms in the prevention of neoplastic lesions into colon cancer, and through mitigation of inflammation.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-1534735420967101" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="bibr28-1534735420967101" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="bibr40-1534735420967101" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup></p>
              <p>In summary, a lifestyle intervention, which includes both a dietary component of rice bran and navy bean and PA promotion, represents a plausible strategy for primary and secondary CRC prevention. A larger randomized controlled trial is needed to evaluate efficacy, and to explore the physiologic mechanisms for cancer prevention (eg, microbiome, metabolomics, inflammation).</p>
