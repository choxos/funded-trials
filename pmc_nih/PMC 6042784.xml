              <abstract>
                <p>Dengue virus (DENV) is the most prevalent arthropod-borne viral disease in humans. DENV causes a spectrum of illness ranging from mild to potentially severe complications. Dendritic cells (DCs) play a critical role in initiating and regulating highly effective antiviral immune response that include linking innate and adaptive immune responses. This study was conducted to comparatively characterize in detail the relative proportion, phenotypic changes, and maturation profile of subsets of both myeloid DCs (mDCs) and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) in children with dengue fever (DF), dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and for purposes of control healthy individuals. The mDCs (Lin<sup>-</sup>CD11c<sup>+</sup>CD123<sup>lo</sup>), the pDCs (Lin<sup>-</sup>CD11c<sup>-</sup>CD123<sup>+</sup>) and the double negative (DN) subset (Lin<sup>-</sup>/HLA<sup>-</sup>DR<sup>+</sup>/CD11c<sup>-</sup>CD123<sup>-</sup>) were analyzed by polychromatic flow cytometry. The data were first analyzed on blood samples collected from DENV-infected patients at various times post-infection. Results showed that the relative proportion of mDCs were significantly decreased which was associated with an increase in disease severity in samples from DENV-infected patients. While there was no significant difference in the relative proportion of pDCs between healthy and DENV-infected patients, there was a marked increase in the DN subset. Analysis of the kinetics of changes of pDCs showed that there was an increase but only during the early febrile phase. Additionally, samples from patients during acute disease showed marked decreases in the relative proportion of CD141<sup>+</sup> and CD16<sup>+</sup> mDC subsets that were the major mDC subsets in healthy individuals. In addition, there was a significant decrease in the level of CD33-expressing mDCs in DENV patients. While the pDCs showed an up-regulation of maturation profile during acute DENV infection, the mDCs showed an alteration of maturation status. This study suggests that different relative proportion and phenotypic changes as well as alteration of maturation profile of DC subsets may play a critical role in the dengue pathogenesis and disease outcome.</p>

              <p>Dengue virus (DENV) is the most prevalent arthropod-borne viral disease in humans. The virus is transmitted to humans via infected female <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> or <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> mosquitoes. DENV is classified into four antigenically distinct serotypes, DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4 [<xref rid="pone.0200564.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Dengue disease is a global epidemic involving more than 100 countries predominantly within tropical and subtropical regions [<xref rid="pone.0200564.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Furthermore, it is estimated that approximately 2.5 billion people are now at risk of DENV infection. One recent study indicated that there are 400 million dengue infections per year of which approximately 100 million resulted in symptomatic cases associated with 21,000 deaths [<xref rid="pone.0200564.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Most DENV infections are asymptomatic, although DENV can cause a spectrum of illness ranging from mild symptoms denoted as dengue fever (DF) to potentially severe manifestations that include dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). The 1997 WHO guideline, which has been used in this study, classifies DHF into 4 grades of severity, with grade III and IV being classified as DSS. The clinical manifestations of DHF are enhancement of vascular permeability, endothelial cell damage and plasma leakage [<xref rid="pone.0200564.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] that are the predominant cause of death [<xref rid="pone.0200564.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. There is presently no licensed vaccines or effective antiviral drugs available. The question why do only some patients develop severe manifestations after DENV infection continues to be a subject of debate. There have been several proposed hypotheses describing the development of severe DENV manifestations. These include exacerbated T cell response with elevated level of cytokines (cytokine storms), as well as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). The latter implicates pre-existing sub-neutralizing antibodies induced by the first DENV infection that bind to DENV particles of the second infection with heterotypic serotypes [<xref rid="pone.0200564.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0200564.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p>
              <p>Both innate and adaptive immune response have been characterized in patients with DENV infection. Among the cell lineages involved, the dendritic cells (DCs) are of particular interest because of their link between innate and adaptive immune responses and their critical role in the induction and regulation of potent anti-viral immune responses [<xref rid="pone.0200564.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. It is important to note that dermal DCs and Langerhan cells have been noted to be the primary targets of dengue virus infection following transmission [<xref rid="pone.0200564.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Upon DENV infection, DCs undergo maturation, which is characterized by upregulated expression of major histocompatibility class II (MHC II) antigens and the co-stimulatory molecules CD40, CD80 (B7-1), CD83, and CD86 (B7-2) [<xref rid="pone.0200564.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0200564.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. DENV infection may induce DC apoptosis and decrease their ability to optimally prime and present antigen to CD4+ or CD8+ T-cells that potentially contribute to DENV pathogenesis [<xref rid="pone.0200564.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In the peripheral blood, there are two major subsets of human blood DCs. These include the myeloid DCs (mDCs) and the plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) [<xref rid="pone.0200564.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0200564.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Both mDCs and pDCs are characterized by the expression of HLA-DR, and the absence of a number of cell lineage (lin) markers such as CD3, CD14, CD19 and CD56. The mDCs (lin<sup>-</sup>HLA-DR<sup>+</sup>CD11c<sup>+</sup>CD123<sup>lo</sup>) play a major role in antigen capture, processing and presentation to T cells. DCs are distributed in peripheral tissues and following antigen capture have the ability to migrate to lymphoid organs, where they interact with T cells to orchestrate immune responses. The mDCs are further subdivided into three subsets, the CD16<sup>+</sup> mDCs, the CD1c<sup>+</sup> mDCs and the CD141<sup>+</sup> mDCs [<xref rid="pone.0200564.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0200564.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0200564.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The CD16<sup>+</sup> mDCs have been previously reported to have a relatively potent pro-inflammatory function associated with high production of TNF-α in response to most TLR agonists [<xref rid="pone.0200564.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The CD1c<sup>+</sup> DCs appear to be primarily involved in the presentation of lipid and glycolipid antigens to T cells [<xref rid="pone.0200564.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Of interest is the finding that while the group 1 CD1 isoforms that include CD1a, CD1b and CD1c have structurally diverse antigen binding grooves, they have similar roles in antigen presentation to T cells. The fact that there are no known data on the CD1b<sup>+</sup> mDC subset prompted us to focus on characterizing this subset in dengue infected patients. The CD141<sup>+</sup> DC subset have been shown to promote Th1 type of immune responses following TLR3 stimulation in addition to be involved in necrotic cell antigen cross-presentation [<xref rid="pone.0200564.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The pDCs (lin<sup>-</sup>HLA-DR<sup>+</sup>CD11c<sup>-</sup>CD123<sup>+</sup>) on the other hand are well recognized as a major source of type I interferon (IFN) that contributes to limiting viral replication [<xref rid="pone.0200564.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p>
              <p>There have been a number of previous studies that have described the frequencies of mDCs and pDCs in dengue patients. However, these previous studies were cross sectional and included description of total populations of mDCs and pDCs without addressing the role of subsets within these cell lineages. Thus, one of these studies documented reduced absolute numbers of both mDCs and pDCs in dengue patients as compared to healthy adults but these decreases did not correlate with disease severity but with levels of viremia [<xref rid="pone.0200564.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. A separate study documented decreases in total mDCs during acute viral illness and the decrease was correlated with disease severity [<xref rid="pone.0200564.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In this study, there was also decreases in the levels of pDCs during acute viral illness but only in those patients that went onto develop DHF [<xref rid="pone.0200564.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Finally, a more recent study documented an increase in the frequencies of mDCs associated with disease severity but this was an increase only in the cytokine expressing mDCs [<xref rid="pone.0200564.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. We reasoned that a more detailed study of the relative proportion of mDCs/pDCs, their subsets and levels of maturation that also included longitudinal studies on a subset of dengue infected patients may provide some important clues as to the potential roles of these cells in dengue pathogenesis. Hence the rationale for the studies reported herein.</p>

                <p>DENV infected patients were enrolled from Department of Pediatrics at Ramathibodi Hospital and Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand. Siriraj Institutional Review Board, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University approved the study (Si 092/2010) and written informed consent was obtained from all subjects. Sixty-eight blood samples from the twenty-two DENV-infected patients were drawn using sodium citrate-containing tubes daily after enrollment until hospital discharge. Healthy age-matched volunteer subjects ages 3–13 (n = 14) were enrolled as controls in this study. It should be noted that blood samples were collected at different days of fever ranging from day -2 (D-2) to day +2 (D+2). Thus, samples collected on D-2 to D-1 were considered as the febrile phase, those collected during D0, day of defervescence when the temperature dropped below 37.5°C without subsequently elevation to D+1 representing the defervescence phase, and those collected during D+2 representing the recovery phase or afebrile phase.</p>
                <p>Patients were diagnosed by physicians using clinical presentations and routine laboratory tests including complete blood count, urinalysis, and blood chemistry. Subjects suspected of DENV infection were confirmed using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and serology using the Platelia<sup>TM</sup> Dengue NS1 Ag microplate EIA (Hercules, CA). DENV-infected patients were characterized according to the 1997 WHO guidelines and were classified as DF (n = 12) and DHF (n = 10) grades 1–3.

Moreover, the expression of CD33 (Siglec-3), a transmembrane receptor primarily expressed by myeloid cells including both mDCs and pDCs was also analyzed. For mDC subset analysis, a different gating strategy was utilized. Thus, following doublet discrimination, mDCs were first gated on HLA-DR<sup>+</sup>/Lin<sup>-</sup> cells followed by gated on cell population that express CD11c without CD304 and CD123 expression.

                <title>Differences in subsets of mDC and CD33-expressing mDCs during acute DENV infection</title>
                <p>Since one of the major difference between dengue infected patients and normal subjects was noted in the relative proportion of mDCs, we reasoned that a more detailed analysis of the mDC subsets that contribute to such difference would be informative. We thus first investigated the relative proportion of mDCs that either expressed CD16, CD1b or CD141 (comprising the three distinct subsets of mDC) as a percentage of total DCs. The distribution of each of these mDC subset during acute DENV was analyzed from 64 DENV-infected samples and 14 healthy subjects. The mean of relative proportion (%) of CD16<sup>+</sup>, CD1b<sup>+</sup> and CD141<sup>+</sup> mDC subsets among total DCs from the peripheral blood of healthy subjects were 34.00%, 0.62% and 46.77%, respectively, while the mean of relative proportion (%) of CD16<sup>+</sup>, CD1b<sup>+</sup> and CD141<sup>+</sup> mDCs subsets among total DCs from peripheral blood of DENV-infected patients were 6.75%, 2.02% and 30.42%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0200564.g003">Fig 3A</xref>).

              <p>DCs play a key role in priming innate and adaptive immune responses against microbial infection such as viral infections. In the case of responses to DENV infection, host cells recognize DENV associated PAMPs and activate TLRs, leading to the initiation of antiviral immune responses that include the synthesis of IFN-α/β and a number of pro-inflammatory cytokines [<xref rid="pone.0200564.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0200564.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Several studies on various aspects of DCs during DENV infection have been reported both in adult [<xref rid="pone.0200564.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and children [<xref rid="pone.0200564.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] but as noted above, most of these studies were cross sectional and did not address which of the subsets of DCs contributed to the observations that were reported. In an effort to better understand the role of DCs, we characterized the relative proportion, phenotypic changes and maturation status of both total mDCs/pDCs and subsets of mDCs in the peripheral blood from children who had DENV infection.</p>
              <p>Our study showed that while dengue infection did not change the relative proportion of pDCs, the infection led to a significant decrease in the relative proportion of mDCs. Importantly, since the relative proportion of mDCs in children with DHF were significantly lower than DF patients, the data suggest that decreased levels of mDCs correlate with an increase in disease severity. These data were consistent with the previous work in children with DENV infection [<xref rid="pone.0200564.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The possible mechanisms that could contribute to a decrease in the number of circulating mDCs include a) increased migration of mDCs to peripheral tissues or lymphoid organs b) impairment of bone marrow function and c) increased apoptosis of mDCs. Support for differences in trafficking of DC’s comes from studies that have documented the fact that mDCs residing within epithelial tissues synthesize significant levels of TNF-α, IFN- α and IL-6 [<xref rid="pone.0200564.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0200564.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] along with inflammatory chemokines upon encounter with dengue viral antigens which promotes their migration from the blood to sites of inflammation [<xref rid="pone.0200564.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Such trafficking of circulating DCs to secondary lymphoid organs has also been noted in both human HIV [<xref rid="pone.0200564.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and nonhuman primate SIV infection [<xref rid="pone.0200564.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. As previously reported, DENV has been shown to infect cells within the bone marrow. It is therefore clearly possible that such infection leads to reduced progenitor cell development resulting in reduced levels of DCs [<xref rid="pone.0200564.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Finally, support for a potential role for increased levels of apoptosis comes from the studies that have documented increase levels of apoptotic cells in the liver, brain, intestinal/lung tissues, and microvascular endothelial cells from fatal cases of DHF/DSS [<xref rid="pone.0200564.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. It has been shown that during DENV infection, there is an accumulation of DENV proteins within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Thus, such accumulation may be one of the mechanisms that induces ER stress leading to the activation of the apoptotic pathway [<xref rid="pone.0200564.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0200564.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Interestingly, there was no significant difference in the relative proportion of pDCs between DENV-infected patients and healthy controls except for the kinetic change noted in the relative proportion of pDCs that were increased during the early febrile phase when compared with that of healthy individuals. We submit that the ability to maintain significant levels of pDCs levels may contribute to viral clearance during acute DENV infection.</p>
              <p>In addition, we observed an increase in the relative proportion of Lin<sup>-</sup>HLA-DR<sup>+</sup>CD11c<sup>-</sup>CD123<sup>-</sup> cells (DN subset) in children with DHF but not DF. This DN subset has been previously identified as Lin<sup>-</sup>HLA-DR<sup>+</sup>CD34<sup>+</sup> cells [<xref rid="pone.0200564.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0200564.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The expression of CD34 has been shown to be a marker of circulating progenitor cells [<xref rid="pone.0200564.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Thus, DCs develop from CD34<sup>+</sup> hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) which are mostly found in the bone marrow and are present in very small numbers in the peripheral blood [<xref rid="pone.0200564.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. It is therefore tempting to speculate that the increased levels of this DN subset in dengue infection could be a reflection of a hematopoietic response to decreased levels of mDCs that induces the maturation of precursor cells. Unfortunately, we did not include analysis of CD34 expression in our study, but is a subject of current studies.</p>
              <p>Human mDC subsets are subdivided into 3 subsets based on the expression of CD16<sup>+</sup>, CD1c<sup>+</sup> (BDCA-1<sup>+</sup>) or CD141<sup>+</sup> (BDCA-3<sup>+</sup>) [<xref rid="pone.0200564.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0200564.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0200564.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In the present study, we characterized these three mDC subsets by their expression of these cell surface markers. The CD1b is a member of group 1 of the CD1 family of molecules similar to CD1c [<xref rid="pone.0200564.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Both CD1b<sup>+</sup> and CD1c<sup>+</sup> have been shown to present microbial lipid antigen to T cells [<xref rid="pone.0200564.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0200564.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] and are classified as non-classical antigen presenting molecules and that CD1b<sup>+</sup> expressing DCs play a major role in the synthesis of select cytokines such as IL-10 and IFN-γ and promote the development of Th1 cells [<xref rid="pone.0200564.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. We demonstrated herein that CD16<sup>+</sup> and CD141<sup>+</sup> and mDC subsets were the major mDC subsets in healthy individuals. Of interest was our findings of significant decreases in the relative proportion of both CD16<sup>+</sup> and CD141<sup>+</sup> mDC subsets during acute DENV infection when compared with those of healthy individuals. The kinetic changes of relative proportion of CD16<sup>+</sup> and CD141<sup>+</sup> mDCs were different. While CD16<sup>+</sup> mDCs were continuously decreased from febrile to the afebrile phase, CD141<sup>+</sup> mDCs were decreased during the early febrile phase. Previous studies have shown that the CD16<sup>+</sup> mDCs play a key role in innate immunity by secretion of chemoattractant stimuli and cytokines as well as playing a role in the induction of inflammation [<xref rid="pone.0200564.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The CD141<sup>+</sup> mDCs on the other hand have been shown to play a crucial role in induction of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells by cross-presentation of antigen to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells [<xref rid="pone.0200564.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0200564.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Our data suggest that decreased relative proportion of CD16<sup>+</sup> and CD141<sup>+</sup> mDC subsets in DENV patients may limit their capacities in executing both innate and adaptive immune responses.</p>
              <p>CD33 (Siglec-3) consists of two Ig-like extracellular domains and two immune-receptor tyrosine-based inhibitory (ITIM)-like motifs within the cytoplasmic domain [<xref rid="pone.0200564.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0200564.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. CD33 is predominantly expressed by cells of the myeloid lineage and appears during the early stages of myeloid cell differentiation and on normal myeloid pre-progenitor cells. The data presented herein demonstrated that there was a significant decrease in the level of CD33 expressed by mDCs especially CD16<sup>+</sup> mDCs in DENV patients suggesting a possible impairment in the generation of DCs and myeloid cell maturation. Results of a previous study demonstrated that DENV induces an increase in the overall maturation of mDCs as defined by increased levels of expression of the co-stimulatory molecules CD40, CD80, CD83, and CD86 [<xref rid="pone.0200564.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. It is important to note, however, that infected DCs but not innocent bystander cells are inhibited from undergoing maturation in the presence of DENV infection [<xref rid="pone.0200564.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The decreased relative proportion but increased expression level (MFI) of CD33-expressing mDCs in DENV patients prompted us to determine whether such decreases led to an impairment in mDC maturation. Interestingly, while there were not globally changed in the MFI of the maturation profiles of mDCs, there was a decrease in the relative proportion of CD86-expressing mDCs. These data suggest that the relative proportion of CD33-expressing mDCs may not be related to the maturation status of mDCs during acute DENV infection and that functional effect of CD33 on maturation of DC is insufficient for predicting maturation status. Future studies involving functional analysis of CD33 on mDCs in DENV patients may be necessary. Of note, we demonstrated that the relative proportion of pDCs did not change significantly, but DENV induces the maturation of pDCs by the up-regulation of CD40 and CD86 markers in children with DF and DHF. On the other hand, pDCs showed down-regulation of CD86, a co-stimulatory marker in adults with DF and DHF [<xref rid="pone.0200564.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. These findings suggest there may be differences in the maturation profile of DCs between children and adult.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, our study provides a detailed characterization of mDCs and pDCs, and their maturation levels during DENV disease. We have shown that a reduction in the relative proportion of mDCs is associated with an increase in disease severity. The decrease is markedly shown in the two major mDC subsets which include the CD16<sup>+</sup> and CD141<sup>+</sup> mDCs subsets. DENV infection also upregulates the maturation of pDCs and alters the maturation status of mDCs. These findings have implication for better understanding the phenotypic changes of DCs and their maturation kinetics during the febrile phase of DENV disease.</p>
