                  <title>Objective</title>
                  <p>Women living with HIV (WLWH) experience psychosocial stress related to social-structural vulnerabilities. To investigate neuroendocrine pathways linking stress and increased cardiovascular disease risk among WLWH, we evaluated associations between psychosocial stress (i.e., perceived stress, posttraumatic stress, and experiences of race- and gender-based harassment) and a composite neuroendocrine biomarker index among WLWH and women without HIV.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>In 2019–2020, Women’s Interagency HIV Study participants in Washington, DC completed a questionnaire and provided blood and 12-hour overnight urine samples for testing of serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) and urinary free cortisol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. Psychosocial stress was measured using the Perceived Stress Scale, PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version, and Racialized Sexual Harassment Scale. Latent profile analysis was used to classify participants into low (38%), moderate (44%), and high (18%) stress groups. Composite biomarker index scores between 0–4 were assigned based on participants’ number of neuroendocrine biomarkers in high-risk quartiles (≥75<sup>th</sup> percentile for cortisol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine and ≤25<sup>th</sup> percentile for DHEA-S). We evaluated associations between latent profile and composite biomarker index values using multivariable linear regression, adjusting for socio-demographic, behavioral, metabolic, and HIV-related factors.</p>

                  <p>Among 90 women, 62% were WLWH, 53% were non-Hispanic Black, and median age was 55 years. In full multivariable models, there was no statistically significant association between psychosocial stress and composite biomarker index values among all women independent of HIV status. High (vs. low) psychosocial stress was positively associated with higher mean composite biomarker index values among all monoracial Black women (adjusted β = 1.32; 95% CI: 0.20–2.43), Black WLWH (adjusted β = 1.93; 95% CI: 0.02–3.83) and Black HIV-negative women (adjusted β = 2.54; 95% CI: 0.41–4.67).</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>Despite a null association in the overall sample, greater psychosocial stress was positively associated with higher neuroendocrine biomarker concentrations among Black women, highlighting a plausible mechanism by which psychosocial stress could contribute to cardiovascular disease risk.</p>

              <p>Over the last two decades, the aging of people living with HIV (PLWH) and the widespread use of antiretroviral therapy have been accompanied by a decrease in AIDS-related deaths and a concomitant increase in deaths attributed to cardiovascular disease (CVD) and other non-AIDS-related chronic conditions [<xref rid="pone.0261746.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0261746.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. PLWH have an elevated risk of subclinical atherosclerosis and atherosclerotic CVD, attributed in large part to chronic inflammation and immune activation [<xref rid="pone.0261746.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0261746.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].

              <p>Psychosocial stress is one CVD risk pathway that remains understudied among WLWH, despite WLWH and particularly WLWH of color being disproportionately affected [<xref rid="pone.0261746.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Forms of psychosocial stress experienced by WLWH include those directly related to managing one’s HIV diagnosis (e.g., rigid medication regimens, side effects, sense of physical vulnerability based on immunodeficiency), those indirectly related (e.g., stigma, emotional challenges), and intersecting social-structural vulnerabilities related to interdependent and mutually constitutive identities such as being female, Black or Hispanic, and HIV-positive [<xref rid="pone.0261746.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0261746.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Experiences of abuse and trauma are also common among WLWH. In a meta-analysis of studies conducted among WLWH, there was a high estimated overall prevalence of intimate partner violence (55%), sexual abuse (35%), physical abuse (55%), and recent posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (30%) [<xref rid="pone.0261746.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p>
              <p>At the end of 2019, 57% of all WLWH in the United States were Black women [<xref rid="pone.0261746.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Among Black women, discrimination attributed to racism and sexism is common and is associated with elevated stress [<xref rid="pone.0261746.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0261746.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Gendered racism, or the simultaneous experience of both racism and sexism, is an inherent stressor that can negatively affect personal relationships, professional and economic opportunities, and mental and physical health outcomes among Black women [<xref rid="pone.0261746.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0261746.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Gendered racism causes psychosocial stress both directly and through increased vulnerability to other stressors [<xref rid="pone.0261746.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0261746.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0261746.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Further, among Black WLWH, the effects of gendered racism and HIV-based discrimination can compound one another, representing key social-structural barriers to HIV care [<xref rid="pone.0261746.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p>
              <p>Psychosocial stress is known to contribute to atherosclerosis through heightened activity of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis and sympathetic nervous system (SNS) [<xref rid="pone.0261746.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. This physiologic response to perceived stress involves the release of glucocorticoid hormones such as cortisol and the production of epinephrine and norepinephrine, which collectively raise blood pressure, reduce insulin sensitivity, decrease hemostasis, and cause endothelial dysfunction [<xref rid="pone.0261746.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Psychosocial stress is also associated with adverse health behaviors including physical inactivity, suboptimal diet, and smoking [<xref rid="pone.0261746.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0261746.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Among WLWH, higher levels of psychosocial stress were positively associated with subclinical carotid atherosclerosis [<xref rid="pone.0261746.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In the general population, chronic daily stressors such as work-related stress as well as PTSD symptoms have been associated with increased CVD risk [<xref rid="pone.0261746.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0261746.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Racial discrimination as a chronic stressor has also been identified as a key contributor of increased CVD risk among Black individuals [<xref rid="pone.0261746.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0261746.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p>
              <p>Largely outside the context of HIV-related research, neuroendocrine biomarkers have been measured as part of a larger set of biomarkers collectively used to measure allostatic load, or the dysregulation of multiple biologic systems, including the neuroendocrine system, as a result of wear and tear brought on by cumulative exposure to stress [<xref rid="pone.0261746.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0261746.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The four neuroendocrine biomarkers most commonly evaluated have included cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) as markers of HPA axis activity and epinephrine and norepinephrine as markers of SNS activity [<xref rid="pone.0261746.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Higher levels of these biomarkers (lower for DHEA-S) under basal (resting) states have been taken to indicate a chronic heightened neuroendocrine response that might be attributed to psychosocial stress. Among women in one study, current life stressors were associated with more extreme levels of these four biomarkers [<xref rid="pone.0261746.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. These biomarkers have also been associated with increased CVD risk [<xref rid="pone.0261746.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0261746.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>].</p>
              <p>Several studies conducted among PLWH have employed a composite biomarker index for allostatic load that incorporated the aforementioned neuroendocrine biomarkers along with measures for inflammatory (e.g., C-reactive protein), metabolic (e.g., glucose), and cardiovascular (e.g., heart rate) markers [<xref rid="pone.0261746.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0261746.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. To our knowledge, there have been no published studies specifically examining a composite neuroendocrine biomarker index and its correlates among WLWH. The objective of this study was to evaluate associations between psychosocial stress (i.e., perceived stress, posttraumatic stress, and experiences of race- and gender-based harassment) and a composite neuroendocrine biomarker index among WLWH and HIV-negative women. We focused on neuroendocrine biomarkers because they are proximal markers of the physiologic stress response and serve as mediators of the effects of stress on inflammation and metabolic and cardiovascular dysfunction [<xref rid="pone.0261746.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0261746.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0261746.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. We hypothesized that this association would be stronger among WLWH compared with HIV-negative women. Given that Black WLWH disproportionately experience stress related to intersecting social-structural vulnerabilities [<xref rid="pone.0261746.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0261746.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], we also conducted a secondary subgroup analysis in which we evaluated this association specifically among Black women. Psychosocial correlates of neuroendocrine biomarkers could provide potential targets for interventions to prevent CVD among WLWH.</p>

                <p>This cross-sectional sub-study was conducted within the Women’s Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) at the Washington, DC site. The WIHS is an ongoing multicenter prospective observational study of WLWH and demographically similar women without HIV who were eligible based on sexually transmitted infection history, intravenous drug use, and/or sexual risk behaviors [<xref rid="pone.0261746.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0261746.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Participants were initially recruited and enrolled in the WIHS in 1994–1995, 2001–2002, or 2011–2013. At semi-annual visits, data were collected through structured interviews and standardized physical, psychological, and laboratory assessments. HIV status was assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with Western blot for confirmation at study enrollment for WLWH, and semi-annually for HIV-negative participants. The WIHS study protocol was approved by the Georgetown University Institutional Review Board (IRB). All participants provided written informed consent.</p>
                <p>Between August 2019 and January 2020, 90 participants were enrolled in this sub-study, including 56 WLWH (62% of the sample) and 34 HIV-negative women (38% of the sample). Participants were recruited at their routine semi-annual visits or by phone. We administered a brief screening questionnaire to evaluate potential participants’ eligibility and their ability to complete study procedures. Women were eligible if they reported no non-topical use of hormone supplements or therapy in the last three months (e.g., corticosteroids, epinephrine, norepinephrine, dehydroepiandrosterone, estrogen, progesterone, and their derivatives). For participants screened by phone, this eligibility criterion was re-confirmed at their study visit. The protocol for this sub-study was approved by Georgetown University and George Washington University IRBs. All participants provided written informed consent.</p>

                  <p>At the study visit, participants completed a questionnaire on perceived stress, posttraumatic stress, and experiences of race- and gender-based harassment (see <italic toggle="yes">Psychosocial Stress</italic>), provided a blood sample, and received materials for home-based collection of a 12-hour overnight urine sample. The 15-minute questionnaire was either self-administered on a tablet computer or administered by a trained interviewer, per participants’ preference. One 3-mL serum-separating tube of blood was collected from each participant. Women scheduled their overnight urine collection for a night of their choice, preferably within one week of their visit and within a maximum of 30 days. Supplies provided included a 3-L urine collection container with 25 mL of 6N hydrochloric acid preservative, a toilet ‘hat,’ an insulated cooler bag, and an ice pack. Participants were also provided with detailed verbal and written instructions.</p>

                  <p>We contacted participants by phone with reminders of their scheduled urine collection and asked them to reschedule if they were menstruating or feeling ill. We also asked participants to refrain from strenuous activity, sexual intercourse, alcohol use, and non-prescribed substance use during the collection period. On a urine collection log, participants recorded their collection start and end times and all void times during the 12-hour period. Participants were asked to void urine at 7 pm and to collect all subsequent urine until 7 am the following day. A 12-hour collection period was chosen over a 24-hour collection period to maximize feasibility and compliance and to obtain biomarker measurements under basal (resting) conditions over a relatively non-stimulated period. Participants could store their sample in their refrigerator or in the cooler bag provided. On the day on which their collection ended, participants transported their sample to the clinic using the cooler bag and ice pack. Following specimen receipt, we administered a second questionnaire to assess compliance with the urine collection protocol and collect data on behaviors and other factors that could have influenced urinary concentrations of free cortisol or catecholamines (e.g., substance use, illness). Participants received $75 for completing the study.</p>

                  <p>Following blood collection, the serum-separating tube was inverted five times, allowed to clot upright for 30 minutes, and centrifuged at 1100–1300 x g for 10–15 minutes. For urine samples, we measured the volume, inverted the container five times, and aliquoted the sample into two 10-mL vials for testing of free cortisol and catecholamines. The blood sample was shipped at room temperature on the collection day and an immunoassay was performed to determine the serum concentration of DHEA-S (in μg/dL). The urine vials were shipped in a refrigerated shipping container on the same day as specimen receipt. Concentration of urinary free cortisol (in μg/12 hrs) was determined using liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry and concentrations of urinary fractionated catecholamines (i.e., epinephrine and norepinephrine) (in μg/12 hrs) were determined using high performance liquid chromatography. All laboratory testing was performed at Quest Diagnostics (Baltimore, MD) using standard clinical laboratory methods. Urinary concentrations were standardized by grams of creatinine because dissimilar body size leads to differential concentrations in the urine.</p>

                <title>Composite neuroendocrine biomarker index</title>
                <p>We created a composite neuroendocrine biomarker index using laboratory test results for the four biomarkers of interest. Since there are no accepted thresholds for defining ‘high-risk’ levels that signify a heightened neuroendocrine response, the high-risk range has commonly been defined using distribution percentiles–often, the 25<sup>th</sup> and 75<sup>th</sup> percentiles [<xref rid="pone.0261746.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0261746.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Following this convention, we assigned one ‘point’ for each test result in the high-risk quartile, that is, the upper quartile (≥75<sup>th</sup> percentile) for urinary free cortisol and catecholamines and the lower quartile (≤25<sup>th</sup> percentile) for serum DHEA-S. Thus, values of the biomarker index could range from 0–4, representing the number of biomarkers for each participant that were in the high-risk quartile. Although we could not establish whether biomarker concentrations were abnormal using percentile cutoffs, this approach allowed us to evaluate whether higher levels of psychosocial stress were associated with more extreme biomarker concentrations within the sample. However, because individuals with PTSD have been found to have low resting cortisol, we also conducted a sensitivity analysis in which we used a bidirectional cutoff approach for defining high-risk levels for urinary cortisol (i.e., ≤12.5<sup>th</sup> or ≥87.5<sup>th</sup> percentiles) [<xref rid="pone.0261746.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0261746.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>].</p>

Seventeen items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale from “not at all” (assigned a score of 1) to “extremely” (assigned a score of 5) (α = 0.95).

Latent profile analysis is a classification method that identifies discrete profiles (or classes) of individuals who share similar response patterns to a set of continuous variables [<xref rid="pone.0261746.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Using MPlus Version 7.4, we considered models with 2–4 classes. The best fitting model was determined by several criteria: lower Akaike information criterion (AIC), Bayesian information criterion (BIC), and sample-size adjusted BIC values; statistically significant p-values for the adjusted Lo-Mendell-Rubin and boot-strapped likelihood ratio tests; and higher entropy values. A three-class model was preferable over two- and four-class models (<xref rid="pone.0261746.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).

                <p>We used linear regression, overall and stratified by HIV serostatus, to evaluate the association between latent class and the composite biomarker index. Although ordinal regression is a possible alternative, because the difference between the scores of 0 and 1, 1 and 2, 2 and 3, and 3 and 4 have the same interpretation (i.e., one additional biomarker in the high-risk range), we were able to appropriately harness the greater statistical power of linear regression for this analysis. This increased power is particularly useful in this study with a smaller sample size. This approach has been applied successfully elsewhere [<xref rid="pone.0261746.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0261746.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. In full multivariable models, we adjusted for socio-demographics, behavioral factors, menopausal status, BMI, and CD4+ cell count and HIV viral load (among WLWH only). Given the sample size, we also created parsimonious models by removing covariates with the highest p-values from full multivariable models in a stepwise manner until the maximum adjusted R-squared value was reached, beyond which further covariate removal would result in lower adjusted R-squared values. Age, race/ethnicity, and HIV status (in the overall sample) were retained in parsimonious models regardless of p-values. We also assessed associations between CD4+ cell count/HIV viral load and the composite biomarker index.</p>
                <p>Regression analyses were further conducted separately among all non-Hispanic Black participants, non-Hispanic Black WLWH, and non-Hispanic Black HIV-negative women. Recognizing that Black individuals who identify with at least one other race (i.e., biracial, mixed-race, or multiracial individuals) are often racialized as Black, yet have unique experiences associated with existing at the intersections of multiple racial identities, we conducted these subgroup analyses once among participants who identified exclusively as Black and again among all participants who identified as Black regardless of whether they also identified with another race. There were insufficient sample sizes to conduct similar analyses among other racial/ethnic subgroups.</p>
                <p>In sensitivity analyses, we repeated analyses with data excluded for participants who reported either not collecting all urine during the 12-hour period or use of substances on the day of urine collection that could have influenced biomarker concentrations (i.e., heavy alcohol use, crack cocaine use). P-values &lt;0.05 were considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses (except latent profile analysis) were conducted using SAS Version 9.4.</p>

                <p>Among 90 participants, 56 (62%) were WLWH. Characteristics are provided in <xref rid="pone.0261746.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> for the full sample and stratified by HIV serostatus. Socio-demographics were similar between WLWH and HIV-negative women. Overall, the median age was 55 years (IQR: 49–62; range: 36–73), 53% were non-Hispanic Black, 34% were multiracial, 6% were non-Hispanic white, and 6% were Hispanic. One-third of participants were current smokers, 8% reported recent substance use, and 27% reported current use of a prescribed psychotropic medication. WLWH were more likely than HIV-negative women to abstain from alcohol use (66% vs. 27%). Nearly three-quarters of women (72%) were postmenopausal and median BMI was 32.6 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (IQR: 28.5–38.4). Among WLWH, 91% currently used antiretroviral therapy (66% with an integrase strand transfer inhibitor; 30% with a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor; 16% with a protease inhibitor), 86% had CD4+ cell counts &gt;500 cells/μL, and 89% had HIV viral loads &lt;20 copies/mL.</p>

An additional four participants (4%) reported that more than a few drops of urine were missing from the collection container due to another reason such as spilling. Aside from one reported asthma attack, no respiratory illnesses (e.g., cold, flu), fevers, or other acute illnesses were reported during the collection period. Three participants (3%) reported alcohol use (two reported one drink and one reported five drinks), five (6%) reported marijuana use, and one (1%) reported crack cocaine use on the day of the collection.

Prior to covariate adjustment, women with moderate psychosocial stress had a 0.51-higher (95% CI: 0.06, 0.97) mean composite biomarker index compared with women with low psychosocial stress. Among WLWH, women with high psychosocial stress had a 0.85-higher (95% CI: 0.06, 1.64) mean composite biomarker index compared with women with low psychosocial stress. Associations for CD4+ T cell count and HIV viral load (detectable vs. undetectable using a 20 copies/mL threshold) with the composite biomarker index were not significant (p = 0.56 and p = 0.23, respectively). In full multivariable models, psychosocial stress was not significantly associated with the composite biomarker index among all women, WLWH, or HIV-negative women. Results based on parsimonious models were largely similar, although high (vs. low) psychosocial stress appeared marginally associated with higher mean composite biomarker index values among WLWH (β = 0.80; 95% CI: -0.004, 1.61).</p>

Prior to covariate adjustment, monoracial Black WLWH with high psychosocial stress had a 0.98-higher (95% CI: 0.01, 1.96) mean composite biomarker index compared with monoracial Black WLWH with low psychosocial stress. In full multivariable models, high (vs. low) psychosocial stress was positively and significantly associated with higher mean composite biomarker index values among all monoracial Black women (β = 1.32; 95% CI: 0.20, 2.43), monoracial Black WLWH (β = 1.93; 95% CI: 0.02, 3.83), and monoracial Black HIV-negative women (β = 2.54; 95% CI: 0.41, 4.67). Results based on parsimonious models were similar. Associations were attenuated and none remained significant in analyses among all non-Hispanic Black women, which included those who identified exclusively as Black plus those who also identified with another race (data not shown).</p>

                <p>Results were similar after excluding 13 participants who reported either not collecting their urine every time they urinated during the collection period, losing more than a few drops of urine from the collection container due to spilling, or heavy alcohol use (i.e., 5 drinks) or crack cocaine use on the day of the collection. In multivariable models, psychosocial stress was not significantly associated with the composite biomarker index among all women, all WLWH, or all HIV-negative women. Among monoracial non-Hispanic Black women, high (vs. low) psychosocial stress remained positively and significantly associated with higher mean composite biomarker index values based on results from full multivariable models: β = 1.41 (95% CI: 0.23, 2.59; p = 0.021) among all Black women, β = 2.17 (95% CI: 0.16, 4.17; p = 0.037) among Black WLWH, and β = 2.25 (95% CI: 1.37, 3.13; p = 0.0038) among Black HIV-negative women.</p>
                <p>After using a bidirectional cutoff to define the high-risk quartile for urinary free cortisol (i.e., ≤2.9 μg/g creatinine or ≥29.1 μg/g creatinine), the fully adjusted association between latent profile and the composite biomarker index remained non-significant for all women, all WLWH, and all HIV-negative women. The fully adjusted association between high (vs. low) psychosocial stress and the composite biomarker index was attenuated among all monoracial Black women (β = 1.11; 95% CI: -0.17, 2.38; p = 0.086), whereas it changed little among monoracial Black WLWH (β = 1.88; 95% CI: 0, 3.76; p = 0.050) and monoracial Black HIV-negative women (β = 2.70; 95% CI: 0.23, 5.17; p = 0.039).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>In this study, we found a null association between psychosocial stress and a composite neuroendocrine biomarker index among the overall sample of WLWH and HIV-negative women and did not find evidence of a difference in this association between WLWH and HIV-negative women. However, our data demonstrate that higher levels of self-reported psychosocial stress were associated with more extreme concentrations of neuroendocrine biomarkers specifically among Black WLWH and HIV-negative women, although this was only the case among monoracial Black participants (and not among all Black participants, including those who identified with at least one other race). By incorporating multiple measures of psychosocial stress (i.e., general perceived stress, posttraumatic stress, and experiences of race- and gender-based harassment), we were able to more fully capture different domains of stress experienced by women. Given the strength of the association detected among subgroups of Black WLWH and HIV-negative women, findings among Black women reached statistical significance even with a relatively small sample size. Although this cross-sectional study cannot establish temporality or causality, our findings provide some support that psychosocial stress promotes hyperactivity of the HPA axis and SNS among Black WLWH and those who are HIV-negative, and highlights a potential mechanism by which chronic stress could contribute to increased inflammation and metabolic or cardiovascular abnormalities over time. Importantly, in this study, psychosocial stress appeared to be relevant in these neural pathways irrespective of HIV status. Additional studies are needed to further distinguish the relative contributions of psychosocial stressors from the effects of chronic HIV infection.</p>
              <p>This study builds upon prior research examining correlates of composite biomarker indices based on neuroendocrine, inflammatory, metabolic, and/or cardiovascular markers among other subpopulations of PLWH [<xref rid="pone.0261746.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0261746.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Previously identified correlates of having greater composite biomarker index values have included HIV-positive status among Black and Latina mothers [<xref rid="pone.0261746.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], lower psychological resilience among older Black PLWH [<xref rid="pone.0261746.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], PTSD among Black bisexual men living with HIV [<xref rid="pone.0261746.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], and adverse childhood experiences among middle-aged PLWH [<xref rid="pone.0261746.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. We specifically focused on neuroendocrine biomarkers, which are proximal markers of HPA axis and SNS activation that influence inflammation and metabolic and cardiovascular dysfunction [<xref rid="pone.0261746.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0261746.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0261746.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Unlike prior similar studies, we measured an intersectional form of stress experienced by women of color (i.e., race- and gender-related).</p>
              <p>Although results were null for the larger sample of women of all races and ethnicities, our findings for Black WLWH and HIV-negative women are consistent with prior research of discrimination and neuroendocrine activity among Black populations. The association between racial discrimination and HPA axis dysregulation due to repeated and prolonged cortisol secretion is well documented in Black Americans [<xref rid="pone.0261746.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0261746.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. Greater racial discrimination has also been linked to increased catecholamine activity among Black men and women [<xref rid="pone.0261746.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0261746.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. Importantly, some evidence suggests that protective factors such as higher educational attainment, higher income, and greater religious engagement can buffer the association between discrimination and neuroendocrine activity among Black Americans [<xref rid="pone.0261746.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0261746.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>].</p>
              <p>Although we assessed recent experiences of race- and gender-related harassment, our use of general symptom-based measures for perceived stress and posttraumatic stress limited our ability to identify the sources of those types of stress reported by participants. Previously reported stressors among WLWH have included difficulties with HIV serostatus disclosure, challenges with medication adherence, HIV-related discrimination, mental health or substance use problems, relationship challenges, caretaking for family members, and financial difficulties [<xref rid="pone.0261746.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. Null findings among the overall study population may have been related to the use of general measures for perceived and posttraumatic stress. Such general forms of stress may have had limited influence on the neuroendocrine biomarkers evaluated in this study.</p>
              <p>Results should be interpreted within the context of several limitations. First, a 12-hour overnight urine collection period was chosen because it was more practical and acceptable for study participants compared with a full 24-hour collection period. Thus, biomarker measures correspond to the nadir of HPA axis and SNS activity and do not reflect the full diurnal cycle of cortisol, norepinephrine, and epinephrine release. Second, sample sizes were relatively small in analyses stratified by HIV status and/or restricted to non-Hispanic Black participants, which resulted in less precise estimates for associations. There were too few white and Hispanic participants to meaningfully conduct analyses among those racial/ethnic subgroups. Third, we used data-driven methods to classify psychosocial stress as low, moderate, or high (i.e., latent profile analysis) and to define high-risk ranges for each biomarker (i.e., upper or lower quartiles). While this approach facilitated comparisons of composite biomarker index values according to varying degrees of stress levels within the sample, it limits our ability to determine whether stress levels and biomarker concentrations were clinically meaningful. This initial study demonstrated feasibility and additional research should evaluate the association between levels of stress and clinical endpoints. Fourth, covariates were measured at core WIHS visits that occurred up to nine months before the date of data collection for this study. The fact that values for time-varying covariates could have changed between when they were measured and when psychosocial stress and neuroendocrine biomarkers were measured could have resulted in residual confounding. Fifth, we lacked data on relevant behavioral factors such as regular diet, exercise, and sleep habits, which could have resulted in unmeasured confounding.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>In summary, this study found that higher levels of psychosocial stress were associated with more extreme concentrations of neuroendocrine biomarkers among monoracial Black women living with or without HIV, but not among the larger study population. Findings point to a plausible mechanism by which chronic stress could contribute to increased inflammation and metabolic or cardiovascular abnormalities over time among Black WLWH and HIV-negative women. Future research with larger study samples should evaluate whether this association differs by HIV status among Black women, by race or ethnicity among WLWH, or by gender among PLWH. The effects of psychosocial stress and neuroendocrine biomarker concentrations on inflammatory, metabolic, and cardiovascular outcomes among WLWH should also be further evaluated. Finally, research is needed to determine if interventions to manage or reduce psychosocial stress can influence clinical outcomes among Black and other WLWH.</p>

              </p>
              <p>2. We note that you have indicated that data from this study are available upon request. PLOS only allows data to be available upon request if there are legal or ethical restrictions on sharing data publicly. For information on unacceptable data access restrictions, please see <ext-link xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability#loc-unacceptable-data-access-restrictions" ext-link-type="uri">http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability#loc-unacceptable-data-access-restrictions</ext-link>.</p>
              <p>In your revised cover letter, please address the following prompts:</p>
              <p>a) If there are ethical or legal restrictions on sharing a de-identified data set, please explain them in detail (e.g., data contain potentially identifying or sensitive patient information) and who has imposed them (e.g., an ethics committee). Please also provide contact information for a data access committee, ethics committee, or other institutional body to which data requests may be sent.</p>
              <p>b) If there are no restrictions, please upload the minimal anonymized data set necessary to replicate your study findings as either Supporting Information files or to a stable, public repository and provide us with the relevant URLs, DOIs, or accession numbers. Please see <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.bmj.com/content/340/bmj.c181.long" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.bmj.com/content/340/bmj.c181.long</ext-link> for guidelines on how to de-identify and prepare clinical data for publication.

              <p>We will update your Data Availability statement on your behalf to reflect the information you provide.</p>
              <p>3. Thank you for stating the following in the Competing Interests section:</p>
              <p>"The authors have declared that no competing interests exist."</p>
              <p>We note that one or more of the authors are employed by a commercial company: Westat.</p>
              <p>(1) Please provide an amended Funding Statement declaring this commercial affiliation, as well as a statement regarding the Role of Funders in your study. If the funding organization did not play a role in the study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript and only provided financial support in the form of authors' salaries and/or research materials, please review your statements relating to the author contributions, and ensure you have specifically and accurately indicated the role(s) that these authors had in your study. You can update author roles in the Author Contributions section of the online submission form.</p>
              <p>Please also include the following statement within your amended Funding Statement.</p>
              <p>“The funder provided support in the form of salaries for authors [insert relevant initials], but did not have any additional role in the study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript. The specific roles of these authors are articulated in the ‘author contributions’ section.”</p>
              <p>If your commercial affiliation did play a role in your study, please state and explain this role within your updated Funding Statement.</p>
              <p>(2) Please also provide an updated Competing Interests Statement declaring this commercial affiliation along with any other relevant declarations relating to employment, consultancy, patents, products in development, or marketed products, etc.  </p>
              <p>Within your Competing Interests Statement, please confirm that this commercial affiliation does not alter your adherence to all PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials by including the following statement: "This does not alter our adherence to  PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.” (as detailed online in our guide for authors <ext-link xlink:href="about:blank" ext-link-type="uri">http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/competing-interests</ext-link>) . If this adherence statement is not accurate and  there are restrictions on sharing of data and/or materials, please state these. Please note that we cannot proceed with consideration of your article until this information has been declared.</p>
              <p>Please include both an updated Funding Statement and Competing Interests Statement in your cover letter. We will change the online submission form on your behalf.</p>
              <p>Please know it is PLOS ONE policy for corresponding authors to declare, on behalf of all authors, all potential competing interests for the purposes of transparency.

              <p>Reviewer #1: “Psychosocial stress is associated with neuroendocrine biomarker concentrations</p>
              <p>among Black women living with or without HI" is a paper whose topic may be of interest to the readership of PLOS ONE. The current study takes an intersectional approach to examine the association between self-reported psychosocial stress and neuroendocrine biomarkers of stress among women living with HIV, with an emphasis on black women. This study contributes to the literature by focusing on understanding the potential mechanisms of cardiovascular disease among cis-gender women living with HIV, a population that has been neglected in research to date. This study supports and extends previous research by highlighting the role of stress, especially racial and gender-based harassment on the physiological functioning of black women living with HIV. However, I have one major concern about the misalignment between how the article is framed in the introduction and the results that are presented. What follows are my concerns and points of clarification.</p>
              <p>Overall Concern</p>
              <p>The authors frame the manuscript as an examination of stress in Black women living with HIV. This is present in the title and introduction. However, the authors actually examined the role of self-reported stress and biomarkers of stress among women of all ethnicities. As a result of this misalignment, the point of the paper gets lost. It appears the original research question was related to all women living with HIV as compared to those who were HIV-negative and that the sub-analysis among black women was part of a fishing expedition given the null findings of the main analysis.</p>
              <p>Given the authors interest in understanding how race and gender-related stress impact health of women living with HIV, I recommend that the authors dedicate some time to fully addressing how racism and sexism may impact the stress and health of Black women living with HIV in the introduction; remove the analysis which included all women (currently the main analysis), and focus on the analysis examining the associations of interests among Black women living with HIV and those who were not. Alternatively, the authors might keep the analysis which includes all women as and include it with the other supplementary analysis that was conducted – however, I believe it would be best just to remove it.</p>
              <p>Introduction</p>
              <p>1. I would be careful when addressing how stress related to socioeconomic status is related to the health of women living with HIV. The authors do not measure socioeconomic status is a meaningful way (above or below $30,000 is not an approximate proxy for SES), therefore, the introduction should focus on the potential impact of racism, sexism, posttraumatic stress, and other perceived stress on the health of this population.</p>
              <p>Methods</p>
              <p>1. It should be noted that no traumatic event was indexed on the PTSD checklist. This is problematic because the “Stressful event” referenced in the questions may not meet criteria for a traumatic event. This is briefly noted in the limitations but should also be stated in the methods. The authors may also consider removing this measure all together since it is very difficult to differentiate between generalized anxiety and PTSD with understanding the index event. For example, the sample questions presented by the authors is “Avoiding activities or situations because they reminded you of a stressful experience”. It is difficult to distinguish between social anxiety and re-experiencing a traumatic event if there is no index event. Alternatively, the authors may separate the scores for racial and gender harassment and use them as separate indicators in the LCA. Therefore, they could still have three indicators of the LCA if they removed the PTSD scale.</p>
              <p>2. Please clarify that the subgroup analysis conducted among Black women is stratified by HIV status.</p>
              <p>Discussion</p>
              <p>1. Again, the authors should be careful with attributing the stress of participants to SES, since SES was not appropriately measured and not included in the measurement of stress.</p>
              <p>2. Also, the authors should be careful not to attributed PTSD symptoms to the experiences of violence reported by the participants, since no index event was reported for the checklist.</p>
              <p>Decision: Revise and Resubmit, with Major Revisions</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: The focus of the study was to examine the relationship between psychosocial stress and neuroendocrine biomarkers among women living with HIV. This article was well written and presents novel findings about a population which experience marginalization due to race, gender, and HIV status. The major concerns about this article are how the findings are framed and the choice in analytic methods. I offer a few suggestions for improving the manuscript.</p>
              <p>Major comments</p>
              <p>- The premise of the article is that racial discrimination could lead to differential outcomes among Black women, however the stress measures were general. For the one measure that specifically identified race-related stress, the racial and gender harassment scale, participants across racial groups had similar scores. Additionally, biomarker scores were similar across group. Temper findings and lead with the null finding that the relation between psychosocial stress latent profile and biomarker index was null, however there is some evidence that this relationship varies by racial category. In the discussion explain why the main finding and subgroup analyses among WLWH compared to HIV-negative women, were null.</p>
              <p>- The sub-group analyses within Black women are rather small and do not provide anything meaningful beyond what is gleaned from the full sample of Black women. Cut the analyses for the WLWH and HIV negative women.</p>
              <p>- Linear regression was used for multivariable analyses, however the biomarker index is not truly a continuous variable. Ordinal logistic regression should be used instead.</p>
              <p>Minor comments</p>
              <p>- Page 11, Line 219: If possible, find an alternate item to use as the example that does not include the racial slurs.</p>
              <p>- Page 11, Line 224: Describe race/ethnicity categories and rationale for all the participants who were grouped in the other category. Were sensitivity analyses conducted to examine whether including multiracial participants who checked Black into the analyses for participants who solely checked Black? Often multiracial people who are Black and another race are racialized as Black and may have similar stressors.</p>

              <p>Dear Dr. Washio,</p>
              <p>Thank you for the opportunity to revise this manuscript, titled “Psychosocial stress and neuroendocrine biomarker concentrations among women living with or without HIV” (PONE-D-20-27314). Please find below indication of where changes were made in response to the comments provided by the reviewers. We are happy to make additional revisions as deemed necessary.</p>
              <p>Reviewer 1</p>
              <p>Comment: “Psychosocial stress is associated with neuroendocrine biomarker concentrations among Black women living with or without HIV" is a paper whose topic may be of interest to the readership of PLOS ONE. The current study takes an intersectional approach to examine the association between self-reported psychosocial stress and neuroendocrine biomarkers of stress among women living with HIV, with an emphasis on black women. This study contributes to the literature by focusing on understanding the potential mechanisms of cardiovascular disease among cis-gender women living with HIV, a population that has been neglected in research to date. This study supports and extends previous research by highlighting the role of stress, especially racial and gender-based harassment on the physiological functioning of black women living with HIV. However, I have one major concern about the misalignment between how the article is framed in the introduction and the results that are presented. What follows are my concerns and points of clarification.</p>
              <p>Response: We thank Reviewer 1 for reviewing this manuscript and for providing comprehensive and thoughtful feedback. We have reframed the manuscript and provided additional information to address this reviewer’s questions and concerns. Please see our responses below each specific comment for additional details regarding our revisions, including those pertaining to the major concern about the misalignment between how the article is framed and the introduction and results that are presented.</p>
              <p>Comment: Overall Concern: The authors frame the manuscript as an examination of stress in Black women living with HIV. This is present in the title and introduction. However, the authors actually examined the role of self-reported stress and biomarkers of stress among women of all ethnicities. As a result of this misalignment, the point of the paper gets lost. It appears the original research question was related to all women living with HIV as compared to those who were HIV-negative and that the sub-analysis among black women was part of a fishing expedition given the null findings of the main analysis.</p>
              <p>Given the authors interest in understanding how race and gender-related stress impact health of women living with HIV, I recommend that the authors dedicate some time to fully addressing how racism and sexism may impact the stress and health of Black women living with HIV in the introduction; remove the analysis which included all women (currently the main analysis), and focus on the analysis examining the associations of interests among Black women living with HIV and those who were not. Alternatively, the authors might keep the analysis which includes all women as and include it with the other supplementary analysis that was conducted – however, I believe it would be best just to remove it.</p>
              <p>Response: We thank the reviewer for these comments. As pre-planned, our primary objective was to “evaluate associations between psychosocial stress (i.e., perceived stress, posttraumatic stress, and experiences of race- and gender-based harassment) and a composite neuroendocrine biomarker index among WLWH and HIV-negative women” of all races and ethnicities (line 102 in the version with tracked changes). We “hypothesized that this association would be stronger among WLWH compared with HIV-negative women” (line 107 in the version with tracked changes). Rather than representing a fishing expedition, our analyses conducted among the subgroup of Black participants were pre-planned based on (1) the large proportion of WLWH in the United States, DC, and this study population who identify as Black; (2) the body of empirical research demonstrating the relationship between racism or racial microaggressions and stress; and (3) our inclusion of the Racialized Sexual Harassment Scale as a measure of harassment related to one’s race or ethnicity and/or gender, which has greater relevance to women of color. We have clarified in the Introduction that this subgroup analysis was secondary: “Given that Black WLWH disproportionately experience stress related to intersecting social-structural vulnerabilities [60-62], we also conducted a secondary subgroup analysis in which we evaluated this association specifically among Black women” (line108 in the version with tracked changes). We have reframed this manuscript to more accurately reflect our original objectives and have revised the title to “Psychosocial stress and neuroendocrine biomarker concentrations among women living with or without HIV.” Reflecting these objectives, we have opted to retain the overall study population (of all races or ethnicities) in our analysis and to continue to report both results for the overall study sample and the subset of Black participants.</p>
              <p>The introduction is now better aligned with this focus. The second paragraph focuses on psychosocial stress among WLWH in general, and we further expand upon this paragraph in the third paragraph to address how racism and sexism may impact the stress and health of Black women and Black WLWH, consistent with our secondary objective: “At the end of 2019, 57% of all WLWH in the United States were Black women [20]. Among Black women, discrimination attributed to racism and sexism is common and is associated with elevated stress [21, 22]. Gendered racism, or the simultaneous experience of both racism and sexism, is an inherent stressor that can negatively affect personal relationships, professional and economic opportunities, and mental and physical health outcomes among Black women [23-26]. Gendered racism causes psychosocial stress both directly and through increased vulnerability to other stressors [21, 23-25]. Further, among Black WLWH, the effects of gendered racism and HIV-based discrimination can compound one another, representing key social-structural barriers to HIV care [27].”</p>
              <p>Our discussion section is also better aligned with this focus, as it begins with: “In this study, we found a null association between psychosocial stress and a composite neuroendocrine biomarker index among the overall sample of WLWH and HIV-negative women and did not find evidence of a difference in this association between WLWH and HIV-negative women. However, our data demonstrate that higher levels of self-reported psychosocial stress were associated with more extreme concentrations of neuroendocrine biomarkers specifically among Black WLWH and HIV-negative women, although this was only the case among monoracial Black participants (and not among all Black participants, including those who identified with at least one other race).”</p>
              <p>Comment: Introduction: 1. I would be careful when addressing how stress related to socioeconomic status is related to the health of women living with HIV. The authors do not measure socioeconomic status is a meaningful way (above or below $30,000 is not an approximate proxy for SES), therefore, the introduction should focus on the potential impact of racism, sexism, posttraumatic stress, and other perceived stress on the health of this population.</p>
              <p>Response: We agree with this comment and have removed mention of socioeconomic status from the introduction. The introduction focuses on the potential impact of perceived stress, posttraumatic stress, racism, and sexism, reflecting the key measures from this study.</p>
              <p>Comment: Methods: 1. It should be noted that no traumatic event was indexed on the PTSD checklist. This is problematic because the “Stressful event” referenced in the questions may not meet criteria for a traumatic event. This is briefly noted in the limitations but should also be stated in the methods. The authors may also consider removing this measure all together since it is very difficult to differentiate between generalized anxiety and PTSD with understanding the index event. For example, the sample questions presented by the authors is “Avoiding activities or situations because they reminded you of a stressful experience”. It is difficult to distinguish between social anxiety and re-experiencing a traumatic event if there is no index event. Alternatively, the authors may separate the scores for racial and gender harassment and use them as separate indicators in the LCA. Therefore, they could still have three indicators of the LCA if they removed the PTSD scale.</p>
              <p>Response: We thank the reviewer for raising this point and have added language to the methods section indicating that no traumatic event was indexed on the PTSD checklist: “The PCL-C asks about symptoms in relation to generic stressful experiences rather than in relation to a specific index event. Although this aspect of the PCL-C facilitates its use in different populations, it also limits its ability to identify sources of stress and determine whether stressful experiences meet criteria for a traumatic event” (line 206 in the version with tracked changes). We also acknowledged this limitation in the discussion section: “Although we assessed recent experiences of race- and gender-related harassment, our use of general symptom-based measures for perceived stress and posttraumatic stress limited our ability to identify the sources of those types of stress reported by participants” (line 556 in the version with tracked changes). Despite this limitation, we think that stress in relation to stressful experiences in general is of relevance to our research question and that there is value in retaining this measure in the analysis, even if PCL-C items were not assessed with respect to a specific traumatic event. We opted to retain the PCL-C measure in our analysis as planned.</p>
              <p>Comment: 2. Please clarify that the subgroup analysis conducted among Black women is stratified by HIV status.</p>
              <p>Response: We have clarified that the subgroup analysis conducted among Black women was stratified by HIV status: “Regression analyses were further conducted separately among all non-Hispanic Black participants, non-Hispanic Black WLWH, and non-Hispanic Black HIV-negative women” (line 329 in the version with tracked changes).</p>
              <p>Comment: Discussion: 1. Again, the authors should be careful with attributing the stress of participants to SES, since SES was not appropriately measured and not included in the measurement of stress.</p>
              <p>Response: We agree with this comment and have removed the previous text that attributed stress of participants to SES (previously, “With approximately two-thirds of the sample having had an annual income &lt;$30,000 and approximately half having had at most a high school education, it is likely that challenges associated with low socioeconomic status contributed to stressors experienced by women in this study.”).</p>
              <p>Comment: 2. Also, the authors should be careful not to attributed PTSD symptoms to the experiences of violence reported by the participants, since no index event was reported for the checklist.</p>
              <p>Response: We agree with this comment and have removed the previous text that attributed PTSD symptoms to experiences of violence reported by the participants (previously, “Regarding possible sources of posttraumatic stress, 51% of WLWH and 55% of HIV-negative women in the WIHS have experienced physical violence, and 38% of WLWH and 40% of HIV-negative women in the WIHS have experienced sexual abuse.”).</p>
              <p>Reviewer 2</p>

We have reframed the manuscript and provided additional information to address this reviewer’s questions and concerns. Please see our responses below each specific comment for additional details regarding our revisions, including those pertaining to how the findings are framed and the choice in analytic methods.</p>
              <p>Comment: Major comments: The premise of the article is that racial discrimination could lead to differential outcomes among Black women, however the stress measures were general. For the one measure that specifically identified race-related stress, the racial and gender harassment scale, participants across racial groups had similar scores. Additionally, biomarker scores were similar across group. Temper findings and lead with the null finding that the relation between psychosocial stress latent profile and biomarker index was null, however there is some evidence that this relationship varies by racial category. In the discussion explain why the main finding and subgroup analyses among WLWH compared to HIV-negative women, were null.</p>
              <p>Response: We thank the reviewer for these comments. We have reframed this manuscript to more accurately reflect our original objectives and have revised the title to “Psychosocial stress and neuroendocrine biomarker concentrations among women living with or without HIV.” We have tempered findings and now lead with the null finding; at the beginning of the Discussion section, we state: “In this study, we found a null association between psychosocial stress and a composite neuroendocrine biomarker index among the overall sample of WLWH and HIV-negative women and did not find evidence of a difference in this association between WLWH and HIV-negative women. However, our data demonstrate that higher levels of self-reported psychosocial stress were associated with more extreme concentrations of neuroendocrine biomarkers specifically among Black WLWH and HIV-negative women, although this was only the case among monoracial Black participants (and not among all Black participants, including those who identified with at least one other race).” We also provide a possible reason for why the main findings were null: “Null findings among the overall study population may have been related to the use of general measures for perceived and posttraumatic stress. Such general forms of stress may have had limited influence on the neuroendocrine biomarkers evaluated in this study” (line 587 in the version with tracked changes). It may also be related to the smaller sample size, which limited our ability to detect significant differences, unless quite large. As mentioned in the Conclusion paragraph, “Future research with larger study samples should evaluate whether this association differs by HIV status among Black women, by race or ethnicity among WLWH, or by gender among PLWH” (line 623 in the version with tracked changes). Regarding the finding that self-reported stress measures and biomarker scores did not appear different across racial and ethnic groups, there were only 5 non-Hispanic white participants and 5 Hispanic participants (and 31 biracial, mixed-race, or multiracial participants who identified with different combinations of races), limiting our capacity to detect differences by race or ethnicity in this study.</p>
              <p>Comment: The sub-group analyses within Black women are rather small and do not provide anything meaningful beyond what is gleaned from the full sample of Black women. Cut the analyses for the WLWH and HIV negative women.</p>
              <p>Response: In the introduction section, we have specified that “we hypothesized that this association would be stronger among WLWH compared with HIV-negative women” (line 107 in the version with tracked changes). Although the sample sizes for WLWH and HIV-negative women are small when restricted to Black participants, we have opted to retain these findings in the manuscript because a positive association was consistently found in separate analyses among all Black women, Black WLWH, and Black HIV-negative women. Each regression model converged and the association between high psychosocial stress and a higher neuroendocrine biomarker index score was significant in each of these subgroups. Although we would have likely been unable to detect a statistically significant difference in this association between WLWH and HIV-negative women, a reader may want to know whether there was at least some evidence of this association differing by HIV status, which we did not find. In the discussion section, we state this limitation that “sample sizes were relatively small in analyses stratified by HIV status and/or restricted to non-Hispanic Black participants, which resulted in less precise estimates for associations” (line 600 in the version with tracked changes).</p>
              <p>Comment: Linear regression was used for multivariable analyses, however the biomarker index is not truly a continuous variable. Ordinal logistic regression should be used instead.</p>
              <p>Response: We thank the reviewer for raising this point. Although we agree that ordinal logistic regression is an alternative choice, we believe that linear regression is also appropriate, particularly in the context of a smaller sample size. We have provided our rationale in the manuscript: “Although ordinal regression is a possible alternative, because the difference between the scores of 0 and 1, 1 and 2, 2 and 3, and 3 and 4 have the same interpretation (i.e., one additional biomarker in the high-risk range), we were able to appropriately harness the greater statistical power of linear regression for this analysis. This increased power is particularly useful in this study with a smaller sample size. This approach has been applied successfully elsewhere [72-76]" (line 315).</p>
              <p>In the following similar studies, linear regression was used successfully to model allostatic load, the composite biomarker index score on which our study’s outcome measure was based:</p>

              <p>Comment: Minor comments: Page 11, Line 219: If possible, find an alternate item to use as the example that does not include the racial slurs.</p>
              <p>Response: We have replaced this item with an alternate item that does not include racial slurs: “Someone said they expected you to behave certain ways because of your gender and ethnicity (for example, expected you as a Black or Latina woman to wear inappropriate clothes, expected you as an Asian man to be self-controlled and disciplined, as an Asian woman to try to please others, as a Latino man that you would be unfaithful in relationships, etc.)” (line 238 in the version with tracked changes).</p>
              <p>Comment: Page 11, Line 224: Describe race/ethnicity categories and rationale for all the participants who were grouped in the other category. Were sensitivity analyses conducted to examine whether including multiracial participants who checked Black into the analyses for participants who solely checked Black? Often multiracial people who are Black and another race are racialized as Black and may have similar stressors.</p>
              <p>Response: We thank the reviewer for raising this point. We have added our rationale for including participants who identified with more than one race in a separate category and have also added a sensitivity analysis to examine whether results were influenced by inclusion of multiracial participants who checked Black in the subgroup analysis among Black participants. In the methods section, we state: “Recognizing that Black individuals who identify with at least one other race (i.e., biracial, mixed-race, or multiracial individuals) are often racialized as Black, yet have unique experiences associated with existing at the intersections of multiple racial identities, we conducted these subgroup analyses once among participants who identified exclusively as Black and again among all participants who identified as Black regardless of whether they also identified with another race” (line 331 in the version with tracked changes). In the results section, we report that results were null after inclusion of Black participants who identified with at least one other race: “Associations were attenuated and none remained significant in analyses among the subgroup of all non-Hispanic Black women, which included those who identified exclusively as Black plus those who also identified with another race (data not shown)” (line 494 in the version with tracked changes). In the first paragraph of the discussion, we acknowledge this finding: “our data demonstrate that higher levels of self-reported psychosocial stress were associated with more extreme concentrations of neuroendocrine biomarkers specifically among Black WLWH and HIV-negative women, although this was only the case among monoracial Black participants (and not among all Black participants, including those who identified with at least one other race)” (line 537 in the version with tracked changes).</p>
