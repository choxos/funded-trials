                  <p>Standard-dose, seasonal, trivalent, inactivated influenza vaccine induces moderate-to-low haemagglutination-inhibition antibody responses in people living with HIV.

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>In this double-blind, randomised, controlled trial, we recruited pregnant women with HIV from seven antenatal clinics in Soweto, South Africa. Pregnant women were eligible if they were aged 18–38 years, infected with HIV, and had an estimated gestational age of 12–36 weeks. Women were randomly assigned (1:1:1), using a computer-generated randomisation list, to receive inactivated influenza vaccine containing 15 μg of each of the three seasonal influenza strains for that year, as a single dose, a double dose, or two single doses 1 month apart. Participants and study personnel were masked to group allocation. Haemagglutination-inhibition antibody responses were measured for all groups in the mothers at enrolment and at 1 month after each vaccine dose, and in the single-dose and double-dose groups within 7 days of birth in the neonates. Immunogenicity analyses only included women with visits 28–35 days apart and infants who were born at least 28 days after maternal immunisation. The primary was seroconversion rate to each of the vaccine strains in the mothers 1 month after completion of the dosing schedule, and the primary safety outcomes were frequency of local and systemic reactions. Safety was assessed in mothers and infants until 24 weeks post partum and analysed in all participants who received at least one dose of vaccine.

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>Between Feb 11, and June 6, 2013, 800 pregnant women living with HIV were enrolled and randomly assigned to the single-dose (n=266), double-dose (n=265), or two-single-doses (n=269) group. In the analysable population, seroconversion rates in mothers 1 month after the final vaccine dose were significantly higher in the double-dose group (n=230; ranging from 29% to 65% for the three vaccine strains) than in the single-dose group (n=230; ranging from 18% to 49%; p≤0·019 for the three vaccine strains), but were similar between the two-single-doses group (n=220; ranging from 23% to 52%) and the single-dose group (p≥0·20 for the three vaccine strains). Safety outcomes were similar in the three groups, except for more injection-site reactions in recipients in the double-dose group.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Interpretation</title>
                  <p>A regimen of double-dose inactivated influenza vaccine gave slightly greater immunogenicity than did a single-dose regimen in pregnant women living with HIV. However, immunogenicity in the double-dose group was still lower than historical data from the same setting in pregnant women without HIV. More immunogenic vaccines are needed for pregnant women living with HIV to enhance transplacental transfer of vaccine-induced protective antibodies to their newborn infants.</p>

                  <p id="para50">Four randomised clinical trials have shown that vaccination of pregnant women against influenza reduces the risk of influenza illness in their infants during the first 6 months of life. However, the only trial that assessed vaccine efficacy among infants born to women living with HIV in South Africa did not detect a protective effect in this group. The lack of vaccine efficacy in infants exposed to HIV might be related to the reduced immune response to vaccination in pregnant women living with HIV. We searched PubMed for publications in English up until May 1, 2019, with no start date restriction using the terms “maternal influenza vaccination HIV”, “maternal influenza immunization HIV”, “pregnancy influenza vaccination HIV”, and “pregnancy influenza immunization HIV”. We found only one study that described immunogenicity in pregnant women with HIV and the antibody levels of their infants after two doses of inactivated A/H1N1/2009 pandemic monovalent vaccine (two doses of 30 μg) during pregnancy. That study reported that a two double doses regimen was moderately immunogenic and that seroprotective titres were present in 67% of mothers and 65% of infants at delivery. After the second dose, only a slight improvement in seroprotection was seen. We did the present analysis to assess if increasing the vaccine antigen content or administration of a second dose of vaccine would improve the immunogenicity of trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine in pregnant women living with HIV and the protection of their infants against influenza infection compared with a standard single dose of vaccination.</p>

                <p id="para180">Participants were given a commercially produced influenza vaccine (Vaxigrip; Sanofi-Pasteur, Lyon, France) that contained 15 μg of A/California/7/2009 (A/H1N1pdm09), A/Victoria/361/2011 (A/H3N2), and B/Wisconsin/1/2010 (Yamagata-lineage), as <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.who.int/influenza/vaccines/virus/recommendations/2013_south/en/" id="interrefs30">recommended</ext-link> for the southern hemisphere in 2013. Vaxigrip was approved in South Africa for use as a single dose in adults. The study pharmacist prepared inactivated influenza vaccine or sterile 0·9% normal saline solution (placebo) in identical syringes; the two preparations were visually indistinguishable. At enrolment (visit 1), all participants received two injections: inactivated influenza vaccine and placebo were given to the single-dose and two-single-doses groups, one in each arm, with inactivated influenza vaccine given in the non-dominant arm; and one dose of inactivated influenza vaccine was given in each arm of the participants in the double-dose group (ie, 30 μg of antigen per strain). 1 month later (visit 2), all participants received a single injection on their non-dominant arm, with the single-dose and double-dose groups both given placebo, and the two-single-doses group given another dose of inactivated influenza vaccine.</p>
                <p id="para190">Participant follow-up was done at the Respiratory and Meningeal Pathogens Research Unit, Soweto, South Africa. We tested immune responses on plasma samples collected from the women immediately before the first injection at visit 1, 1 month after the first injection and immediately before the second injection at visit 2, and 1 month after the second injection at visit 3. We also collected blood within 7 days of birth from the women and their neonates. After review of maternal haemagglutination-inhibition antibody titres, and that no differences were detected between the single-dose and two-single-doses groups, we made a post-hoc decision to analyse only infant blood collected from infants in the single-dose and double-dose groups. Haemagglutination-inhibition antibodies were measured as described previously.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p>
                <p id="para200">We did weekly active surveillance by home visit or telephone call from the time of enrolment through to 24 weeks post partum in mothers and infants for influenza-like illness. The criteria for diagnosing influenza-like illness in the women were onset in the past 7 days of symptoms including: a fever of 38·0°C or higher on oral measurement or history of chills, rigors, or feeling feverish; presence of cough, sore throat, or pharyngitis; presence of myalgia, arthralgia, or headache; or presence of dyspnoea, breathing difficulty, or chest pain when breathing. Criteria used for diagnosing influenza-like illness in infants were any of the following: axillary temperature of 37·8°C or higher or mother's perception that an infant was feverish, or both, without evidence of a non-respiratory localised source, coupled with at least one sign or symptom of acute respiratory illness in the past 72 h; or at least two signs or symptoms of acute respiratory illness in the past 72 h. Signs or symptoms of acute respiratory illness were respiratory rate of 60 or more breaths per min in infants aged 0–2 months and 50 or more breaths per min in infants aged 2–6 months and difficulty breathing reported by the mother, cough, wheezing, runny or congested nose, cyanosis or oxygen saturation below 90% on room air, chest wall in-drawing, grunting on expiration, and pus draining from either ear. Women and infants identified as having influenza-like illness during surveillance visits had respiratory secretions collected within 72 h of illness identification that were tested by influenza PCR. We also investigated by influenza PCR, participants who were admitted to hospital and who had unsolicited study clinic visits due to respiratory illness. Details on sample collection, influenza diagnostic and subtyping by PCR have been described previously.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref></p>
                <p id="para210">For routine assessment of reactogenicity and safety, the investigator (usually study nurse) observed each participant for 30 min after each injection to monitor immediate adverse events. Additionally, participants were provided with a diary card to document solicited local and systemic reactions for 7 days after each vaccination visit. For injection site reactions, severe reactions were defined as follows: severe tenderness as severe pain in the injected limb that increases when moved or when the movement was reduced, severe redness as redness in an area of 100 mm or larger in size, severe swelling as swelling in an area of 100 mm or larger in size, severe hardness as a large lump being felt wider than half the arm width, severe bruising as a bruise larger than 25 mm in size, and severe itching as itching that requires soothing cream. For systemic reactions, severe reactions were defined as severe weakness or tiredness as being unable to do normal activities during the day, severe headache as a headache requiring medication and being unable to do normal activities during the day; severe fever as an axillary temperature of 39·4°C or higher, and severe joint or muscle pain as severe aching that required medication and that restricted activity. Serious adverse events were collected throughout the study until 24 weeks post partum in women and infants.</p>

The primary outcome was the seroconversion rate to each of the vaccine strains in mothers 1 month after completion of the dosing schedule.</p>
                <p id="para230">Secondary objectives reported here were to compare the proportion of neonates born to women in the double-dose group with haemagglutination-inhibition titres of 1/40 or higher at age 7 days or younger (individually for each of the three vaccine strains) with the proportion in the single-dose group, to assess the relative efficacy of the double-dose and two-single-doses regimens compared with the single-dose regimen against PCR-confirmed influenza among the women and their infants until 24 weeks post partum.

Four fetal deaths occurred within 14 days of maternal vaccination, one in the single-dose group and three in the two-single-doses group (two after the first dose and one after the second dose), and were consequently deemed possibly related to maternal vaccination. However, this association was only based on temporal associations to vaccination (adverse event within 14 days of vaccination), which was decided a priori. The three women (including one twin pregnancy) did not report any local or systemic reactions after vaccination that could indicate a causative effect of the vaccine (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 7</xref>).

              <p id="para400">In pregnant women living with HIV, the use of a double dose of inactivated influenza vaccine slightly improved immunogenicity compared with a single dose, but at 1 month after vaccination fewer than 66% of women in the double-dose group seroconverted to the most immunogenic vaccine strain (ie, A/H1N1pdm09), which was lower than the 92% seroconversion seen in our 2011 cohort of pregnant women without HIV who were given a standard single dose of inactivated influenza vaccine.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> A second standard inactivated influenza vaccine dose did not improve the immune response in the current cohort of women. These results are in accordance with previous studies in non-pregnant women and men with HIV who had higher haemagglutination-inhibition antibody responses after high dose of inactivated influenza vaccine than after a single standard dose, but the responses were still inferior compared with those in adults without HIV.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Furthermore, a second dose of vaccine did not consistently increase seroresponses in pregnant or non-pregnant individuals living with HIV.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p>
              <p id="para410">Safety and immunogenicity of adjuvanted pandemic A/H1N1 vaccines have not been assessed in pregnant women with HIV, but immune responses in men and non-pregnant women living with HIV were higher with adjuvanted pandemic vaccines than with unadjuvanted pandemic vaccines.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> A systematic review assessing the immunogenicity of different influenza vaccine strategies among individuals living with HIV found that, for the A/H1N1 strains, booster doses of adjuvanted vaccines containing 7·5 μg of antigen and 60 μg of single-dose vaccine (high-dose inactivated influenza vaccine) strategies induced higher rates of seroconversion and seroprotection than did standard doses.<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> The 60 μg single-dose vaccine also emerged as the most immunogenic formulation for influenza-B strains, although no single strategy was significantly more immunogenic than the standard dose for A/H3N2.<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> To our knowledge, only one study to date has assessed immune response to two doses of a high dose (30 μg per dose) A/H1N1 monovalent vaccine in pregnant women living with HIV.<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> In that report, the second high-dose injection only slightly improved the proportion of women with haemagglutination-inhibition antibody titres of 1/40 or higher (73% after the first dose and 80% after the second dose) and who seroconverted (66% after the first dose and 72% after the second dose).<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para420">Although our cohort was heterogeneous, the participants had weak haemagglutination-inhibition antibody immune responses after vaccination with the inactivated influenza vaccine despite having generally normal CD4 cell counts and a high proportion being on antiretroviral therapy (ART). Possible reasons for this observation include residual immune dysregulation affecting both T-cell and B-cell quantities and function, immune activation, and immunosenescence.<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Richardson and Weinberg<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> showed that regulatory T cells have an important role in attenuating immune responses to inactivated influenza vaccine in pregnant women living with HIV, with high proportions of influenza-specific regulatory T cells being associated with both reduced haemagglutination-inhibition antibody titres and influenza-specific cell-mediated responses.</p>
              <p id="para430">In addition to protecting the mothers against infection with influenza virus, another potential benefit of inactivated influenza vaccine during pregnancy is to prevent infection in the neonates.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> Although our study was not powered to detect vaccine efficacy in infants exposed to HIV the incidence of influenza was similar in the three study groups. In our previous randomised controlled trial<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> infants born to mothers with HIV who had been given inactivated influenza vaccine had significantly higher haemagglutination-inhibition antibody titres than those born to mothers who had been given placebo, but titres were lower than in infants born to women without HIV who were given inactivated influenza vaccine. Compared with infants in the single-dose group, those in the double-dose group had increased haemagglutination-inhibition titres only for A/H1N1pdm09, but the titres and the proportion of infants with titres of 1/40 or higher against A/H1N1pdm09 were still lower than previously described for infants born to mothers without HIV who had been given a single dose of inactivated influenza vaccine (median geometric mean titre ranged from 41·8 to 93·3 and proportion with haemagglutination-inhibition titres of 1/40 or higher ranged from 60·0% to 81·1% for the three strains).<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> In the current study, we only did haemagglutination-inhibition assays in blood samples collected from infants in the single-dose and double-dose groups. The decision to forego the comparison of haemagglutination-inhibition titres at birth between infants exposed to single-dose and two-single-doses of inactivated influenza vaccine was based on the lack of benefit of the second dose of inactivated influenza vaccine on maternal haemagglutination-inhibition titres. Furthermore, we assumed that 28 days from time of vaccination to birth was the ideal interval for efficient transplacental transfer of antibodies,<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> and almost 20% of infants were born before this interval.</p>
              <p id="para440">The three vaccination regimens were well tolerated among pregnant women, with fewer than 48% of participants having at least one solicited local injection-site reaction and fewer than 53% having at least one systemic reaction. Except for a higher incidence of local reactions in women in the double-dose group, the safety profile was similar in the double-dose and two-single-doses groups compared with the single-dose group. Four fetal deaths occurred within 14 days of receipt of inactivated influenza vaccine and were attributed as being possibly related to the vaccination only due to the temporal association because no reactogenicity was reported in these mothers after vaccination. The incidence of fetal deaths in the current study—ie, 26 per 1000 births, is similar to the incidence of stillbirths estimated in 2015 in Soweto with administrative databases (22·5 stillbirths per 1000 births).<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> None of the infant deaths were attributed to maternal inactivated influenza vaccine vaccination.</p>
              <p id="para450">Limitations of this report include that the study was done during the transition of prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission management to option B+, such that some women with CD4 counts of 350 cells per μL or higher were still given zidovudine monotherapy during pregnancy. This fact raises the question of whether differential use of ART might influence antibody responses to vaccination. However, we have previously reported in a study of single-dose inactivated influenza vaccine in pregnant women before option B+, that plasma HIV viral load and use of ART at the time of vaccination were not associated with seroconversion 1 month after vaccination.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> Similarly, other studies in people with HIV before three-drug ART was available also showed that the CD4 count threshold below which antibody responses to inactivated influenza vaccine were compromised was 200 cells per μL.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Women in this category were treated with three-drug ART in the current study. Collectively, these observations support the hypothesis that the effect of ART on antibody responses to the vaccine depends on the extent to which they promote immune reconstitution and the use of three-drug ART in the most immune-compromised women in the current study was more likely to have homogenised antibody responses to vaccination. Other study limitations were that only one influenza season was covered and a single inactivated influenza vaccine formulation was assessed at a single study site. Also, only 37% of participants had CD4 counts of less than 350 cells per μL. Although this low proportion prevents us from generalising our findings to a population with severe immunosuppression, it accurately represents the current landscape of HIV infection globally, in which individuals with HIV are treated earlier than in the past. By contrast, since only 27% of the women were virologically suppressed, a more in-depth analysis is needed to better understand the association between HIV viral load and immune responses to inactivated influenza vaccine. Another limitation was that only 397 (76%) of 525 infants were included in the analysis of haemagglutination-inhibition antibody titres on or before age 7 days, although they were distributed equally across study groups. Furthermore, the observed immunogenicity in the single-dose group was lower than anticipated in the sample size calculation, which could have affected the power of the study.</p>
              <p id="para460">Despite lower humoral responses to influenza vaccination in individuals living with HIV, inactivated influenza vaccine is efficacious, and vaccination of this vulnerable population should continue.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Nonetheless, the results for the current study show that doubling the dose of antigen or administration of a second dose of non-adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccine did not increase the immunogenicity of the vaccine in women living with HIV to levels similar to those of women without HIV. These findings emphasise the need for continued efforts to find an improved influenza vaccine or vaccination strategy for this population to improve protection of their infants, such as exploring the use of high-dose inactivated influenza vaccine that is currently approved for older adults in pregnant women with HIV.<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref></p>
