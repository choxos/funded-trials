                <p>Acetyl-CoA
carboxylase (ACC) inhibitors offer significant potential
for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), hepatic steatosis,
and cancer. However, the identification of tool compounds suitable
to test the hypothesis in human trials has been challenging. An advanced
series of spirocyclic ketone-containing ACC inhibitors recently reported
by Pfizer were metabolized in vivo by ketone reduction, which complicated
human pharmacology projections. We disclose that this metabolic reduction
can be greatly attenuated through introduction of steric hindrance
adjacent to the ketone carbonyl. Incorporation of weakly basic functionality
improved solubility and led to the identification of <bold>9</bold> as a clinical candidate for the treatment of T2DM. Phase I clinical
studies demonstrated dose-proportional increases in exposure, single-dose
inhibition of de novo lipogenesis (DNL), and changes in indirect calorimetry
consistent with increased whole-body fatty acid oxidation. This demonstration
of target engagement validates the use of compound <bold>9</bold> to
evaluate the role of DNL in human disease.</p>

              <p>Acetyl-CoA carboxylase
(EC6.4.1.2) (ACC) is a biotin carboxylase
that catalyzes the ATP-dependent condensation of acetyl-CoA and carbonate
to form malonyl-CoA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></sup> The malonyl-CoA produced
by ACC serves two major physiologic functions. It is an essential
and rate-limiting substrate for de novo lipogenesis (DNL), and it
acts as an allosteric inhibitor of the enzyme carnitine-palmitoyl
transferase I (CPT-1). CPT-1 is responsible for the transport of long-chain
fatty acyl-CoAs across the mitochondrial membrane into the mitochondria
where they become available for fatty acid oxidation. The transport
step is rate-determining for this process. Thus, ACC is positioned
as a key physiologic switch regulating the transition from oxidative
to lipogenic metabolism. Metabolic perturbations, including suppressed
fatty acid oxidation and increased hepatic DNL, have been hypothesized
to contribute to ectopic accumulation of lipid species in muscle and
liver, which in turn have been hypothesized to play a causative role
in the molecular pathogenesis of insulin resistance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></sup> Inhibition of malonyl-CoA production by ACC is expected to simultaneously
inhibit DNL and increase flux through CPT-1, leading to increased
β-oxidation of long-chain fatty acids, and thus may lead to
reduced ectopic lipid accumulation and improved insulin sensitivity.
ACC inhibition is therefore an attractive biological target for the
treatment of metabolic diseases such as T2DM and nonalcoholic fatty
liver disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup> Consistent with this hypothesis,
antisense oligonucleotide inhibition of ACC significantly reduced
diet-induced hepatic steatosis and hepatic insulin resistance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup> The two closely related isoforms, ACC1 and ACC2,
are encoded by separate gene products that differ in tissue and subcellular
distribution.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></sup> ACC1 is primarily located
in liver and adipose tissue, while ACC2 is the dominant isoform in
skeletal and heart muscle. ACC1 is also expressed in multiple human
cancers, making it an attractive oncology target.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> We
sought balanced inhibitors of ACC1 and ACC2 to gain benefit from inhibition
of the enzyme in both liver and muscle.</p>
              <p>Several ACC inhibitors
have been disclosed in recent years, with
much consideration directed toward understanding whether selective
or balanced inhibition of ACC1/ACC2 is preferable. Published results
to date have been controversial in terms of both efficacy and safety
of the mechanism. Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> highlights selected

                <p>The N2-alkyl pyrazole
ketones with substitution
at the α-position to the ketone and the N1-alkyl pyrazole ketones
described in this work were synthesized by the general methods shown

These synthetic routes have been described in detail previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></sup> The mono- and dimethyl substituted ketone cores in Scheme <xref rid="sch1" ref-type="scheme">1</xref> were synthesized by α-alkylation of the respective
precursor ketones. Although the desired enolates could be formed at
low temperature by treatment of the ketone with lithium diisopropylamide
(LDA) or lithium hexamethyldisilazide (LHMDS), the rate of alkylation
(for example, with methyl iodide) was slow relative to the rate of
ring-opening β-elimination of the oxy-pyrazole anion. Notably,
addition of 1,3-dimethyl-3,4,5,6-tetrahydro-2(1<italic>H</italic>)-pyrimidinone
(DMPU) achieved both increased efficiency of enolate formation and
increased reactivity of the enolate to the desired alkylation. The
pyrazoloketones in Scheme <xref rid="sch2" ref-type="scheme">2</xref> were prepared by
regioselective addition of alkyl hydrazines to a cyclohexenone intermediate,
followed by functionalization of the olefin.</p>

                <p>Compound <bold>1</bold> was previously
disclosed as a candidate for in vivo efficacy and toxicology evaluation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> demonstrating good potency against human ACC1
and ACC2 (IC<sub>50</sub> = 111 and 9.8 nM, respectively) and low
human liver microsomal clearance (&lt;4.9 mL/min/kg). Key observations
during the preparation for and analysis of those in vivo efficacy
and safety studies guided the search for improved properties in subsequent
compounds. First, during synthetic scale-up, a byproduct arising from
ring-opening elimination of oxy-pyrazole was observed, presumably
via a retro-Michael reaction analogous to that shown in Scheme <xref rid="sch1" ref-type="scheme">1</xref>, an obstacle that was overcome but which increased
concern about potential instability of the β-pyrazoloxy-ketone
functionality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> Second, crystalline compound <bold>1</bold> exhibited low solubility, requiring a spray-dried dispersion
formulation to achieve adequate compound exposure in toxicology studies.
Third, the ketone functional group in <bold>1</bold> was reduced in
vivo to provide substantial circulating levels of the alcohol metabolite, <bold>1m</bold>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> The alcohol metabolite was
formed upon incubation of <bold>1</bold> with rat, dog, and human
liver microsomes, with reduction rates highest in dog and lowest in
rat.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></sup> Pharmacokinetic (PK) studies in
dog showed the alcohol metabolite <bold>1m</bold> had nine-times higher
exposure relative to parent compound <bold>1</bold> (see Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The metabolite had substantially reduced ACC1
and ACC2 potency (IC<sub>50</sub> = 8.7 and 1.0 μM, respectively;
see <xref rid="notes-1" ref-type="notes">Supporting Information, Table S1</xref>) relative
to parent, but the high level of ketone reduction was a concern for
two main reasons: (a) decreased confidence in human PK predictions
with ketone reduction as a primary metabolic pathway and (b) increased
off-target pharmacology risk due to high circulating levels of metabolite,
with our attention focused primarily on hERG inhibition because ketone <bold>1</bold> and alcohol <bold>1m</bold> had similar potencies versus
this ion channel (IC<sub>50</sub> = 34 and 57 μM, respectively).</p>

                <p>As a result of these observations from the study
of compound <bold>1</bold>, a decreased rate of ketone reduction became
the primary
objective in the design of new compounds. The initial hypothesis for
decreasing ketone reduction was to increase steric hindrance around
the ketone,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref></sup> leading to two approaches
for substitution proximal to the ketone: adding alkyl substituents
on the methylene adjacent to the ketone and altering the pyrazole
to the regioisomeric N1-alkyl (rather than N2-alkyl) derivative.</p>
                <p>Consideration of the crystal structure of <bold>1</bold> bound
in ACC provided support for exploring the α-substitution strategy.
As described previously,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref></sup> the ACC CT-domain
is an obligate homodimer, with the active site composed of residues
from each monomer (denoted A and B). An X-ray cocrystal structure
of <bold>1</bold> bound in a “humanized yeast” chimeric
CT-domain of ACC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref></sup> demonstrated binding
to the putative biotin binding site consistent with previous structures
(Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref></sup> Compound <bold>1</bold> bound in a generally hydrophobic cleft, with all of its polar atoms
satisfied and sequestered from competing solvent interactions. The
ketone and amide carbonyls made key hydrogen-bond contacts to the
protein, orienting the rigid spirocycle in a low-energy conformation
that allowed for ideal placement of polar and hydrophobic interactions
with a minimal loss of conformational entropy. There appeared to be
sufficient space adjacent to the ketone to accommodate substitution
with alkyl groups, though specific interactions with the protein were
not expected with small substituents. The probable impact of altering
the pyrazole regioisomer was less clear. A crystallographic water
was hydrogen-bonded to N1, but the water was calculated using HydroSite<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref></sup> to be low energy and easily displaced by a potential
N1-substituent. However, there was also potential that the increased
steric congestion would negatively impact the hydrogen-bond between
the ketone and the backbone NH.</p>

the amide carbonyl and NH-Glu-B2026. The pyrazolopyranone group was
sandwiched in a hydrophobic cleft lined with side chains of Leu-A1762,
Val-A1765, Leu-A1766, Ala-B1920, Val-B1923, and Phe-B1925. The hydrogen
bonding potential of the pyranone ether oxygen was unsatisfied, but
this region of the active site was capped by the side chain of Arg-B1954.
The distance between the ether oxygen and the guanidinium group of
the arginine (3.8 Å) was consistent with a weak electrostatic
interaction, which likely alleviated the thermodynamic penalty associated
with burying an unsatisfied hydrogen bonding group.</p>

                <p>The results of introducing substituents on the
carbon adjacent
to the ketone are shown in Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">1</xref>. For routine
screening, potencies were assessed versus human ACC1 and ACC2 using
recombinant enzymes in a Transcreener format.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> Consistent with the strategy employed in the identification of compound <bold>1</bold>, lipophilic efficiency (LipE) was a key parameter that was
used to evaluate the quality of new compounds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> Unfortunately, the monomethyl stereoisomers, <bold>2</bold> and <bold>3</bold>, and the dimethyl derivative, <bold>4</bold>,
demonstrated insufficient potency as ACC inhibitors. The additional
lipophilicity relative to parent compound <bold>1</bold> also increased
intrinsic clearance in human liver microsomes (hCL<sub>int</sub>,
Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">1</xref>). On the specific property of ketone
reduction, the qualitative rate of ketone reduction as assessed by
rate of alcohol formation in human liver microsomes was <bold>1</bold> &gt; <bold>2</bold> ≈ <bold>3</bold> &gt; <bold>4</bold> (data
not shown). Evaluation of the dimethyl derivative <bold>4</bold> in
a dog PK study (Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) showed a marked decrease
in the amount of alcohol metabolite <bold>4m</bold> relative to parent
ketone (23-fold greater exposure for <bold>4</bold>). Although the
α-alkylation approach did not seem likely to lead directly to
a candidate, these ADME data provided strong support for the hypothesis
that increased steric hindrance was a viable strategy for decreasing
the rate of reduction.</p>

                <p>The regioisomeric N1-alkyl pyrazole derivatives were the
alternative
structural change designed to increase steric hindrance around the
ketone. The synthetic route developed for these compounds also provided
the opportunity to replace the cyclic ether in compound <bold>1</bold> with a carbocycle, thus obviating the potential for retro-Michael
ring-opening. The potency of the corresponding cyclic ether and carbocyclic
analogues was similar for both the N2- and N1-alkyl series across
a range of analogues (data not shown). Although there was some concern
that removing the electron-donating ether might increase electrophilicity
of the pyrazoloketone and the associated rate of ketone reduction,
we believed that the steric effects of the N1-alkyl substituent would
dominate any change in electronics.</p>
                <p>The results of studies on
N1-alkyl pyrazoles are shown in Table <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="other">2</xref>. Compounds <bold>5</bold>, <bold>6</bold>, and <bold>7</bold> with varying steric
bulk of the N1-substituent showed an
encouraging profile. Importantly, the structural changes from <bold>1</bold> to <bold>5</bold>/<bold>6</bold> retained both ACC potency
and selectivity versus hERG. The relatively high LipE of compound <bold>6</bold>, which was reflected in the desirable balance of ACC potency
and human liver microsomal (HLM) stability, led to selection of R
= isopropyl as the preferred pyrazole N1-substituent. Having made
structural changes to the core of the molecule that increased steric
hindrance around the ketone and removed the potentially labile cyclic
ether linkage, we focused on the piperidine amide group to improve
solubility. Within the scope of 5,6-bicycloheteroaromatic groups (a
topology found to be important for potency in the discovery of compound <bold>1</bold>), weakly basic rings were targeted to achieve the most desirable
balance between solubility and hERG potency. Pyrrolopyridine <bold>8</bold> and benzimidazole <bold>9</bold> were two of the most promising
derivatives, with the benzimidazole <bold>9</bold> favorably differentiating
on both HLM stability and hERG activity. Furthermore, the solubility
at pH 1.2 of crystalline compounds <bold>8</bold> (2320 μg/mL)
and <bold>9</bold> (1980 μg/mL) increased substantially as compared
to crystalline compound <bold>1</bold> (20 μg/mL). To assess
the impact of pyrazole N1-substitution on the rate of ketone reduction,
the benzimidazole <bold>9</bold> was tested in a dog PK study; the
data depicted in Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> demonstrated a 24-fold
lower exposure to alcohol metabolite <bold>9m</bold> as compared to
parent compound <bold>9</bold>.</p>

to the ketone and to the pyrazole N1 in the bound structure of <bold>1</bold>. Notably, however, the pyrazoloketone group of compound <bold>6</bold> shifted by ∼17° relative to <bold>1</bold> such

(Table <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="other">4</xref>). Oral (po) administration (3 mg/kg)
to rats and dogs showed bioavailability of 40% and 54%, respectively,
consistent with the low microsomal clearance and good solubility at
low pH. The bioavailability following a 50 mg/kg oral dose in rats
was 106%, suggesting saturation of clearance.</p>

                <p>Consistent with the
role of ACC in modulating fatty acid oxidation,
oral treatment with <bold>9</bold> also produced acute reductions
in whole-body RER. To drive the basal fuel substrate utilization toward
increased dependence on carbohydrate usage (increased RER), rats were
fasted for 24 h and then re-fed a high sucrose diet for 48 h prior
to the experiment. Following baseline RER measurement, the rats were
dosed by oral gavage with a range of doses of <bold>9</bold> or vehicle.
Immediately following dosing, animals were returned to the metabolic
chambers and RER was monitored for an additional 105 min. Following
the last RER measurement, animals were euthanized and skeletal muscle
and plasma were collected for malonyl-CoA and drug exposure measurements,
respectively.</p>
                <p>Within 15 min of oral administration of <bold>9</bold>, dose-dependent
reductions in RER indicated a shift in fuel substrate utilization
toward increased net whole-body dependence on fatty acid utilization
(Figure <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>a). At the nadir, RER values in the

lead to downstream decreases in DNL and increases in the use of fatty

                <title>Human Clinical Evaluations</title>
                <p>The effects
described above
for liver and muscle malonyl-CoA, DNL, and RER in rats were the foundation
for a rat PK/PD model that was then applied to predict human dosing
for <bold>9</bold>. Quadriceps muscle malonyl-CoA level (QMCoA) in
rat was chosen as the primary mechanistic biomarker. On the basis
of the rapid formation and elimination (seconds to min) of malonyl-CoA
in muscle tissue, a direct response model was selected as a reasonable
approximation to describe the PK/PD relationship. Using the resulting
rat QMCoA PK/PD model and the predicted human PK of <bold>9</bold>, GastroPlus was used to project the steady-state dose necessary
to achieve 50% inhibition of human quadriceps ACC2 at the steady-state
average concentration (<italic>C</italic><sub>ave</sub>). These projections,
after correction for species differences in ACC2 enzyme potency (radiometric
assay) and plasma/tissue protein binding, were based on assumptions
of: (a) a 1:1 translation in QMCoA response between rats and humans,
and (b) as observed in rat, a 1:1 relationship between human free
muscle and free plasma drug concentrations. On the basis of these
assumptions and models, the clinical plasma concentration of <bold>9</bold> to achieve 50% inhibition of human quadriceps ACC2 was predicted
to be 14800 ng/mL (473 nM free), which would be achieved by a dose
of 125 mg once-daily.</p>
                <p>In the First-in-Human study, the safety,
tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of single doses of <bold>9</bold> were tested according to a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind,
parallel-group design. Seven sequential cohorts of healthy volunteers
were randomized to receive either <bold>9</bold> or placebo (six and
three subjects per cohort, respectively). Compound <bold>9</bold> was
administered at escalating doses ranging from 10 to 800 mg; the 800
mg dose was provided as split doses of 400 mg in the a.m. and p.m.</p>
                <p>Overall, single ascending doses of <bold>9</bold> were safe and
well-tolerated, exhibiting a benign adverse event profile similar
to placebo-treated subjects. Five adverse events were considered to
be potentially treatment related, including nightmare in two subjects
[one treated with placebo and one with <bold>9</bold> (800-mg split
dose)], gastroesophageal reflux disease in one subject treated with <bold>9</bold> (300 mg), dyspepsia in one subject treated with <bold>9</bold> (600 mg), and dry mouth in one subject treated with <bold>9</bold> (300 mg). All potentially treatment-related adverse events were
mild in intensity. In the fasted state, rapid absorption was noted
with median peak concentrations observed 1–2 h postdose (Figure <xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">11</xref>). The pharmacokinetic profiles exhibited low-to-moderate
interindividual variability in AUC and <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub>. AUC was approximately proportional to dose over the 10–800
mg range, while <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> was observed to be
slightly less than dose-proportional. Dosing in the presence of food
(300 mg dose) resulted in a delayed <italic>T</italic><sub>max</sub> (3.5 h), with marginal differences in peak and total exposure. Terminal
half-life values were consistent across doses and were independent
of dosing in the presence of food, with mean values of 10–13
h (data not shown).</p>

Hepatocytes</title>
                <p>Cryopreserved male Wistar rat hepatocytes from
Xenotech were thawed
and isolated using a percol rat hepatocyte isolation kit. Hepatocytes
were plated in seeding media containing high glucose DMEM, 5% FBS,
1 μM dexamethasone, 4 μg/mL insulin, 1% pen/strep, and
1% glutamine. Hepatocytes were plated in 48-well collagen coated type
I plates using a viable seeding density of 125000 cells/well in seeding
media to result in 80–90% confluency at 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and
37 °C. Media was aspirated 4–6 h later and fresh Hepatocyte
Modified Eagle Medium, Dr. Chee’s Modification (MCM) was added.
Fresh cold MCM media containing a 1:40 dilution of Matrigel, 250 ng/mL,
200 μL/well was added 24 h post seeding. The assay was run 72
h post seeding with a MCM media change the night before the experiment.</p>
                <p>On the day of the study, media was aspirated and cells were treated
with fresh MCM media containing DMSO vehicle or varying concentrations
of <bold>9</bold> as indicated. Compound was initially dissolved in
DMSO and subsequently diluted 1:100 in MCM. An aliquot of this solution
was added to the fresh MCM in each well, further diluting the compound
by 1:10. This dilution progression ensured that all wells had a final
DMSO concentration of 0.1%. After 5 h at 37 °C, incubation media
was removed and the experiment was terminated by washing the cells
with ice-cold PBS. Cells were lysed with the addition of 70 μL
of 10% trichloroacetic acid (TCA). Plates were mixed for 20 min at
4 °C and centrifuged at 2200<italic>g</italic> for 5 min. Supernatant
(48 μL) was transferred to a ScreenMates Clear 384 Well V Bottom
polypropylene microplates and frozen. Malonyl-CoA concentration was
measured using RapidFire mass spectrometry analysis. TCA, ammonium
acetate, methanol, acetone, acetonitrile, and water were used to make
the necessary mobile phases. Adenosine 5′-triphosphate disodium
salt hydrate (ATP) was used for sample preparation. Rapidfire Type
D Hypercarb cartridges were obtained from BioCius. Samples were provided
as 48 μL in 10% TCA. Then 2 μL of malonyl-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>3</sub>-CoA internal standard (0.4 pmol/μL final) and
2 mM final ATP in 10% TCA were added to the reaction and mixed. The
samples were analyzed on a RapidFire platform coupled to a Sciex API4000
triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (RF-MS). Malonyl-CoA and malonyl-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>3</sub>-CoA were monitored in positive ion mode following
MRM transitions at 854.1/347.1 and 857.1/350.1, respectively. Sample
(10 μL) was aspirated directly from assay plates quenched with
TCA (10% final). The aspirated sample was loaded onto the RF MS microscale
solid-phase Hypercarb extraction cartridge (D) and washed with HPLC
grade H<sub>2</sub>O in a 3 s wash cycle to remove the nonvolatile
assay components. The product and internal standard were coeluted
to the mass spectrometer in 3 s with 50% H<sub>2</sub>O, 25% MeCN,
25% acetone, and 5 mM ammonium acetate. Ion chromatograms were integrated
using the Rapidfire Integrator software. Peak area ratios (malonyl-CoA/malonyl-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>3</sub>-CoA) were compared against a standard curve
prepared in 10% aqueous TCA to determine sample concentrations of
malonyl-CoA. Malonyl-CoA values were expressed as pmol/μL and
compared against a standard curve. Dose response curves of malonyl-CoA
inhibition by ACC inhibitor compound <bold>9</bold> were generated
by plotting percent of control. An average EC<sub>50</sub> was determined
from seven independent experiments.</p>

Tissue concentrations for malonyl-CoA were calculated from a standard
curve prepared in a 10% solution of TCA in water and ranged from 0.01
to 1 pmol/μL. Malonyl-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>3</sub>-CoA (final
concentration of 0.4 pmol/μL) was added to each standard curve
component and served as an internal standard, and the resulting chromatograms
were integrated using Analyst software (Applied Biosystems).</p>

in Rats</title>
                <p>This procedure was derived from
a published method for the examination of rat liver de novo lipid
synthesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup> On the day of the study, male
SD rats, previously randomized into groups of seven based on body
weight, were administered a single dose of compound <bold>9</bold> or vehicle via oral gavage 2 h into the light cycle (8 a.m.). [2-<sup>14</sup>C]-Acetic acid (Amersham) was diluted to 64 μCi/mL
with saline prior to being administered intraperitoneally at 2.5 mL/kg
1 h postdose of compd/vehicle. Then 1 h following <sup>14</sup>C-acetic
acid administration, the animals were sacrificed (CO<sub>2</sub> euthanasia)
and liver samples collected (∼400 mg, bifurcated median lobe)
using disposable tissue biopsy punches. Analysis of DNL in these samples
was performed as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup></p>
                <p>Briefly, tissues were saponified in aqueous NaOH (1.5 mL of
2.5 M). Following complete degradation, absolute ethanol (2.5 mL)
was added to each sample and vigorously mixed. The samples were extracted
with petroleum ether (4.8 mL). Following centrifugation to separate
the organic and aqueous phases, the upper organic phase was removed
and discarded. Concentrated HCl (0.6 mL of 12 M) was added to the
remaining aqueous phase and vortexed vigorously. The acidified aqueous
phase was subsequently extracted with petroleum ether (4.8 mL) and
then centrifuged to separate the organic and aqueous phases. The upper
organic phase was collected in an appropriately sized scintillation
vial. The remaining aqueous phase was extracted with petroleum ether
as described above, and the organic phase was combined with the previous
extract. The combined organic phases were evaporated to dryness under
gentle flow of nitrogen at room temperature. Compatible scintillation
fluid was added to each vial, and the level of <sup>14</sup>C in the
extraction was determined.</p>
                <p>The data were analyzed with Microsoft
Excel and plotted using GraphPad
Prism 5. Statistical analysis (one-way ANOVA, Dunnett’s posttest)

                <title>RER Studies in Rats</title>
                <p>Male SD rats were fasted for 24
h and then re-fed a diet high in sucrose (D10001, Research Diets)
for 2 days prior to study initiation to elevate baseline respiratory
exchange ratio (RER). On the day of experiment, rats were removed
from their home cage, weighed, and individually placed into the calibrated
indirect calorimetery chambers (Oxymax, Columbus Instruments, Columbus,
OH) with free access to water and diet (D10001). Baseline oxygen consumption
and carbon dioxide production rates were measured every 15 min for
75 min before treatment. After collecting baseline calorimetery data,
rats were dosed orally with either vehicle control (0.5% methylcellulose/0.1%
tween 80) or <bold>9</bold> (1, 2, 5, 20, 40, or 100 mg/kg) and then
returned to the calorimetry chambers. Oxygen consumption and carbon
dioxide production were measured for an additional 2.25 h after being
placed back in the calorimetry chamber. Immediately following completion
of the calorimetry measurement period, the animals were sacrificed
by CO<sub>2</sub> asphyxiation followed by cervical dislocation. Plasma
for determining plasma exposure of compound <bold>9</bold> was collected
via cardiac puncture, and quadriceps muscles were rapidly removed,
freeze-clamped as described above, and stored at −80 °C.
Quadriceps malonyl-CoA content was measured as described above.</p>

                <title>DNL and RER Studies in Humans</title>
                <p>Studies involving human
subjects were conducted in compliance with the ethical principles
originating in or derived from the Declaration of Helsinki and in
compliance with all International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH)
Good Clinical Practice (GCP) Guidelines. In addition, all local regulatory
requirements were followed, in particular, those affording greater
protection to the safety of trial participants. Final study protocols
and informed consent document were reviewed and approved by the investigational
centers participating in the studies and by an independent Institutional
Review Board (IRB). The investigator was required to inform the IRB
of the study’s progress and occurrence of any serious and/or
unexpected adverse events. A signed and dated informed consent was
required before any screening procedures were initiated. The investigator
or his/her delegate explained the nature, purpose, and risks of the
study to each subject. Each subject was informed that he/she could
withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason. Each subject
was given sufficient time to consider the implications of the study
before deciding whether to participate. Subjects who chose to participate
signed an informed consent document.</p>
                <p>Safety, tolerability, and
pharmacokinetics were evaluated in the first-in-human study. A total
of 63 healthy volunteers (all male; mean age 32.6 years [range 20–45
years]; mean body mass index (BMI) 27.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; [range 21.3–35.1
kg/m<sup>2</sup>]) participated in the study. Seven sequential cohorts
of volunteers were randomized to receive either <bold>9</bold> or
placebo (six and three per cohort, respectively). Compound <bold>9</bold> was administered at escalating doses ranging from 10 to 800 mg;
the 800 mg dose was provided as split doses of 400 mg in the a.m.
and p.m. due to the prediction that <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> might exceed the exposure limits. Compound <bold>9</bold> was administered
after 10 h of fasting in a 10, 50, and 100 mg powder-in-capsule formulation.
The effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of <bold>9</bold> was evaluated
at the 300 mg dose. Safety and tolerability were assessed by adverse
event monitoring, laboratory values, and cardiovascular parameters
including blood pressure, heart rate, and electrocardiogram.</p>
                <p>The effects of <bold>9</bold> on inhibition of DNL and on whole-body
fuel substrate utilization was assessed in a randomized, double-blinded,
placebo-controlled crossover study in healthy volunteers (mean age
35.4 years [range 20–50 years]; mean body mass index (BMI)
29.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; [range 25.8–35.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>]).
Substrate utilization, assessed by RER, was measured in each of two
study periods. Subjects were randomized to receive a single oral dose
of <bold>9</bold> (600 mg) or placebo in the first period. In the
second period, subjects were crossed over to receive the other treatment
(placebo or <bold>9</bold>) at least 1 week apart. Oral fructose loading
was used during the DNL and RER assessments to provide reproducible
fractional contribution of DNL to VLDL-TG from one assessment period
to the other.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref></sup> A continuous infusion of <sup>13</sup>C-acetate (9–9.5 mg <sup>13</sup>C-acetic acid sodium
salt per min via an infusion pump) was started at approximately 10:00
a.m. on the evening prior to each treatment period and continued until
approximately 6:30 p.m. on the study day. Blood samples for assessment
of the fractional contribution of DNL to VLDL-TG were collected and
RER measures made hourly for 10 h. Subjects received study medication
(<bold>9</bold> or matching placebo) at approximately 08:00 h (plus
or minus 2 h). Subjects received a bolus of 0.25 g fructose/kg body
weight every 30 min starting at approximately 08:30 h for approximately
9.5 h (total of 20 fructose administrations) during each of the two
study periods. Urine samples for purpose of urinary nitrogen determination
were collected during each study period. Subjects refrained from eating
and drinking beverages other than water and the fructose drinks administered
as part of study procedures. DNL was measured by <sup>13</sup>C-incorporation
(derived from intravenous <sup>13</sup>C-acetate infusion) into VLDL
palmitate using mass isotopomer distribution analysis (MIDA).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref></sup> RER values reported are nonprotein RER as no
changes in urinary nitrogen were observed during or between the study
periods.</p>
