                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Despite the importance of regular moderate-intensity to vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA) for health benefits and long-term weight management, current comprehensive lifestyle interventions have focused on providing MVPA prescriptions and goals but with only minimal and intermittent focus on psychosocial theoretical constructs and novel strategies, perhaps explaining the often modest impact on adoption and maintenance of higher levels of MVPA. An intervention based on acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) targeting the increase of values-based autonomous motivation could improve the adoption and maintenance of habitual MVPA among insufficiently active overweight or obese adults in a brief intervention format.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>The overall aim of this study is to develop and test the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy of an ACT-based brief workshop intervention for increasing bouted MVPA for inactive adults with overweight/obesity using a single-arm design. A total of 48 inactive adults with overweight/obesity will be recruited and attend a 4-hour, ACT-based workshop followed by weekly emails and monthly phone calls for 3 months. The workshop will teach values clarification and acceptance-based skills to increase values-based autonomous motivation and bouted MVPA. Participants will self-monitor minutes of MVPA and personal values and report on progress via weekly emails and monthly phone calls. Assessments will be conducted at baseline and at 3 and 6 months.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Habitual moderate-intensity to vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA) performed in sustained bouts provides significant and wide-ranging health benefits<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1–4</xref> and is a key factor in long-term weight control<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 6</xref>; however, the impact of lifestyle intervention on MVPA is modest.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> For example, in the biggest lifestyle change intervention study to date, participants’ activity increased from 81 to 149 MVPA minutes in ≥10 min bouts (ie, bouted MVPA) per week on average over 1 year of intervention,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> with the majority of participants falling short of both the prescribed study goal (175 min per week) and the minimum recommendations (150 min per week),<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> a finding consistent with other randomised controlled trials (RCTs).<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Thus far research has focused on providing MVPA prescriptions and goals but with only minimal and intermittent focus on psychosocial theoretical constructs and novel strategies to facilitate adoption and maintenance, suggesting there is potential for improving outcomes through targeted, smaller scale, theory-driven research.</p>
              <p>Consistent with self-determination theory (SDT),<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> research suggests that motivation to engage in habitual physical activity (PA) varies to the degree to which it is experienced as autonomous, with higher autonomous motivation associated with greater habitual MVPA.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Recently, Teixeira and colleagues<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> conducted a systematic review of 66 studies using SDT and found strong evidence supporting the association between the presence of autonomous motivation and higher average levels of PA. Although there are different kinds of autonomous motivation, the review found that the strongest predictor of high, sustained levels of PA was engaging in PA because it was consistent with one’s personal values (referred to hereafter as ‘values-based autonomous motivation’). While SDT provides an excellent framework for understanding and identifying an important theory-based target (autonomous motivation), it does not provide validated treatment strategies for intervention.</p>
              <p>An intervention based on the newer generation behaviour therapy, acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT),<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> is ideally suited to increase and maintain high levels of PA by fostering values-based autonomous motivation using values clarification and commitment strategies. The primary goal of ACT is to foster behaviour change consistent with one’s personal values (ie, autonomously motivated behaviour change).<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> ACT uses values clarification strategies to help individuals identify how behaviours relate broadly to desired living for the individual. For example, increased PA can improve work performance, provide needed energy for parenting, improve intimacy, allow for engaging in desirable activities with friends or improve longevity for the purpose of witnessing family milestones, among many other possible values-based outcomes that can vary widely. ACT tailors values interventions to the individual, allowing them the autonomy of defining the purpose and degree of their behaviour change efforts. ACT also uses acceptance-based strategies to reduce cognitive and emotional barriers to engaging in values-consistent behaviour while undermining problematic sources of motivation (ie, non-autonomous motivators).<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> ACT is a robust technology with broad support for producing meaningful behaviour change in a variety of mental and physical health-related problem domains<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> and has shown promise in improving weight management<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13–15</xref>; however, it has not yet been carefully applied to PA.</p>
              <p>Therefore, the overall aim of this project is to develop and test the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy of an ACT-based workshop intervention for increasing bouted MVPA for overweight and obese, insufficiently active adults using a single-arm design. The primary goal of the workshop is to use values clarification and acceptance-based skills training to increase values-based autonomous motivation and bouted MVPA. If efficacious, the workshop intervention could be used both as a stand-alone intervention for inactive adults or as a component of a comprehensive weight loss or weight loss maintenance intervention.</p>

                <title>Intervention</title>
                <p>The ACT workshop is a 1-day, 4-hour, group-based intervention session delivered face to face in groups of 6–10. The use of ACT in a concentrated, workshop format is common, and has been shown to be effective and is one of the potential advantages of using such an approach.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> The intervention is delivered by a PhD clinical psychologist with extensive training in the development and delivery of interventions based on ACT for health behaviour change. The basic structure is an initial onsite, group-based intervention workshop, written materials, weekly emails, and monthly phone calls for a total of 3 months.</p>
                <p>The workshop is designed to increase values-based autonomous motivation in order to increase bouted MVPA. Participants engage in basic and advanced values clarification exercises designed to help clarify (1) the relative importance of major values domains (eg, social, vocational, recreational) and (2) the potential role of PA in empowering functioning in these domains. Participants generate their own PA goals and additional values-based goals by identifying activities that will impact important, personally identified valued domains. For example, a participant might strongly value parenting, and thus might set a goal for increased activity participation with their children (which would be a target on its own, but also is related to their PA goals by increasing energy level). In addition, acceptance strategies are taught to reduce cognitive and emotional barriers to meeting values-based goals. The delivery of ACT is experiential in nature, with frequent processing of thoughts and emotions. Finally, participants receive a FitBit Flex as part of the intervention, which is an activity-tracking device wristband to monitor their PA goal progress via the free FitBit app. See <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref> for detailed intervention content.</p>

                <p>Following the workshop, participants receive 12 weekly emails.

Each weekly email also contains a micro-intervention to support skills learnt in the workshop. Micro-interventions focus on the importance of connecting PA to personally stated values, applying acceptance-based skills in the presence of cognitive and emotional barriers, and supportive feedback.

                <title>Statistical analysis, sample size and power estimates</title>
                <p>The sample size was chosen in order to obtain reliable and precise estimates of treatment effect that are sufficient for determining whether continuation of the research (ie, refinement of the intervention for testing in a large-scale RCT) is justified. Based on prior studies with insufficiently active adults, we anticipate that participants will have a baseline mean of roughly 75 min of bouted MVPA. The intervention aims for ≥200 min of objectively measured bouted MVPA to achieve a mean of &gt;150 min per week, which is considered a clinically significant level of MVPA. Assuming an SD of approximately 150 min (as seen in prior studies) and a sample size of 48, the 95% CI around a true mean of 200 min would be 150–250 min. Therefore, if we achieve a mean of at least 150 min at study endpoint (6 months), we will consider the intervention to be minimally clinically significant and sufficiently efficacious to warrant further development and then testing in a larger scale.</p>
                <p>Generalised linear models will be estimated using generalised estimating equations (GEE) with robust SE estimate, which provides an extension of regression analysis to the case of correlated or repeated observations and allows for appropriate modelling of covariance structures when observations are correlated across time. Mean and error parameters generated by GEE will be used to calculate effect size. We will use the same GEE analysis method to calculate estimated marginal mean change in MVPA. The same GEE procedure will be used to examine change in <italic>CompACT</italic> and <italic>SRQ-E</italic> scores.</p>
                <p>The intervention will be considered feasible and acceptable if (1) we achieve an average of ≥70% completion on both email surveys and phone calls (indicating completion of the 3-month programme); (2) we achieve ≥70% retention at the follow-up assessment (6 months); and (3) the item score on the feasibility and acceptability questionnaire at post-treatment (3 months) is ≥4.0, with ≥70% of recorded responses indicating ‘somewhat agree’ or ‘totally agree’.</p>
