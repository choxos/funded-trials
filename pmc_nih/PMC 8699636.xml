              <abstract>
                <p>In this forthcoming multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial, we will investigate the augmentative effects of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, escitalopram, on language therapy in individuals with post-stroke aphasia. We hypothesize that, when combined with language therapy, daily escitalopram will result in greater improvement than placebo in an untrained picture naming task (Philadelphia Naming Test short form) administered one week after the end of language therapy. We also will examine whether escitalopram’s effect on language is independent of its effect on depression, varies with lesion location, or is associated with increased functional connectivity within the left hemisphere. Finally, we will examine whether individuals with BDNF met alleles show reduced response to treatment and reduced changes in connectivity. We expect to enroll 88 participants over four years. Participants are given escitalopram or placebo within one week of their stroke for 90 days and receive fifteen 45-minute computer-delivered sessions of language treatment beginning 60 days from the start of drug therapy. Patients then complete a comprehensive assessment of language at one, five, and twenty weeks after the last language therapy session. ELISA is the first randomized, controlled trial evaluating the effect of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor on the improvement of language in people with aphasia undergoing language treatment during the acute to subacute post-stroke period.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Aphasia is a devastating outcome of stroke. The primary intervention is speech and language treatment [SALT; <xref rid="pone.0261474.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0261474.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. SALT can be very effective. However, improvement in language through SALT is relatively slow and laborious [<xref rid="pone.0261474.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. While pharmacotherapies that augment plasticity might increase SALT efficiency, few prior studies have evaluated their effect on aphasia rehabilitation [<xref rid="pone.0261474.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0261474.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In this project, we will investigate the effects of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), escitalopram, on augmenting language therapy, as measured when naming untrained pictures and describing pictures in individuals with aphasia in the acute and subacute post-stroke period (i.e., within three months post stroke).</p>
              <p>Escitalopram is a particularly ideal candidate pharmacotherapy as it is a relatively well-tolerated member of its drug class and previously was used in a trial in which it was shown to improve cognitive function [<xref rid="pone.0261474.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Safety studies reported in the escitalopram label observed only miniscule, sub-clinical changes in QTc (4.5 msec) and found no ECG change when using escitalopram at our intended 10 mg dosing. None of the 625 patients in the escitalopram group had a QT F interval greater than 500 msec or a prolongation &gt;60 msec compared to 0.2% of 527 patients in the placebo group. While there are class-wide concerns regarding an increased risk of depression and suicidality in children, adolescents and young adults taking antidepressants for major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders, short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24 and show a <italic toggle="yes">reduction</italic> in suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older. Taken together, these observations support the use of escitalopram as a candidate drug for improving outcomes in the post-stroke adult population.</p>
              <p>Escitalopram is a promising adjunct to traditional SALT. We recently found that survivors of left hemisphere stroke who took an SSRI daily for at least three months post-stroke showed better language recovery, compared to those who did not [<xref rid="pone.0261474.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. We first carried out a longitudinal study in which we observed that daily use of SSRIs in the first three months after stroke was associated with better naming recovery, independently of lesion volume, time since stroke, and depression. A large effect size for SSRI use on naming (<italic toggle="yes">d</italic>  =  1.34) was observed. In the confirmatory cross-sectional study, those who took SSRIs continuously for three months post-stroke attained a higher accuracy on object naming than non-users, again with a large effect size [d  =  1.16; 7].</p>
              <p>In our ongoing trial examining the effects of transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS) versus sham combined with computer-delivered naming therapy on aphasia recovery in subacute stroke, we evaluated the effects of SSRI use (with or without tDCS as we are still masked to treatment condition) on language recovery in the first 22 completers of the study. SSRI use depended on physician’s discretion. We found no significant differences between SSRI users and nonusers in age, education, or any test at baseline. Together, SSRI use, depression score on the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), age, and education predicted highest quartile of change in amount of information provided when describing a picture (content units, CU); pseudo r<sup>2</sup> = 0.62 (p = 0.016). SSRI users were more likely to achieve the highest quartile in CU, compared to nonusers. Although there were no significant differences between SSRI users and nonusers in change on any of the tests (likely due to low power), SSRI users showed higher mean improvements on all tests of language examined compared to nonusers [<xref rid="pone.0261474.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. These data provide pilot evidence that it is possible to recruit, test, and treat participants within three months of stroke onset and preliminary evidence for the investigation of SSRIs in the first three months to augment language therapy for aphasia.</p>
              <p>There has been no previous RCT to evaluate the effect of daily SSRI in the first three months after stroke on improvement of language in people undergoing aphasia treatment. It is plausible that SSRIs, which elevate synaptic serotonin, might enhance recovery by augmenting synaptic plasticity. Although several groups have evaluated the effects of pharmacotherapy (plus SALT) on improving language after post-stroke aphasia, most previous studies have been carried out in chronic stroke, usually more than one year after stroke and were relatively small in scale. The few studies of pharmacotherapy for aphasia that have shown substantial positive results have studied medical intervention in the subacute period after stroke [<xref rid="pone.0261474.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0261474.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Because neuroplasticity and recovery potential are greatest early after stroke, there is reason to believe therapeutic SSRI might be most effective in the acute and early subacute period.</p>
              <p>Although there has been relatively little prior investigation of the use of SSRIs in the treatment of post-stroke aphasia, a greater body of work exists that has examined whether SSRIs augment other forms of post-stroke recovery. These trials have led to mixed results. A large, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial (RCT) demonstrated that a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), fluoxetine, results in better motor recovery compared to placebo, if taken daily in the first three months post-stroke [<xref rid="pone.0261474.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The effect of fluoxetine on motor recovery was independent of effects on depression.</p>
              <p>Other RCTs have demonstrated improved cognitive recovery associated with SSRI use after stroke [<xref rid="pone.0261474.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0261474.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, two recent RCTs showed no significant effect of SSRI use on functional outcomes after stroke, measured with the Modified Rankin Scale [mRS; 2, 14]. The mRS is a 6-point scale that is heavily weighted toward motor recovery (e.g., gait). Similar null findings were reported in a recent trial examining the effect of escitalopram on moderate or severe depression in the acute to subacute period, which included numerous measures of functional and motor recovery as secondary outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0261474.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Nevertheless, a recent meta-analysis of eight trials showed significant effects of SSRI use on functional outcome measured with the NIHSS and the Barthel Index [<xref rid="pone.0261474.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, also <xref rid="pone.0261474.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Therefore, there remains equipoise regarding the effect of SSRIs on motor recovery. In contrast, the mRS is insensitive to changes in language, other than complete recovery from aphasia (mRS = 0) versus some degree of aphasia at outcome (mRS 1–4, depending on other functional deficits). However, our recent investigations into our own longitudinal data in preparation for the present trial have provided support for examining the use of SSRIs in augmenting language recovery.</p>
              <p>Here we describe the protocol for an ongoing Phase II multisite, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial of escitalopram for augmenting language intervention in early subacute stroke. We hypothesize (1.a) that daily escitalopram for 90 days after stroke results in greater improvement (compared to placebo) in naming untrained pictures, as well as greater increase in content of picture description and greater improvement in morphosyntactic production, when combined with SALT. We hypothesize that this effect is independent of escitalopram’s effect on depression (1.b) and most pronounced in individuals with infarcts involving the left superior temporal gyrus and/or arcuate fasciculus compared to individuals without damage to these areas (1.c).</p>
              <p>A second aim is to evaluate the mechanisms of language recovery in individuals who receive active medical treatment and those who receive placebo using functional imaging consisting of either resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) or functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and genetic testing. We hypothesize that greater improvement in language is associated with increased connectivity within the left hemisphere language network on functional imaging measures in participants who receive escitalopram than in those who receive placebo, independently of improvement in depression (2.a). We will examine whether greater improvement in depression is associated with changes in connectivity in frontolimbic circuits in participants who received escitalopram, but not in those who receive placebo, independently of improvement in language. The goal of this exploratory aim is to determine whether or not we will be able to separate the effects of escitalopram on language and depression, using changes in network connectivity (2.b).</p>
              <p>We also hypothesize that the effects are greatest in individuals with val/val allele of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF; 2.c), consistent with previous studies showing a greater response to treatment and greater neuroplasticity in people with the val/val allele than those with one or more met alleles [<xref rid="pone.0261474.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0261474.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Both we [<xref rid="pone.0261474.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and others [<xref rid="pone.0261474.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] have shown that language improvement with treatment after stroke is associated with changes in functional connectivity. The presence of a BDNF met allele may hinder the changes in functional connectivity needed for language recovery. In depth connectivity analyses will inform a better understanding the underlying mechanisms by which SSRIs improve language recovery after stroke, contributing to precision, individualized medicine in this population.</p>

Language production as assessed by content units included in picture description of "Cookie Theft"<break/>Content units are based on a standard scoring template of commonly identified concepts (nouns and verbs) in the left and right regions of the "Cookie Theft" picture. Participants either include or fail to include 30 concepts on the left side of the picture and 23 concepts on the right side of the picture. A ratio of included left content units to included right content units then can be calculated and interpreted as a measure of hemispatial attention.<break/>[Time Frame: Baseline, 5 weeks after computer-delivered naming treatment]<break/>4.

Language production as assessed by Morphosyntactic Generation (MorGen) Test<break/>60 item assessment of word morphology (e.g., plurals, possessives) and modifiers (e.g., number, size, color). Each item is scored based on produced accurate descriptors of an image relative to a second reference image (e.g., patients see two trees, one larger than the other, and the phrase "little tree" is elicited). Patients are scored for objects correctly named (nouns) out of 60, instances of correct use of plural marker out of 31, instances of correct use of numbers out of 8, instances of correct modifiers denoting size out of 16, instances of correct modifiers denoting color out of 19, instances of correct modifiers denoting possessive markers out of 17, and instances of correctly named possessing individuals (proper names provided on screen) out of 17. These scores can then be interpreted separately or averaged to interpret a broad morphosyntactic accuracy score.<break/>[Time Frame: Baseline, 1 week after computer-delivered naming treatment]<break/>7. Stroke severity as assessed by NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS)<break/>The NIHSS is a 15-item neurologic examination stroke scale used to evaluate the effect of acute cerebral infarction on the levels of consciousness, language, neglect, visual-field loss, extraocular movement, motor strength, ataxia, dysarthria, and sensory loss. A trained observer rates the patient’s ability to answer questions and perform activities. Ratings for each item are scored with 3 to 5 grades with 0 as normal, and there is an allowance for untestable items.<break/>[Time Frame: Baseline, during computer-delivered naming treatment, 5 weeks after computer-delivered naming treatment, 20 weeks after computer-delivered naming treatment]<break/>8.

                <p>Drug therapy will be started within the first seven days after stroke and participants receive escitalopram or placebo daily for 90 days. Escitalopram is a well-tolerated SSRI that has been shown to be effective in treatment of depression and anxiety at a dosage of 10 mg per day. The FLAME trial found that fluoxetine 20 mg per day for three months after stroke onset was associated with greater motor recovery compared to placebo [<xref rid="pone.0261474.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and the same dosage was used in other large clinical trials in post-stroke recovery [<xref rid="pone.0261474.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The equivalent dose of escitalopram is 9 mg per day [<xref rid="pone.0261474.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Escitalopram is commercially available at a dose of 10 mg, and this is the recommended therapeutic dosage for individuals 65 and older. Thus, we will use 10 mg as the study dose. This dose was also used in the positive RCT of escitalopram to improve cognitive function post-stroke [<xref rid="pone.0261474.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p>
                <p>Escitalopram has been associated with spontaneous reports of adverse events occurring upon discontinuation, particularly when abrupt. The most common side effects are drowsiness, nausea, insomnia, dry mouth, constipation, which are also common with placebo. Participants will be up-titrated onto the medication by taking 5 mg escitalopram (or placebo) for the first week of treatment and tapered off the medication by taking 5 mg escitalopram (or placebo) for 2 weeks after the 90 days of treatment. All participants are monitored daily during hospitalization and weekly after discharge until the end of trial for signs of depression, adverse events, and compliance.</p>

                <title>Secondary outcomes</title>
                <p>Several secondary analyses will be conducted on the linguistic, cognitive, personality and temperament, neuroimaging, and genetic data collected in addition to the PNT prior to randomization and 1-, 5-, and 20-weeks after the computer-delivered naming therapy. Secondary objectives will test hypotheses related to the relationship between language improvement and (1.b.) antidepressant effects, (1.c.) lesion location, (2.a.) functional connectivity in the left hemisphere language network, (2.b.) connectivity in the frontolimbic circuits, and (2.c.) met alleles of BDNF.</p>
                <p>We will evaluate the proposed mechanism of SSRI on neural mechanisms underlying the effects of an SSRI on augmenting language recovery using longitudinal rsfMRI and genetic testing. To supplement the fMRI data, we will also collect task-based and task-free (“resting”) fNIRS data. The fNIRS protocol is expected to take up to 60 minutes. fNIRS is a safe, non-invasive, and flexible modality for brain imaging. During an fNIRS experiment, an array of light sources and detectors affixed to a cap is placed on the scalp, and the measures from these different channels allow the reconstruction of an image of the hemodynamic response. fNIRS has emerged as a complementary technology to other brain imaging and monitoring modalities. Previous research [<xref rid="pone.0261474.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0261474.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] in healthy populations has shown that the hemodynamic response captured in fNIRS is similar to that measured in fMRI. Collecting either fMRI or fNIRS data at each time point in the present study will allow us to recruit participants for whom MRI is contraindicated or logistically prohibitive and will provide greater flexibility to complete assessments outside of the hospital. Similar to task-free fMRI, “resting” fNIRS will allow us to determine intrinsic functional connectivity between regions of the brain at each stage of stroke recovery. In the event of a pandemic or other event that prevents participants from having MRI, we will be able to use fNIRS to test hypotheses about changes in connectivity associated with treatment, as the fNIRS equipment is not only highly portable, but can also be disinfected relatively easily after each use.</p>

                <p>A blinded speech-language pathologist (SLP) to be named at each site will perform baseline and outcome assessments (described in full in the unabridged protocol found in the Supplement). Codes without any protected health information will be used for each participant. Demographic and assessment data will be recorded directly on the assessment forms, and this will be considered source data. The forms will be kept in locked cabinets and secured servers and will be entered into WebDCU<sup>TM</sup>. After assessments are scored by raters, these data are entered, monitored and analyzed in WebDCU<sup>TM</sup> at the Medical University of South Carolina.</p>
                <p>The Clinical Core (authors 2–5) is responsible for training all personnel who have contact with participants and/or friends and family members to ensure that all exchanges are ethical, respectful, and employ successful communication strategies. This includes training for communication during initial recruitment and participant identification, for the informed consent process, and for participant retention. It also includes training of assessment administration procedures and treatment procedures. This training helps to reduce variance introduced by clinicians communicating or carrying out procedures with different styles than others. Training of personnel in this manner has rarely been reported in the aphasia treatment literature.</p>
                <p>The Clinical Core ensures that all study personnel having any contact with participants and/or the friends and family members of the participants have a basic understanding of the communication needs and obstacles for this population, and also some understanding of their experience. While most study personnel have had a background with adult neurogenic communication disorders, standardizing this baseline training for all personnel, from those who might only be escorting them to the elevator to those who spend hours with them in treatment sessions, ensures that no erroneous assumptions about qualifications are made. This baseline training comprises many components that are already implemented by the Clinical Core of C-STAR, with positive feedback and results. The Clinical Core continues to facilitate the training and maintain compliance logs.</p>
                <p>First, all study personnel complete human subjects training (CITI) to understand ethical treatment of human research participants, which is essential training even in the earliest stages of a study (e.g., to avoid coercion and/or bias during advertising and recruitment efforts). Second, all personnel independently read two articles by the Hilari research group discussing the impact of aphasia. Third, all personnel independently view four videos available via AphasiaBank (<ext-link xlink:href="http://talkbank.org/AphasiaBank/" ext-link-type="uri">http://talkbank.org/AphasiaBank/</ext-link>; participants consented to be videotaped by AphasiaBank) during which persons with aphasia discuss their stroke story. Two videotaped persons have nonfluent aphasia (1 high, 1 low severity) and two have fluent aphasia (1 high, 1 low severity). Finally, the Clinical Core leads small group sessions. The stated goals of the program are: (1) To give participants an opportunity to experience what it is like to be communicatively impaired; (2) To encourage participants to discuss their emotional responses to being treated as an impaired individual; and (3) To instruct participants about the different modalities that may be impaired as a result of stroke or head injury. This session will provide opportunities for personnel to participate in simulations of communicating with aphasia through receptive language, expressive language, reading, and writing stations.</p>
                <p>Borrowing from treatment fidelity guidelines, the Clinical Core will coordinate assessor and rater training, assessment delivery, and reliability of raters. Assessors are speech-language pathologists who already have a basic understanding of the project (through baseline and informed consent training, some of whom already have received the detailed training described below, facilitated by the current Clinical Core. New assessors will complete the same training. Illustrating the relationships between the assessments the clinicians are giving and the specific project goals emphasize the importance of the assessment process and adherence to prescribed procedures. This development of clinician “meta-competence” or “buy-in” is thought to be important in treatment fidelity and is intuitive in assessment as well–understanding the “why” facilitates investment in the “how”, or adherence to procedures. In addition, highlighting the opportunities most susceptible to drift or contamination serves to bring the information to the forefront so that it can be actively avoided. Finally, clinician attrition is likely to be observed less in clinicians who are invested in the project goals and feel as if their contribution is important.</p>
                <p>The Clinical Core will facilitate the following assessment training procedures: (1) independent reading of the assessment manual; (2) video observation of expert administration of each test, administered to persons with varying types and severity of aphasia; (3) a small group training session that includes manual review, highlighting of similarities and differences between administration procedures via discussion and video observation, and supervised role-play with feedback; (4) at project initiation, three supervised assessment sessions with expert feedback; and (5) throughout study, yearly “booster” small group training and 1–2 supervised assessment sessions with expert feedback. These training procedures guard against clinician-to-clinician variability, drift, and contamination. Both new and current assessors will receive specialized training in administration of the Morphosyntactic Generation (MorGen) test. To continue training, SLPs meet monthly (or more often) to discuss questions about protocols. They also participate in online webinars and other professional development activities related to aphasia and apraxia.</p>

Effect sizes &gt;1 in naming improvements amongst post-stroke patients who took SSRIs for three months SSRIs have been reported [<xref rid="pone.0261474.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]; however, we have conservatively powered this study for a smaller effect.</p>
                <p>We predict no difficulty recruiting at least 22 people with aphasia due to acute stroke each year. The PI has recruited an average of 13 people with aphasia due to acute left hemisphere ischemic stroke each year in her ongoing treatment study with tDCS at Johns Hopkins Hospital and Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center, with similar inclusion and exclusion criteria. We anticipate having more difficulty enrolling in this trial, because of the exclusion criteria of moderately-severe depression or use of SSRIs at the time of stroke. We also plan for a relatively high dropout rate/crossovers, because of the risk of developing moderate-severe depression or other events for which stroke patients are at risk (e.g. recurrent stroke) and a small risk of developing prolonged QTc interval on electrocardiogram on escitalopram.</p>

                <p>Adverse events will be monitored during the entire visit by the study team. The families will be given telephone numbers of study team as well. The site PI and the DSMB will be notified immediately if any serious adverse events are reported. DSMB members will review SAEs within 24 hours of when the PI or other study team member becomes aware of the SAE and will determine if the SAE is related to the study, and what actions (if any) are required in response to the SAE. If a significant safety concern arises, participants may be unblinded in order to address it. Adverse events will be monitored until they are resolved or clearly determined to be due to a subject’s stable or chronic condition or intercurrent illness. Medical care will be provided, as defined in the informed consent, for any adverse event related to trial participation. Appropriate medical care will include initiating transport to the Emergency Department for evaluation when necessary. All adverse events, regardless of intensity or causality, will are to be recorded in the study documentation and reported to the JHU IRB and DSMB. Any serious adverse events will be reported to the IRB and the DSMB within 24 hours.</p>
                <p>All adverse experiences will be summarized in terms of frequency, severity and relatedness to the study treatment using the MedDRA code. All subjects who received escitalopram will be included in the safety analysis. At the end of the study, the cumulative incidences of adverse events are compared between the two treatment groups using Fisher’s exact test at the two-sided alpha level of 0.05.</p>
                <p>The study biostatistician will generate closed and open DSMB reports semi-annually or more frequently, as determined by the DSMB. Each DSMB report provides cumulative summary statistics on enrollment; subject status in the study (e.g., number completed study, dropouts, etc.); baseline characteristics; safety data, including AEs and SAEs; and data quality information. The statistics for the closed DSMB Reports are provided by treatment group displayed as A or B. The open report contains aggregated statistics only, i.e., not by treatment group.</p>

              <title>Summary and concluding remarks</title>
              <p>The effect of acute and early subacute SSRI with concomitant SALT on language recovery remains incompletely understood. It is our hope that these findings will support more individualized, effective, and efficient treatment recommendations for individuals who experience language deficits following stroke. Regardless of outcome, results will be disseminated in peer-reviewed journals and meaningfully contribute to the growing body of literature on the topic of pharmacological therapy to facilitate post-stroke rehabilitation, which historically has focused on motor and cognitive outcomes with mixed results.</p>
              <p>If this trial shows benefits of SSRIs on post-stroke language recovery, a next step would be to conduct a full Phase III clinical trial and examine whether this is a suitable indication for this drug in the label. This would be supported by complementary investigations to better understand the underlying mechanism of action, whether directly associated with serotonergic changes to plasticity or mediated by the SSRI’s impact on affect. A subsequent investigation would examine whether the combination of tDCS and SSRIs behave synergistically in the treatment of post-stroke aphasia.</p>
