Most PCPs felt responsible for managing abnormal cancer screening test results with the specific cancer type being the best factor (range, 63.6% [175 of 275] for breast to 81.1% [223 of 275] for lung; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). The PCPs reported limited support for following up on overdue abnormal cancer screening test results. Standard processes such as automated reports, reminder letters, or outreach workers were infrequently reported. Major barriers to follow-up of abnormal cancer screening test results across all cancer types included limited electronic health record tools (range, 28.5% [75 of 263]-36.5%[96 of 263]), whereas 50% of PCPs felt that there were major social barriers to receiving care for abnormal cancer screening test results for colorectal cancer. Fewer than half reported being very satisfied with the process of managing abnormal cancer screening test results, with satisfaction being greatest for breast cancer (46.9% [127 of 271]) and lowest for cervical (21.8% [59 of 271]) and lung cancer (22.4% [60 of 268]).</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Preventive screening for breast, cervical, colorectal, and lung cancer reduces cancer-specific mortality and is recommended by the US Preventive Services Task Force and other national guidelines.<sup><xref rid="zoi220972r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220972r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220972r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220972r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220972r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Achieving reductions in cancer-specific mortality starts with identifying and screening eligible individuals, and screening has been a focus of research and quality improvement efforts.<sup><xref rid="zoi220972r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Less attention has been paid to developing systematic processes to ensure the timely and appropriate follow-up of abnormal cancer screening test results (hereafter, <italic>abnormal screens</italic>).<sup><xref rid="zoi220972r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Studies suggest that high rates of timely follow-up, required to realize the maximal benefits of screening, are not being achieved.<sup><xref rid="zoi220972r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220972r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220972r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220972r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220972r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Barriers to follow-up of abnormal screens exist at multiple levels, including the patient, primary care practitioner (PCP), care team, specialist, and health system. For PCPs, there is uncertainty about responsibility, they lack systems to identify and track when patients are overdue for follow-up of an abnormal result,<sup><xref rid="zoi220972r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> and they have insufficient time to perform outreach. Moreover, the transition from screening to diagnostic evaluation often involves coordination between PCPs and specialists and differs depending on the cancer screening test.<sup><xref rid="zoi220972r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220972r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Even though the PCP may not be the ordering clinician, PCPs still maintain the responsibility of managing the diagnostic evaluation of these multiple cancer screens with increasingly complex recommendations and time frames for test completion.<sup><xref rid="zoi220972r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> The number of abnormal screens that PCPs are responsible for is large and may create medicolegal risks.<sup><xref rid="zoi220972r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220972r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220972r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> However, few PCPs or their practices have integrated management systems to track abnormal screens and manage follow-up.</p>
              <p>To develop a multilevel intervention to improve the follow-up of abnormal screens, we surveyed PCPs from participating practices prior to trial implementation. We sought to identify responsibility for managing abnormal results, systems and resources currently in place to help, the ease of scheduling follow-up care, barriers to ensuring timely follow-up, and knowledge of follow-up recommendations. Our goal was to identify deficiencies that could be addressed as part of a multilevel intervention focused on developing a system-level health informatics platform to identify and track abnormal screens, and enhancing clinical support team outreach.</p>

                <title>Overview</title>
                <p>This study was conducted as part of a National Cancer Institute–funded trial, mFOCUS (multilevel Follow-up of Cancer Screening).<sup><xref rid="zoi220972r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> The trial was designed from the perspective of PCPs who take a whole-person approach with responsibility for all cancer screening tests endorsed by the US Preventive Services Task Force.<sup><xref rid="zoi220972r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220972r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220972r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220972r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Although the PCP may not order or perform a screening test and there are systems and policies designed to focus on a single type of cancer (eg, the Mammography Quality Standards Act for breast cancer screening results), PCPs are responsible for comprehensive cancer screening in collaboration with specialists or other clinicians involved in the diagnostic evaluation of abnormal screens. For these reasons, we sought to survey PCPs from sites participating in mFOCUS prior to initiating the trial. The study is registered at ClincialTrials.gov (<ext-link xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03979495" ext-link-type="uri">NCT03979495</ext-link>) and has been reviewed and approved by the Mass General Brigham Institutional Review Board, which served as the central institutional review board. Return of the survey was deemed to be consent.</p>

                <p>Three primary care networks are participating in mFOCUS: 2 affiliated with Mass General Brigham in Massachusetts, Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital, and a third affiliated with Dartmouth Health in New Hampshire. Primary care physicians and advanced practice clinicians from 44 participating practice sites were identified from each of the networks. Physicians who were in residency training were excluded.</p>

                <title>Recruitment Protocol</title>
                <p>The survey was sent to 485 PCPs prior to each network initiating enrollment for the trial. At the Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital sites, surveys were sent to 376 PCPs between February and March 2020. At Dartmouth Health sites, surveys were sent to 109 PCPs between September and October 2020. Primary care practitioners were initially sent an email invitation from the network’s medical director encouraging participant input about how they and their practice currently support the follow-up of abnormal screens. This recruitment invitation was followed by an email invitation from study investigators. Embedded within the email invitation was a hyperlink to the survey. PCP surveys were designed to be completed in 10 to 15 minutes and were self-administered using REDCap (up to 5 email contacts with a REDCap link over 4 weeks).<sup><xref rid="zoi220972r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> As an incentive to complete the survey, PCPs were given a $50 gift card.</p>

                <title>Survey Content and Measures</title>
                <p>The questionnaire content was adapted from the National Cancer Institute National Survey of Primary Care Physicians’ Cancer Screening Recommendations and Practices.<sup><xref rid="zoi220972r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Topics included perceptions of who is responsible for the follow-up of an abnormal result, mechanisms to track whether follow-up has been obtained, difficulty scheduling follow-up, clinician and patient barriers to follow-up, practice resources to assist with follow-up, and satisfaction with the process of managing an abnormal result. The PCP knowledge was assessed by providing scenarios for breast, cervical, colorectal, and lung cancers asking about how soon after a range of abnormal results (from less to more serious) would they typically recommend a follow-up test or referral for specialist consultation. Correct responses were based on guideline recommendations and local expert input. Clinician characteristics and experience items were investigator developed, including age, sex, specialty, number of office visits during a typical week, and prior litigation for failing to diagnose cancer were ascertained.</p>

For radiologic screening tests, the clinician interpreting mammograms was most commonly viewed as responsible for notifying the patient of an abnormal screen (70.9% [195 of 275]), but not for abnormal low dose computed tomography screens (7.6% [21 of 275]). For Papanicolaou tests and colonoscopies, most PCPs viewed that the clinician performing the screening test was responsible for notifying the patient (65.1% [179 of 275] for Papanicolaou tests and 84.4% [232 of 275] for colonoscopies). Despite differences in who was responsible for abnormal result notification, most PCPs still felt that they were responsible for managing abnormal screens, regardless of the cancer test (63.6% [175 of 275] to 81.1% [223 of 275]) (<xref rid="zoi220972t2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Primary care practitioners reported that other members of the primary care team (eg, nurses, medical assistants, and administrative staff) were uncommonly involved in notification or managing abnormal results.</p>

                <p>Primary care practitioners reported limited support for following up overdue abnormal screens. Few PCPs reported that their practice had an automated reporting mechanism to provide them or a member of their team with an alert when a patient is overdue for follow-up of an abnormal result independent of whether or not the patient was coming in for a visit (for cervical cancer, 14.5% [40 of 275] for PCP and 26.2% [72 of 275] for other team member) (eTable 2 in the <xref rid="note-ZOI220972-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement</xref>). Standard processes to remind patients were reported by 21.8% (60 of 275) PCPs (sending reminder letters to patients for abnormal overdue lung cancer screening results) and by 23.6% (65 of 275) of PCPs (using population health manager or navigator to contact patients for abnormal overdue lung cancer screening results). In logistic regression models, respondents were less likely to report mechanisms to alert other team members and have standard reminder letters or population outreach for abnormal lung cancer results (16.7% [46 of 275]; aOR 0.47 [95% CI, 0.37-0.61] for reminder letter and aOR 0.61 [95% CI, 0.47-0.76] for population outreach for lung cancer; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) (eTable 1 in the <xref rid="note-ZOI220972-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement</xref>).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>We surveyed PCPs affiliated with 3 practice networks in New England prior to enrolling individuals with overdue abnormal cancer screening test results in an intervention trial. The PCPs reported deficiencies in a range of processes to follow-up overdue abnormal results, suggesting the need for new models of care. Reported support varied among cancer types with breast cancer processes being rated highest and cervical and lung being lowest. Although PCPs variably reported that others were involved in the process of notifying patients with abnormal results, PCPs viewed themselves as being responsible for overall management regardless of the cancer test. Despite feeling responsible for managing abnormal results, there were knowledge gaps in recommended follow-up intervals, especially for findings with longer follow-up windows that are more likely to require PCP intervention. Few PCPs felt adequately supported by staff and electronic systems, and less than half of PCPs were very satisfied with the process of managing abnormal screening results for any cancer type.</p>
              <p>Most prior surveys of practitioner attitudes and beliefs have focused on screening rather than abnormal result follow-up and on individual cancer tests rather than comprehensive cancer screening test follow-up.<sup><xref rid="zoi220972r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220972r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> This focus on screening and individual cancer tests is seen despite evidence that inadequate follow-up of abnormal test results is well described and not limited to only certain screening tests.<sup><xref rid="zoi220972r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220972r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Given this situation, our findings are notable in showing that PCPs report deficiencies as being uniformly present but also variable in important ways among cancer screens. For example, follow-up of abnormal breast cancer screening results was viewed as being better than for other abnormal cancer screens and may reflect legislative efforts to ensure timely follow-up.<sup><xref rid="zoi220972r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Participants highlighted the complexities of tracking different abnormal cancer screening test results. Although participants reported that the person responsible for notifying patients about an abnormal screen depended on the specific test, most nonetheless viewed the PCP as being responsible for managing the abnormal screen. Prior efforts focused on improving follow-up for a single cancer test take a more specialist-oriented approach and may result in optimal systems that vary among the different screening tests.<sup><xref rid="zoi220972r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220972r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> Our results may be viewed as supporting an approach whose goal is to develop tracking systems and protocols that are similar regardless of the specific cancer screening test rather than customizing to the specific test and result.</p>
              <p>The multiple deficiencies reported by PCPs, including varying roles among clinicians, inadequate information technology and personnel support systems, and knowledge gaps, point to the need for multilevel interventions to support patients and PCPs, as well as integration efforts involving specialists. If PCPs are going to bear responsibility for at least overseeing the follow-up of abnormal screens, then technology solutions should function similarly for the different screening test results. Such efforts should also support other team members who may be involved in only limited aspects of ensuring timely follow-up. Initial systems may begin by providing fail-safe oversight if existing cancer-specific protocols are in place. This oversight is especially useful when there is variable support across cancer types. If such comprehensive systems prove effective, one could then transition them to being involved sooner in the follow-up process.</p>

                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p>This study has limitations. These results may not be generalizable to PCPs in other practice networks. Given that the resources available in the studied networks may exceed those in other practices, it is possible that these results may overstate the support available to PCPs more broadly. Thus, our findings are more likely to understate the nature of the deficiencies identified. Our response rate is similar to other surveys of health care professionals, and lower rates decrease the validity of the reported findings.<sup><xref rid="zoi220972r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Our findings are based on PCP perceptions and PCPs may not know all resources available to them. It is also possible that responses may have overestimated available reminder processes because PCPs may consider support for routine screening efforts to be applicable to managing an abnormal screen, even if this is not the case. For example, electronic health record reminders to obtain overdue routine cancer screening tests may not be automatically updated when an abnormal result occurs that warrants diagnostic testing or shorter subsequent follow-up intervals. In addition, these PCP responses are likely to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Survey of PCPs at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital occurred just prior to the first wave of the pandemic. Surveys at Dartmouth Health occurred in September and October of 2020. It is likely that the deficiencies have only been magnified by the pandemic and that improved systems are needed more than ever to decrease barriers to follow-up of abnormal screens.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>In this survey study of PCPs from 3 primary care networks, they reported important deficiencies in managing the follow-up of all abnormal cancer screening test results and identified particular areas where process varied among the cancer types. Despite differences among the cancer screening tests, most PCPs viewed themselves as being responsible for managing all abnormal screens. These findings suggest the need for comprehensive systems to promote timely follow-up of abnormal cancer screening results using a primary care–focused approach across the range of preventive cancer tests.</p>
