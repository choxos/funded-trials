              <abstract>
                <p>In this study, we engineered <italic>Listeria monocytogens</italic> (Lm) by deleting the LmÎ<italic>actA</italic>/Î<italic>inlB</italic> virulence determinants and inserting HCV-NS5B consensus antigens to develop a therapeutic vaccine against hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. We tested this recombinant Lm-HCV vaccine in triggering of innate and adaptive immune responses <italic>in vitro</italic> using immune cells from HCV-infected and uninfected individuals. This live-attenuated Lm-HCV vaccine could naturally infect human dendritic cells (DC), thereby driving DC maturation and antigen presentation, producing Th1 cytokines, and triggering CTL responses in uninfected individuals. However, vaccine responses were diminished when using DC and T cells derived from chronically HCV-infected individuals, who express higher levels of inhibitory molecule Tim-3 on immune cells. Notably, blocking Tim-3 signaling significantly improved the innate and adaptive immune responses in chronically HCV-infected patients, indicating that novel strategies to enhance the potential of antigen presentation and cellular responses are essential for developing an effective therapeutic vaccine against HCV infection.</p>

              <p>Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a global epidemic characterized by a high rate of chronic infection, poor treatment response, and no available vaccine <xref rid="pone.0087821-Shepard1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0087821-Gale1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Despite extensive studies on virus-host interactions, it remains unclear why HCV persists in the majority of infected individuals, and more than half of genotype 1 HCV-infected patients fail to respond to standard treatment with pegylated interferon (PegIFN) and ribavirin <xref rid="pone.0087821-Shepard1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0087821-Gale1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Dendritic cells (DC) are the most potent antigen presenting cells (APC) and serve as an effective means to trigger CTL responses, which are critical to clearing virus <xref rid="pone.0087821-Dolganiuc1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0087821-Bowen1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Impairment of DC and CTL responses by HCV seems to play a pivotal role in the majority (about 85%) of HCV-infected patients who progress to chronic infection; whereas approximately 15% of individuals who spontaneously resolve the acute infection exhibit vigorous innate and adaptive immune responses <xref rid="pone.0087821-AuffermannGretzinger1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0087821-NeumannHaefelin1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> - an indication that a vaccine may be attainable.</p>
              <p>Since molecular cloning of HCV in 1989, a variety of vaccines have been generated for preclinical trials, including subunit protein or peptide vaccines <xref rid="pone.0087821-Firbas1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0087821-Drane1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, recombinant DNA vaccines <xref rid="pone.0087821-Inchauspe1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0087821-AlvarezLajonchere1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, recombinant HCV-like particle vaccines <xref rid="pone.0087821-Murata1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0087821-Haller1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, microbial vector vaccines <xref rid="pone.0087821-Ezelle1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0087821-Thammanichanond1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, and more recently, DC-targeting vaccines <xref rid="pone.0087821-Matsui1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0087821-Echeverrial1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Despite decades of intense research, there is no HCV vaccine available to date and several major obstacles have been identified <xref rid="pone.0087821-Zhou1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Firstly, HCV is highly variable, divided into at least 6 major genotypes and over 100 subtypes. In an infected individual, HCV exists as groups of related but distinct viral populations termed quasispecies <xref rid="pone.0087821-Bowen2" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> that differ in sequence within hyper-variable regions along the genome, making vaccine development extremely difficult. Secondly, there is a lack of appropriate HCV animal models. Apart from humans, the only natural HCV animal model is chimpanzee, a protected species that is costly and hence limited in its availability <xref rid="pone.0087821-Bukh1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. HCV genetic mice and cell culture systems have more recently provided important tools for the study of HCV pathogenesis and antiviral agents, including therapeutic vaccines <xref rid="pone.0087821-Lindenbach1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0087821-Dorner1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Thirdly, there is a shortage of potent immunotherapy (vaccine) vectors. Notably, a distinct <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> (Lm) vaccine platform has been recently developed that specifically deletes the <italic>actA</italic> and <italic>inlB</italic> virulence determinants (<italic>LmÎactA/ÎinlB</italic>). This genetically-modified, live-attenuated <italic>LmÎactA/ÎinlB</italic> vaccine platform effectively segregates toxicity from immunopotency, and is currently being tested in Phase-2 clinical trials in advanced cancers <xref rid="pone.0087821-Lauer1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0087821-Bahjat1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Lastly, chronically HCV-infected individuals mount an impaired immune response, partially due to HCV-mediated over-expression of inhibitory receptors, such as programmed death-1 (PD-1) and T cell immunoglobulin mucin domain-3 (Tim-3) on immune cells, which can facilitate viral persistence and vaccine non-responsiveness <xref rid="pone.0087821-Rollier1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0087821-Zhang2" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. Therefore, it is fundamentally important and clinically applicable to study whether targeting cell negative signaling may improve the efficacy of an Lm-based DC-targeting therapeutic vaccine against HCV infection.</p>
              <p>In this study, we explored novel strategies to improve the ability of a live-attenuated Lm-HCV vaccine, generated by inserting the HCV-NS5B consensus antigens into the <italic>LmÎactA/ÎinlB</italic> microbial vector, to trigger DC maturation, antigen presentation, cytokine production, and virus-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses <italic>in vitro</italic> using immune cells derived from HCV-infected and uninfected individuals concomitant with blockade of Tim-3 signaling. Our preliminary data reveal that approaches to improve the potential of antigen presentation and cellular responses are necessary for developing an effective therapeutic vaccine against chronic HCV infection.</p>

Lm-HCV vaccine was generated by inserting consensus HCV-NS5B antigens in the <italic>LmÎactA/ÎinlB</italic> vector. M/M<sub>Î¦</sub> isolated from healthy subjects (HS) were cultured in the presence of GM-CSF and IL-4 for 5 days to induce immature DC (iDC), and then infected by live attenuated Lm-NS5B or Lm-control for 2 days to induce mature DC (mDC). The expression of HCV-NS5B antigen was detected by immunofluorescence staining, in conjunction with DAPI nuclear staining, and observed by fluorescence microscopy as described in the Methods. The imaging was taken at 20Ã magnification and typical cell (squares) with or without HCV antigen expression in DC was further amplified in the left lower corner. b) Expression of cell differential surface markers. Purified monocytes were cultured in the presence of GM-CSF and IL-4 for 5 days to induce iDC, and then infected by live attenuated Lm-NS5B or Lm-control for 2 days to induce mDC. TNF-Î± and polyI:C served as positive DC maturation inducers. The expressions of CD14, HLA-ABC, HLA-DR, CD209, CD1a, CD80, CD83, CD86, on the surface of monocyte, GM-CSF/IL-4-induced iDC, TNF-Î±/PolyI:C-induced or Lm-control and Lm-NS5B-induced mDC were analyzed by flow cytometric analysis. Data are shown as overlaid histograms of the cell surface marker expression with isotype control in grey-filled histogram.

                <title>Lm-based HCV vaccine can infect monocyte-derived DC and drive their maturation</title>
                <p>DCs are instrumental for the initiation of immune responses to foreign antigens because of their professional competence to capture and present antigens to T cells; however, they must be activated to maturity before serving as efficient APCs <xref rid="pone.0087821-Dolganiuc1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. As an initial approach exploring novel strategies to augment the efficacy of an Lm-based DC-targeting vaccine against HCV infection, we first examined whether this Lm-based HCV vaccine can infect DC, express HCV antigens, and drive DC maturation. To this end, monocytes were isolated from HCV-infected and healthy subjects (HS), cultured in the presence of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and IL-4 for 5 days to induce immature DC (iDC), and then infected by live-attenuated Lm-NS5B or Lm-control for 2 additional days to induce mature DC (mDC). Tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNF-Î±) and Poly I:C served as positive DC maturation inducers. The expressions of HCV antigens and maturation markers by DC were analyzed by immunofluorescence and immunophenotyping. This Lm-based vaccine is unique in that it can naturally target human DC <xref rid="pone.0087821-Neuenhahn1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> and express HCV antigens in the cytoplasmic compartments of the infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0087821-g001">Fig. 1a</xref>, infectivity &gt;90%). Following initial induction and Lm infection, resting monocytes are activated to lose surface CD14 marker, but concurrently express HLA and co-stimulatory molecules such as HLA-ABC, HLA-DR, CD209, CD1a on iDC, and subsequently maturation markers such as CD80, CD83, and CD86 on mDC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0087821-g001">Fig. 1b</xref>). Notably, the process of DC maturation mediated by Lm-HCV or Lm-control is comparable in terms of efficiency and phenotypic development when compared to induction by TNF-Î± and Poly I:C, the standard DC maturation stimuli. No significant differences are observed in the susceptibility of DC to Lm-NS5B or Lm-control infection as well as the expression levels of these cell surface markers in HCV-infected individuals versus HS (data not shown). These results suggest that this Lm-HCV strain can naturally target human DC, activate DC maturation, present HCV antigens, and serve as a potential DC-targeting HCV vaccine.</p>

                <p>Presumably, Lm-HCV-infected DC will express HCV antigens in the appropriate cytoplasmic compartments, resulting in HCV proteins having access to MHC class I molecules for presentation to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. However, the antigen-presenting capacity of DC and the cytotoxic activity of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are known to be diminished in the setting of HCV infection, leading to immune tolerance and viral persistencc <xref rid="pone.0087821-AuffermannGretzinger1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0087821-NeumannHaefelin1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. To assess if Lm-HCV-infected DC are able to stimulate virus-specific memory T cell responses and thus potentially function as a therapeutic approach to break through immune tolerance during chronic HCV infection, monocytes isolated from HCV-infected as well as HCV-resolved individuals were induced to iDC by GM-CSF and IL-4 treatment for 5 days, and subsequently infected by Lm-NS5B or Lm-control for 2 additional days to induce mDC; then incubated with autologous T cells in the presence of IL-2 for another 5 days to generate CTL. Activation of virus-specific CTLs was assessed by HCV-NS5B tetramer staining of CD3<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell frequencies. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0087821-g002">Fig. 2a, a</xref> baseline of HCV-specific tetramer staining is detected in T cells incubated with Lm-control-infected DC, indicating an antigen-independent activation of CD3<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells by Lm-infected DC. However, a higher frequency of HCV-tetramer<sup>+</sup> is observed in CD3<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells stimulated with DC harboring Lm-NS5B than those with Lm-control vector, supporting the notion that additional HCV antigen triggering is necessary for an effective memory T cell response to an Lm-DC-targeting vaccine. Notably, strong CTL activation are elicited with Lm-NS5B-infected DC and T cells derived from HCV-resolved individuals, including those with spontaneous resolution of HCV infection and those with sustained virological response (SVR) after PegIFN/ribavirin treatment. In contrast, HCV-tetramer<sup>+</sup> frequencies in CD3<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells triggered by Lm-NS5B-DCs are significantly lower in chronically HCV-infected patients than those HCV-resolved individuals. Of note, this Lm-NS5B-DC-targeting vaccine can only induce virus-specific T cell activation in limited, but not all, HCV-infected patients (data not shown), suggesting either limited antigenic coverage of Lm-NS5B or possible viral mutational escape of immune surveillance - an indications for multi-epitopic or polyvalent vaccines to break through the immune tolerance in the setting of chronically HCV infection.</p>

To investigate the underlying mechanisms of the diminished CTL response induced by Lm-based DC-targeting HCV vaccine in the setting of chronic HCV infection, we examined the expression of Tim-3 on monocyte-derived DC from HCV-infected versus uninfected subjects. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0087821-g002">Fig. 2b</xref>, Tim-3 expression is significantly higher in M/M<sub>Ð¤</sub>, as well as GM-CSF/IL-4-induced iDC, and Lm-induced mDC from chronically HCV-infected patients than in uninfected individuals, including those naturally HCV-resolved subjects, HCV-treated SVR subjects, and HS. This is true when separating the HS in the uninfected group as control for statistical analysis. Additionally, Tim-3 expression is also observed at a higher frequency on the Lm-DC-activated CTLs from HCV-infected than HCV-resolved subjects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0087821-g005">Fig. 5a</xref>).

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0087821-g003">Fig. 3a</xref>, iDC induced from patients with chronic HCV infection capture less antigen than those from HS, an effect that can be improved by blocking Tim-3 signaling.

After Lm infection and DC maturation, however, mDC from HS lost their ability to uptake antigens. In contrast, mDC from patients with chronic HCV infection continued to capture BSA-FITC â an indication of an immature status â and this can be corrected by Tim-3 blockade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0087821-g003">Fig. 3b</xref>).

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0087821-g004">Fig. 4c</xref>, Tim-3 is highly expressed on the surface of resting M/M<sub>Ð¤</sub>, whereas IL-12 is barely detectable in the un-stimulated M/M<sub>Ð¤</sub>, suggesting that Tim-3 may function as a cap or brake for TLR-mediated IL-12 production <xref rid="pone.0087821-Zhang3" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. Following TLR stimulation, Tim-3 rapidly declines from the cell surface (within 6 h), allowing TLR-driven IL-12 expression, which peaks at 12 h and exhausts at 24 h, by which time Tim-3 is recycled or expressed again on the cell surface. Notably, IL-12 is primarily expressed by Tim-3 negative cells. This kinetic relationship between cell surface Tim-3 and intracellular IL-12 expressions is also observed in GM-CSF-induced iDC and Lm-induced mDC, which exhibit lower Tim-3 expression but higher IL-12 production (data not shown), indicating that Tim-3 negatively controls IL-12 expression in innate APCs.</p>

Tim-3 blocking or control IgG antibodies were added during the induction of iDC and mDC as well as incubation with T cells.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0087821-g006">Fig. 6a and 6b</xref>, strong IFN-Î³ and Granzyme-B expressions by HCV-specific CD3<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are detected with immune cells derived from HCV-resolved individuals, including spontaneously HCV-resolved as well as HCV-treated SVR subjects; whereas diminished CTL responses are observed with cells from chronically HCV-infected patients. Importantly, the impaired CTL responses induced by Lm-HCV-DC can be improved by blocking Tim-3 signaling during the process of DC induction and T cell activation. These results suggest that both antigen presentation and cellular response capacities in the phase of innate and adaptive immunity are essential for generating an effective therapeutic vaccine against HCV infection.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>DC and CTL dysfunctions are characteristic of and reasons for the chronic infection, poor treatment response, and lack of effective vaccine during HCV infection. In this report, we provide pilot evidences that demonstrate: 1) Lm-based HCV vaccine is unique in that it can naturally target human DC, thereby driving DC maturation and presenting HCV antigens; 2) Lm-based HCV vaccine can only elicit a weak DC and T cell responses in chronically HCV-infected individuals, who present higher levels of Tim-3 expression on immune cells; 3) blocking Tim-3 signaling can significantly improve innate to adaptive immune responses <italic>ex vivo</italic> using cells from chronically HCV-infected patients, indicating that challenge with an Lm-based DC-targeting HCV vaccine along with blockade of Tim-3 signaling may be a viable approach to boosting immune responses against HCV infection.</p>
              <p>A novel approach of this study is to use genetically modified Lm expressing viral antigens in DC as a therapeutic vaccine to challenge memory T cell responses against HCV infection. Specifically, we have tested the efficacy of a new Lm-HCV vaccine that expresses a consensus-sequence of HCV-NS5B antigens <italic>ex vivo</italic> in immune cells derived from HCV-infected versus uninfected or HCV-resolved individuals. Since a major challenge of HCV vaccine development is ineffective viral gene delivery in an appropriate testing model system <xref rid="pone.0087821-Zhou1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, our study using an Lm vector to deliver HCV antigens targeting DC and T cells from virally infected patients may have more clinical applicability as a new method of immunotherapy. Lm's unique attributes makes it an ideal vector for the development of HCV therapeutic vaccines <xref rid="pone.0087821-Lauer1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0087821-Bahjat1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>: i) it has a good safety profile in both preclinical animal models as well as humans in multiple clinical trials; ii) it naturally infects DC, efficiently presents target antigens to both MHC class I and class II molecules, and effectively stimulates both innate and adaptive immune responses; iii) it activates TLRs and non-TLRs, down-regulates PD-1 and Tim-3, and thus has the potential to overcome immune exhaustion by an antigen-dependent as well as antigen-independent mechanisms in the setting of chronic infections. Thus, live-attenuated LmÎactA/ÎinlB vaccines may be a useful platform for prophylactic vaccination in healthy subjects and for targeted immunotherapy in patients with cancer or infectious diseases <xref rid="pone.0087821-Lauer1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0087821-Bahjat1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Here we show that this recombinant Lm-NS5B strain is an effective DC-targeting vaccine with potential to trigger HCV-specific CTL memory responses using immune cells from HCV-infected or HCV-resolved individuals. One limitation of this specific recombinant vaccine is its narrow antigenic coverage, or possibly antigenic escape by an immunodominant strain of HCV in chronically infected individuals, in that it can only trigger virus-specific CTL responses in limited but not all HCV-infected patients. Given that acute HCV clearance has been correlated with a vigorous T cell response encompassing a large number of viral epitopes, an Lm-based DC-targeting vaccine expressing multiple epitopes of HCV prevalent in different populations is clearly worth pursuing.</p>
              <p>Active immunotherapy targeting DCs has shown great promise in animal models and in clinical trials for the treatment of human diseases. ProvengeÂ® (Sipuleucel-T), which consists of antigen-loaded DCs, recently became the first targeted therapeutic cancer vaccine to be approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). However, ex vivo therapies such as Provenge have practical limitations and elicit an immune response with limited scope. By contrast, live-attenuated Lm naturally targets DCs <italic>in vivo</italic> and stimulates both innate and adaptive cellular immunity. Two different Lm-based vaccine platforms have advanced into phase II clinical trials in cervical and pancreatic cancer<sup>35</sup>. The possibility of employing engineered Lm to establish HCV pan-genotypic protection is promising based on the studies which have employed Lm-based DC-targeting vaccines to induce simultaneous responses to multiple antigens<sup>35</sup>. Future Lm-based clinical vaccine candidates are expected to feature polyvalent antigen expression and to be used in combination with other immunotherapies to augment efficacy.</p>
              <p>Another major challenge for a therapeutic vaccine is the poor innate and adaptive cellular responses observed in the setting of chronic infection, such that even what should be an effective vaccine might limited in virally infected individuals simply because of diminished cellular responses, likely due to virus-mediated negative signaling molecules <xref rid="pone.0087821-Zhou1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Specifically, chronic HCV infection is associated with exhausted CTL responses <xref rid="pone.0087821-Bowen1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0087821-NeumannHaefelin1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, and a defective antiviral CTL response is critical to HCV persistence, treatment response, and vaccine development. In addition, induction of an effective immune response requires the active participation of host APCs, the most potent of which are DCs <xref rid="pone.0087821-Gale1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0087821-AuffermannGretzinger1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Strategies enhancing DC function to improve CTL response have been reported to be effective in overcoming immune tolerance in antiviral and antitumor therapeutic vaccines <xref rid="pone.0087821-Matsui1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0087821-Zhou1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Recent studies indicate that Tim-3 plays a pivotal role in impairing innate to adaptive immune responses during chronic HCV infection <xref rid="pone.0087821-McMahan1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0087821-Jin1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087821-Zhang2" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. This inhibitory receptor could indeed interact with its natural ligand, Galectin-9, expressed by monocytes, Tregs, and HCV-infected hepatocytes, or with phosphatidylserine expressed by dying cells. Moreover, apoptosis of exhausted CTLs may be induced by LM-NS5B/DCs <xref rid="pone.0087821-Zhou1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087821-McMahan1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0087821-Zhang2" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. Additionally, exhausted CTLs co-express various exhaustion receptors (including PD-1, CTLA-4, or CD160) during chronic infection <xref rid="pone.0087821-McMahan1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0087821-Zhang2" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, and thus it is worthwhile to explore whether blockade of other inhibitory pathways or dual blockade may trigger the same or even more extensive expansion of HCV-specific T cells. In this study using an Lm-HCV expressing DC-targeting model system, we show that Tim-3 is highly expressed on monocyte-derived DC as well as T cells, and blockade of Tim-3 signaling can significantly improve the capacity of DC uptake antigens, secretion of Th1 cytokines, and triggering of virus-specific CTL responses. Notably, merely inhibition of Tim-3 signaling during DC maturation or in T cells was not sufficient to drive the expansion of HCV-specific T cells, suggesting that Tim-3 pathway suppresses innate as well as adaptive immune cells, and a good CTL response requires rescue of both APCs and T cells, including virus-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> as well as CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Indeed, Tim-3 was found to be expressed high on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, concomitant with a lower level of IL-2 expression by these cells, from HCV-infected versus uninfected subjects (data not shown). Since Tim-3 blockade was carried out with DC induction as well as incubation with total CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells, the role of helper CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells must be considered in count of the improved CTL responses. This study indicates that novel strategies to enhance the potential of both innate and adaptive immunity by improving antigen presentation and cellular responses are essential for generating an effective therapeutic vaccine against chronic infection.</p>
