                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p> Obesity is associated with adverse health events among diabetic patients, however, the relationship between obesity fluctuation and risk of microvascular complications among this specific population is unclear. We aimed to examine the effect of waist circumference (WC) and body mass index (BMI) variability on the risk of diabetic microvascular outcome</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p> Annually recorded anthropometric data in the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) study was used to examine the association of WC and BMI variability defined as variability independent of mean, with the risk of microvascular outcomes, including neuropathy, nephropathy, and retinopathy. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) (Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov., no. NCT00000620).</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p> There were 4,031, 5,369, and 2,601 cases of neuropathy, nephropathy, and retinopathy during a follow-up period of 22,524, 23,941, and 23,850 person-years, respectively. Higher levels of WC and BMI variability were associated with an increased risk of neuropathy. Compared with the lowest quartile, the fully-adjusted HR (95% CI) for the highest quartile of WC and BMI variability for neuropathy risk were 1.21 (1.05 to 1.40) and 1.16 (1.00 to 1.33), respectively. Also, higher quartiles of BMI variability but not WC variability were associated with increased risk of nephropathic events. The fully-adjusted HR (95% CI) for the highest quartile compared with the lowest quartile of BMI variability was 1.31 (1.18 to 1.46). However, the results for retinopathic events were all insignificant.</p>

                  <p> Among participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus, WC and BMI variability were associated with a higher risk of neuropathic events, whereas BMI variability was associated with an increased risk of nephropathic events.</p>

              <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
              <p>Despite decades of improvement in public health services, the prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) has been on the rise globally and has in recent times been recognized as a global public health problem [<xref rid="b1-dmj-2021-0258" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the number of people living with DM rose from 108 million in 1980 to 422 million in 2014 [<xref rid="b2-dmj-2021-0258" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], a figure that has been projected to rise to 592 million by 2035 [<xref rid="b3-dmj-2021-0258" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Similarly, complications associated with DM have also been on the rise in tandem with trends of DM worldwide [<xref rid="b2-dmj-2021-0258" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Reports show that about 20% to 40% of patients with DM would develop diabetic kidney disease [<xref rid="b4-dmj-2021-0258" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], while 10% are likely to develop diabetic retinopathy [<xref rid="b5-dmj-2021-0258" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], and up to 50% would eventually develop diabetic neuropathy [<xref rid="b6-dmj-2021-0258" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p>
              <p>Several factors including obesity have been identified as plausible risk factors for the pathology of microvascular complications among patients with diabetes [<xref rid="b6-dmj-2021-0258" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>-<xref rid="b8-dmj-2021-0258" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Indeed, adequate weight loss in individuals with obesity has been associated with a substantial decline in blood pressure (BP), improvement in insulin sensitivity, decrease in proteinuria, and metabolic benefits [<xref rid="b9-dmj-2021-0258" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>-<xref rid="b11-dmj-2021-0258" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Hence, maintenance of ‘normal’ body weight has been a target as part of the management of noncommunicable diseases such as DM [<xref rid="b12-dmj-2021-0258" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, prospective studies have shown that obesity indexes frequently fluctuate and may be linked to the risk of macrovascular and microvascular outcomes [<xref rid="b13-dmj-2021-0258" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="b14-dmj-2021-0258" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Although a number of studies have examined the relationship between body weight variability and cardiovascular complications and mortality in patients with diabetes [<xref rid="b15-dmj-2021-0258" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>-<xref rid="b17-dmj-2021-0258" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], there is a paucity of studies examining the association between waist circumference (WC) or body mass index (BMI) variability and diabetic microvascular complications. Since WC and BMI may reflect different forms of adiposities [<xref rid="b18-dmj-2021-0258" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>-<xref rid="b20-dmj-2021-0258" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], variability in these measures could differently be associated with certain health outcomes.</p>
              <p>In this context, we conducted a <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis of publicly available Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) study data to examine the association between intraindividual variability in WC and BMI with the risk of microvascular complications among patients with diabetes. The ACCORD trial was a randomized, multi-center, double 2×2 factorial trial in 10,251 participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The current study gives a unique sample of patients with T2DM, with comprehensive baseline measurements and almost complete follow-up for diabetic microvascular complications, including neuropathy, nephropathy, and retinopathy.</p>

                <p>ACCORD was a randomized clinical trial of 10,251 participants with T2DM who were followed to assess the health effects of intensive glycemic, lipid, and BP control as against standard control [<xref rid="b21-dmj-2021-0258" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="b22-dmj-2021-0258" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The design and main results of the ACCORD study have been published previously [<xref rid="b22-dmj-2021-0258" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Briefly, ACCORD had three study arms: (1) glycaemia trial (glycosylated hemoglobin [HbA1c] &lt;6.0% vs. 7.0%&lt; HbA1c &lt;7.9%); (2) lipid trial (fenofibrate vs. placebo); and (3) BP trial (systolic blood pressure [SBP] &lt;120 mm Hg vs. SBP &lt;140 mm Hg), with all participants involved in the glycaemia trial [<xref rid="b23-dmj-2021-0258" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Recruitment of participants into the study began in January 2001 through to October 2005 from 77 clinical sites across Northern America (i.e., USA and Canada). Participants were followed up until June 2009 when the ACCORD study was ended [<xref rid="b24-dmj-2021-0258" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Ethical approval for the ACCORD study was granted by Institutional Review Boards (IRB) of each clinical site and written informed consent was obtained from all recruited participants (trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov., no. NCT00000620) [<xref rid="b25-dmj-2021-0258" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. It is noteworthy to mention that the authors of this current study were not involved in the ACCORD trial project but only conducted a <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis of the ACCORD dataset.</p>
                <p>For this study, participants were excluded if they had less than two recorded anthropometric measurements (<italic>n</italic>=460). Then, for the analysis of each microvascular outcome, individuals with the very prevalent microvascular outcome at baseline were excluded. For neuropathy outcome, 2,587 participants with prevalent neuropathy were excluded; for nephropathy outcome, 1,037 participants with prevalent macroalbuminuria and 34 persons with serum creatinine &gt;3.3 mg/dL were excluded; and for retinopathy, 1,003 patients with retinopathy, 2,184 patients with eye disease and 387 patients who have had eye surgeries were excluded from the analysis. The analytic samples for neuropathy, nephropathy, and retinopathy outcomes were 7,204, 8,720, and 6,217, respectively.</p>

                <title>Measures of variabilities in WC and BMI</title>
                <p>Exposure of interest was anthropometric measurements obtained at baseline and then annually, including WC and BMI. WC was measured at the smallest point between the 10th rib and the iliac crest over bare skin using steel or non-stretching plastic tape. Height was measured using either a steel tape measure marked in centimeters which was hung vertically on the wall with a headboard at a right angle or commercial stadiometers. Participants were asked to position themselves against the wall having their heels, buttocks, and/or shoulder blades touching the board (tape), and their eyes looking straight, feet together with ankles touching or as close as possible. Bare feet were preferred while light or nylon socks were also allowed during the measurement. Finally, the weight of participants was measured using high-quality scales in clinical practice; during the weighing procedure, participants were asked to wear as little clothing as possible, removing shoes, and other external accessories. All values were recorded to the nearest decimal place. BMI was calculated as weight (kg) divided by squared height (m).</p>
                <p>Variabilities in WC and BMI were defined as intra-individual variabilities between measurements using the following four variability measures: (1) average successive variability (ASV), which was defined as the average absolute difference between successive visits; (2) standard deviation (SD); (3) coefficient of variation (CV); and (4) variability independent of the mean (VIM). VIM was calculated as 100×SD/mean<sup>β</sup>, where β is the regression coefficient, based on the natural logarithm of the SD on the natural logarithm of the mean. The uncorrected VIM was corrected using this formula: (VIM uncorrected×mean of CV)/mean of VIM uncorrected [<xref rid="b26-dmj-2021-0258" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Because the results from all variability measures were similar (with exception of the results between variability measures and the relationship with retinopathy in our primary analysis), the corrected variability independent of the mean (cVIM) was used as the primary variability measure in this study whiles results from the other variability measures are reported for comparative purposes [<xref rid="b16-dmj-2021-0258" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="b27-dmj-2021-0258" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="b28-dmj-2021-0258" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p>

                <p>The endpoints considered in our analysis were the predefined ACCORD microvascular outcomes defined as neuropathy: a composite of (1) new score of &gt;2.0 on the Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument (MNSI), (2) new loss of vibratory sensation (tested using 128 Hz tuning fork), (3) new loss of ankle jerk during Jendrassik maneuver, or (4) new loss of light touch (as measured by 10 g force monofilament test); nephropathy: a composite of (1) development of macroalbuminuria, (2) development of renal failure, or (3) doubling of baseline serum creatinine or more than 20 mL/min/1.73 m2 decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR); and retinopathy: a composite of (1) retinal photocoagulation or vitrectomy to treat retinopathy, (2) eye surgery for cataract extraction, (3) three‐line change in visual acuity (as measured using Log MAR visual acuity chart), or (4) severe vision loss (as measured by Snellen fraction &lt;20/200). Patients who experienced any one of the predefined microvascular events that comprised the composite neuropathy, nephropathy, and retinopathy outcome were considered to have experienced that specific disease. <xref rid="SD1-dmj-2021-0258" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref> shows the three predefined ACCORD microvascular endpoints and their frequency of assessment.</p>

                <p>Participants’ characteristics were described using mean±SD or median (interquartile range) for continuous variables, depending on whether the data distribution was normal (assessed by the Shapiro-Wilk test); categorical variables were described by frequency and percentage. The association between WC and BMI variability (as measured by corrected variability independent of mean) and the risk of outcomes was evaluated with the use of WC and BMI variability as a categorical variable.</p>
                <p>Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI), using WC and BMI variability as a time-dependent covariate. The crude models and fully adjusted models were used. With the exception of baseline age, sex, and race, all baseline characteristics with a <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.10 in the univariate analysis were included in the multivariable models for respective microvascular outcomes. In Kaplan-Meier analysis for the outcomes, the highest quartile (Q4) category was compared with the lower three quartiles (Q1–Q3) as a reference category. The differences between categories were assessed using the log-rank test. Additionally, to account for WC and BMI variability as a categorical variable, patients were divided into quartiles, using the lowest quartiles as the reference.</p>
                <p>The multivariable models comprised baseline age (continuous), sex (male or female), race (white or non-white), diabetes duration (continuous), BP versus lipid treatment arm (standard BP, intensive BP, fibrate, and placebo), SBP (continuous), diastolic blood pressure (DBP; continuous), low density lipoprotein (LDL; continuous), high density lipoprotein (HDL; continuous), HbA1c (continuous), baseline BMI (continuous) (or baseline WC) in addition to allocation to glycemia treatment arm (intensive and standard), insulin use (yes or no), alcohol consumption (yes or no) for neuropathy (model 2<sup>1</sup>); antihypertensive medication (yes or no), cardiovascular disease (CVD) history (yes or no), eGFR (continuous), and UACR (continuous) for nephropathy (model 2<sup>2</sup>); allocation to glycemia treatment arm (intensive and standard) and insulin use (yes or no) for retinopathy (model 2<sup>3</sup>).</p>
                <p>Further exploration was carried out to examine possible interactions between each SD increase in WC and BMI variability (cVIM), and the following baseline characteristics of the participants with respect to each microvascular outcome: age (≤65 or &gt;65 years), sex, diabetes duration (≤9 or &gt;9 years), glycemia arm (intensive or standard), BP versus lipid treatment arm (standard BP, intensive BP, lipid placebo, and lipid fenofibrate), and SBP (≤139 or &gt;139 mm Hg). The statistical significance of the interactions was assessed by adding a multiplicative term to the Cox models. Sensitivity analyses were also performed by excluding participants who had the respective events within the first year of follow-up and participants with any serious adverse event (attributed to study medication and not related to hypoglycemia) that occurred in the first 18 months of follow-up.</p>
                <p>All statistical analyses were 2-sided, and we considered a <italic>P</italic> value of &lt;0.05 to be statistically significant. All analyses were performed using Stata version 14.2 (StataCorp., College Station, TX, USA).</p>

For participants who were included in the study, participants who developed neuropathy were more likely to be older, men, whites, have higher levels of WC, BMI, longer duration of diabetes, non-insulin users, alcohol abstainers, and had lower levels of DBP and HDL. Also, participants who subsequently developed nephropathy were more likely to be men, whites, have higher levels of WC, BMI, HbA1c, use antihypertensive, less likely to have CVD, have higher levels of SBP, eGFR, UACR, but lower levels of HDL, LDL, serum creatinine.

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>In this <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis involving participants with T2DM who participated in the ACCORD trial, we found higher levels of WC and BMI variability to be associated with neuropathy, while only BMI variability was associated with nephropathy risk. On the contrary, neither higher levels of WC nor BMI variability were associated with retinopathy risk. This study provides epidemiologic evidence regarding the associations between variabilities in obesity measures with the risk of neuropathy and nephropathy and the lack thereof in relation to retinopathy risk in participants with T2DM.</p>
              <p>Several previous studies have examined the relationship between the consequence of variabilities in obesity measures on health outcomes in participants with or without diabetes but the results are inconsistent. Some studies have found variability in BMI to be associated with the development of diabetes [<xref rid="b29-dmj-2021-0258" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], increased risk of new-onset atrial fibrillation and myocardial infarction [<xref rid="b30-dmj-2021-0258" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], increased rate of hospitalization from heart failure [<xref rid="b31-dmj-2021-0258" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], whiles WC variability has also been found to be associated with risk of stroke and all-cause mortality [<xref rid="b28-dmj-2021-0258" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. However, these studies did not assess the relationship between obesity variability and diabetic microvascular complications. One longitudinal study on T2DM patients did examine the relationship between body weight variability and microvascular complications and found a positive association between body weight variability and a composite outcome of neuropathy, nephropathy, and retinopathy [<xref rid="b17-dmj-2021-0258" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, this study did not delineate the relationship between the measure of obesity variability and each microvascular outcome separately. Another 5-year prospective study explored the relationship of longitudinal BMI variability with retinal changes using a sample of Chinese adults, and found a significant relationship between rising BMI trend and retinal microvascular changes, but did not find any significant relationship between BMI variability and retinal vascular caliber [<xref rid="b13-dmj-2021-0258" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], (a potential biomarker for the development and progression of retinopathy) [<xref rid="b32-dmj-2021-0258" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. However, this study was not on a sample with diabetes.</p>
              <p>Using data from a large sample of participants with T2DM, we show that WC and BMI variability may be detrimental to participants with diabetes. Our study found an association between WC and BMI variability with neuropathy; and BMI variability with nephropathy risk which is in line with the findings of a recent study of a cohort of T2DM patients in which the researchers found bodyweight variability to be associated with diabetic microvascular complications albeit without delineating the associations between body weight variability and specific microvascular complications [<xref rid="b17-dmj-2021-0258" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p>
              <p>While weight reduction has been associated with better health outcomes [<xref rid="b12-dmj-2021-0258" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], weight variability has also been linked to some morbidities and mortality [<xref rid="b33-dmj-2021-0258" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The mechanism underlying obesity variability and disease outcome is not completely understood. However, it has been suggested that a subsequent increase in weight after an initial decrease may be associated with a more rapid adipose tissue growth and hyperplasia due to metabolic shifts which favor lipid storage [<xref rid="b15-dmj-2021-0258" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Since adipose tissue is a highly active metabolic endocrine organ [<xref rid="b34-dmj-2021-0258" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], the rapid remodelling of adipose tissue linked to high obesity variability may provoke abnormal production of proinflammatory adipokines, which may potentially lead to adverse health outcomes including diabetes and its associated complications [<xref rid="b15-dmj-2021-0258" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="b17-dmj-2021-0258" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="b28-dmj-2021-0258" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="b29-dmj-2021-0258" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p>
              <p>Our study did not find a significant association of WC variability with nephropathy and retinopathy risk. Even though no previous studies specifically examined such a relationship, our result was in agreement with some studies exploring the relationship between WC fluctuation and some health outcomes. For example, in one longitudinal study in which researchers explored the relationship between long-term variation in WC and insulin resistance, they found a null association between WC fluctuations and insulin resistance [<xref rid="b35-dmj-2021-0258" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], while another study also observed a null association between WC variability and myocardial infarction [<xref rid="b28-dmj-2021-0258" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Furthermore, our study did not find any association between higher BMI variability levels and retinopathy risk, which was in agreement with a longitudinal study of adult Chinese subjects in which the researchers found no association between BMI variability and retinal vascular caliber [<xref rid="b13-dmj-2021-0258" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, it must be noted that these null associations in our study are contrary to the findings of the study on a cohort of T2DM patients in which the researchers found bodyweight variability to be associated with diabetic microvascular complications [<xref rid="b17-dmj-2021-0258" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The contradictory findings might be because of the composite outcome of all microvascular complications used in that study. Further studies may be necessary to assess the association of obesity variability with diabetic microvascular complications separately.</p>
              <p>Interestingly, the results of our subgroup analysis showed sex to modify the relationship between WC or BMI variability with the nephropathic outcome. Our results were similar to another study which also found sex to modify the relation between body weight variability and myocardial infarction in a population base study [<xref rid="b28-dmj-2021-0258" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. This suggests that sex may play a role in the pathological relationship between obesity variability and some health outcomes. Further studies may be needed to elucidate the potential influence of sex on the relationship between obesity variability and health outcomes.</p>
              <p>The strength of our study includes the relatively large sample size and comprehensive clinical and biological characterization of participants. There was also a special examination of microvascular complications at baseline and subsequent visits, which permitted the accurate assessment of the effect of obesity variability on microvascular complication risk. Another strength was that the attrition of study participants was also low. This study also has several limitations. First, the observational nature of this study can only infer an association but not causation. Second, purposeful loss of weight may have a different effect on disease outcome; however, our study could not determine if weight variability was purposeful or not. Third, the generalization of these findings to other populations may be limited since all study participants were from northern America and there may be variability in body composition across different populations. Finally, the events used to define the composite outcome of each microvascular complication may differ from other studies, hence the results of this study should be applied cautiously in view of current definitions/diagnostic criteria.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, in this cohort of patients with T2DM, WC and BMI variability were associated with a significant increase in the risk of neuropathic events, whereas BMI variability was associated with increased risk of nephropathic events. Individuals with T2DM might need to be encouraged to maintain stable WC and BMI to prevent diabetic microvascular complications.</p>
