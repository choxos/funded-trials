                  <title>Background:</title>
                  <p>The neuropeptides oxytocin and vasopressin have been repeatedly implicated in social decision making by enhancing social salience and, generally, cooperation. The iterated and sequential version of the prisoner’s dilemma (PD) game is a social dilemma paradigm eliciting strategies of cooperation versus competition.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="section2-0269881120913145">
                  <title>Aims:</title>
                  <p>We aimed to characterise the role of PD players’ sex, game partner type (computer vs. human) and oxytocin or vasopressin inhalation on the player’s strategy preference.</p>

                <sec id="section3-0269881120913145">
                  <title>Methods:</title>
                  <p>Participants (153 men; 151 women) were randomised to intranasal 24 IU oxytocin, 20 IU vasopressin or placebo, double-blind, and played the PD. We examined main and interactive effects of sex, drug and partner type on strategy preference.</p>

                <sec id="section4-0269881120913145">
                  <title>Results:</title>
                  <p>We found a pervasive preference for a tit-for-tat strategy (i.e. general sensitivity to the partner’s choices) over unconditional cooperation, particularly when against a human rather than a computer partner. Oxytocin doubled this sensitivity in women (i.e. the preference for tit-for-tat over unconditional cooperation strategies) when playing against computers, which suggests a tendency to anthropomorphise them, and doubled women’s unconditional cooperation preference when playing against humans. Vasopressin doubled sensitivity to the partner’s previous choices (i.e. for tit-for-tat over unconditional cooperation) across sexes and partner types.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions:</title>
                  <p>These findings suggest that women may be more sensitive to oxytocin’s social effects of anthropomorphism of non-humans and of unconditional cooperation with humans, which may be consistent with evolutionary pressures for maternal care, and that vasopressin, irrespective of sex and partner type, may be generally sensitising humans to others’ behaviour.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Predicting others’ intentions (i.e. mentalising) is essential for building trust and achieving cooperation (<xref rid="bibr7-0269881120913145" ref-type="bibr">Brüne and Brüne-Cohrs, 2006</xref>). In most cases, cooperation is rewarding and reinforces trust by favourably updating our mentalisation of who treats us fairly. Recent findings on the biochemical basis of social decision making point to neuropeptides oxytocin and vasopressin as key modulators of the neural circuitry supporting it, such as in trust, cooperation or revenge. Nevertheless, the influence of both systems on the strategies adopted to solve social dilemmas, and how they depend on the player’s sex and partner type, remains unclear.</p>
              <p>Oxytocin modulates various social behaviours. In animals, it influences social decision making (<xref rid="bibr39-0269881120913145" ref-type="bibr">Meyer-Lindenberg et al., 2011</xref>), social salience (<xref rid="bibr39-0269881120913145" ref-type="bibr">Meyer-Lindenberg et al., 2011</xref>), attachment, maternal nurturing and stress resilience (<xref rid="bibr24-0269881120913145" ref-type="bibr">Ferris, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bibr30-0269881120913145" ref-type="bibr">Heinrichs et al., 2009</xref>). Vasopressin shares affinity for the same receptors and is a mediator of attachment, social recognition and aggression (<xref rid="bibr24-0269881120913145" ref-type="bibr">Ferris, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bibr30-0269881120913145" ref-type="bibr">Heinrichs et al., 2009</xref>).

              <p>The prisoner’s dilemma (PD) is a paradigm that emphasises the tension between the collectively highest (thus welfare-maximising) outcome for both players and the individually pay-off-maximising outcome. The earliest occurrence of the term PD dates back to 1950, coined by Albert W. Tucker (<xref rid="bibr36-0269881120913145" ref-type="bibr">Luce and Raiffa, 1957</xref>), while the game is thought to have been devised by Merril Flood and Melvin Dresher (<xref rid="bibr43-0269881120913145" ref-type="bibr">Poundstone, 1993</xref>). The game has been extensively studied by game theorists. In the single-shot version, two players simultaneously and independently choose either to cooperate or to defect. Each cell of the pay-off matrix (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269881120913145">Figure 1</xref>) indicates the pay-off for each player, given their choices. While mutual cooperation is often associated with friendship, love, trust or obligation, mutual defection relates to feelings of rejection or hatred. Jointly, the cooperator typically feels anger or indignation, and the defector feels anxiety, guilt or elation from successfully exploiting the partner (<xref rid="bibr44-0269881120913145" ref-type="bibr">Rilling et al., 2012</xref>). In this one-off simultaneous choice version, mutual defection is the dominant strategy, that is, the Nash equilibrium (<xref rid="bibr42-0269881120913145" ref-type="bibr">Osborne and Rubinstein, 1999</xref>). Computer simulations of the iterated version of the PD, where the same game is played several times, have included strategies such as, in descending order of cooperativeness: Cooperator (Coop), Tit-for-Two-Tats (TF2T), Tit-for-Tat (TFT) and Defector (Def). The TFT takes place when the player mimics, in the current round, the partner’s choice in the previous one. In TF2T, when the player chooses to cooperate and the partner chooses to defect, the player only plays ‘defect’ after two consecutive ‘cooperate-defect’ outcomes. In the Coop and Def strategies, the player simply cooperates or defects, respectively, in every round, irrespective of what the partner has played in the previous rounds. In the iterated version of the game, the maximum gain for both players combined occurs from <italic>mutual</italic> cooperation, but this outcome is unstable (i.e. each player has an incentive to defect in order to gain an extra benefit in the current round). Among these strategies, TFT has been the most successful because it is ‘nice’ (i.e. never first to defect) and retaliatory yet forgiving: ironically, for a strategy to maximise benefit, it must involve some forgiveness (<xref rid="bibr2-0269881120913145" ref-type="bibr">Axelrod and Hamilton, 1981</xref>).</p>

              <p>Extrapolating to ecological contexts, TFT is thought to be an evolutionarily stable strategy (i.e. resistant to invasion by other strategies; <xref rid="bibr20-0269881120913145" ref-type="bibr">Easley and Kleinberg, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bibr27-0269881120913145" ref-type="bibr">Gintis, 2000</xref>). It leads to high fitness in social species, provided that individuals interact sufficiently often and that there is an initial drive to cooperate (<xref rid="bibr2-0269881120913145" ref-type="bibr">Axelrod and Hamilton, 1981</xref>). There are several examples of TFT in nature (<xref rid="bibr24-0269881120913145" ref-type="bibr">Ferris, 2005</xref>). In species where TFT is observed, this initial drive towards cooperation might have originated between kin, allowing for a genetically transmitted self-reinforcing bias. ‘Kin’-like altruistic behaviour between unrelated individuals (within-species) is observed in some social animals (e.g. egg trading in hermaphroditic fish (<xref rid="bibr10-0269881120913145" ref-type="bibr">Crowley and Hart, 2007</xref>) and food sharing among vampire bats (<xref rid="bibr53-0269881120913145" ref-type="bibr">Wilkinson, 1988</xref>)). Mutualism (between-species) also exists (e.g. in house sparrows (<xref rid="bibr19-0269881120913145" ref-type="bibr">Dugatkin, 2002</xref>), primates (<xref rid="bibr19-0269881120913145" ref-type="bibr">Dugatkin, 2002</xref>), and in chimpanzees interacting with humans (<xref rid="bibr52-0269881120913145" ref-type="bibr">Warneken et al., 2007</xref>)). Reciprocal altruism or direct reciprocity (i.e. the expectation that cooperation will be rewarded with cooperation) has also been demonstrated in both primates (<xref rid="bibr14-0269881120913145" ref-type="bibr">De Waal and Luttrell, 1988</xref>) and bats (<xref rid="bibr19-0269881120913145" ref-type="bibr">Dugatkin, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bibr53-0269881120913145" ref-type="bibr">Wilkinson, 1988</xref>). Cooperation towards unrelated strangers also has evolutionary explanations such as sexual selection, whereby displays of wealth and generosity are regarded as attractive traits (<xref rid="bibr56-0269881120913145" ref-type="bibr">Zahavi, 1975</xref>, <xref rid="bibr57-0269881120913145" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>); and indirect reciprocity, whereby helping others may increase one’s reputation (<xref rid="bibr41-0269881120913145" ref-type="bibr">Nowak and Sigmund, 2005</xref>).</p>
              <p>We have previously reported the effects of intranasal oxytocin and vasopressin, player sex and partner type (human vs. computer) on behaviour, and their neural correlates during the iterated and sequential-choice PD game. Using the same (<xref rid="bibr9-0269881120913145" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bibr23-0269881120913145" ref-type="bibr">Feng et al., 2015</xref>) and part of the same (<xref rid="bibr44-0269881120913145" ref-type="bibr">Rilling et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bibr45-0269881120913145" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) sample herein, we found that both intranasal oxytocin and vasopressin had different effects in male and female participants. In a subsample of 91 men (<xref rid="bibr44-0269881120913145" ref-type="bibr">Rilling et al., 2012</xref>), we found that, when playing with human partners, oxytocin increased rates of cooperation following unreciprocated cooperation compared to vasopressin, whereas vasopressin increased rates of cooperation following cooperation from human and computer partners. In a sample of 87 women (<xref rid="bibr45-0269881120913145" ref-type="bibr">Rilling et al., 2014</xref>), we found drug effects exclusively with computer partners: oxytocin lowered the probability of cooperating following unreciprocated cooperation or mutual defection, and vasopressin lowered it following mutual defection. In these cases, both neuropeptides lowered rates of cooperation with computer partners, which may reflect anthropomorphism (i.e. attribution of social meaning to inanimate stimuli). In an enlarged sample of 153 men and 151 women, we have also reported that vasopressin treatment decreased the probability of cooperating after unreciprocated cooperation from computer partners, but only in men (<xref rid="bibr9-0269881120913145" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
              <p>Given the above-mentioned evidence that oxytocin and, less consistently, vasopressin increase trust and cooperation, one prediction is that treatment with these neuropeptides will bias subjects towards the most cooperative PD strategy (Coop) and away from the least cooperative strategy (Def). On the other hand, the social salience hypothesis predicts that oxytocin and vasopressin sensitise players to their partner’s behaviour, rendering their cooperation more contingent on their partner’s choice, creating a bias towards TFT or TF2T.</p>
              <p>To evaluate these two possibilities, we analysed behavioural responses of the first player (see Methods) during the iterated and sequential version of the PD in a double-blind placebo-controlled study in which either oxytocin or vasopressin was administered. We have previously reported (<xref rid="bibr9-0269881120913145" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bibr23-0269881120913145" ref-type="bibr">Feng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bibr45-0269881120913145" ref-type="bibr">Rilling et al., 2014</xref>) on PD outcome frequency and transition probabilities (e.g. probability of cooperating after mutual cooperation (<xref rid="bibr23-0269881120913145" ref-type="bibr">Feng et al., 2015</xref>) or after unreciprocated cooperation (<xref rid="bibr9-0269881120913145" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2016</xref>)). In the present analysis, we assessed whether these neuropeptides modulate preference for various PD strategies based on a trial-by-trial pattern of responses. This overcomes the limitation in our previous work and, in the majority of the literature, of reporting average responses, disregarding the sequence of outcomes. To this end, we selected the above-mentioned iterated strategies (Coop, TF2T, TFT and Def) and calculated, through maximum-likelihood, a strategy for each participant, after which we inferred how strategy preference depended on drug treatment, sex and partner type.</p>

                <p>In the PD game, two players choose either to cooperate or to defect and receive a pay-off that depends upon the interaction of their respective choices. The game version we use here is the above-mentioned iterated version of the PD, where the same game is played several times with the same partner, and is sequential, in which player 1 chooses and player 2 is then able to view player 1’s choice before making his/her own choice. This game serves as a model for relationships based on trust and reciprocity (<xref rid="bibr2-0269881120913145" ref-type="bibr">Axelrod and Hamilton, 1981</xref>; <xref rid="bibr9-0269881120913145" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bibr44-0269881120913145" ref-type="bibr">Rilling et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bibr55-0269881120913145" ref-type="bibr">Yao et al., 2014</xref>). Player 1 must decide whether to trust player 2 (i.e. cooperate), whereas player 2 must decide whether to reciprocate cooperation (or defection). Each of the four game outcomes is associated with a different pay-off. Player cooperation followed by partner cooperation (CC) pays US$2 to both player and partner; player cooperation followed by partner defection (CD) pays US$0 to the player and US$3 to the partner; player defection followed by partner defection (DD) pays US$1 to both player and partner; and player defection followed by partner cooperation (DC) pays US$3 to the player and US$0 to the partner (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269881120913145">Figure 1</xref>). As described in our previous reports (<xref rid="bibr9-0269881120913145" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bibr23-0269881120913145" ref-type="bibr">Feng et al., 2015</xref>), subjects played 30 rounds of an iterated PD game with the putative human partner (who was represented by a same-sex confederate who had previously been briefly introduced to him/her), and another 30 with a computer partner (in counterbalanced order). In reality, subjects were playing with a preprogramed computer algorithm in both sessions. The algorithm strategy was designed to mimic an actual human strategy: it reciprocated defection at 90% and cooperation at 67%. After the experiment, participants were paid two-thirds of their total earnings.</p>

                <title>Subject-level strategy preference identification</title>
                <p>We compared each subject’s game choices, as player 1, to known iterated PD game strategies, namely TFT, TF2T, Coop and Def. TFT, which involves a relatively lower level of forgiveness and trust than TF2T, has been considered one of the most successful strategies in the iterated (and sequential) PD (<xref rid="bibr2-0269881120913145" ref-type="bibr">Axelrod and Hamilton, 1981</xref>). Here, we aimed to contrast this optimal strategy with: (a) Coop, which involves the highest level of forgiveness and trust; (b) TF2T, which involves a higher level of forgiveness and trust (than TFT); and (c) the Def strategy, which involves the lowest level of forgiveness and trust (thus, higher level of fear of betrayal and defensiveness). We also contrasted the latter three between themselves.</p>
                <p>The strategy preferred by each individual (as player 1) was identified using the maximum-likelihood method. For a given strategy, we calculated which action is expected to be executed. For instance, when following a TFT strategy, we expect that the subject defects (D) in a given round after suffering a defection in the previous one. By considering that for each strategy there is always a well-defined action, we can define a probability function that assigns a high probability (<italic>p</italic><sub>H</sub>=0.95) if the correct (i.e. the expected) action was executed, and a low probability (<italic>p</italic><sub>L</sub>=0.05) otherwise. For instance, in the case of a Coop strategy, we would assign a probability of 0.95 to a cooperation (C) choice and 0.05 to a D choice, regardless of the outcome of the previous round. In the case of a TFT strategy, we would assign a probability of 0.95 to a C choice following a DC or CC round and to a D choice following a DD or a CD round; and would assign a probability of 0.05 to the remaining possible outcome combinations. Then, we normalise the resulting likelihood by dividing the un-normalised likelihoods of each strategy by their total sum.</p>
                <p>All of the 30 round-specific likelihood values were applied a logarithmic transformation and then summed in order to obtain an estimate of how the player’s choices across all 30 rounds compared to each of the included strategies, and the model’s equation is described in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/0269881120913145">Supplement 1</ext-link>. In the end, the strategy showing the highest likelihood (according to the subject’s game choices) was chosen as that subject’s strategy. This procedure resulted in two outcomes for each subject, since the partner variable (human, computer) is a within-subjects variable. (Further details are available in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/0269881120913145">Supplement 1</ext-link>.)</p>

                <p>For the group analysis, a general estimating equation approach was used to estimate a logistic multinomial regression model using a logit link in R studio v1.0.153 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). In these models, one of the strategies is used as reference strategy (in this case, TFT), and three model equations are estimated, allowing each of the remaining strategies to be compared to the reference strategy. The dependent variable was ‘strategy preference’. Independent between-subject variables were drug (oxytocin, vasopressin, placebo) and sex (male, female), and the independent within-subject variable was partner (human, computer), which entered the model as sets of dummy variables. All corresponding effects and possible interactions were estimated, and the model’s equation is described in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/0269881120913145">Supplement 1</ext-link>, along with further details on its design.</p>
                <p>To estimate the main effects (of drug, partner and sex), we considered three simple models of the same class as described above, considering each of the independent variables alone. To estimate the two-way interaction effects (of drug×partner, drug×sex and sex×partner), we considered three models of the same type of the above-mentioned, with all of the possible pairs of factors.

The preference for TFT over Coop and the preference for TF2T over Coop was influenced by our three variables of interest (sex, drug and partner) as we show below (for further details on those, and results for the complete list of ratios, including TFT/TF2T, TFT/Def, TF2T/Def and Coop/Def, see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/0269881120913145">Supplement 2</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/0269881120913145">Figures S1–S4</ext-link>).</p>

There was a decrease of 40% for TF2T and 47% for TFT in preference over unconditional cooperation when subjects played with a computer, which expectedly indicates that playing with humans entices higher (social) salience to the actions of others. In addition, TFT was preferred over TF2T in almost every group (except females under placebo playing against humans or under vasopressin playing against computers; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/0269881120913145">Supplement 2</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/0269881120913145">Figure S1</ext-link>).</p>

                <title>Overall drug effects (and interactions) on social strategy preference</title>
                <p>With respect to drug effects of social strategy preference, our present results, discussed next in detail, suggest that oxytocin effects show substantial dependence on the subject’s sex and the partner’s human agency. In women, they are consistent both with the prosocial hypothesis of oxytocin, since oxytocin increased trust and cooperation with humans, and with the social salience hypothesis of oxytocin, since oxytocin increased contingency on others’ past behaviour, from non-humans. As vasopressin also increased contingency on others’ past behaviour – from humans and non-humans and in both sexes – a vasopressin social salience hypothesis is suggested, but a prosocial hypothesis is not supported.</p>
                <p>We found that intranasal oxytocin increased cooperative behaviour among women (decreasing the relative preference for both tit-for-tat strategies) while they played with a supposedly human partner. Specifically, influencing the TFT over unconditional cooperation preference, we found: (a) a significant main effect of partner type; (b) a significant main effect of drug for vasopressin; and (c) a highly significant influence of sex on partner preference within oxytocin takers only (which translated into a three-way interaction trend). That is, men preferred TFT when playing against humans, showing no preference between strategies when playing against computers, and this did not change with oxytocin intake. Women taking placebo showed the same behaviour as men (towards both humans and computers), but oxytocin intake increased their preference for unconditional cooperation when playing against humans and for TFT when playing against computers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0269881120913145">Figure 4</xref>, discussed below).</p>

                  <title>General increased sensitivity to human versus computer behaviour</title>
                  <p>The finding that both sexes, under placebo, showed a decreased preference for a TFT strategy (vs. unconditional cooperation) and, conversely, an increased preference for unconditional cooperation when playing against computers (vs. humans) may indicate that we tend not to retaliate defections from computers as much as from other humans. This may mean that a tendency towards revenge, or fear of a second defection, is present when playing against humans but not against computers, perhaps because no intentionality or deliberation is attributed to a computer (i.e. it is playing randomly), and therefore a defection is not considered a breach of trust. Another non-mutually exclusive explanation is that no learning is attributed to the computer partner, and thus the corrective punishment involved in a tit-for-tat strategy would have no effect. On the contrary, when a defection from the partner is thought to be deliberate and intentional, as in the case of a human partner, there is a breach of trust or a defensive fear of re-defection. Thus, a punishing retaliation might increase partner cooperation.</p>

With oxytocin, when playing against a computer, women exhibited the same preference that both sexes had shown for a tit-for-tat strategy when playing against a human under placebo, which leads us to hypothesise that women with heightened oxytocin function treated the computer as a human, that is, they anthropomorphised the computer. As such, due to oxytocin intake, women may have employed a more revengeful, defensive or corrective attitude towards the computer as if it had an intentional attitude. Such an oxytocin facilitation of anthropomorphisation in women has indeed been reported for socially moving geometric shapes (<xref rid="bibr46-0269881120913145" ref-type="bibr">Scheele et al., 2015</xref>), although not consistently (<xref rid="bibr29-0269881120913145" ref-type="bibr">Hecht et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, the same oxytocin intake in women decreased this revengeful/punitive/defensive attitude when they played against perceived humans. Thus, a heightened oxytocin function seems to increase women’s levels of cooperation with humans by rendering it less contingent on the other player’s choice. In fact, it is possible that oxytocin enhances women’s learning that cooperation is the most rewarding strategy of this game (which is ‘taught’ by the automated (second player) tit-for-tat-resembling algorithm that punishes defection and rewards cooperation moves).</p>
                  <p>The above suggests that men are less sensitive than women to oxytocin in terms of its effect on strategy choices at the 24 IU oxytocin dose. Women may be more lenient than men in social interactions when experiencing higher oxytocin function, herein mimicked by intranasal intake. This is plausibly consistent with evolutionary pressures towards making women more tolerable to children’s aversive behaviour during childcare, given previous findings that oxytocin plasma levels during pregnancy and the first month postpartum correlate with higher levels of behavioural and psychological bonding with the infants (<xref rid="bibr22-0269881120913145" ref-type="bibr">Feldman et al., 2007</xref>), and that oxytocin may be released to reduce stress and anxiety in mothers with low sensitivity and ability to cope with their infants, thus promoting care and bonding (<xref rid="bibr21-0269881120913145" ref-type="bibr">Elmadih et al., 2014</xref>). Not excluding the explanation proposed above for an increase in cooperation, oxytocin may also be enhancing fear of the consequences of not collaborating, specifically in women. Indeed, a number of studies have shown that oxytocin effects on amygdala neural responses to negative affective stimuli tend to be increased in women but decreased in men (<xref rid="bibr26-0269881120913145" ref-type="bibr">Gao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bibr35-0269881120913145" ref-type="bibr">Lischke et al., 2012</xref>), which is further supported by a sex-dependent receptor distribution in the amygdala (in non-primate mammals; <xref rid="bibr25-0269881120913145" ref-type="bibr">Francis et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bibr49-0269881120913145" ref-type="bibr">Stoop, 2012</xref>).</p>

                  <title>Converging oxytocin evidence from both tit -for-tat strategies</title>
                  <p>Serving as converging evidence, our TF2T versus Coop comparison showed broadly the same effect direction as the above-mentioned TFT versus Coop comparison. Indeed, both tit-for-tat strategies (TFT and TF2T) are expected to contrast with unconditional cooperation in the same direction, although TF2T is somewhat intermediate between TFT and Coop, as it involves a relatively higher level of trust and forgiveness (i.e. cooperation) than TFT. Here, we also found a main effect of partner type, revealing an increase in the preference for Coop when playing against a computer opponent. The three-way interaction was stronger and statistically significant in the TF2T (rather than TFT) versus Coop case. Analogous to the TFT versus Coop comparison (see above), in the TF2T versus Coop case, men, irrespective of drug, as well as women under placebo, showed a tendency to cooperate unconditionally with computers but not with humans. Again, these tendencies, and especially the latter with humans, disappeared in women under intranasal oxytocin, which suggests that oxytocin hampers cooperative attitude towards computers in women, and increases it towards humans. This implies that oxytocin heightened a revengeful/punitive/defensive behaviour towards computers. Lastly, the modulating effect of sex on the effect of oxytocin also survived, as a trend, irrespective of partner type. Interestingly, oxytocin administration aligned all four groups in the same order in terms of preference for tit-for-tat strategies versus unconditional cooperation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0269881120913145">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0269881120913145">5</xref>).</p>

                  <title>Comparison with previous (average-based) oxytocin findings</title>
                  <p>The above results (TFT and TF2T vs. Coop) corroborate and expand our previous conclusion, reported with part of the present sample (~59%), that oxytocin lowers the cooperative attitude with computers following a mutual defection outcome or an unreciprocated cooperation outcome in women, but not as much in men (<xref rid="bibr44-0269881120913145" ref-type="bibr">Rilling et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bibr45-0269881120913145" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). However, using the exact same sample, we also reported a null effect of oxytocin and of any interaction with sex on the probability of cooperating following a mutual cooperation (<xref rid="bibr23-0269881120913145" ref-type="bibr">Feng et al., 2015</xref>), on the number of cooperation choices and on the probability of cooperating following unreciprocated cooperation (<xref rid="bibr9-0269881120913145" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2016</xref>). This suggests that analyses using transition probabilities may be insufficiently sensitive to the effects of these drugs.</p>
                  <p>Others have reported (<xref rid="bibr55-0269881120913145" ref-type="bibr">Yao et al., 2014</xref>) that women show more punitive behaviour than men do towards humans who breach their trust – which, in the present case, is what we found for computer but not for human partners. On the other hand, it has also been previously reported (<xref rid="bibr47-0269881120913145" ref-type="bibr">Scheele et al., 2014</xref>) in another moral dilemma task that women under oxytocin exhibit more prosocial behaviour, endorsing in less self-benefit outcomes, whereas men under oxytocin show a bias towards self-benefiting outcomes. This result may further converge with the disappearance of a preference for TFT over unconditional cooperation when women under oxytocin played against a human (vs. a computer). At the same time, evidence (<xref rid="bibr50-0269881120913145" ref-type="bibr">Theodoridou et al., 2013</xref>) suggests that oxytocin enhances social perspective taking in men, having no effect in women, perhaps because, in women, this heightened tendency is already present, regardless of oxytocin intake. However, in the present study, oxytocin did not change the preference in men, but only in women. Lastly, the present results are consistent with both the social salience hypothesis of oxytocin and the prosocial hypothesis of oxytocin by providing converging evidence that it increases generosity, cooperation, trust and anthropomorphism in women.</p>

                  <title>Vasopressin’s general facilitation of sensitivity to the behaviour of others</title>
                  <p>As for vasopressin, we found that it increased the preference for a TFT strategy over unconditional cooperation nearly twofold, irrespective of sex or partner. This difference was not noticeable in the TF2T versus Coop comparison. These findings partially converge with our previous transition probability results (<xref rid="bibr44-0269881120913145" ref-type="bibr">Rilling et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bibr45-0269881120913145" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Using part of the present sample (~59%), we showed that vasopressin increased conciliatory behaviour in women (i.e. increased the probability of cooperation following unreciprocated cooperation), but also increased reciprocation of cooperation when men played against both computers and humans. Among women, vasopressin lowered the rates of cooperation with computers following an outcome of mutual defection in the previous round. Even though this effect was seen exclusively in women playing against a computer and does not amount directly to a TFT strategy, it is in accordance with what we see in the present analysis. Furthermore, we also reported, with the present sample and data, that vasopressin increased the probability of cooperating after a mutual cooperation more in men than in women (<xref rid="bibr23-0269881120913145" ref-type="bibr">Feng et al., 2015</xref>) and that it decreased the probability that men would cooperate after an unreciprocated cooperation outcome from computers (<xref rid="bibr9-0269881120913145" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2016</xref>), which agrees with the pervasive preference for a TFT strategy.</p>
                  <p>Overall, the present findings show that vasopressin generally renders subjects’ behaviour more contingent on partners’ choice, irrespective of sex or partner type. Even though the present results diverge from the idea that vasopressin increases mutual cooperation (<xref rid="bibr8-0269881120913145" ref-type="bibr">Brunnlieb et al., 2016</xref>), they converge with previous findings that suggest that vasopressin can have antisocial effects, such as selfish and punitive behaviour (<xref rid="bibr48-0269881120913145" ref-type="bibr">Stanton, 2007</xref>). Furthermore, this effect might be attributable to vasopressin increasing the salience of social stimuli (e.g. the partner’s choice).</p>

                <title>Limitations and future directions</title>
                <p>As a reflection on potential limitations, the present analysis is based on assigning a preferred strategy to each individual playing against a specific partner through maximum-likelihood, which differs from our previous analysis that compared transition probabilities (<xref rid="bibr9-0269881120913145" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bibr23-0269881120913145" ref-type="bibr">Feng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bibr44-0269881120913145" ref-type="bibr">Rilling et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bibr45-0269881120913145" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). As such, comparisons between both types of data should be made with caution. There is also still limited research in this field including sex as a quasi-experimental variable, which is warranted given previous findings that point to distinct neural substrates between the sexes (<xref rid="bibr45-0269881120913145" ref-type="bibr">Rilling et al., 2014</xref>). Additionally, until there is evidence to show that playing against players of the same or different sex can modulate the effect of oxytocin or vasopressin, we cannot be sure the drug-level difference we found is exclusively due to the participant’s sex and not to the partner’s. Nevertheless, in the present study, the participants always played against those of the same sex. There is indeed evidence that opposite-sex dyads result in different levels of cooperation, namely more competition in same-sex dyads (<xref rid="bibr38-0269881120913145" ref-type="bibr">Mack et al., 1971</xref>), and that in opposite-sex dyads there is decreased sensitivity to the opponent’s behaviour and strategy (<xref rid="bibr33-0269881120913145" ref-type="bibr">Knight, 1980</xref>). However, given that previous research has mostly focused on studying same-sex dyads, we too opted to study same-sex dyads to facilitate comparability with the literature on this social dilemma.</p>
                <p>Further studies should explore if the dose of oxytocin alters the observed pattern of behaviour, namely to investigate support for the inverted U-shape hypothesis of social reward (<xref rid="bibr6-0269881120913145" ref-type="bibr">Borland et al., 2018</xref>). This hypothesis proposes that there is an inverted U-shape relationship between oxytocin dose, social reward and neural activity in males and females. This hypothesis is still rather unexplored in humans. However, these and related findings on the effect of these neuropeptides in human behaviour may contribute to the better design of both aetiological and intranasal oxytocin therapeutic models of social symptoms – particularly in anxiety, psychosis and autism spectrum disorders.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>In sum, oxytocin increased the proportion of women who adopted the ‘always cooperate’ strategy with human partners (and reduced it when with computers, therein approaching men’s behaviour). In men, oxytocin produced no effect, and they were less cooperative, more retaliatory and more corrective with human compared to non-human partners. Women may be more lenient than men in social interactions when experiencing higher oxytocin function, herein mimicked by intranasal intake, which is plausibly consistent with evolutionary pressures towards making women more tolerable to children’s aversive behaviour during childcare, which in turn is well aligned with the heightened physiological measurements of oxytocin in women during maternal bonding. Furthermore, vasopressin intake increased the proportion of subjects who played a tit-for-tat strategy, where cooperation is more contingent on the partner’s choice. That is, vasopressin may be sensitising players to their partner’s choices.</p>
              <p>Overall, our findings improve the knowledge of the biological mechanisms involved in social/economic decision making in humans and, importantly, emphasise sex differences in a literature where mostly men are researched. By doing so, they may help better explain, physiologically, the different behavioural deficit patterns seen between sexes, in the same psychiatric illnesses, for example in antisocial personality disorder or autism spectrum disorder, where women tend to show less social deficits and be more prosocial. Clinically, they can also help predict the behavioural effects of using these neuropeptides therapeutically, as is being trialled nowadays in autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia.</p>
