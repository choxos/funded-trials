                <p id="Par1">There was a varied spatial distribution of reported syphilis cases across cities in South China. This study aims to identify and describe spatiotemporal clusters of primary and secondary syphilis (P/S) cases in this region. Reported syphilis cases in Guangdong Province, China, from January 2014 to June 2015 were collected from the national centralized reporting system. Spatiotemporal clusters of P/S were identified and cross-validated by calculating local Moran’s I, performing hotspot analysis (Getis-Ord Gi*), and constructing a discrete Poisson model in SaTScan. Reported cases within and outside the clusters were compared by bivariable and multivariable logistic regression. Out of 17,691 reported P/S cases, 11% were in the identified spatiotemporal clusters. The monthly P/S notification rate (per 100,000 persons) ranged between 0.6 and 1. The identified clusters were located in 14, out of 126, counties in eight, out of 21, cities. Cases of older age, living in rural area and taking self-initiated syphilis test were more likely to be in the clusters. Some areas bore a greater burden of P/S in Guangdong Province. Routine spatiotemporal analysis of P/S cases may be useful for enhancing syphilis control programs by strategic location-based service planning.</p>

              <p id="Par2">In China, notifiable sexually transmitted infections (STIs) include HIV/AIDS, syphilis and gonorrhoea. Among the notifiable STIs, syphilis, caused by <italic>Treponema pallidum</italic>, is the most commonly reported STI, imposing an increasing burden in China in the past decade. The average annual increase in the incidence of syphilis was as high as 16.3% between 2004 and 2013, comparable to that for HIV/AIDS (16.3%) and much higher than that for gonorrhoea (−8.5%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Although the annual rate of primary and secondary syphilis (P/S) notification (per 100,000 persons) had dropped from 13.44 in 2012 to 9.81 in 2015 in China, it was still much higher than that in the United States (US) (ranging from 5 in 2012 to 7.6 in 2015, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats15/tables/27.htm">https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats15/tables/27.htm</ext-link>). While male-to-male-sex is the main route of transmission in the US and Europe<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, heterosexual transmission predominates in China. The epidemiologic difference in the route of transmission is illustrated by the variation in the gender distribution of P/S cases. More than 90% of the cases were male in the US (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats15/tables/27.htm">https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats15/tables/27.htm</ext-link>), but male comprised only 51% of all cases in China as shown in the National STD Management Information System.</p>
              <p id="Par3">Previous studies showed an uneven geographic distribution of reported syphilis cases in China and other countries including Canada<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Spatiotemporal analyses of syphilis are important for two reasons. First, mapping of syphilis cases over time and cluster detection could identify potential hot spot areas so as to guide the resource allocation for epidemic control<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Second, an understanding of the characteristics of syphilis cases in spatiotemporal clusters would be important for identifying new target groups for intervention. As sex networking patterns may vary over time and space, identifying the spatiotemporal clustering pattern from readily available surveillance data (reported P/S cases) could be an alternative yet feasible approach. By definition the P/S stages refer to syphilis infection in the preceding 1 year and are associated with high infectivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, so the reported number of P/S cases could be a useful marker for active transmission of syphilis in the community. Studies have suggested that an investigation of syphilis outbreaks in conjunction with spatiotemporal analyses could inform tailored strategies, in response to different modes of transmission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par4">Only a few studies have examined the spatial heterogeneity and identified the spatial clusters of reported syphilis cases in China<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Most of them applied only one method for cluster detection without cross validation. The purpose of this study was to identify and describe spatiotemporal clusters of primary and secondary syphilis cases at county level in Guangdong Province, China.</p>

                <title>Study area – Guangdong, China</title>
                <p id="Par5">The number of reported syphilis cases (50,019 cases in 2015) in Guangdong Province was the highest among all provinces in China<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. A dramatic rise of total reported syphilis cases from 13.47 per 100,000 persons in 2000 to 51.71 per 100,000 persons in 2013 was recorded<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. The province is located in the southern part of China. It composes of 21 cities, which can be subdivided into 126 smaller counties. In 1995–2013, the population of permanent residents in the province increased from 73,874,900 to 106,440,000, and the proportion of urban population increased from 39% to 68%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. The population was dynamic, with an annual population immigration rate of 11% and an emigration rate of 9% in 2013.</p>

                <title>Data source and processing</title>
                <p id="Par6">From the national case-based surveillance system (CBSS), we retrospectively accessed data of reported syphilis cases who were diagnosed and living in Guangdong Province from 1 January 2014 to 30 June 2015. Over this study period, correct syphilis staging rate reported by doctors was higher due to additional training of doctors in sexually transmitted diseases (STD) clinics. Syphilis cases were defined by the presence of two positive laboratory tests (nontreponemal test and treponemal test) along with clinical signs and symptoms consistent with syphilis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Permanent resident population data in Guangdong Province at county level in 2011 were collected from Leprosy Management Information System in China. We also downloaded Chinese administrative boundaries in city and county level from GADM database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gadm.org/country">http://www.gadm.org/country</ext-link>). Because of the change of county number and their respective boundaries across time, county boundaries were revised from the downloaded version so as to match with the list of counties in the case reporting dataset.</p>

                <p id="Par10">Global Moran’s I of reported P/S cases per 100,000 persons at county level was calculated to examine the spatial clustering pattern. A Moran’s I value near +1 indicates positive spatial autocorrelation (similar values are found together forming a cluster), 0 indicates random distribution, whereas a value near −1 indicates negative spatial autocorrelation (dissimilar values are found together). To identify location of clusters, local Moran’s I was computed and hotspot analysis (Getis-Ord Gi*) were performed in ArcGIS10.3. The spatial analysis is based on the first law of geography, that things closer are more similar than things farther apart (spatial autocorrelation)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Local Moran’s I is a measure of spatial autocorrelation, the analysis of which detects clusters with similar neighbouring features and outliers spatially. In hotspot analysis, spatial clusters were classified as hot spot (high value) or cold spot (low values). To demonstrate and validate the temporal change of spatial clustering and clusters, we performed all analyses on a monthly basis with p-value &lt; 0.05<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.</p>
                <p id="Par11">Spatiotemporal clusters of P/S rate were also detected by discrete Poisson model in SaTScan<sup>TM</sup> 9.4. Within a cylindrical scanning window, analyses were performed with the circular base corresponding to space, and the height corresponding to time. Clusters were detected when the number of expected events was larger than the observed ones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. We set 3% of population as the maximum spatial cluster size and 90% of days as the maximum temporal cluster size. Sensitivity analyses with 1%, 2%, 5% and 9% of population with 90% time window were performed. Significance of the defined clusters was determined by Monte Carlo simulations with 999 replications, with p-value &lt; 0.05 as threshold. We input the number of cases per county per day in ‘case’ file, number of total population size in county in ‘pop’ file, and latitude and longitude of county centroid in ‘geo’ file.</p>

                <p id="Par15">From January 2014 through June 2015, 82,554 syphilis cases were reported in Guangdong Province. Among them, 17,691 (21%) were P/S cases, 62,662 (76%) were latent syphilis, 943 (1%) were tertiary syphilis and 1,258 (2%) were congenital syphilis. Annual male P/S notification rate (per 100,000 persons) was 13 and female P/S notification rate was 11 in 2014. The monthly P/S notification rate (per 100,000 persons) ranged between 0.6 (February 2015) and 1 (May 2014). The monthly rate in 2014 was higher than that in 2015, and no obvious peaks were identified. The troughs of monthly P/S notification rate were observed during the Lunar New Year (STD clinics closed during public holidays), February 2014 and February 2015, respectively. A month (March) following the trough, the notification rate increased over the preceding month (January).</p>

Some cities experienced persistently low level of P/S cases over time (e.g. City F, City J, City M, City N and City S), and a few had declining trends (City R and City P). However, some cities showed the presence of occasional high level of P/S activity (City A, City E, City K and City U).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Geographic distribution of rate of primary and secondary syphilis (P/S) cases (per 100,000 persons) in county level in 2014, and the smoothed trends of bi-weekly number of reported P/S syphilis cases in city level of Guangdong Province from January 2014 through June 2015 (the map was created in ArcGIS 10.3).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41598_2018_27173_Fig2_HTML" id="d29e511"/></fig></p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par21">We observed a spatial variation of reported P/S rate over 18 months and identified a number of spatiotemporal clusters in Guangdong Province, China. The existence of spatial clustering is consistent with the findings in a previous study in Shenzhen (City B)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Interestingly, the clusters were not concentrated in one area, forming a bigger cluster, but sparsely distributed in four PRD cities (urban areas) and four non-PRD cities (mostly rural areas). Given the observed spatiotemporal distribution of cases, diffusion of syphilis from one place to another was rather unlikely in the study period. Socio-demographics and syphilis testing sites were factors significantly associated with P/S cases within the clusters. This study expands the literature by identifying the factors associated with P/S clusters in Guangdong, China.</p>
              <p id="Par22">In this study, older cases were more likely to be in P/S clusters, forming a possible high risk subgroup in community. In a previous Chinese study, around half of STD patients aged above 50 were male clients of female sex workers (FSW), of which a quarter reported multiple sex partners<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. FSW can be roughly ranked by “tiers” with reference to the price charged per sex trade or the type of stationed venue of FSW (more visible and well-managed venues for middle/high-tier FSW, and street-based venues and more invisible venues for low-tier FSW). The preference of low-tier FSW among older men, found in a previous study, might shed light on this observation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. As compared with middle- or high-tier FSW, the transmission risk of syphilis by sexual contact with low-tier FSW would be higher for two main reasons. First, the prevalence of syphilis in low-tier FSW (11.8%) was much higher than middle/high-tier FSW (3.2%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> and male clients of FSW (8.8%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. In general, the number of clients per day was higher and history of engaging in sex trade was longer among low-tier FSW than high- and middle-tier FSW<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Second, lower-tier FSW usually charged less and were compromised to have risky sexual behaviour, due to their lower bargaining power for their sex work. Other studies had reported that older aged were less likely to get diagnosed at primary stage or secondary stage because of their lower perceived risk and less understanding on STD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. However, if they were diagnosed with P/S, they were more likely to be in P/S clusters than other age groups.</p>
              <p id="Par23">Our study revealed a potential transmission of syphilis in rural areas in China. This finding is consistent with a study in North Carolina, U.S., where high rate of syphilis and gonorrhoea in rural areas was reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. However, clusters were not limited to rural areas in the North Carolina study. Instead, large clusters covering urban, metropolitan, small town, and rural areas were identified<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Similar to older clients of FSW, clients in rural area might prefer middle and low-tier FSW, because of their lower affordability for sex services in rural areas in China. A previous study found that more than 80% of FSW in urban periphery or rural area were middle and low-tier FSW<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Although the syphilis prevalence of these FSW was not high (2%), the condom usage rate in the previous month was low at 50%, and 23.5% of them had experienced STD symptom in the past 1 year<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Another study in rural area of Guangxi Province reported a high syphilis prevalence of low-tier FSW at 12.5%, and 75% of their clients were aged ≥40 years old<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. In addition, a previous study in Meizhou (City H), one of the clusters identified in this study, showed that most of the syphilis cases were farmers or unemployed, and less educated with sexual health<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. This observation partly reflected a lower affordability for commercial sex and lower awareness of sexual health among the infected cases in the city. Expansion of some public health interventions targeting older adults in rural areas, such as sexual health education and promotion of condom use is, therefore, needed.</p>
              <p id="Par24">We found that P/S syphilis cluster cases were more likely to be in the vicinity of STD clinics, VCT sites, and CBOs. This finding echoed some previous studies in the U.S., where patients recently diagnosed with STI (gonorrhoea and chlamydia) were more likely to have past history of STI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. These patients with repeated STI might be the core transmitters, who shall be targeted for risk reduction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Individuals visiting these sites may have higher odds to experience symptoms or have high risk sexual behaviours recently. They were more likely to be diagnosed early<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, and probably be in the cluster (recent transmission network). Settings like STD clinics and VCT sites/CBOs are key places for capturing P/S cases for screening, diagnosis and treatment. An increased accessibility of STD clinics, VCT sites and CBOs could enhance STI testing rate. As sexual partners of positive cases have higher risk of being infected, effective partner notification and contact tracing are crucial to identify possibly linked syphilis cases in the same sexual network. Therefore, in addition to scaling up the screening coverage, partner notification, contact tracing and risk reduction programme should be implemented in these settings to intervene ongoing transmission in the community<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par25">We acknowledged the possibility of non-locally acquired infection, which could not be reflected from the study results due to the limitations of data in the case-reporting system. For instance, no clusters were detected in Dongguan city (City K), an economic centre in PRD with highly mobile population and high syphilis prevalence among detained FSW (15.4%) and their clients (9.2%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. However, more than 90% of the registered residency among these detained FSW and their clients’ were provinces other than Guangdong<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. As most of the clients of FSW were unlikely to be local residents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>, their diagnosis of syphilis could have been made in close proximity to their residential places, instead of the place for risky sexual behaviour. Our data only reflects the location of residence, but not the location for sex. Therefore, while interventions targeting cluster areas are needed, non-cluster areas (accounting for 89% of P/S cases), especially places with more commercial sex activities, deserve more attentions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. In addition, recurring crackdowns against FSW in some cities may influence transmission. For example, a large-scale three-month sex work crackdown was initiated in Dongguan city (City K) and other locations in February 2014<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Given that we did not have complete data on the scope of these activities, we could not incorporate them into our analysis. In HIV epidemiology, non-locally acquired infection plays an important role<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. The case-reporting system should include suspected place of infection, such that a crude estimation on the proportion of non-locally acquired infection could be made. Community-based syphilis epidemiological study could fill the gap and provide useful reference for strategic epidemic control planning.</p>
              <p id="Par26">We acknowledge several limitations. First, reported early latent syphilis cases, who were also infectious to others, were not included. The Chinese syphilis case reporting system combines early latent and late latent cases. As early latent syphilis epidemiology is important in understanding syphilis transmission thoroughly, it is recommended to classify latent syphilis cases into early latent and late latent stages in the case reporting system. One possible classification approach is to make full use of syphilis titer data, which could be an indicator for defining active syphilis infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Of note, only primary and secondary syphilis cases were included in analysis, and the clustering pattern could be different from the overall syphilis epidemic. Second, the study duration was 1.5 years, which was too short for sophisticated temporal analysis. Data in the latest years were selected due to significant improvement in correct syphilis staging reported by the doctors in the province<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. Misclassification of syphilis stages could not be ruled out, especially in places without sufficient training for making syphilis diagnosis and case reporting. In the national syphilis control plan 2010–2020, training and examination of healthcare providers have been put in the agenda for mitigating the problem<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Third, the reporting system is not able to differentiate FSW from non-FSW, and male client of FSW from male non-clients. As they are normally the core groups disproportionately involved in syphilis transmission networks, missing of such information limits the understanding of syphilis transmission dynamics. Lastly, we acknowledged high syphilis prevalence among men who have sex with men (MSM) in China<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Unfortunately, there was a high proportion of missing data in the relevant field for distinguishing MSM from non-MSM. Further investigation was limited in the study period.</p>
              <p id="Par27">Nonetheless, findings in this study could enhance the understanding of spatiotemporal distribution of syphilis epidemic. The identified clusters of P/S cases in Guangdong Province could be the starting points for subsequent local investigations and planning of location-based interventions. Spatiotemporal cluster detection by multiple approaches could cross-validate the results with each other, and give valuable additional epidemiological information, on top of the current surveillance system. As cases of higher age and living in rural areas were more likely to be in clusters, sexual health education and condom usage promotion should be expanded to cover these populations. In addition, interventions for partner notification, contact tracing and syphilis testing should be scaled-up in STD clinics and VCT sites or CBOs, where cases were more likely to visit for syphilis testing. The service catchment of these healthcare services should be expanded to improve accessibility and enhance testing. In areas with frequent misclassification of syphilis staging, more training should be provided to the doctors for accurate documentation of patients’ conditions and making valid epidemiological inference.</p>
              <p id="Par28">To conclude, P/S notification rates clustered but scattered in eight out of 21 cities in Guangdong Province. Individuals of older age, living in rural area and undergoing syphilis test in STD clinics, VCT sites or CBOs were more likely to be in clusters, suggesting their involvement in the possible transmission network. Our study findings and spatiotemporal analysis approach may be useful for designing tailored syphilis control program.</p>
