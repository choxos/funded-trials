                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Cannabis dependence is a significant public health problem. Because there are
no approved medications for this condition, treatment must rely on
behavioral approaches empirically complemented by such lifestyle change as
exercise.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Aims</title>
                  <p>To examine the effects of moderate aerobic exercise on cannabis craving and
use in cannabis dependent adults under normal living conditions.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Design</title>
                  <p>Participants attended 10 supervised 30-min treadmill exercise sessions
standardized using heart rate (HR) monitoring (60–70% HR
reserve) over 2 weeks. Exercise sessions were conducted by exercise
physiologists under medical oversight.</p>

                  <title>Participants</title>
                  <p>Sedentary or minimally active non-treatment seeking cannabis-dependent adults
(n = 12, age 25±3 years, 8 females) met criteria
for primary cannabis dependence using the Substance Abuse module of the
Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID).</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Measurements</title>
                  <p>Self-reported drug use was assessed for 1-week before, during, and 2-weeks
after the study. Participants viewed visual cannabis cues before and after
exercise in conjunction with assessment of subjective cannabis craving using
the Marijuana Craving Questionnaire (MCQ-SF).</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>Daily cannabis use within the run-in period was 5.9 joints per day
(SD = 3.1, range 1.8–10.9). Average cannabis use
levels within the exercise (2.8 joints, SD = 1.6, range
0.9–5.4) and follow-up (4.1 joints, SD = 2.5,
range 1.1–9.5) periods were lower than during the run-in period (both
P&lt;.005). Average MCQ factor scores for the pre- and post-exercise craving
assessments were reduced for compulsivity (P  = .006),
emotionality (P  = .002), expectancy (P
 = .002), and purposefulness (P
 = .002).</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>The findings of this pilot study warrant larger, adequately powered
controlled trials to test the efficacy of prescribed moderate aerobic
exercise as a component of cannabis dependence treatment. The
neurobiological mechanisms that account for these beneficial effects on
cannabis use may lead to understanding of the physical and emotional
underpinnings of cannabis dependence and recovery from this disorder.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Cannabis abuse or dependence and complications have increased in all age groups in
the past decade in the United States. In 2009, approximately 16.7 million
(6.6%) Americans age 12 or older reported cannabis use in the past month and
6.1 million used the drug on 20 or more days per month <xref rid="pone.0017465-Substance1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Treatment admissions
primarily for cannabis dependence have also risen both in absolute numbers (∼1.2
million/year) and as a percentage of total addiction treatment admissions, from
7% in 1998 to 16% in 2009 <xref rid="pone.0017465-Substance1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Hence, there is a great
public health need to develop safe and effective therapeutic interventions for
cannabis use disorders.</p>
              <p>Since there are no US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) -approved medications for
cannabis dependence, treatment currently relies primarily on behavioral approaches
generically used for treatment of all drug use disorders <xref rid="pone.0017465-Budney1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Aerobic exercise training,
empirically part of a healthy drug-free lifestyle, has been considered as a
promising behavioral approach in drug and alcohol treatment programs. Most
extensively studied has been the effect of exercise on tobacco smoking. For example,
a 2008 Cochrane Database reviewed 13 randomized trials in smokers or recent
quitters, enrolled in an exercise program and followed for six months or more <xref rid="pone.0017465-Ussher1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Certain of the
reviewed studies showed significantly higher abstinence rates in a physically active
group in comparison with a control group by the end of treatment <xref rid="pone.0017465-VanRensburg1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. However,
to our knowledge, the direct effect of exercise on cannabis use <italic>per
se</italic> has not been previously reported. In two very recent pilot studies,
exercise training (2–6 months) was used as treatment to reduce drug use in
general. In the first study of 38 drug abusers (51% of whom abused cannabis),
the 58% who completed the program increased fitness level and improved
quality of life <xref rid="pone.0017465-Roessler1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. At the end of the exercise program, 15 of the 20 drug
abusers at least downgraded their drug intake. In a second study of 16
drug-dependent patients, those who participated in at least 8 of 12 weekly exercise
sessions had significantly better substance use outcomes than those who did not
<xref rid="pone.0017465-Brown1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p>
              <p>Based on reports that aerobic exercise produces a host of psychological effects
potentially associated with reductions in substance abuse <xref rid="pone.0017465-Brown1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0017465-Brown2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0017465-Lynch1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0017465-Smith1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, we hypothesized that the
exercise may generically alter reward circuits such that exercise takes the place of
cannabis use to a significant degree because of training, thereby reducing cannabis
use as exercise becomes more reinforcing. The purpose of this pilot study was to
examine the effects of a supervised 2-week moderate exercise program on cannabis
craving and use in non-treatment seeking cannabis dependent adults in their normal
living environment.</p>

taken any psychotropic or vasoactive medications within 6 weeks of screen day.
Also excluded were persons who smoked more than 10 cigarettes per day in the

              <p>This study shows for the first time that participation in a supervised 2-week aerobic
exercise program can reduce cannabis use in non-treatment seeking adults who meet
criteria for cannabis dependence. Our findings also show that after exercise program
completion, cannabis use significantly increased towards pre-treatment levels.
Observed enduring effects were very likely caused by a relatively short (2 weeks)
follow up and may well have returned to the baseline level with a longer period of
observation. Consistent with the changes in cannabis use reported by participants,
subjective cravings elicited by cannabis cues were also significantly reduced by
exercise, suggesting the possibility that the potential therapeutic effect of
exercise may be mediated via brain mechanisms responsible for cue-induced
craving.</p>
              <p>Why occasional self-administration of rewarding drugs can progress to out-of-control
use or conversely, how some individuals engaged in such a self-destructive pattern
of drug use may eventually stop taking drugs and recover from addiction have not
been fully elucidated. However, learning-related processes, particularly in brain
reward circuits, have been considered a partial explanation <xref rid="pone.0017465-Wise1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. These same brain mechanisms have
been invoked in behavioral addictions involving non-drug rewards, as is observed in
overeating and obesity, problematic hypersexuality, and pathological gambling <xref rid="pone.0017465-Martin1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Analogously,
it has been reported that exercise activates some of the same reward pathways as are
activated by addictive drugs. For instance, acute bouts of exercise increase central
dopamine concentrations <xref rid="pone.0017465-Fisher1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0017465-Hattori1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0017465-Meeusen1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0017465-Petzinger1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> and chronic exercise leads to sustained increases in
dopamine concentrations and compensatory alterations in dopamine binding proteins in
brain regions relevant to reward <xref rid="pone.0017465-Gilliam1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0017465-MacRae1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0017465-Morgan1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Moreover, aerobic exercise produces a host of beneficial
effects, including improved self-esteem, weight control, and diminished depressive
symptoms <xref rid="pone.0017465-Dunn1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0017465-Muller1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0017465-Norris1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0017465-Norris2" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0017465-Veale1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0017465-Waade1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>.</p>
              <p>It is not fully understood how exercise may affect drug use in general or cannabis
use in particular because exercise is by no means universally rewarding. For
instance, vigorous exercise intensities above the lactate threshold (a marker of
aerobic exercise intensity) actually induce more negative affective responses than
sub-threshold, self-selected exercise intensities<xref rid="pone.0017465-Parfitt1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. It is hypothesized that this
aversive exercise intensity threshold can be shifted to a higher level with training
and hence may progressively make exercise more compelling even in those in whom it
was initially aversive. Therefore, while it seems reasonable that rewarding effects
of physical activity associated with exercise have the potential to supplant other
behaviors such as drug use in the behavioral repertoire, this seems even more
plausible over time with physical training.</p>
              <p>A possible explanation for the beneficial effects of exercise on cannabis consumption
may relate to affective changes associated with exercise that may alter cannabis use
by diminishing depression and/or anxiety. For example, intermediary metabolism in
muscle may be linked to affective changes as has been suggested by research on brain
mechanisms of anxiety as triggered by lactate infusions <xref rid="pone.0017465-Johnson1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. An important question for
future research is whether the beneficial effects of exercise on cannabis dependence
are maintained over the long term as the present study was of relatively short
duration. In addition, the neurobiological underpinnings of these beneficial effects
on behavior may enhance our understanding of both cannabis dependence and recovery
from this condition. Finally, the brain and peripheral mechanisms that account for
these reductions in cannabis use may lead to valuable understanding of wellness,
both physical and emotional.</p>
              <p>Our study has several strengths. First, our study included cannabis users who were
not interested in treatment, which suggests that this approach may be even more
effective in individuals who are motivated to stop or limit cannabis use. Second,
the study intervention was monitored and the treatment was adjusted to individual
aerobic capacity eliminating a potential bias with exercise intensity and
adherence.</p>
              <p>Our study also has some limitations. First, we did not include a control condition
but our goal was to assess the feasibility of conducting such studies and to
determine any effects of this intervention on individual cannabis use. It is
possible that other forms of intervention such as isometric exercise or body image
methods will show effects similar to exercise as is the case in studies with tobacco
(nicotine) dependence <xref rid="pone.0017465-Ussher2" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. It has been shown that when smoked cannabis is mixed
with tobacco, so that the consumption of cannabis is associated with tobacco
smoking, cannabis use impedes the users' attempts to quit tobacco smoking <xref rid="pone.0017465-Agrawal1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0017465-Arpana1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Second, our
sample was relatively small. However, that we observed a highly significant effect
even with these small numbers suggests an important effect size. Finally, we used
self-report to assess cannabis use in a free-living environment with all its
limitations. There is not a reliable and objective method to assess cannabis use in
normal free-living environment since cannabinoid elimination from bodily fluids has
such a long half-life. Consequently, most studies of cannabis consumption rely on
self-reports. Nevertheless, self-report methods as we have employed in this study do
provide reliable results, do not affect adherence, and are not burdensome to
participants. The strategies we used to increase compliance (monetary incentives,
follow-ups for missed appointments) while designed to increase validity,
nevertheless reduced generalizability of our findings.</p>
              <p>In summary, we found that participation in a supervised moderate exercise program
could decrease cannabis use in association with reduced cannabis cue-induced craving
in cannabis-dependent young adults who were not seeking treatment. Taken together,
the findings of this pilot study suggest that a larger, adequately powered
controlled trial is warranted to test the efficacy of moderate exercise as a
component of treatment for cannabis dependence under real-world conditions. Such a
study should also test the efficacy of a longer exercise program to determine the
duration of treatment effects. Additionally, these studies should include a more
diverse (age, ethnicity) population of individuals and especially cannabis dependent
individuals who are motivated to seek abstinence from cannabis.</p>
