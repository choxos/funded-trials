                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>The <italic>Healthy People 2020</italic> report states a goal of 80% uptake of recommended vaccines among adolescents, including the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine. However, the rate of uptake of the HPV vaccine is estimated at 51% in 2018, which leaves young people vulnerable to morbidity and mortality from preventable, HPV-related cancers. Reasons for this are multifactorial and include factors at the level of the provider, primary care practice, patient and family, and community. The development of interventions that are responsive to these multifactorial barriers in real-world settings is a priority. Boot Camp Translation (BCT) is a community-engaged approach to message development for translating evidence-based practices into clinics and communities. This project aims to (1) Engage practices and communities in the development of interventions to promote HPV vaccine uptake and (2) Evaluate the impact of the BCT-designed intervention on practice-level HPV vaccine initiation rates. We hypothesise that the BCT-designed intervention will increase the rate of HPV vaccine initiation in the practices.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>This study will implement HPV-focused BCT in three counties in Colorado with a below average county-level vaccination rate. Each BCT group will design a multipronged intervention targeted at patients, parents, providers and the general community to then be disseminated in the participating practices and communities over the subsequent 6-month period. The long-term goal is to develop a replicable approach and low-cost method of increasing HPV vaccine uptake that is easily adaptable to different settings and sociodemographic contexts.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>The human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine is underused. <italic>Healthy People 2020</italic> states a goal coverage level of 80% for all vaccines routinely recommended for adolescents.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> These adolescent vaccines include the tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis (Tdap), meningococcal (MenACWY), HPV and influenza vaccines. Although coverage rates for all these vaccines have been rising steadily, only Tdap and MenACWY coverage levels have achieved the national goals, with coverage rates for 2018 at 89% and 86.6%, respectively.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> HPV vaccination levels are increasing at a substantially slower pace than the other adolescent vaccines. Series completion rate for 2018 is estimated at 51.1% for adolescents in the USA.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> These trends persist for Colorado, where HPV vaccine series completion rates are only 53.8%.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> HPV vaccines are preferentially recommended for adolescents aged 11–12 years to provide the vaccine well before exposure to HPV infection, which typically occurs shortly after sexual debut.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Unfortunately, in USA, adolescents aged 11–12 years have the lowest levels of HPV vaccine utilisation compared with all other adolescent age categories. Thus, there is an urgent need to find mechanisms to increase HPV vaccination uptake among adolescents, particularly adolescents aged 11–12 years.</p>
              <p>The public health benefits of HPV vaccination cannot be realised until higher coverage levels among adolescents are achieved. Modelling studies indicate that high levels (80%–100%) of adolescent HPV vaccine utilisation can result in near eradication of genital warts, a 63%–86% reduction of anal cancers, a 76%–83% reduction in cervical cancer and a 56%–74% decrease in abnormal Papanicolaou smears among women, and an 86% reduction in HPV-associated genital cancers in men.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> With more than 80% of sexually active adults infected with HPV by age 50 years, HPV vaccination is a cost-effective public health intervention, and widespread use of the vaccine could save billions of healthcare utilisation dollars related to the management of HPV-related cancers.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> However, when lower levels of HPV vaccine utilisation are considered, such as that found among adolescents in the USA, the cost-effectiveness of HPV vaccination is significantly less favourable.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Barriers to HPV vaccination are often contextual and involve factors at the level of the provider, patient/parent, practice and policy. Engagement of stakeholders at each of those levels is likely to improve uptake.</p>
              <sec id="s1-1">
                <title>Developing interventions to promote uptake</title>
                <p>Previous research has demonstrated that multifaceted interventions that target both the provider and the patient are more successful than single-pronged interventions for improving vaccine uptake.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 9</xref> Furthermore, interventions that include active engagement by stakeholders tend to have more success than interventions with passive engagement.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Thus, community engagement strategies have promise for the development and implementation of interventions to increase HPV vaccine uptake. By engaging multiple stakeholders, these approaches to intervention development are more comprehensive as they account for numerous factors at the level of the patient, practice and the broader community. There have been relatively few studies evaluating the impact of community engagement strategies on HPV vaccination. Several studies have implemented social marketing approaches to promoting HPV vaccination,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 11</xref> but while community-focused, these interventions are often not community-engaged. Other studies have implemented focus groups, but focus groups often lack the intensity and depth of engagement required to improve the translation of evidence-based interventions.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12–14</xref></p>
                <p>Boot Camp Translation (BCT) is a community-engagement approach that was developed in the High Plains Research Network, a geographically defined practice-based research network (PBRN) in eastern Colorado, to improve the translation of medical evidence into communities.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> The genesis of BCT was a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention grant to improve colorectal cancer (CRC) screening in rural and frontier counties in eastern Colorado.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> First, community members gained expertise in CRC screening through a continuing education presentation, with substantial time for community members to interact with the medical expert and ask questions. Community members changed the technical language to make the topic more accessible to their rural communities. They changed words such as ‘colorectal’ to ‘colon cancer’ to make it easier to talk about in public. Given the complexity of the concept of ‘screening’, they eliminated this language and changed the title of the project to ‘Testing to Prevent Colon Cancer’. By disseminating these messages through local channels and primary care practices, the programme reached 70% of the target population and resulted in a 10% increase in testing.

                <p>Since inception, BCT has been used numerous times to address a wide variety of health topics, including hypertension, diabetes, chronic pain, mental health, asthma and cardiovascular disease prevention.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 18 19</xref> The BCT focused on asthma resulted in (1) A set of messages to increase awareness of asthma and its symptoms, and (2) A provider toolkit for use in primary care practices. The provider toolkits reached 57 out of the 58 primary care practices in eastern Colorado and resulted in 79% of the practices initiating or increasing their use of spirometry in diagnosis and management, 40% of the practices increased the use of inhaled corticosteroids for symptom control, and 53% of the practices increased their implementation of asthma action plans.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Additionally, as part of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality EvidenceNOW initiative to improve cardiovascular care, four communities in Colorado and New Mexico used BCTs to create a distinct set of products that were strongly influenced by the community context.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Early results (study in progress) indicate that participating primary care practices had a preference for materials developed by their local BCT.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Most recently, a pilot project in Colorado demonstrated the feasibility of using the BCT for addressing low uptake of HPV vaccination in two Colorado communities; however, this project was not designed to evaluate its effectiveness in increasing HPV vaccination rates.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></p>
                <p>These BCTs have been in diverse communities in Colorado, usually with the State Networks of Colorado Ambulatory Practices and Partners (SNOCAP) consortium of PBRNs.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19 23</xref> BCT products have disseminated within primary care practices participating in projects as well as the broader community. BCT is effective because it accomplishes several key tasks that influence local uptake and implementation: (1) Formation of critical partnerships between academic researchers, local community leaders and primary care practice champions,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24 25</xref> (2) Increasing local relevance of an evidence-based intervention by using language and constructs that resonate locally, and (3) Disseminating the new messages through effective community channels.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p>
                <p>This project aims to implement a proven engagement methodology to translate the current guidelines and evidence for HPV vaccination into contextually relevant interventions that will accelerate the adoption of the HPV vaccine. This approach can easily be scaled throughout the state of Colorado with our network of primary care PBRNs,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23 26 27</xref> partnerships with public health departments and numerous community partners. Furthermore, this study will test a novel approach to the development of relevant interventions to promote HPV vaccine uptake that can subsequently be replicated across other PBRNs in the USA.</p>

                <p>The BCT process is summarised in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>. BCT begins with a daylong retreat where a member of the project team gives a presentation on adolescent vaccination, and BCT Community Advisory Group members have ample time to have all their questions about the topic answered. The BCT facilitator then works with the group to address two questions: (1) What does our message to the community about HPV vaccination need to say? and (2) How do we disseminate that message to our practices and community? In the subsequent 7–10 conference call meetings and three inperson meetings, the facilitation team guides the BCT Community Advisory Group members towards the generation of ‘products’ (pamphlets, posters, ads, articles, talks, clinician aids, etc) that resonate in the community, and corresponding implementation plans. These products convey the key messages about the evidence for HPV vaccination and can include new messages, new messaging strategies, or existing messages translated to a new setting or population within the target community. Throughout these meetings, further brainstorming will inevitably occur and be incorporated.</p>

                <p>Given the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and the corresponding restrictions on gatherings, the BCT process will be adapted to be conducted virtually, with all participants attending the retreat, conference calls and other meetings via online videoconferencing. In addition, facilitators will lead discussions about how messaging and dissemination strategies will accommodate the COVID-19 restrictions in the practices and community setting. Finally, facilitators will work with each BCT group to incorporate appropriate contingencies for changes in the local COVID-19 context to optimise their dissemination plans. For example, groups may discuss what to do in the event of a surge in cases and increased local restrictions; or conversely, what additional dissemination strategies might be employed if case rates fall and restrictions are lifted. These decisions will guide the implementation by the research team after the completion of the BCT process.</p>

                <title>Sample size and power calculations</title>
                <p>Intent-to-treat analyses will be conducted to test the primary study hypothesis that patients in intervention practices who have not previously received at least one dose of the HPV vaccine will be more likely to have done so by the end of the 6-month intervention period (12 months postbaseline, with the 6-month Boot Camp process as a washout period) than those in control practices. We estimate that each participating practice will have a minimum of 200 adolescents during the 6-month intervention period that have not previously received the HPV vaccine. We will use practice size and number of providers as a proxy for number of adolescent patients<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> and estimate a 30%–50% vaccination rate for those adolescents. Based on these estimates, practices with at least two providers will be eligible for participation.</p>
                <p>We based our power calculations on vaccine utilisation rates in control practices of 50%, since this is the most conservative proportion for calculating sample size (ie, requires the largest sample to detect differences between experimental arms). Our final sample size for analysis would be 2400 patients in 12 practices, 6 intervention and 6 matched control practices. At this sample size, we will have 80% power to detect an effect size of 9.8% for an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.01, and 90% power for an effect size of 11.3%. This corresponds, respectively, to vaccine utilisation rates in intervention practices of 59.8% and 61.3%. As this is a preliminary study with a 2-year timeline, we have chosen to compare intervention practices to matched controls rather than implement a randomised design, as randomisation would double the number of counties we would need to participate.</p>

Additionally, we will seek to assess attribution of changes in vaccine initiation rates. Evaluation will be tailored to the specific intervention, delivery modality and implementation strategy developed in the BCT. We anticipate that we will conduct five to seven parent and practice staff interviews per practice site and conduct a survey of a random sample of 30–40 parents of HPV-vaccine eligible patients per practice to assess each of the RE-AIM domains. Surveys will assess exposure to the intervention, impact of the intervention message and acceptability of the intervention. We will also document implementation and maintenance activities undertaken by the research team and practice staff throughout the practice implementation phase. These data will serve to help explain findings related to vaccine initiation (Aim 2) and inform the translation of this intervention approach to a larger trial.</p>

Vaccine-eligible participants will be defined as patients in the participating practices aged 9–26 years who have not previously received an HPV vaccine as recorded in the CIIS. Secondary analyses will investigate the difference in initiation rates between intervention and control practices in boys compared with girls as well as different age strata (9–10, 11–12 and 13–17 years).

The following types of data will be obtained from the CIIS: patient-level immunisation data, including the number, date and type of specific vaccines received; patient-level demographic data, including age, gender and race/ethnicity. Control practices will be chosen to match intervention practices on size (total full time equivalent (FTE)), per cent of patients using Vaccines for Children, setting (urban/suburban/rural) and baseline HPV initiation rates. Control practices must also be active CIIS users; we will obtain baseline rates of initiation for practices in several counties that are similar to our chosen study counties in terms of demographics and size, and then choose from the practices within those counties that have similar baseline rates to our intervention practices. The design requires only that we obtain CIIS data for the control practices, with minimal associated increases in effort. CIIS data are highly accurate, with frequent quality checks.</p>

Additional patient-level and practice-level covariates will be included in the model as described above. To examine the effects of the intervention on time to vaccination initiation, Cox models will be fit to the data, where the outcome is time from beginning of the study to vaccine initiation or the end of the study (censoring), whichever is first. A test of the HR associated with the treatment indicator variable will allow for determination of whether the intervention significantly affected time to initiation.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></p>

Additionally, each BCT group will include practice providers and staff as well as local community members, all of whom will be participating in the study. For all data obtained about providers, practice staff members, patients, parents of patients and community members, we will use confidentiality standards to protect them and their data.</p>

We will create a match list of names/contact information with study assigned ID codes to be maintained. This list will be kept in a password protected computerised file and not shared with others beyond the study investigators and research assistant.

Oversight for data safety and monitoring will be conducted by a faculty member at the University of Colorado, Denver, who is not involved in the project. In this capacity, the individual will provide independent observation and verification of protocol compliance, recruitment and study progress, and data completeness. The data safety monitor (DSM) will monitor the study for adverse events, and the study team’s response to these events, should any occur. Though adverse events are not anticipated, they will be reported to the institutional review board and the DSM at the time of the event should any occur.</p>

The EMR data will consist of data collected in the course of patient care and includes the patient’s demographic information. For these demographic data, collected in the course of standard care delivery, patients will not be approached for consent as their information will only be provided as contact information to invite patients to participate in the survey. Only the healthcare personnel in the clinic or in a business associate role (ie, chart abstractor) will know the identity of the patients. These data will be coded for confidentiality using a study ID code and be securely transferred using appropriate protocols for secure data transfer. We will apply for a waiver of consent and HIPAA waiver of authorisation for this portion of our data collection that are consistent with the nature of a limited data set.</p>

                <p>With this exploratory pre-experimental study, we seek to use BCT to develop interventions that promote the uptake of HPV vaccination and determine preliminary effect size estimates. The results of this study can then be disseminated to practices nationally and through the PBRNs in Colorado by recruiting more practices to serve as study sites to implement BCT-generated materials. The materials generated in this study will be combined with the previously designed community-based materials and made available to other primary care practice and communities. Furthermore, our advisory group will serve to inform the dissemination in Colorado with a specific focus on incorporating the BCT materials into other initiatives within Colorado to promote HPV vaccine uptake. We also plan to share the findings of this study in scientific presentations and publications, as well as through workshops at our annual PBRN convocation and monthly online newsletter.</p>

              <p>To address suboptimal HPV vaccination rates, this study applies an evidence-based community engagement strategy—BCT—in the private practice setting to engage patient stakeholders alongside private practice staff to develop messaging and interventions promoting the HPV vaccine. The BCT approach produces interventions that are dissemination-ready, incorporate both practice and community context, and improve the acceptability of evidence-based interventions to individual communities. This study will use a robust matched case-control evaluation to assess the implementation and effectiveness of the BCT approach to increase HPV vaccination rates among adolescents aged 9–17 years. While practices will not be randomised, clinics with similar demographics will be recruited to serve as matched controls. Ultimately, we anticipate this study will demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of using community-engaged strategies at the private clinic level to improve HPV vaccination rates and prevent HPV-related cancers.</p>
