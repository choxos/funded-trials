                <p id="Par1">SWOG S0777, a randomized phase III trial, compared bortezomib, lenalidomide and dexamethasone (VRd) with lenalidomide and dexamethasone (Rd). This updated analysis includes 460 patients evaluable for survival endpoints: 225 eligible and analyzable patients were randomized to Rd and 235 to VRd. The 6-month induction was six 28-day cycles of Rd and eight 21-day cycles of VRd followed by Rd maintenance for all patients. Median follow up is 84 months. Median PFS is 41 months for VRd and 29 months for Rd: stratified hazard ratio (96% Wald Confidence Interval) was 0.742 (0.594, 0.928) and one-sided stratified log-rank <italic>P</italic>-value 0.003. Median OS for VRd is still not reached with median OS for Rd being 69 months: stratified hazard ratio (96% Wald Confidence Interval) was 0.709 (0.543, 0.926) and stratified two-sided <italic>P</italic>-value was 0.0114. Both PFS and OS were improved with VRd versus Rd adjusting for age (<italic>P</italic>-values: 0.013 [PFS]; 0.033 [OS])). Median duration of Rd maintenance was 17.1 months. The addition of bortezomib to lenalidomide dexamethasone for induction therapy results in a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in PFS as well as better OS. VRd continues to represent an appropriate standard of care irrespective of age.</p>

              <p id="Par2">The combination of bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone was selected at the time of trial design in 2007 to achieve the maximum response in the frontline setting for myeloma therapy. Both bortezomib and lenalidomide were at the time approved for use in the relapsed setting, but still under evaluation in patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma.</p>
              <p id="Par3">Bortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor which decreases proliferation and reverses chemoresistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Lenalidomide is an immunomodulatory agent which exhibits multifaceted, anti-myeloma activity by enhancing immune function, disrupting aberrant stromal cell support as well as having direct anti-myeloma cell effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Both bortezomib and lenalidomide inhibit NF-κB and in combination demonstrate enhanced proapoptotic effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Additionally, dexamethasone further enhances anti-myeloma activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Indeed, prior to the current study, the VRd combination showed promising activity in both the relapsed and newly diagnosed settings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par4">The SWOG S0777 trial was the first phase 3 open-label trial in newly diagnosed patients to evaluate the combination of VRd versus Rd. The results were published in 2017 and demonstrated significantly improved PFS and OS with VRd<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. The present report outlines the longer-term outcomes with a data cut at May 15, 2018.</p>

Patients aged 18 years or older with newly diagnosed myeloma were eligible. Key inclusion criteria were: presence of CRAB criteria (C = calcium elevation; R = renal impairment; A = anemia; B = bone involvement) with measurable disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. No patients with asymptomatic disease were included in this trial. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0–3 was acceptable<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Allowable blood count values were: hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL; absolute neutrophil count ≥1 × 10³ cells per mm³; platelet count ≥80,000/mm³. Major exclusion criteria were: creatinine clearance ≤30 mL/min; cardiac status New York Heart Association class III/IV or recent myocardial infarction; active hepatitis B or C or HIV or uncontrolled other infection; previous cancer prior to study registration or enrollment; or poorly controlled diabetes. The study protocol was approved by the institutional review boards of all participating institutions. All patients provided written informed consent. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00644228.</p>

                <p id="Par6">Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive initial treatment of bortezomib with lenalidomide and dexamethasone (VRd) or lenalidomide and dexamethasone (Rd). We used a dynamic allocation algorithm developed by Pocock and Simon to balance treatment assignment by the stratification factors. The randomization was stratified based on International Staging System stage (I, II, or III) and intent to transplant (yes vs no)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Patients at participating NCTN institutions were randomly assigned upon registration. Randomization procedures were developed and maintained by the SWOG statistics and data management center. There was no masking to treatment interventions.</p>

                <p id="Par7">The VRd regimen was given as eight 21-day cycles. Bortezomib was given at 1·3 mg/m² intravenously on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 combined with 25 mg oral lenalidomide once a day on days 1–14 plus 20 mg oral dexamethasone on days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, and 12. The Rd regimen was given as six 28-day cycles and consisted of 25 mg oral lenalidomide once a day for days 1–21 plus 40 mg oral dexamethasone on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. The total amount of lenalidomide administered for induction was balanced for each group (VRd: 2800 mg lenalidomide total dose; Rd: 3150 mg total dose). Patients in the VRd group received herpes simplex virus prophylaxis. All patients received 325 mg oral aspirin once a day to reduce the risk of thromboembolic complications. Upon completion of induction, all patients received ongoing maintenance with 25 mg oral lenalidomide once a day for 21 days plus 40 mg oral dexamethasone once a day for days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each 28-day cycle. Stem-cell collection was allowed for those patients considering future transplant. With dosage adjustments as necessary using slide adjustment scale within the protocol, maintenance was continued until emergence of progressive disease, toxic effects, or patient withdrawal.</p>

                <title>Outcomes</title>
                <p id="Par8">The primary endpoint was progression-free survival from the time of randomization. Secondary endpoints were overall survival, the rate of overall response (partial response or better), safety, and to bank specimens for future translational medicine research. Data were collected and analyzed by the SWOG statistical center team in standard SWOG cooperative group procedural fashion. Treatment response and disease progression were assessed centrally and followed the international uniform response criteria for multiple myeloma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Disease assessments were done at the end of each cycle. After treatment discontinuation because of toxic effects, disease progression, or patient withdrawal, patients were followed up for disease status every 6 months, until death or for a maximum of 6 years after initial randomization. We did fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) analysis of bone marrow cells at trial entry. Preliminary analyses from available data from 316 patients suggested that 33% were deemed high risk by one or more of the high risk features including t(4;14), t(14;16), or chromosome 17 deletion abnormalities. Individual site FISH testing and reports will be further reviewed as part of data assessment in the present study to confirm details, including cell numbers and percentages as well as possible coexistence of high, intermediate, and good risk features. We used standard percentage cutoff values for each type of FISH test abnormality (typically 5%, but ranging from 1·5% to 7·5%). We collected data for adverse events every 3 months while on treatment and again at the end of induction and maintenance treatment. All adverse events were initially graded according to National Cancer Institute Common.</p>

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p id="Par10">The sample size was based on the assumption of an eligible patient accrual rate of 110 patients per year (440 eligible patients over 4 years), a median progression-free survival of about 3 years in the control group, exponential distribution of progression-free survival, and roughly 2.5 years of additional follow up. The study was designed to detect a hazard ratio of 1.5, with ~87% power and an overall study alpha of 0.05. Thus, to allow for an interim analysis, a one-sided 0.02 significance level was used to assess the primary progression-free survival endpoint. The primary endpoint was evaluated with the use of a group-sequential design, with two planned interim analyses at 1/3 and 2/3 of the total number of events. A Haybittle–Peto approach was used for alpha spending and a one-sided alpha of 0.0025 was used for each interim analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. At the final analysis, a one-sided stratified log-rank test was done at the 0.02 significance level for an overall one-sided alpha of 0.025<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. We compared progression-free survival and overall survival between treatment groups using a log-rank test stratified according to the factors used for randomization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Hazard ratios were estimated by means of a stratified Cox proportional-hazards model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. The multivariate analysis were done with a model that was not stratified by, rather adjusted for stratification factors, to provide some idea as to how the stratification factors were associated with outcome. We used the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test to assess assumptions of proportional hazards. There was no evidence of violation of proportional hazards for any of the covariates. Survival curves were based on the Kaplan–Meier method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. We compared the overall response rate between groups using a stratified Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel test<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. The odds ratio and corresponding 95% confidence interval were estimated with the use of the Mantel–Haenszel method.</p>
                <p id="Par11">Duration of response was summarized by means of the Kaplan–Meier method. All primary and secondary endpoint analyses were predefined within the protocol. Analyses were done on an intention to treat basis that incorporated all eligible patients. Patients with missing parameters of interest were excluded from multivariate analyses. We used SAS (version 4) for all analyses. Baseline variables were compared using Fisher’s exact test. The safety analysis included all eligible patients who received at least one dose of study treatment and who were evaluated for toxic effects.</p>

              <p id="Par14">As a basis for this longer-term follow-up analysis, all data elements were checked and updated with a data cut of May 15, 2018. A full listing of the trial profile with patient distribution throughout the trial is in Appendix 1. For these analyses, for VRd, 235 patients were deemed eligible and analyzable for efficacy with 234 evaluable for toxic effects and 215 assessable for response. For Rd, 225 patients were deemed eligible and analyzable for efficacy with 222 evaluable for toxic effects and 207 assessable for response. At the time of this analysis, 53 patients (12% of eligible patients) are still on maintenance therapy. The median overall follow up was 84 months. The median duration of maintenance was 17.1 months.</p>
              <p id="Par15">The median PFS was 41 months for VRd and 29 months for Rd: stratified hazard ratio (96% Wald confidence interval) was 0.742 (0.594, 0.928) and one-sided stratified log-rank <italic>P</italic>-value 0.003 (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>).

The median OS for VRd is still not reached with median OS for Rd being 69 months: stratified hazard ratio (95% Wald confidence interval) was 0.709 (0.543, 0.926) and stratified two-sided <italic>P</italic>-value was 0.0114 (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). The primary report<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> indicated a median OS of 75 months for VRd. With the update to patient follow-up and events, the estimate for the median is now not yet reached. With longer follow up and updating the median OS for VRd is &gt;84 months. The number of events in the VRd arm changed from 76/242 in the primary report to 102/235 in the current analyses. Because the length of OS for the 133 living patients who received VRd is so much longer at this second analysis, the true median is now not reached.

              <p id="Par17">The impact of treatment within subgroups of interest including intent to transplant, transplant, and age were assessed with age-adjusted multivariable regression techniques (Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>).

              <p id="Par21">The addition of bortezomib to lenalidomide dexamethasone for induction therapy in previously untreated myeloma results in a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in PFS as well as improved OS with follow-up of 7 years. VRd had an acceptable safety and tolerability profile and continues to represent an appropriate standard of care irrespective of age and transplant intent.</p>
              <p id="Par22">With longer-term follow up, the benefits of VRd over Rd are maintained as in the prior analyses. The PFS benefit is maintained at a median of 41 months for VRd versus 29 months for Rd (one-sided stratified log-rank <italic>P</italic> = 0.003: Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). The overall survival benefit is maintained at a median of not yet reached (&gt;84 months) versus 69 months for Rd (one-sided stratified log-rank <italic>P</italic> = 0.014: Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). These added benefits with VRd are linked to the deeper responses achieved. With VRd, 74.9% of patients achieved VGPR or better versus 53.2% with Rd (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The benefits of VRd are also evident in each of the three different age categories, showing a &gt;10-month median benefit across all age groups. Overall survival is also improved both above and below age 65 years. Of particular note, over 55% of patients receiving VRd remain alive at 7 years (median follow-up 84 months).</p>
              <p id="Par23">As part of the report of the primary data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, the outcomes benefits with proteasome inhibitor–immunomodulatory drug combinations were fully discussed with reference to prior data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. It is now remarkable to be able to emphasize that with over 7 years of follow up, the positive impact of the 6 months of VRd induction is retained. This is all the more remarkable in that with VRd induction 34.6% Gd 3 or greater neurologic toxic effects occurred with biweekly intravenous bortezomib. We have proposed that the use of VRd lite and making every effort to maximize the number of cycles of VRd incorporating SQ bortezomib can be reasonably anticipated to further improve outcomes for the maximum number of patients both &lt;65 years and ≥65 years. For the post-induction maintenance, the incorporation of dexamethasone also compromised the ability to continue with ongoing therapy.</p>
              <p id="Par24">As noted, the median duration of maintenance was 17.1 months. The duration is shorter than the 2 years, 2.5 years, and 3 years median values for the studies assessed in the meta-analysis of lenalidomide maintenance after autologous stem cell transplantation in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Thus, despite excellent outcomes in the S0777 trial, it is possible that longer maintenance could have provided added benefit.</p>
              <p id="Par25">As noted, the associated rates of second cancers were 8% with VRd and 7% with Rd. Of the 19 and 16 cancers, the numbers of hematologic cancers were 3 for both groups (see Appendix 2 for listing). These percentages and numbers are lower than reported with a median of 79.5 months (versus 84 months for S0777 trial) follow-up in the post-transplant lenalidomide maintenance setting in which the cumulative incidence of second cancers was 5.3% for hematologic plus 5.8% for solid cancers, giving a total of 11.1%. It is worth noting that the S0777 trial included no melphalan and the duration of maintenance was shorter.</p>
              <p id="Par26">While cross-trial comparisons have limitations, it is of interest to compare outcomes achieved with S0777 VRd and Rd regimens with results obtained in the IFM 2009 and MAIA trials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. In the IFM 2009 trial, patients treated with VRd induction were randomized to receive upfront or delayed ASCT, and the rate of VGPR or better was 77% (versus 74.9% in S0777 trial) while the median PFS duration was 36 months (versus 41 months in the S0777 trial). In the more recent MAIA trial presented as a late-breaking abstract at ASH<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, and subsequently published<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>, the combination of daratumumab plus Rd was compared with Rd alone in the frontline non-transplant setting. In this study, the VGPR or better rate was 79.3% (slightly higher than with VRd) and the median PFS is not reached but appears likely to be comparable to results with both S0777 and IFM 2009 trials. Two additional points to consider in assessing VRd versus Dara Rd (MAIA regimen) in the frontline setting are the continued use of daratumumab in the maintenance in the MAIA trial (versus no bortezomib in S0777 maintenance) and the uncertain role of Dara Rd in the high-risk setting. As proposed by Kapoor and Rajkumar, head to head comparison of VRd with Dara Rd is required to clarify relative merits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. In the MAIA trial, all patients were transplant-ineligible [whereas only some were transplant-ineligible in S0777] and in the IFM 2009 trial, all patients were transplant eligible. Despite these various differences, it is clear that the use of daratumumab can contribute to excellent outcomes in the frontline setting.</p>
              <p id="Par27">The SWOG S0777 trial had several limitations as identified and discussed in the primary report<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. It is worth re-emphasizing that the use of intravenous bortezomib twice weekly resulted in neuropathy which led to early discontinuation of the VRd induction therapy. Perhaps the most helpful comparison is between the results of the S0777 trial and the recently published Spanish phase 3 PETHEMA/GEM 2012 trial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. In the PETHEMA trial, the dose of intensity of bortezomib was reduced to twice per week subcutaneously for 2 weeks out of a 28-day cycle. This resulted in the delivery of all planned six induction cycles, and excellent response and outcomes data including for patients with high risk cytogenetics. A limitation of the S0777 trial was the lack of sufficient cytogenetic data to establish the efficacy for high risk patients.</p>
              <p id="Par28">In conclusion, the addition of bortezomib to lenalidomide dexamethasone for induction therapy in previously untreated myeloma results in a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in PFS as well as better OS with follow up of 7 years. VRd had an acceptable safety and tolerability profile and continues to represent an appropriate standard of care irrespective of age.</p>
