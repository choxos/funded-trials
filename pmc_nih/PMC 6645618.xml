                <p>The spectral properties of the ambient illumination provide useful information about time of day and weather. We study the perceptual representation of illumination by analyzing measurements of how well people discriminate between illuminations across scene configurations. More specifically, we compare human performance to a computational-observer analysis that evaluates the information available in the isomerizations of cone photopigment in a model human photoreceptor mosaic. The performance of such an observer is limited by the Poisson variability of the number of isomerizations in each cone. The overall level of Poisson-limited computational-observer sensitivity exceeded that of human observers. This was modeled by increasing the amount of noise in the number of isomerizations of each cone. The additional noise brought the overall level of performance of the computational observer into the same range as that of human observers, allowing us to compare the pattern of sensitivity across stimulus manipulations. Key patterns of human performance were not accounted for by the computational observer. In particular, neither the elevation of illumination-discrimination thresholds for illuminant changes in a blue color direction (when thresholds are expressed in CIELUV ΔE units), nor the effects of varying the ensemble of surfaces in the scenes being viewed, could be accounted for by variation in the information available in the cone isomerizations.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>The spectral properties of the ambient illumination provide useful information about time of day and weather. Indeed, variation in natural illumination spectra occurs during the course of the day (e.g., Hernandez-Andres, Romero, Nieves, &amp; Lee, <xref rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-HernandezAndres1" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Spitschan, Aguirre, Brainard, &amp; Sweeney, <xref rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-Spitschan1" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), within single natural scenes (Nascimento, Amano, &amp; Foster, <xref rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-Nascimento1" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), and when we move between natural and artificial illumination (Wyszecki &amp; Stiles, <xref rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-Wyszecki1" ref-type="bibr">1982</xref>). A number of psychophysical paradigms have been developed to study the perceptual representation of illumination (Kardos, <xref rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-Kardos1" ref-type="bibr">1928</xref>; Beck, <xref rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-Beck1" ref-type="bibr">1959</xref>; Oyama, <xref rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-Oyama1" ref-type="bibr">1968</xref>; Kozaki &amp; Noguchi, <xref rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-Kozaki1" ref-type="bibr">1976</xref>; Gilchrist &amp; Jacobsen, <xref rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-Gilchrist1" ref-type="bibr">1984</xref>; Noguchi &amp; Kozaki, <xref rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-Noguchi1" ref-type="bibr">1985</xref>; Hurlbert, <xref rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-Hurlbert1" ref-type="bibr">1989</xref>; Logvinenko &amp; Menshikova, <xref rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-Logvinenko1" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>; Rutherford &amp; Brainard, <xref rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-Rutherford1" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Logvinenko &amp; Maloney, <xref rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-Logvinenko2" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Lee &amp; Brainard, <xref rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Recently, a number of labs have reported psychophysical threshold measurements of how well people can discriminate between illuminations across scene configurations (Pearce, Crichton, Mackiewicz, Finlayson, &amp; Hurlbert, <xref rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-Pearce1" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Radonjić et al., <xref rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-Radonjic2" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Weiss &amp; Gegenfurtner, <xref rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-Weiss1" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Alvaro, Linhares, Moreira, Lillo, &amp; Nascimento, <xref rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-Alvaro1" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Radonjić et al., <xref rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-Radonjic1" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Aston, Radonjić, Brainard, &amp; Hurlbert, <xref rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-Aston1" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; see also Lucassen, Gevers, Gijsenij, &amp; Dekker, <xref rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-Lucassen1" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p>
              <p>A key step in interpreting psychophysical threshold measurements is to understand the degree to which patterns in the data are driven by variation in the information available from the stimuli. This has often been accomplished by comparing human performance to that of an <italic>ideal observer</italic> that makes optimal use of the task-relevant information available in the stimulus or at some early stage of the visual processing (Barlow, <xref rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-Barlow1" ref-type="bibr">1962</xref>; Green &amp; Swets, <xref rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-Green1" ref-type="bibr">1966</xref>; Banks, Geisler, &amp; Bennett, <xref rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-Banks1" ref-type="bibr">1987</xref>; Geisler, <xref rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-Geisler1" ref-type="bibr">1989</xref>; Sekiguchi, Williams, &amp; Brainard, <xref rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-Sekiguchi1" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>; Geisler, <xref rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-Geisler2" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Cottaris, Jiang, Ding, Wandell, &amp; Brainard, <xref rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-Cottaris1" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Such ideal observer analyses clarify which aspects of performance may be accounted for by the properties of the stimuli and well-understood mechanisms of early vision.</p>
              <p>In this paper, we review previously reported measurements of human psychophysical performance on an illumination-discrimination task (Radonjić et al., <xref rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-Radonjic2" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Radonjić et al., <xref rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-Radonjic1" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). We then compare human performance to that of a computational observer that uses the information available in the cone photopigment isomerizations to perform the same task. We ask whether the stimulus dependent changes in human performance across different illumination changes and scene configurations are consequences of differences in the information available to perform the task. The analysis clarifies which aspects of performance require additional explanation in terms of the action of visual mechanisms beyond the isomerization of photopigment by light.</p>
              <p>Our approach shares much with the ideal observer analysis, but rather than using an analytic calculation to estimate ideal performance levels, we employ computer simulations and machine learning. For this reason, we refer to our approach as a <italic>computational-observer analysis</italic> (Farrell, Jiang, Winawer, Brainard, &amp; Wandell, <xref rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-Farrell1" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Jiang et al., <xref rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-Jiang1" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Cottaris et al., <xref rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-Cottaris1" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; cf. Lopez, Murray, &amp; Goodenough, <xref rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-Lopez1" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>). Unlike the ideal observer, where the decision rule is implemented on the assumption that the observer has perfect information about the statistical properties of the stimuli, the computational observer must learn these properties from a large number of training samples.</p>

              <title>Illumination-discrimination psychophysics: Modeled Experiment 1</title>
              <p>We analyze two similar illumination-discrimination experiments; we begin by providing an overview of the first. Detailed methods and results for this experiment (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Modeled Experiment 1</xref>) are reported elsewhere (Radonjić et al., <xref rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-Radonjic1" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>, experiment 2 in that paper, fixed-surfaces condition), so our overview is brief. The second experiment (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Modeled Experiment 2</xref>) is similar in design and is also reported in detail elsewhere (Radonjić et al., <xref rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-Radonjic2" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).</p>
              <p>Both modeled experiments measured humans' ability to discriminate changes in illumination across four illumination-change directions—blue and yellow (which were aligned with the daylight locus) and red and green (which were orthogonal to the daylight locus). On each trial of the experiments, observers viewed three successive computer-generated images, displayed on a calibrated color monitor. The scene geometry was held fixed across the experiment, and all the surfaces in the scene remained unchanged: Only the spectral power distribution of the illumination varied. The first image on a trial was presented in the <italic>reference interval</italic> (2,370 ms). For this image, the scene was illuminated by the <italic>target illumination</italic>, a metamer<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="n1">1</xref></sup> for natural daylight with a color temperature of approximately 6700 K. The reference interval was followed by two <italic>comparison intervals</italic>. The comparison intervals (870 ms) were separated from each other and from the reference interval by interstimulus intervals (750 ms). During each comparison interval, an image of the scene was again shown. In one comparison interval, the scene was illuminated by the target illumination and in the other by a <italic>test illumination</italic>. The order of the two comparisons was randomized on each trial. The observer's task was to choose which of the two comparison intervals had scene illumination most similar to the target illumination. On each trial, the test illumination was chosen from a pool of 200 prespecified illuminations. These varied in steps of approximately 1 CIELUV ΔE unit (CIE, <xref rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-CIE1" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>) in each of four illumination-change directions: blue, yellow, green, and red (50 steps per direction).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="n2">2</xref></sup>

              <p>During each session, trials probing the four illumination-change directions were interleaved. The illumination-change steps were determined through twelve interleaved 1-up-2-down staircases (three independent staircases for each illumination-change direction). The illumination step size for a staircase was decreased when the observer responded correctly twice in a row on trials governed by that staircase, and increased each time the observer responded incorrectly. Each staircase terminated after the eighth reversal.</p>
              <p>Observers' thresholds to discriminate illumination changes were measured for each of the four directions, relative to the target illumination. Thresholds corresponded to 70.71% accuracy and were determined using a maximum likelihood fit to the combined data for all three staircases in each illumination-change direction. The 70.71% correct criterion was used because this is the performance convergence point for the staircases (Wetherill &amp; Levitt, <xref rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-Wetherill1" ref-type="bibr">1965</xref>). Observers completed two experimental sessions, and thresholds obtained in each session were averaged for each observer. Each observer's right eye was tracked using an Eyelink 1000 (SR Research, Ltd.), which allowed us to record eye fixation positions on each trial.</p>
              <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-f02">Figure 2</xref> illustrates the average thresholds across ten observers. The average threshold for the blue direction is elevated relative to those obtained for the other illumination-change directions, when thresholds are plotted using the CIELUV ΔE metric. The elevation for thresholds in the blue direction has been found in other studies with a similar design, for scenes where the average reflectance of the surfaces in the scene is close to that of a neutral nonselective gray (Pearce et al., <xref rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-Pearce1" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Radonjić et al., <xref rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-Radonjic2" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Two essentially identical experiments reported with this one (Radonjić et al., <xref rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-Radonjic1" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>, experiments 1 and A1 in that paper, fixed-surfaces condition) yielded similar results. We are particularly interested here in whether the elevation of threshold in the blue direction has its roots in a relative paucity of information about this illumination change in the representation of the visual scene provided by the cone photoreceptor mosaic, which could arise because of the relatively small number of S cones in the mosaic.</p>

ISETBio provides functions that model early vision and allow computation of the visual system's responses to calibrated stimuli at various stages of processing.

                <title>Cone photopigment isomerizations</title>
                <p>We estimated the mean number of photopigment isomerizations in the cones for a 1.1° × 1.1° patch of foveal retina. We chose small patches of retina because restricting the analysis to small patches makes calculation of computational-observer performance tractable given the current implementation and computing power. The full analysis is thus achieved by breaking the image down into a set of patches and aggregating performance over these patches. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-f04">Figure 4A</xref> below illustrates the layout of the patches relative to the stimuli for Modeled Experiment 1.</p>
                <p>The model cone mosaic was a hexagonal mosaic in which cone density, cone aperture, and outer segment length all varied with eccentricity according to measurements by Curcio et al. (<xref rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-Curcio1" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>). The construction of such mosaics is described in detail in Cottaris et al. (<xref rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-Cottaris1" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). The peak cone density was 204,213 cones/mm<sup>2</sup>, with a corresponding minimum cone spacing of 2.36 microns, which is within the range of foveal densities reported by Curcio et al. (<xref rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-Curcio1" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>). There were 9629 cones in all, 6167 (64%) L cones, 3,085 (32%) M cones, and 377 (4%) S cones, corresponding to current views on the relative numbers of cones of each class in the typical human retina (Hofer, Carroll, Neitz, Neitz, &amp; Williams, <xref rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-Hofer1" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). There were no S cones in the central 0.15°, with a semiregular arrangement of S cones outside this region. The non-S cones were assigned as L or M randomly with 2:1 as the expected L:M ratio. Photopigment absorbance for the L, M, and S cones was taken from the CIE <xref rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-CIE2" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref> standard (CIE, <xref rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-CIE2" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>), and absorption by the foveal macular pigment (Stockman, Sharpe, &amp; Fach, <xref rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-Stockman2" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>) was incorporated. These choices, together with that used for lens density above, yield the CIE (<xref rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-CIE2" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>) 2° cone fundamentals. We assumed a quantal efficiency for cone photopigment of 0.67 (Rodieck, <xref rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-Rodieck1" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>) and a foveal cone inner segment acceptance area of 1.96 um<sup>2</sup>, an area that sits between those provided by Kolb (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://webvision.med.utah.edu">http://webvision.med.utah.edu</ext-link>) and Rodieck (<xref rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-Rodieck1" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>). We assumed a mean rate of spontaneous isomerizations of 100/cone-sec, consistent with estimates obtained psychophysically but lower than those obtained physiologically (see Koenig &amp; Hofer, <xref rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-Koenig1" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). We used a cone integration time of 50 ms and computed the mean number of isomerizations of each cone in response to each image. From the mean number of isomerizations, we can simulate the number of isomerizations on an individual trial, because trial-by-trial isomerizations are Poisson distributed (Hecht, Schlaer, &amp; Pirenne, <xref rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-Hecht1" ref-type="bibr">1942</xref>; Rodieck, <xref rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-Rodieck1" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>). The mean numbers of L, M, and S cone isomerizations under the standard illuminant for this experiment, taken across the image patches, were 439.8, 315.0, and 50.8 respectively for Modeled Experiment 1. For Modeled Experiment 2, the values were 325.6, 246.3, and 33.4. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="jovi-19-06-12_s02">Supplementary Table S1</xref> provides the mean number of isomerizations for all of the illuminations for both modeled experiments.</p>

                <title>Obtaining computational-observer thresholds</title>
                <p>Given the responses of a simulated cone mosaic to the experimental stimuli, we made computational-observer predictions of discrimination performance for each illumination-change direction and step size. To do so, we created a training set consisting of simulated trials and used this to learn a linear classifier that separated trials according to which comparison interval corresponded to the target. Each instance in the training set had independently drawn noise added to the mean number of isomerizations for each cone. We predicted performance by evaluating the classifier on a separate test set (cross-validation). The test set consisted of additional simulated trials, each with independently drawn noise.</p>
                <p>We studied performance for individual 1.1° × 1.1° patches of foveal mosaic with a single fixation location at the center of each patch, which was held constant across the two comparison intervals. This analysis quantifies the information available from single patches of the stimulus. We then investigated how the information varies across stimulus patches as well as aggregated across patches. Our approach ignores the additional information provided in the reference interval. The motivation for including that interval in the experiment was to reduce observer's uncertainty about which of the two comparison-interval images corresponds to the target. Our computational observer was designed so that such uncertainty is not an issue.</p>
                <p>For each illumination-change direction and step size, we calculated the mean number of isomerizations in the cones of the mosaic to the target-illumination image patch and the test-illumination image patch. To each mean response, we added Poisson noise to simulate trial-to-trial variability in the number of isomerizations in a single integration time. Then, we concatenated the resulting two response vectors into a single vector, with the target coming either first or second. We refer to simulated trials where the target vector comes first and the comparison vector second as AB trials, and simulated trials where the comparison vector comes first and the target second as BA trials. The task of the computational observer was to classify AB versus BA response vectors.</p>
                <p>The training and test sets each consisted of 1,000 labeled concatenated response vectors of this sort (500 AB and 500 BA). We used the training set to learn a linear classifier, i.e., to find the hyperplane which best separated the two classes (AB versus BA) of concatenated response vectors. We did this using the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm (Manning, Raghavean, &amp; Schutze, <xref rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-Manning1" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>), as implemented in MATLAB (function fitcsvm). This algorithm finds the hyperplane that maximizes the margin between the exemplars of the two classes, where margin refers to the amount of space without any data points around the classification boundary. Support vector machines provide an effective tradeoff between good classification performance on the training set and good generalization.</p>
                <p>The dimensionality of the concatenated response vectors is 19,258 (for two concatenated 1.1° × 1.1° patches of foveal retina). We reduced this dimensionality using principal components analysis (PCA). We first standardized each dimension (i.e., response of one cone in one interval) of the training set using its sample mean and standard deviation. Then, we ran principal components analysis on the training set and projected the standardized response vectors onto the first 400 principal components for training and testing.</p>
                <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-f03">Figure 3A</xref> shows the projection of 100 AB and 100 BA vectors from one stimulus patch, using nominal step size ΔE = 1 in the blue illumination-change direction, onto the first two principal components obtained for this direction and step size. The dashed line shows the decision boundary of a linear SVM trained on these vectors. Using this decision boundary led to performance of 100% on the training set as well as on the test set, indicating that a computational observer could perform perfectly on the task even for this smallest illumination-change step size. Since human thresholds considerably exceed ΔE = 1, there are additional sources of noise beyond the Poisson variation in the number of isomerizations and/or inefficiencies in the way that the visual system uses the information provided by the cone photopigment isomerizations. Indeed, ideal observer studies of human discrimination performance for simple stimuli often find that ideal observers outperform human observers (Geisler, <xref rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-Geisler1" ref-type="bibr">1989</xref>). Because our goal is to understand whether the pattern of psychophysical performance we measured is driven by differences in information at the photoreceptor mosaic, we modeled the inefficiency of the postisomerization visual system by adding independent zero-mean Gaussian noise to each cone's response, in addition to the Poisson noise. Doing so degrades the performance of the computational observer, but in a manner that does not seem likely to introduce systematic changes in relative computational-observer performance across illumination-change directions. We set the variance of the added noise for each cone's response (both for the target and comparison responses) to a multiple of the mean response of the cones in the mosaic; we refer to the multiple chosen as the <italic>noise factor</italic>. The noise factor was varied systematically, providing us with a parameter that allowed us to match performance levels between computational and human observers. Expressing the magnitude of the added noise as a noise factor in the way we do relates the variance of the added noise to the mean variance of the Poisson noise intrinsic to photopigment isomerizations, and thus allows us to understand how much noise had to be added relative to that intrinsic Poisson noise.</p>

                <p>To model the psychophysical data, we trained and tested SVMs for each combination of illumination direction, step size, and a series of noise factors. This provides us with a modeled percent correct for each combination. Noise factors were varied from 0 to 30 in steps of 5.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="n4">4</xref></sup></p>
                <p>As noted above, it was not computationally feasible for us to train the SVM's using a cone mosaic that captures the entire stimulus. For this reason, we partitioned the scene into 1.1° × 1.1° square patches by imposing a uniform grid onto the stimulus, and then trained SVM's for each patch across all combinations of illumination direction, step size, and noise factor. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-f04">Figure 4A</xref> illustrates the grid. On the right and bottom edges of the image, there are small regions of the stimulus not covered by the grid. These are neglected in the calculations. To obtain thresholds for each illumination-change direction and choice of noise factor for each 1.1° × 1.1° patch, we analyze computational-observer performance as a function of step size by fitting a Weibull psychometric function. This relates computational-observer performance to illuminant-change step size. In performing the fit, the actual ΔE values for each illumination change, rather than the nominal values, were used (see Radonjić et al., <xref rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-Radonjic1" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>).

                <p>Because predicted performance depends on which patch is examined, to make overall predictions it is necessary to aggregate across the individual patches. There are a number of ways to implement such aggregation. Here, for each illumination direction, step size, and noise level, we averaged the percent correct performance obtained for each of the 270 patches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-f04">Figure 4A</xref>) to obtain a single aggregate psychometric function. We then analyzed this function using the same methods as for the individual patch data, to obtain an aggregate threshold as a function of noise factor. The results of this analysis are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-f05">Figure 5C</xref>. The aggregate performance more closely resembles the performance in 5A than in 5B, but differs in relative threshold order (blue &gt; yellow &gt; green &gt; red). The aggregate thresholds represent an estimate of computational-observer performance when the information in all patches is weighted equally.</p>

                <title>Relation to psychophysics</title>
                <p>For each human observer, we found a single noise factor that minimized the sum of the squared error (across the four illumination-change directions) between the aggregate computational-observer thresholds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-f05">Figure 5C</xref>) and human thresholds. Linear interpolation was used to estimate computational-observer thresholds for noise factors between those for which performance was explicitly computed. The resulting computational-observer thresholds across observers were averaged to provide a fit to the average human data. This average fit is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-f06">Figure 6A</xref>. The computational-observer thresholds share with the human thresholds the elevation in the blue illumination-change direction relative to the red and green directions, indicating that the information available to the visual system at the retinal photoreceptor stage is already biased across illumination directions. However, the difference in the computational-observer thresholds between the blue and yellow illumination-change directions is small and does not provide a clear explanation for the elevation of thresholds in the blue direction that is generally found in the human psychophysics, when thresholds are expressed using the CIELUV ΔE metric.</p>

There are many factors that likely contribute to the decrease, including neural noise introduced after the cone photopigment isomerizations, differences in spatial and temporal integration of information between the computational and human observers, loss of information during the interstimulus intervals, and differences in the decision processes used by the computational and human observers.

                <p>The approach to aggregating the performance across patches described above weights the information from each stimulus patch equally.

                <p>One approach to incorporating the fixation data into the computational-observer calculations is to weight each stimulus patch in the averaging step according to the fraction of fixations that landed within that patch during the two comparison intervals. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-f07">Figure 7D</xref> illustrates the fixation-based weights for one observer as a heat map, with the weights for each patch obtained from the combined data shown in 7B and C. We incorporated fixation-based weights for each observer using that observer's eye fixation data and the computed thresholds for each illumination-change direction/step size/noise factor. We then found the noise factor for each observer that brought the computational-observer data into best register with that observer's data, and then averaged the thresholds across observers. The results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-f06">Figure 6B</xref>. The effect of incorporating eye fixations is not large.

The difference between the computational observer blue and yellow direction thresholds also increased slightly, but remained considerably less than the difference in human thresholds for these directions. Once the noise factor was chosen to fit the psychophysical data, the RMSE of the fit was similar to but slightly worse (6B) than that obtained with the nonfixation-weighted analysis described above (6A).</p>

                <title>Information provided by the different cone classes</title>
                <p>The computational-observer thresholds are elevated in the blue and yellow directions relative to the red and green directions. This suggests that there is an asymmetry across illumination-change directions in the information available at the photoreceptor mosaic, when step size is expressed in ΔE units. We were curious about how the different cone classes contribute to this asymmetry. We recomputed computational-observer thresholds for six additional cone mosaics. These were mosaics with L cones only, M cones only, S cones only, L and S cones, L and M cones, and M and S cones. In constructing the dichromatic cone mosaics, missing L cones were replaced with M cones and vice-versa, whereas missing S cones were replaced with a mixture of L and M cones in a 2:1 (L:M) ratio.</p>
                <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-f08">Figure 8</xref> shows computational-observer thresholds for the six additional mosaics (black circles in each plot) along with the corresponding computational-observer data for the original trichromatic mosaic (colored circles in each plot, replotted from black squares shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-f06">Figure 6A</xref>). Computational-observer thresholds for the L, LS, and LM mosaics are similar to one another as well to those obtained with the original mosaic. This suggests that the elevation of computational-observer thresholds in the blue and yellow directions found with the original mosaic can be primarily attributed to the pattern of performance mediated by the L cones: mosaics containing L cones show the elevation, while those with only M and/or S cones do not. Possibly, the fact that L cones are the predominate type in the mosaic leads to the overall mosaic showing a pattern of performance that is most similar to the performance of the L-cone-only mosaic. This in turn might mean that some of the individual variability observed in illumination-discrimination performance (see Radonjić et al., <xref rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-Radonjic2" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Radonjić et al., <xref rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-Radonjic1" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>) could be related to individual variability in L:M cone ratio (Hofer et al., <xref rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-Hofer1" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; for a review see Brainard, <xref rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-Brainard1" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). We note, however, that there are other possibilities. For example, there is a systematic difference in the isomerization rate between L and S cones because of light absorption by the lens and macular pigment. This difference might interact with our choice of SVM linear classifier or our choice to model postisomerization processing with equal-variance Gaussian noise.</p>

They found that thresholds were slightly elevated overall for dichromats relative to trichromats, with no statistically significant interaction between observer type and illuminant-change direction.

They obtained illumination-discrimination thresholds for three separate scene surface ensembles, which they labeled neutral, yellowish-green, and reddish-blue (based on the appearance of the corresponding images). The basic methodology of their experiment was the same as for Experiment 1 above, except for the variation of surface ensemble and a slightly different geometric structure of the stimulus scene. Note that in the experiment, the ensemble of surfaces was held constant within each trial so that the question investigated was how the surface ensemble affected illuminant discrimination, not how well observers could tell the difference between changes in illumination and changes in surface ensemble (see Craven &amp; Foster, <xref rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-Craven1" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref> for a study of the latter sort).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>We implemented a computational observer that performs the illumination-discrimination task. The computational observer analysis incorporates well-established properties of early human vision, particularly wavelength-dependent optical blur and sampling by the interleaved LMS cone mosaic, and studies the implications of these properties for human performance. Here, the computational observer has access to the representation at the cone mosaic, with predictions of performance based on a learned linear SVM classifier. By setting up a detailed model of visual processes up to and including isomerization of cone photopigment, we ask about the degree to which understanding these processes is sufficient to predict human performance. Across the stimulus conditions we studied, thresholds determined from the computational observer's performance do not predict either the absolute or the relative performance of human observers across illumination-change directions and across variation in the ensemble of surfaces in the scene. Absolute deviations are not unexpected, as earlier studies of ideal observer models at the level of the isomerizations generally reveal an overall difference in efficiency between human and ideal observers (Geisler, <xref rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-Geisler1" ref-type="bibr">1989</xref>). It is the relative deviations that are of most interest. These deviations are particularly clear for the case where the ensemble of surfaces in the scene was varied (comparison of computational observer to data reported by Radonjić et al., <xref rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-Radonjic2" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Whereas human performance showed a large effect of the surface ensemble, the computational observer's performance stayed relatively consistent across the ensembles. In addition, the computational observer did not account for the elevated thresholds (expressed as CIELUV ΔE) typically seen for illuminant changes in a blue direction. Thus our results implicate postisomerization processing as an important determinant of not only the absolute level of sensitivity to illumination changes, but also the observed patterns of illumination-discrimination thresholds.</p>
              <p>An attractive feature of the computational observer analysis is that we can use it to understand how variation in properties of early vision affects performance in well-specified visual tasks. An example of this is our exploration of the effects of changing the retinal complement of spectral cone types on illumination discrimination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-f08">Figure 8</xref>). As another example, we explored the effect of optical blur on illumination discrimination. Here we found little change in computational observer thresholds when we eliminated optical blur from the computational pipeline (results not shown). This is not surprising, given the relatively large spatial scale of the stimulus patches relative to the point spread function of the human eye.</p>
              <sec id="s4a">
                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p>Our computational observer incorporates a number of simplifications. One of these is to implement the observer on 1.1 × 1.1 patches evenly spaced across the stimulus, instead of simulating a larger mosaic with varying cone density that samples the entire stimulus. This choice was made for computational efficiency, particularly with respect to learning the classifier. One long-term goal of our project is to improve the computational efficiency of our methods so that we can simulate larger cone mosaics.</p>
                <p>We recognize that a complementary approach is to build simplified calculations that contain only the information necessary for a specific stimulus and task. For example, it seems likely that illumination-discrimination performance for our stimuli may be predicted from the low spatial frequency information in the retinal image. In that case a simplified model, more efficient than the full model, might be appropriate. A special case might replace the fine spatial sampling of a realistic cone mosaic with a blurred and subsampled representation that enables efficient computation.</p>
                <p>Although implementing special case calculations is possible, our overall goal is to develop and make available a quantitative image-computable model of early visual processing that may be used to analyze performance on many visual tasks for a wide range of visual stimuli. For that reason, at this juncture, we think it is important for us to focus on extending the model to incorporate visual processing that occurs after the isomerization of photopigment by light (see subsection Postisomerization Processes below). We do acknowledge that special-case calculations derived from the more general full model also represent an interesting future direction.</p>
                <p>For Modeled Experiment 1, we compared computational-observer thresholds when we weighted all stimulus patches equally and when we weighted them according to observers' measured eye fixations. The two analyses yielded similar patterns of thresholds. We were not able to make this comparison for Experiment 2 nor for hypothetical observers with di- and monochromatic cone mosaics, because we do not have fixation data available for those cases. There are cases where which patch the computational observer is trained and evaluated on has a large effect on performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-f05">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-f05">B</xref>). This suggests that the information about where observers look when they perform psychophysical tasks is useful for computational observer modeling.</p>
                <p>Other simplifications of our approach were that we assumed that observers used the information from only a single patch across the duration of each trial, and that we restricted our modeling to two comparison intervals, while excluding the reference interval. Building computational-observer performance models that take into account the trial-by-trial sequence of eye fixation locations across the entire trial is an interesting extension for future research. As with increasing the size of the modeled cone mosaic, this extension would also require an increase in computational resources.</p>

                <title>Postisomerization processes</title>
                <p>Although it is of fundamental interest to understand how the information available in the responses of the cone mosaic varies across experimental conditions within a psychophysical study, it should not be surprising that there are cases where the rest of the visual system plays a role in shaping performance. Indeed, two well-known processes that occur after photopigment isomerization are likely to influence performance on the illumination-discrimination task. First, regulation of sensitivity (aka adaptation) that begins with the conversion of isomerization rate to photocurrent within the cones has the potential to affect postisomerization information (Hood &amp; Finkelstein, <xref rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-Hood1" ref-type="bibr">1986</xref>; Stockman &amp; Brainard, <xref rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-Stockman1" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Angueyra &amp; Rieke, <xref rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-Angueyra1" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). As light level increases, this adaptation limits sensitivity in a manner that dominates the effects of Poisson-distributed noise in the photopigment isomerizations, producing Weber's Law rather than square root law behavior in the dependence of threshold on light level. The luminance at which cone sensitivity regulation is manifest in psychophysical data depends on the spatial and temporal properties of the stimulus (Hood &amp; Finkelstein, <xref rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-Hood1" ref-type="bibr">1986</xref>), but it may well account for some of the differences between the performance of the computational observer presented here and that of human observers.</p>
                <p>Second, signals from the three classes of cones are recombined by postisomerization processing into luminance and cone-opponent channels (Shevell &amp; Martin, <xref rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-Shevell1" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). To the extent that noise following this recombination limits discrimination, these processes can have a major effect on the relative sensitivity of the visual system to stimulus changes in different directions in color space (for a review, see Stockman &amp; Brainard, <xref rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-Stockman1" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Indeed, it has been shown that cone-opponent processing plays an important role in shaping sensitivity to modulations in different color directions in psychophysical tasks that involve simple colored stimuli, such as spots or Gabor patches seen against a spatially uniform background (Wandell, <xref rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-Wandell1" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>; Stockman &amp; Brainard, <xref rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-Stockman1" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>).</p>
                <p>Our current implementation of the computational observer uses additive zero-mean Gaussian noise as a proxy for all of postisomerization vision. This noise does not model stimulus-specific effects, nor should it be expected to capture all aspects of visual mechanisms beyond the site of photopigment isomerization. Rather, it was included because real observer thresholds are considerably higher than those of the computational observer, even when we consider only 1.1° × 1.1° patches of retina. We are eager to extend our computational-observer models to incorporate both the conversion of isomerization rate to photocurrent and the recombination of signals from different classes of cones by retinal ganglion cells, along the lines of the sequential ideal observer analysis outlined by Geisler (<xref rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-Geisler1" ref-type="bibr">1989</xref>). A computational observer that models multiple stages of neural information processing in the retina will likely provide a better account of the experimental data with less need for an omnibus parameter to reduce overall efficiency.</p>

                <p>Metamers for natural daylights were used to match spectra that could be produced by an apparatus designed to study illumination discrimination for real illuminated surfaces. Radonjić et al. (<xref rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-Radonjic2" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) present a comparison of illumination-discrimination performance for scenes consisting of real illuminated surfaces and graphics-based renderings. Finlayson, Mackiewicz, Hurlbert, Pearce, and Crichton (<xref rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-Finlayson1" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; see also Pearce et al., <xref rid="i1534-7362-19-7-11-Pearce1" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) describe in some detail the daylight metamers themselves.</p>

                <p>The value of 1 ΔE is a nominal step size. The actual step sizes varied across illuminant directions and modeled experiments. The actual step sizes were used in all analyses.

                <p>Because rendering is a stochastic process, it is possible to train a classifier to distinguish between two separate renderings of the same scene, even though the differences are imperceptible to a human observer. In Modeled Experiment 1, we used 30 separate renderings of the target image and drew randomly from these on each psychophysical trial to generate each training/test set instance. Our modeling followed this same procedure. In Modeled Experiment 2 described below, only one target image was used in the psychophysics. In the modeling, we generated seven versions of that same target image and drew randomly from these to generate each training/test set instance. The two draws for each trial (one for target interval and the other for one of the comparison intervals) were made without replacement.</p>
