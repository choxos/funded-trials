                <p id="Par1">Epigenetic therapies may modulate the tumor microenvironment. We evaluated the safety and optimal sequence of combination DNA methyltransferase inhibitor guadecitabine with a granulocyte macrophage-colony-stimulating-factor (GM-CSF) secreting colon cancer (CRC) vaccine (GVAX) using a primary endpoint of change in CD45RO + T cells. 18 patients with advanced CRC enrolled, 11 underwent paired biopsies and were evaluable for the primary endpoint. No significant increase in CD45RO + cells was noted. Grade 3–4 toxicities were expected and manageable. Guadecitabine + GVAX was tolerable but demonstrated no significant immunologic activity in CRC. We report a novel trial design to efficiently evaluate investigational therapies with a primary pharmacodynamic endpoint.</p>

              <p id="Par3">Despite improvements over the past several decades in the management of colorectal cancer (CRC), unresectable advanced disease remains largely incurable with responses to currently available systemic treatments of limited duration. Immunotherapy has the potential to induce deep and durable responses even in advanced treatment-refractory cancers; however, thus far the activity of immunotherapy in CRC has been limited to those that have mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR), which represents less than 5% of advanced CRC cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Response to immunotherapy remains elusive in the 95% of patients with proficient MMR/microsatellite stable CRC, despite accumulating evidence that an anti-tumor immune response plays a significant role in prognosis regardless of MSI/MMR status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Novel immunotherapy combinations may be needed to further modulate the immune microenvironment to achieve an effective anti-tumor immune response in these prototypically “cold” tumors.</p>
              <p id="Par4">Epigenetic therapy has recently emerged for its potential role in such combinations. Epigenetic alterations govern the differential expression of genetic information and have a prominent role in cancer initiation and progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Agents targeting the epigenome include DNA methyltransferase 1 inhibitors (DNMTi) and histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi). While anti-tumor activity of these agents has been observed in hematologic malignancies, in solid tumors including CRC, trials of epigenetic therapy have failed to demonstrate an effect of these agents alone and treatment is often limited by toxicities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, multiple preclinical studies have demonstrated modulation of the tumor immune microenvironment by these epigenetic therapies through a number of mechanisms, including increased expression of HLA Class I antigens, cancer/testis antigens and genes related to antigen presentation, upregulation of interferon-gamma receptor and signaling proteins, and upregulation of immune checkpoint expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. These data suggest a potential role for epigenetic therapy in sensitizing the tumor to immunotherapy.</p>
              <p id="Par5">Guadecitabine is a second-generation DNMTi with enhanced resistance to cytidine deaminase inactivation when compared to first-generation agents in this class, resulting in a longer half-life and greater systemic exposures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Guadecitabine has been shown in preclinical models to have a potent immunomodulatory effect through the increased expression of cancer/testis antigens and HLA class I antigens, strongly supporting a potential role in combinatorial approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par6">We hypothesized that the addition of guadecitabine to a GM-CSF secreting colon vaccine (GVAX) would enhance the anti-tumor immune response and thus trafficking of effector T cells into the tumor. The GVAX colon cancer vaccine consists of two allogeneic colon cancer cell lines combined with a bystander cell line modified to secrete GM-CSF as a vaccine adjuvant. A whole cell vaccine has the advantage of delivering a range of peptide antigens which may be shared between the vaccine cell lines and the patient’s tumor. GVAX (given with immunomodulatory doses of cyclophosphamide (Cy) to deplete regulatory T cells in the tumor microenvironment) has been shown to be safe and induced immune responses albeit in the absence of clinical responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In a mouse model, the combination of Cy/GVAX with the DNMTi decitabine showed promise; however, sequence of administration appeared to be important. Co-administration of decitabine with Cy/GVAX inhibited tumor growth and was associated with enhanced interferon gamma production both in splenocytes and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), while decitabine administration after Cy/GVAX resulted in increased tumor growth, likely through inhibition of the immune response[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par7">We further hypothesized that an increase in TILs, specifically CD45RO+ cells, on sequential tumor biopsies could be used as a surrogate for clinical outcomes and would therefore enable the more efficient evaluation of the regimen. CD45RO+ memory T cell density was demonstrated across several studies to have prognostic significance both in early and advanced cancers including colorectal cancer and were felt to broadly represent the T cell compartment[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p>

If 1 out of the first 5 evaluable subjects demonstrated an immune response, the cohort would be expanded to 8 subjects. If at least 2 out of 5 (or 8) subjects exhibited an immune response, the regimen would be considered promising, and if 0 out of 5 or 1 out of 8 had an immune response, the regimen would be deemed not worthy of further exploration.

The other two long-term survivors had a moderate infiltrate (9 and 11 cells/mm2 respectively) at baseline; however, a decrease was noted in the on-treatment sample to 2 and 3 cells/mm2 respectively. Analysis of CD8+ cells by the same method yielded higher cell densities including in the MSI-H tumor; however, there was no appreciable trend with change on treatment.

Six cases were negative for PD-L1 by this method at baseline; one of these patients’ tumor became PD-L1+ after therapy and this patient was among the long-term survivors.</p>

              <p id="Par27">Progress in the development of new therapies for advanced CRC has been slow, and in the era of burgeoning immunotherapeutics with innumerable potential combinations to be evaluated, large-scale phase III trials are impractical. Furthermore, few studies have addressed the optimal sequencing of the combinatorial approaches and novel study designs are needed to this end. We report the results of a trial of the combination of the DNMTi guadecitabine and GVAX colon cancer vaccine in patients with advanced colorectal cancer, the first trial, to our knowledge, designed to identify the optimal sequencing of an immunomodulatory combination using a primary biological endpoint. Our study utilized a primary endpoint of increase in CD45RO+ TILs, with an aim to characterize the best potential sequence of this combination prior to moving forward with well-powered phase II studies. The treatment was well tolerated with no unexpected toxicities. Based on the predefined endpoint of increase in CD45RO+ TILs no significant increase was noted, although an increase from no CD45RO+ T cell infiltrate to a measurable infiltrate was observed in two patients in Cohort 1, showing a possible biologic effect. Unfortunately, a clinical effect of the regimen was not appreciated, with most patients experiencing progressive disease by the first scan.</p>
              <p id="Par28">The design of our study permitted further investigation of effects on other immune cell populations in the tumor through the use of multiplex IHC analysis. In particular, effects of the agents under study on myeloid cell populations are poorly understood. GVAX has been shown to affect myeloid cell populations in a dose-dependent manner, with increased activation and numbers of circulating monocytes at lower doses and increased MDSCs at higher doses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. In combination with a listeria based vaccine in metastatic pancreatic cancer, GVAX decreased CD68+ cells in the tumors of the subset of patients with longer survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Epigenetic alterations likely play a role in regulation of the macrophage phenotype; however, the different classes of agents may differentially impact the myeloid compartment. Specifically, HDACi therapy combinations have demonstrated pro-immune effects on monocyte-macrophage populations both in patients and in animal models, and effects on macrophage polarization are a postulated mechanism for the immunomodulatory effects of these agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. DNMT1 positively regulates the M1 phenotype and some studies have demonstrated downregulation of M1 markers and increased expression of M2 markers with inhibition of DNMT1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]; however studies of effects in tumor associated macrophages are lacking38. In this study, we observed a significant increase in the myeloid compartment with treatment (increase in CD68:CD8 ratio where CD8 density did not change with therapy); however, CD163:CD68 ratio did not change significantly with treatment, suggesting that the regimen did not promote polarization to the immune-suppressive M2 phenotype.</p>
              <p id="Par29">This study highlights some of the challenges and potential pitfalls of a small phase 0 study with a biological endpoint. Most importantly, the design relies on the validity of the primary biomarker. In this study and others of immunomodulatory agents, the optimal biomarker of response to immunotherapy is not known and remains a subject of intensive study and debate. Different immunotherapy approaches may each have unique single biomarkers or biomarker panels that are salient to the agent(s) being tested. We chose CD45RO+ cells due to multiple reasons, including prior reports that showed CD45RO+ T cell infiltration had prognostic significance and their underlying biology, representing the T cell compartment broadly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. However, whether change in CD45RO+ T cell infiltration has utility as a predictive marker has not been extensively validated. Several other potential biomarkers of response to immunotherapy have more recently emerged, including other immune cell markers, immune checkpoints (notably PD-L1) and gene expression signatures. These data are also limited, with most being in tumor types where responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors are commonly seen such as melanoma. It is not known to what extent these findings can be extrapolated to other tumor types and other immunotherapies. In this study there was no clear correlation between PD-L1 expression and clinical outcomes, utilizing two different methods for quantification of PD-L1.</p>
              <p id="Par30">Additionally, a biomarker based on core biopsies has several potential issues. Infiltration of immune cells within a tumor may be heterogeneous and not well represented with core needle biopsies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The optimal means of quantification has not been established and computer-aided analysis has limitations. In addition, spatial information regarding distribution of TILs (at the invasive margin versus intratumoral) may be an important component of quantification and may be limited in biopsy cores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Finally, paired biopsies are burdensome to patients, and difficult to obtain in all subjects. Analyses may be biased towards patients who are able to undergo a second biopsy. Thus the development of biomarkers based on newer non-invasive techniques such as liquid biopsy or imaging may be advantageous.</p>
              <p id="Par31">In summary, no significant clinical activity of guadecitabine with Cy/GVAX in metastatic colorectal cancer patients was observed in this small study. However, we report on a novel study design to evaluate optimal sequence of administration which could be carried forward in other studies of combinations. While we were not able to draw definitive conclusions regarding the immunologic activity of the regimen, it remains possible that other immune suppressive pathways are contributing to the lack of activity and further immune activation with another agent such as an immune checkpoint inhibitor may be necessary. The potential for epigenetic therapy to sensitize tumors to the activity of immunotherapy remains an area of interest, and other immunotherapy combinations continue to be explored [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p>
