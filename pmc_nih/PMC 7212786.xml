                  <p>Eribulin mesylate, a synthetic analog of halichondrin B, is a novel
tubulin-binding agent that inhibits cancer cell proliferation at

                  <title>Methods:</title>
                  <p>In a multicenter ECOG trial, patients with progressive metastatic CRPC, ECOG
0-2 were treated with eribulin 1.4 mg/m<sup>2</sup> as an IV
bolus over 5 minutes on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle. This noncomparative
study stratified points to either a chemonaive (CN), prior-taxane (Tax)
only, or 2 prior cytotoxic (TCx) chemotherapy arm. The trial was powered to
detect a 50% PSA reduction using Consensus Criteria in at least
40% versus 20% (90% power, one-sided
α=0.10) for the CN stratum and 25% versus. 10%
(power 87%, one-sided α=0.10) for the Tax and TCx
strata.</p>

                  <title>Results:</title>
                  <p>In total, 119 pts received treatment of which 116 were eligible for the
primary response determination in this study. Median age 70 years (range, 45
to 88); median number of treatment cycles 4 (range, 1 to 20+); ECOG
0-1 90%. Confirmed PSA response rates (50% decline from
baseline) were 29% (90% [18.2%, 41.2%];
<italic>P</italic>=0.20), 10% (90% [5.2%,
27.1%]; <italic>P</italic>=1.00), and 4% ([0.2%,
18.3%]; <italic>P</italic>=0.59) in the chemonaive stratum,
the prior-taxane stratum, and the 2-prior-chemotherapy stratum,
respectively. Median progression-free survival was 3.5 months (95%
CI, 2.0, 5.9), 2.3 months (95% CI, 2.0, 2.9) and 3.7 months
(95% CI, 2.1, 4.2) for the chemonaive stratum, the prior-taxane
stratum and the 2-prior-chemotherapy stratum, respectively. Nonhematological
toxicities of any grade (mainly grade 1 and 2) were fatigue (74%),
neuropathy (40%), alopecia (39%), nausea (35%), and
anorexia (34%). Common hematological toxicities were decreased
leukocytes (75%), decreased neutrophils (72%), and decreased
hemoglobin (66%). The most common grade ≥ 3 toxicities were
decreased neutrophils (55%), decreased leukocytes (42%),
sensory neuropathy (13%), and fatigue (11%). Overall, there
was a 4% rate of febrile neutropenia.</p>

          <body>
            <p>Metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) continues to be a significant
source of morbidity and mortality with 29,430 prostate cancer related deaths expected to
occur in 2018.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)
to suppress gonadal synthesis of testosterone represents standard first-line therapy for
patients with metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer. In recent years, the
addition of novel androgen signaling inhibitors has improved overall survival in both
hormone-sensitive and castration resistant advanced prostate cancer.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>–<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
Nevertheless, chemotherapy remains an important part of the palliative treatment of
patients with advanced metastatic prostate cancer. The microtubule inhibitors docetaxel
and cabazitaxel have both been demonstrated to improve overall survival in patients with
advanced prostate cancer.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Furthermore, in men with hormone sensitive metastatic prostate
cancer, a substantial survival benefit has been seen when docetaxel is given with
initiation of ADT rather than once resistance to castration has developed.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> With
earlier use of docetaxel in this patient population there is a need for additional
chemotherapy agents in patients with castrate resistant prostate cancer that is
docetaxel resistant.</p>
            <p>Eribulin mesylate (eribulin) is a structurally simplified synthetic analog of
halichondrin B, a nontaxane inhibitor of microtubule dynamics with high affinity for the
growing plus end of the microtubule.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Preclinically eribulin has activity against a
wide variety of tumors including LNCaP human prostate cancer cells and has effects on
angiogenesis, vascular remodeling and epithelial mesenchymal transformation that make it
distinct from other microtubule inhibitors.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> A phase III trial of eribulin
versus treatment of physician’s choice in previously treated patients with
metastatic breast cancer demonstrated an overall survival benefit with eribulin
treatment leading to regulatory approval for eribulin in the United States in 2010.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Eribulin is also approved for treatment of
metastatic liposarcoma, resulting from an improvement in overall survival compared with
dacarbazine.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> On the basis of the unique
efficacy profile of eribulin, preclinical activity in prostate cancer, and clinical
efficacy of other microtubule inhibitors in prostate cancer, we conducted a phase II
trial of eribulin in men with CRPC. In order to assess drug activity in relevant
clinical settings, subjects were assigned to one of three strata based having no prior
chemotherapy treatment, prior docetaxel or 2 prior chemotherapies for metastatic
CRPC.</p>

                <title>Study Design</title>
                <p>This open label, multisite, single arm, phase II trial evaluated eribulin in men
with metastatic CRPC. Subjects were enrolled into one of 3 strata based on prior
therapy: chemotherapy naïve, prior taxane therapy or ≥2 prior
chemotherapies. The trial was conducted in member institutions of the Easton
Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG, now part of ECOG-ACRIN). The study was
approved by the institutional review board of each participating institution.
Patients provided written informed consent before study participation. The
primary objective of the study was to determine the proportion of patients with
a ≥50% decrease in the PSA of at least 4 weeks duration in
patients with metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer in each of the
treatment strata. Secondary objectives were to estimate the measurable disease
response in patients with measurable disease, to determine the duration of PSA
response (or decline) and measurable disease response and to characterize the
safety and tolerability of eribulin.</p>

                <title>Patients</title>
                <p>All patients in this study had histologically proven adenocarcinoma the prostate
and were receiving treatment with androgen deprivation therapy in the form of
bilateral orchiectomy or treatment with an LHRH agonist or antagonist. All
patients had a ECOG performance status of 0, 1, and 2. All patients had
testosterone level &lt;50 at the time of enrollment. Patients were required
to have evidence of progressive metastatic prostate cancer defined by new
lesions on bone scan or new/enlarging lesions on CT scan, or have a
rising PSA within 4 weeks before registration. In addition, patients with bone
metastases only were required to have a PSA level ≥5 ng/mL
within 1 week before registration. Patients with stable metastatic disease and
rising PSA were required to have 2 consecutive rises in PSA measurement at least
one week apart with the most recent PSA within 4 weeks of study registration.
Discontinuation of flutamide was required ≥4 weeks before registration
and discontinuation of bicalutamide or nilutamide were required ≥6 weeks
before registration with confirmation of rising PSA obtained after the washout
period.</p>
                <p>Depending on the stratum patients could be either chemotherapy naïve, have
been treated with one prior taxane regimen, or be treated with up to 2 prior
cytotoxic chemotherapeutic regimens as long as the last chemotherapy was given
&gt;4 weeks before registration and evidence of disease progression was met.
The use of bisphosphonates was allowed as long they had been given &gt;4
weeks before registration. No radiation was allowed within 4 weeks before
registration. Prior treatment with strontium 89, samarium 153, or other
radioisotopes was prohibited. Patients receiving eribulin in the first line

                <p>Eribulin was administered as an IV bolus at 1.4 mg/m<sup>2</sup>
over 5 minutes on days 1 and 8 of each 21 day cycle. Dose was calculated based
on actual body surface area before each cycle. Missed doses on day 8 were not
made up. Patients requiring dose reduction as noted below were treated at
1.1 mg/m<sup>2</sup> and then
0.7 mg/m<sup>2</sup> if a second dose reduction was required.
Patients who met criteria for a third dose reduction were removed from study.
Patients who experienced toxicity requiring dose reduction had treatment delayed
(if day 1 of a cycle) until toxicity resolved to ≤grade 1, or skipped (if
day 8) only to resume the next planned dose after recovery to grade
≤grade 1.</p>
                <p>Patients experiencing grade 3/4 nonhematological toxicity felt at least
possibly related to the study medication (excluding alopecia and
nausea/vomiting unless uncontrolled by antiemetics) required dose
reduction. Patients who failed to recover to ≤grade 1 within 2 weeks
required discontinuation of protocol treatment. For hematologic toxicity
treatment was required to be held for ANC&lt;1,000/µL
and/or platelets &lt;75,000/µL. If counts recovered
within 2 weeks, treatment was resumed at the next lower dose level. Failure to
recover counts within 14 days required discontinuation of protocol therapy. Any
episode of febrile neutropenia (temperature greater than 38.5°C with an
ANC&lt;1000/µL) required a dose reduction for all subsequent
doses. Neutropenia on nontreatment days did not require a dose reduction.</p>
                <p>Patients continued on treatment with eribulin until they experienced radiographic
disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, voluntarily withdrew from the study,

registration and were repeated during the last week of every third cycle until
disease progression. CBC with differential was performed within one week of
registration and then weekly during treatment. A complete metabolic panel was
performed at baseline and on day one of all subsequent cycles.</p>
                <p>PSA was evaluated according to the 1999 PSA working group criteria.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> PSA response was defined as a decline

decline from baseline by ≥50%. PSA progression in patients who had
no PSA decrease was defined as an increase of serum PSA above the baseline value
by ≥25% and an increase in the absolute value PSA level by at
least 5 ng/mL, and confirmed by a second measurement ≥4

whose PSA decreased from baseline, PSA progression was defined by an increase of
serum PSA above the nadir by ≥50% with an increase by at least

treatment with clinically stable disease, but with a single, unconfirmed PSA
measurement that represents progression as defined above will be considered to
have PSA progression.</p>

study has separate accrual goals for 3 strata (chemonaive, one prior taxane
regimen, or up to 2 prior chemotherapeutic regimens) and a 2-stage design was
used in this study.</p>
                <p>For patients without prior chemotherapy, we considered eribulin promising if a
true response rate of ≥40% was observed, and would not be of
further interest if the true response rate was ≤20%. With a
2-stage design, the first stage would accrue 19 patients (17 eligible). If at
least 4 responses were observed among the 17 eligible patients, an additional 22
patients (20 eligible) would be entered. If ≥11 responses were observed
among the 37 eligible patients, the treatment would be considered worthy of
further study for this group of patients. With this design, we had 90%
power to test the response rate of 40% versus; 20% based on a 0.10
level 1-sided 1-sample binomial test. The probability of stopping early was 0.55
if the true response rate was 20%; whereas, if the true response rate was
40%, this probability was 0.05.</p>
                <p>We considered eribulin to be a promising regimen if a true response rate of
25% was observed for patients previously treated with one prior taxane
regimen or up to 2 prior chemotherapeutic regimens. In contrast, if the true
response rate was ≤10%, the regimen would not be of further
interest in this population. With a 2-stage design, the first stage would accrue
23 patients (21 eligible). If at least 3 responses were observed among the 21
eligible patients, an additional 21 patients (19 eligible) would be entered. If
≥7 responses were observed among 40 eligible patients, the treatment
would be considered worthy of further study for this group of patients. With
this design, we had 87% power to test the PSA response rate of 25%
versus; 10% based on a 0.09 level 1-sided 1-sample binomial test for each
of these 2 strata. The probability of stopping early was 0.65 if the true
response rate was 10%; whereas if the true response rate was 25%,
this probability was 0.07.</p>
                <p>If the regimen demonstrated a PSA response rate of at least 25% for
patients with prior taxane or 2 prior chemotherapy regimens, or at least
40% for patients without prior chemotherapy and if the number of patients
with measurable disease entered to either stratum was &lt;25, additional
patients with measurable disease would be accrued such that the total number of
eligible patients with measurable disease in each stratum was 25. However, the
PSA response rate would only be calculated among the first cohort of patients,
not including the additional patients with measurable disease.</p>
                <p>Secondary endpoints included measurable disease response, duration of PSA
response, duration of measurable disease response, progression-free survival,
and overall survival. Measurable disease response was evaluated using Solid
Tumor Response Criteria (RECIST) among patients with measurable disease at study
entry.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Duration of measurable
disease response was defined as the time from onset of complete response or

Progression-free survival was defined as the time from registration to PSA
progression, radiographic progression or death, whichever occurred first.
Overall survival was defined as the time from registration to death from any
cause.</p>

              <p>In this phase II study evaluating the activity of eribulin in men with metastatic
castrate resistant prostate cancer clinical activity was demonstrated in taxane
naïve and previously treated patients. Activity as defined by PSA decline
from baseline value by ≥50% was observed in 29%, 10% and
4% in the chemonaive stratum, the prior-taxane stratum, and the 2
prior-chemotherapy stratum, respectively. Docetaxel, the current standard of care
for chemotherapy naïve patients demonstrated a PSA response rate of
45%.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Median progression-free
survival was 3.5 months, 2.3 months, and 3.7 months for the chemonaive stratum, the
prior-taxane stratum and the 2-prior-chemotherapy stratum, respectively. Despite the
evidence of activity in some patients, overall eribulin did not meet a level of
activity to justify further evaluation of this agent in an unselected phase II
population.</p>
              <p>The PSA response rate and objective response rate in the current study were
commensurate with findings in another study of eribulin in men with metastatic CRPC
in which the 50% PSA response rate was 22.4% for taxane naïve
patients and 8.5% for taxane pretreated patients.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Median duration of PSA response was 17.0 months and 4.4
months for the chemonaive stratum and the prior-taxane stratum, respectively. The
long median duration of PSA response in the chemotherapy naïve stratum
exceeded the duration of PSA response previously reported with docetaxel
(8.2 mo)<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> or eribulin
(3.2 mo).<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> This may in part
reflect patient selection as patients in the treatment naïve group had lower
PSAs at baseline and fewer patients with liver metastasis compared with the patients
in the other eribulin prostate study. Alternatively, there may be a select group of
patients with exquisite sensitivity to eribulin responsible for this prolonged
duration of PSA response.</p>
              <p>Presently, multiple agents are approved for use in the treatment of metastatic CRPC.
In addition to docetaxel, that was approved at the time this study commenced, the
semisynthetic taxane derivative cabazitaxel obtained regulatory approval for the
treatment of metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer after progressing on a
docetaxel-containing regimen.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> In the phase
III trial of cabazitaxel versus mitoxantrone in which all subjects were previously
treated with docetaxel, cabazitaxel resulted in a notable ≥50% PSA
decline in 39% of patients, with 14% of patients having an objective
tumor response. These results compared favorably to the results seen with eribulin
in the current study in which 4 (15%); 1 (2.6%) and 1 (7.7%)
subject achieved object response in the chemonaive stratum, the prior taxane
stratum, and the 2-prior-chemotherapy stratum, respectively. However, median
progression-free survival was 2.8 months in the cabazitaxel group and 1.4 months in
the mitoxantrone group in this large phase III trial. This PFS was comparable with
the PFS seen with eribulin in a comparable disease setting. It is unknown if
patients will respond to eribulin after cabazitaxel given these 2 drugs’
distinct mechanisms of action with respect to mitotic spindle inhibition.</p>
              <p>Additional analysis may also clarify if there is any association between resistance
to second generation androgen signaling inhibitors such as enzalutamide and
abiraterone and resistance to eribulin. Several groups have described the importance
of microtubule mediated AR translocation for AR signaling.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Although some
authors have suggested that resistance to AR inhibitors as a result of cancer cell
expression of AR splice variants also confers resistance to taxanes,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> other authors suggest that taxanes maintain
activity even in the presence of AR splice variants, in contrast to AR signaling
inhibitors such as enzalutamide.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> It is not
yet known if microtubule inhibitors or stabilizers have differential activity in
this clinical setting. Future trials with eribulin in prostate cancer should
therefore be designed to account the presence of AR splice variants.</p>
              <p>Overall treatment with eribulin was associated with manageable toxicity, including in
patients with multiple prior treatments. No statistically significant increase in
differences in the distribution of worst degree toxicities was seen when evaluated
by stratum (<italic>P</italic>=0.92). Leukocytopenia, fatigue, neutropenia,
anemia, and sensory neuropathy were the most common toxicities. Neutropenia was the
most common grade ≥3 toxicity with a 4% rate of febrile neutropenia.
Unlike docetaxel, eribulin is not given with corticosteroids, which may help to
ameliorate some side effects such as anorexia and fatigue which are commonly seen
with prostate cancer.</p>
              <p>In summary, per the prespecified study endpoints, eribulin did not have adequate
activity in chemotherapy naïve or chemotherapy pretreated patients with
metastatic CRPC to support further study in this setting. Studies prospectively
incorporating relevant biomarkers of resistance such as the presence of AR splice
variants that allow us to better understand the characteristics of patients who are
exceptional responders to eribulin (as seen in the current study) by incorporating
next generation sequencing of tumor biopsies or cell free DNA, may help to establish
a role for eribulin or other novel cytotoxic agents in discrete patient
populations.</p>
