                <title>PURPOSE</title>
                <p>The utility of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analyses has not been established in the risk stratification of Wilms tumor (WT). We evaluated the detection of ctDNA and selected risk markers in the serum and urine of patients with WT and compared findings with those of matched diagnostic tumor samples.</p>
                <sec>
                  <title>PATIENTS AND METHODS</title>
                  <p>Fifty of 395 children with stage III or IV WT enrolled on Children's Oncology Group trial AREN0533 had banked pretreatment serum, urine, and tumor available. Next-generation sequencing was used to detect ctDNA. Copy-number changes in 1q, 16q, and 1p, and single-nucleotide variants in serum and urine were compared with tumor biopsy data. Event-free survival (EFS) was compared between patients with and without ctDNA detection.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>RESULTS</title>
                  <p>ctDNA was detected in the serum of 41/50 (82%) and in the urine in 13/50 (26%) patients. Agreement between serum ctDNA detection and tumor sequencing results was as follows: 77% for 1q gain, 88% for 16q deletions, and 70% for 1p deletions, with ĸ-coefficients of 0.56, 0.74, and 0.29, respectively. Sequencing also demonstrated that single-nucleotide variants detected in tumors could be identified in the ctDNA. There was a trend toward worse EFS in patients with ctDNA detected in the serum (4-year EFS 80% <italic toggle="yes">v</italic> 100%, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = .14).</p>

                  <p>ctDNA demonstrates promise as an easily accessible prognostic biomarker with potential to detect tumor heterogeneity. The observed trend toward more favorable outcome in patients with undetectable ctDNA requires validation. ctDNA profiling should be further explored as a noninvasive diagnostic and prognostic tool in the risk-adapted treatment of patients with WT.</p>

              <p>Wilms tumor (WT) is the most common malignant kidney tumor in the pediatric population,<sup><xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> with 500 new cases being diagnosed annually in the United States. Although outcomes of children diagnosed with WT have significantly improved over the past few decades, there remain significant challenges to optimizing therapy such that all patients are cured while side effects of therapy are minimized. A subset of patients experience relapse after therapy, and survival after relapse is unacceptably low.<sup><xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>-<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Recent clinical research efforts have focused on identifying patients who are at increased risk of relapse, demonstrating the prognostic relevance of specific tumor genomic features at diagnosis, including loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of 16q and 1p and, more recently, gain of 1q.<sup><xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> On the basis of these observations, the Children's Oncology Group (COG) recently implemented treatment intensification for patients with LOH of 1p and 16q tumor genetics, resulting in marked improvements in outcome.<sup><xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup></p>

              <p>Liquid biopsy is a novel technology that is recently being applied to adult and pediatric malignancies to detect, quantify, and profile ultrarare strands of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) as a screening method.<sup><xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>-<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> These technologies are already used clinically to select patients for targeted therapies in the setting of colorectal cancer, NSCLC, and breast cancer.<sup><xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>-<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Previous studies indicate that ctDNA is detectable in a range of pediatric solid tumors; however, those studies exploring ctDNA in patients with WT have been limited by sample size and cohorts of patients with a mix of risk-defining clinical features.<sup><xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>-<xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Whether recently identified stratifying genomic features, namely 16q and 1p LOH and 1q copy gains, can be identified in the blood of patients with WT using liquid biopsy has yet to be explored.</p>
              <p>In this study, we used a next-generation sequencing approach to profile cell-free DNA extracted from banked serum and urine samples collected from patients with stage III or IV WT. We leveraged genome-wide assessment of copy-number alterations (CNAs) to determine which patients had detectable levels of ctDNA, explore whether the presence of ctDNA in the blood or urine of these patients correlates with outcome, and evaluate whether ctDNA can serve as an alternative source of tumor material for detecting the presence of 1q copy gains and 16q and 1p LOH.</p>

                <p>CNAs of chromosomal arms 1p, 1q, and 16q were identified from ULP-WGS data by extracting the log2 fold-change for data from the segmental files generated from the ichorCNA algorithm. The low coverage of this technique required that we rely on a large segment of the chromosome to confidently identify the copy-number variants. In this study, copy-number losses and gains were called if they involved at least half of the chromosome arms of interest as indicated by the start and stop genomic coordinates in the segmental files.</p>

                <p>Fifty patients were eligible for inclusion in this study. Descriptive statistics were computed as relative frequencies for categorical variables and means, standard deviations, and ranges for continuous variables. Previously analyzed individual patient data for LOH of 1p, LOH 16q, combined LOH 1p AND 16q, and 1q gain from AREN03B2 were included for comparison.</p>
                <p>To evaluate ctDNA detection rates overall, the distribution of % ctDNA detected in urine and serum were separately plotted as box/violin plots. Rates of marker positivity were calculated separately for each marker, specimen type, and source (current study <italic toggle="yes">v</italic> AREN03B2). Raw rates of agreement between specimen sources and associated 95% CIs were computed. As these rates can be skewed by underlying prevalence of a marker as well as chance sampling variability, kappa coefficients for inter-rater reliability in detecting each marker were also computed.<sup><xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup></p>
                <p>Event-free survival (EFS; defined as the time from enrollment on AREN0533 to the earliest of disease relapse, progression, secondary malignancy, or death due to any cause) and overall survival (OS; defined as the time from enrollment to death due to any cause) were compared by ctDNA detection (yes <italic toggle="yes">v</italic> no) using Kaplan-Meier estimates and log-rank tests, where patients not experiencing an event of interest were right-censored at their last known disease assessment (EFS) or last known vital status (OS).</p>

Rates of detection of LOH 1p, LOH 16q, LOH 1p AND 16q were fairly stable across specimen sources (Fig <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B and Data Supplement), whereas rates of detection of 1q gain were substantially higher in serum ctDNA (63.3%) and urine ctDNA (66.7%) than in matched diagnostic tumor analyzed contemporaneously as part of this project (44.4%) or as reported previously on AREN03B2 (32.4%; Table <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).<sup><xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> This enrichment could be attributed, at least in part, to the significantly higher rate of ctDNA detection in the serum among patients whose tumors demonstrated gain in 1q, which was noted in ad hoc analyses (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = .01; Fig <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B and Data Supplement). In fact, all patients that were found to have a 1q gain in the tumor by ULP-WGS had detectable levels of ctDNA in the serum. Rates of agreement in biomarker classification among pairs of specimen types ranged from 67% to 90% for LOH 1p, 75% to 88% for LOH 16q, 80% to 90% for combined LOH 1p AND 16q, and 77% to 89% for 1q gain (Table <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">3</xref> and Figs <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C-<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>E).

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>The past several decades of clinical trials for patients with WTs has resulted in a dramatic improvement in outcomes, with the majority of patients now cured. However, patients who experience relapses have a markedly worse outcome even when treated with intensified regimens. Furthermore, emerging evidence demonstrates that the use of clinical measures of disease burden alone does not risk stratify as precisely as integration of histopathologic and molecular features of a patient's disease. It also remains unclear how to include molecular prognostic features present in only subclonal populations of tumor cells. Ongoing efforts to implement these additional prognostic biomarkers of outcome suggest that improved precision of risk stratification could further reduce the rate of disease progression or relapse after initial therapy and mitigate risks of long-term toxicities by facilitating further intensity reduction for some patients without jeopardizing outcomes.</p>
              <p>Liquid biopsies are emerging as a new tool for prognostication and precision medicine in cancer.<sup><xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>-<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Previous studies have demonstrated that the detection of ctDNA in the blood of patients with WT was feasible, but these studies were too small to demonstrate associations with other prognostic features or outcomes.<sup><xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>-<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> In this study, we profiled samples collected from a cohort of 50 patients with matched tumor, serum, and urine who were treated on the COG study AREN0533 for patients with newly diagnosed stage III and IV disease. We found that the majority of these patients shed sufficient levels of ctDNA into their serum to be reliably detectable by a low-sensitivity next-generation sequencing approach that identifies segmental and chromosomal copy-number variants. By contrast, only a minority of patients had detectable levels of ctDNA in their urine, suggesting that more sensitive assays or larger sample volumes may be needed to make urine-based liquid biopsies useful in this disease.</p>
              <p>ULP-WGS can be used to detect ctDNA when it comprises at least 3% of the cell-free DNA content isolated from a liquid biopsy sample.<sup><xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> In previous studies of other pediatric solid tumors, we have found that this limit of detection is a convenient and clinically relevant cutoff for distinguishing patients with high ctDNA (≥ 3%) from patients with low ctDNA (&lt; 3%).<sup><xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Consistent with this previous work, we found that none of the patients enrolled on this study with low (undetectable) ctDNA in their serum experienced a relapse and all survived. Although this difference in PFS and OS was not significant, these findings justify further validation in prospective cohorts and suggest that ctDNA levels could further refine risk stratification for patients with stage III-IV WT. We also found that all patients later found to have localized or diffuse anaplasia in their tumors at the time of surgery, shed ctDNA into the serum and urine, further supporting the concept that detection of ctDNA by ULP-WGS may be associated with more aggressive disease in patients with WT, an important finding to also validate in an expanded cohort.</p>
              <p>In this study, we demonstrated that somatic variants present in the tumor could be detected in the serum and urine of patients with detectable levels of ctDNA. These findings demonstrate the practice changing potential of liquid biopsies to detect the presence of validated prognostic molecular events in the context of up-front chemotherapy without biopsy. Although the level of correlation between tumor profiling and ctDNA samples was high, we also observed discrepancies between samples that suggest the presence of subclonal heterogeneity in these patients, most of whom had metastatic disease. In other cancers, ctDNA has been shown to better capture the presence of subclonal variants than solitary biopsies, especially in patients with metastatic disease.<sup><xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>-<xref rid="b37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> In five cases from our study, we detected a 1q gain in the serum but not in the matched tumor, and in two cases, 1q gain was detected in the tumor but not the serum, even when samples were profiled by using the same technology (ULP-WGS), suggesting the possible utility of a more comprehensive profiling strategy for risk stratification at diagnosis. However, it is still unclear how to interpret the detection of these somatic events when present in subclonal fractions. Interestingly, we did not identify <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> mutations in either the tumors or ctDNA from the five patients found to have anaplasia at delayed resection. It is possible these cases were representative of <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> wild-type anaplasia<sup><xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> or that our sequencing techniques were not sensitive enough to detect rare subclones containing these variants. We anticipate that more comprehensive detection of clonal and subclonal CNVs and SNVs will be possible by cell-free DNA profiling as more sensitive sequencing approaches are implemented.<sup><xref rid="b38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> Additional studies will be needed to determine whether ctDNA can better identify clinically relevant tumor genetic biomarkers than tumor biopsies in WT and to determine how to incorporate subclonal variants into risk-stratification strategies.</p>
              <p>One limitation of this study is that our cohort was enriched for patients with stage IV disease because only a subset of patients with stage III disease, those with LOH of 1p and 16q, were eligible for AREN0533. Levels of detectable ctDNA could be lower in patients with biologically less aggressive stage III disease or patients with localized WT, which will need to be further studied. This patient cohort was only a subset of the patients enrolled on AREN0533, which could have introduced unexpected selection bias. Another limitation of this study is that only serum was available from these patients, and samples demonstrated a high degree of contamination with cellular DNA.<sup><xref rid="b39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>-<xref rid="b41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> For this reason, accurate ctDNA levels could not be confidently calculated (beyond detect or not detect), and this precluded studying whether the quantity of ctDNA was directly associated with an increased risk of relapse or death. Furthermore, only small volumes of urine were available for our study. Given the potential to collect much larger volumes of urine from patients, this analysis does not rule out the possibility that urine could be a promising source of material for ctDNA analysis. Moreover, as only pretreatment samples were available for this cohort, we were not able to evaluate whether changes in ctDNA detection on and after therapy were associated with prognosis or relapse, but we recognize this as an important area of future study.<sup><xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="b42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>-<xref rid="b44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> Each of these limitations can be overcome through routine collection of serial blood and urine samples using validated ctDNA-optimized sample handling protocols, such as the use of cell-stabilizer tubes, in future clinical trials.<sup><xref rid="b39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>-<xref rid="b41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> Finally, leveraging ULP-WGS for detection of segmental CNAs could have resulted in some false-negative results for focal CNVs picked up by array profiling for the AREN03B2 study, potentially accounting for some of the rare discrepancies seen in our analysis. Improvements in computational analysis would be expected to shorten the minimum length of CNVs detectable by ULP-WGS to one megabase, equivalent to the length needed to call an alteration in the AREN03B2 protocol.</p>
              <p>In summary, to our knowledge, our study is the first to define the feasibility of detecting and quantifying ctDNA from liquid biopsy samples collected from patients with WT enrolled on a multi-institutional prospective clinical trial, with available correlative treatment and outcome data. The findings highlight the potential advantage of these assays in refining risk-stratified treatment strategies that have already improved outcome for patients with this pediatric malignancy. We believe prospective validation of these results is warranted, and studies to determine whether ctDNA studies in patients with higher-risk and lower-risk disease would also be informative.</p>
