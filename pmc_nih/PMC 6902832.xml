              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (<italic>ERBB2</italic>, formerly <italic>HER2</italic>) is a proto-oncogene that encodes the 185-kDa ERBB2 protein, a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor that is a member of the human epidermal growth factor receptor family. Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, which is involved in the regulation of cell growth and survival, is amplified in 15% to 20% of invasive breast carcinomas and confers shortened progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) compared with other breast tumors.<sup><xref rid="zoi190615r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Activation of ERBB signaling is dependent on homodimerization or heterodimerization, with the ERBB2-ERBB3 dimer as the most potent inducer of cell proliferation.<sup><xref rid="zoi190615r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Clinical outcomes for patients with <italic>ERBB2</italic>-positive breast cancer have significantly improved with the development of ERBB2-targeted therapies. Trastuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to the extracellular domain IV of ERBB2 and thereby limits its activation.<sup><xref rid="zoi190615r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Pertuzumab, also a monoclonal antibody, disrupts ERBB2 dimerization via binding of the extracellular domain II of ERBB2, thereby inhibiting ligand-activated signaling with other growth factor receptors.<sup><xref rid="zoi190615r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Together, trastuzumab and pertuzumab synergistically inhibit tumor growth through their complementary mechanisms of action.<sup><xref rid="zoi190615r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p>
              <p>In the frontline setting, standard treatment of patients with <italic>ERBB2</italic>-positive metastatic breast cancer includes the combination of taxane chemotherapy with trastuzumab and pertuzumab.<sup><xref rid="zoi190615r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190615r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> This approach was established by pivotal data from the randomized phase 3 Clinical Evaluation of Trastuzumab and Pertuzumab (CLEOPATRA) trial,<sup><xref rid="zoi190615r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> which demonstrated improvements in both PFS and OS in patients treated with docetaxel, trastuzumab, and pertuzumab on a 3-week schedule. Our group reported similar findings in a phase 2 study<sup><xref rid="zoi190615r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> evaluating the combination of weekly paclitaxel with trastuzumab and pertuzumab. The use of either docetaxel or weekly paclitaxel with trastuzumab and pertuzumab for first-line treatment of patients with <italic>ERBB2</italic>-positive metastatic breast cancer is endorsed by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines.<sup><xref rid="zoi190615r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup></p>
              <p>In the second-line setting, the randomized phase 3 PHEREXA trial<sup><xref rid="zoi190615r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> evaluated the combination of capecitabine with trastuzumab and pertuzumab vs capecitabine with trastuzumab alone. While the addition of pertuzumab in the second-line setting was not associated with a significant gain in PFS, an 8-month increase in OS was reported, although the trial was underpowered to evaluate this end point. Other trials have demonstrated median PFS of approximately 3 to 4 months for patients treated with trastuzumab and chemotherapy-based regimens after 2 or more prior lines of therapy.<sup><xref rid="zoi190615r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190615r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190615r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Based on these historical data, we aimed to determine the 3-month and median PFS rates of dual anti-<italic>ERBB2</italic> therapy, including pertuzumab and trastuzumab, given with chemotherapy among patients previously exposed to pertuzumab. Accordingly, we conducted a phase 2 trial of gemcitabine with pertuzumab and trastuzumab in patients with <italic>ERBB2</italic>-positive metastatic breast cancer in the second-line setting and beyond.</p>

                <p>This was a single-center, phase 2 trial in which all patients were enrolled from the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. Eligible patients had <italic>ERBB2</italic>-positive metastatic breast cancer and prior treatment with pertuzumab-based therapy. We defined <italic>ERBB2</italic> positivity as 3+ by immunohistochemistry stain or amplified by fluorescent in situ hybridization with an <italic>ERBB2</italic> to <italic>CEP17</italic> ratio of 2.0 or greater. Additional eligibility criteria included being 18 years or older, having an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 1, having measurable or nonmeasurable disease, having had up to 3 prior chemotherapy regimens in the metastatic setting, having adequate organ function, and having baseline left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 50% or greater, measured by echocardiogram, within 4 weeks before enrollment. Patients may have had pertuzumab-based therapy in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting. Patients with treated brain metastasis who were stable for 2 or more months before enrollment were included. Patients were excluded if they had a history of cardiac morbidities (eg, unstable angina, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, or uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmias) within 12 months of enrollment or any grade 3 or higher toxic response to prior trastuzumab or pertuzumab. This trial was approved by the institutional review board of the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, and all participants provided written informed consent prior to enrollment. Reporting of this trial is in accordance with Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/consort/">CONSORT</ext-link>) reporting guideline.

                <p>Patients received gemcitabine at 1200 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle and trastuzumab (8-mg/kg loading dose, then 6 mg/kg) plus pertuzumab (840-mg loading dose, then 420 mg) once every 3 weeks, all given intravenously (<xref rid="zoi190615t1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Each cycle spanned 3 weeks and included gemcitabine with trastuzumab and pertuzumab given on day 1 and gemcitabine alone on day 8. After 3 months of therapy, if patients were deemed to be progression free, gemcitabine could be held at the discretion of the treating physician, and patients were maintained with antibodies alone. Treatment was continued until progression of disease or unacceptable toxic effects.</p>

Up to 3 consecutive weeks of treatment delay was allowed for recovery. On improvement and reinitiation of treatment, the gemcitabine dose was reduced.

For trastuzumab and pertuzumab, treatment was held for significant asymptomatic LVEF decline (ie, 10%-15% decline to &lt;50%, or â‰¥10% decline from baseline) or New York Heart Association class III to class IV heart failure. Treatment with the anti-<italic>ERBB2</italic> antibodies could be restarted if repeated echocardiogram showed LVEF recovery within 3 weeks.

                <p>The primary end point of this study was the proportion of patients who were progression free at 3 months or later. Progression-free survival events included disease progression or death, whichever occurred first. The study was powered on the basis of a binary end point of the proportion of patients who were progression free at 3 months. For the primary intention-to-treat analysis, evaluable patients included all study participants who received at least 1 full dose of therapy. A target rate of 70% or higher was selected as the promising progression-free rate at 3 months, while the null rate of 50% was based on evidence from 3 prior studies involving more than 900 patients with <italic>ERBB2</italic>-positive metastatic breast cancer treated in the second-line setting or beyond, in which median PFS was 3 to 4 months.<sup><xref rid="zoi190615r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190615r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190615r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> A Simon optimal 2-stage design was used to evaluate the efficacy of this regimen.<sup><xref rid="zoi190615r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> This design required a total of 45 patients and assumed a 10% type I and type II error rate. The type I error was 1-sided, and secondary analyses were conducted at a 2-sided type I error of 5%. In the first stage, 21 patients were enrolled. Accrual to the second stage was contingent on 12 or more patients in the first stage being alive and progression free at 3 months. At the end of the study, if 27 or more patients were alive and progression free 3 months after the initiation of therapy, the regimen would be considered a success and deemed worthy of further study. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate PFS estimates. A secondary end point was OS, which was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Additional secondary end points included safety, tolerability, and assessment of biomarkers (not presented in this article). An exploratory end point was to evaluate response by PERCIST (not presented in this article). Adverse events with frequencies of 25% or greater were summarized by percentage. We incorporated a stopping rule to ensure cardiac safety. Cardiac events were defined as symptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD; deaths and nondeaths), non-LVSD cardiac death, or probable cardiac death.<sup><xref rid="zoi190615r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> A cardiac event rate of 4% or less and an asymptomatic LVEF decline (of â‰¥10% from baseline to &lt;50%) rate of 20% or less were considered acceptable.

The median (range) age was 57.1 (31.7-77.2) years. At initiation of study treatment, 38 patients (84%) had visceral disease, and 7 (16%) had nonvisceral disease. Measurable disease was present in 30 patients (67%), and 15 (33%) had nonmeasurable disease. A total of 33 patients (73%) had estrogen receptorâ€“positive and/or progesterone receptorâ€“positive disease. Metastatic disease was present at the time of breast cancer diagnosis in 20 patients (44%). Overall, 22 patients (49%) had received 1 prior line of chemotherapy in the metastatic setting, 17 (38%) received 2 prior lines, and 6 (13%) received 3 prior lines.

At a median (range) follow-up period of 27.6 (8.3-36.0) months, the 3-month PFS was 73.3% (95% CI, 61.5%-87.5%). The 3-month PFS was 73.9% (95% CI, 58.0%-94.2%) in patients who had not received prior T-DM1 and 72.7% (95% CI, 56.3%-93.9%) in those who received prior T-DM1. Overall, median PFS was 5.5 months (95% CI, 5.4-8.2 months) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="zoi190615f1">Figure</xref>, A); it was 5.6 months (95% CI, 5.1-11.0 months) for those without prior T-DM1 treatment and 5.5 months (95% CI, 5.4-8.2 months) for those who received prior T-DM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="zoi190615f1">Figure</xref>, B).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>In this study of gemcitabine given with dual anti-<italic>ERBB2</italic> antibody therapy for the treatment of <italic>ERBB2</italic>-positive metastatic breast cancer among patients previously treated with pertuzumab-based therapy, the Kaplan-Meier 3-month PFS was 73.3% (95% CI, 61.5%-87.5%). This study met its primary end point and prespecified definition of success: a promising 3-month PFS rate of at least 70%. Thus, this trial demonstrated encouraging activity of dual anti-<italic>ERBB2</italic> therapy with gemcitabine in the second-line setting and beyond.</p>
              <p>Nearly half of patients in this study received T-DM1 after disease progression on first-line treatment with taxane plus dual anti-<italic>ERBB2</italic> therapy. Currently, T-DM1 is a standard second-line treatment based on the EMILIA study<sup><xref rid="zoi190615r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> and endorsed by American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines<sup><xref rid="zoi190615r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> for systemic therapy in patients with <italic>ERBB2</italic>-positive metastatic breast cancer. The EMILIA trial, a randomized phase 3 study,<sup><xref rid="zoi190615r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> demonstrated improved PFS (9.6 vs 6.4 months) and OS (29.9 vs 25.9 months) with T-DM1 compared with the combination of lapatinib plus capecitabine.<sup><xref rid="zoi190615r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> With the negative results of the first-line MARIANNE study,<sup><xref rid="zoi190615r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> T-DM1 remains a standard option in the second-line setting. However, our data encourage further study of reexposure to trastuzumab plus pertuzumab beyond progression from prior treatment with this dual-antibody therapy. Retrospective data from our institution add additional support.<sup><xref rid="zoi190615r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Argolo et al<sup><xref rid="zoi190615r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> reported that trastuzumab and pertuzumabâ€“based combinations in the second-line setting were associated with a median PFS of 10.3 months (95% CI, 5.9-16.3 months) vs 5.3 months (95% CI, 3.0-6.6 months) in patients treated with regimens that did not include pertuzumab (<italic>P</italic>â€‰=â€‰.03). In contrast, the PHEREXA trial<sup><xref rid="zoi190615r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> demonstrated no significant PFS difference between capecitabine with trastuzumab plus pertuzumab vs capecitabine with trastuzumab alone for second-line treatment (9.0 vs 11.1 months; hazard ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.65-1.02; <italic>P</italic>â€‰=â€‰.07). However, OS was 28.1 vs 36.1 months, favoring the pertuzumab-containing arm (HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.51-0.90). Although underpowered to evaluate OS, the signal of OS benefit in this study was consistent with the greater OS than PFS benefit with dual-antibody therapy in the CLEOPATRA study.<sup><xref rid="zoi190615r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Other trials are currently testing novel therapeutic strategies in the second-line setting. For example, in the phase 2 KATE2 trial,<sup><xref rid="zoi190615r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> which evaluated the efficacy and safety of T-DM1 combined with atezolizumab, an antiâ€“programmed death-ligand 1 antibody, vs T-DM1 combined with a placebo, there was no PFS benefit in the atezolizumab arm, and OS data are not yet mature. In addition to immunotherapy, other novel <italic>ERBB2</italic>-directed therapies include small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (eg, neratinib, afatinib, tucatinib, pyrotinib), antibody-drug conjugates, and bispecific antibodies. An important future direction will be to compare the efficacy of these emerging therapeutics with dual-antibody therapy (ie, pertuzumab plus trastuzumab) and with standard second-line T-DM1.</p>
              <p>Our study demonstrated promising activity of dual-antibody therapy after prior exposure in the second-line setting and beyond. Notably, 49% of patients received T-DM1 prior to enrollment in this study. After exposure to pertuzumab and T-DM1, treatment practices vary and typically comprise chemotherapy combined with trastuzumab.<sup><xref rid="zoi190615r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> In a small study of 29 patients, CortÃ©s et al<sup><xref rid="zoi190615r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> reported that the median PFS of dual-antibody therapy after disease progression on pertuzumab monotherapy was 4.4 months (80% CI, 1.5-7.3 months).<sup><xref rid="zoi190615r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> In a heavily pretreated population of 602 patients enrolled in the TH3RESA trial,<sup><xref rid="zoi190615r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> median PFS with treatment of physicianâ€™s choice (typically trastuzumab plus chemotherapy) was 3.3 months (95% CI, 2.9-4.1 months). Similarly, Blackwell et al<sup><xref rid="zoi190615r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> reported a median PFS of 3 months in nearly 300 patients treated with trastuzumab and lapatinib after disease progression on trastuzumab-based regimens. Thus, in these 3 studies of more than 900 patients, the median PFS was approximately 3 to 4 months with standard options in the second-line setting and beyond. Although no direct cross-trial comparisons can be made, the median PFS of 5.5 months in the current study is encouraging.</p>
              <p>Gemcitabine (at 1000 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) given with trastuzumab and pertuzumab was well tolerated. The most common grade 3 to 4 AEs were neutropenia and anemia, consistent with the known toxic profile of gemcitabine. Despite these toxic effects, median gemcitabine dose intensity was 1000 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, indicating that delivery of the full dose was feasible. Notably, the incidence of febrile neutropenia and grade 3 to 4 diarrhea were 0%. No patients experienced clinical heart failure (ie, symptomatic LVSD), and no patients withdrew from the study because of asymptomatic LVEF decline. One patient experienced asymptomatic LVEF decline, which recovered after antibody treatment was delayed, and treatment was resumed without further incident. Similar to trials in the first-line setting,<sup><xref rid="zoi190615r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190615r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> the addition of pertuzumab did not increase cardiac toxic effects.</p>

                <title>Limitations and Strengths</title>
                <p>This study has limitations. One limitation is its single-arm design; however, historical data were used to inform the efficacy target. Furthermore, this is a single-center study, and larger randomized clinical trials are needed. The study was strengthened by use of a single chemotherapeutic agent (ie, gemcitabine). Blood was collected throughout the study, and potential biomarkers of response will be reported separately. Additionally, an imaging substudy comparing response assessed by RECIST vs PERCIST criteria will be reported separately.</p>
