                <p>Particularly interesting new cysteine- histidine- rich protein (PINCH) is an adaptor protein that our data have shown is required for neurite extension under stressful conditions. Our previous studies also report that PINCH is recalled by neurons showing decreased levels of synaptodendritic signaling proteins such as MAP2 or synaptophysin in the brains of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients. The current study addressed potential role(s) for PINCH in neurodegenerative diseases. Mass spectrometry predicted the interaction of PINCH with Tau and with members of the heat shock response. Our <italic>in vitro</italic> data confirmed that PINCH binds to hyperphosphorylated (hp) Tau and to E3 ubiquitin ligase, carboxy-terminus of heat shock-70 interacting protein. Silencing PINCH prior to induction of hp-Tau resulted in more efficient clearance of accumulating hp-Tau, suggesting that PINCH may play a role in stabilizing hp-Tau. Accumulation of hp-Tau is implicated in more than 20 neuropathological diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and human immunodeficiency virus encephalitis (HIVE). Analyses of brain tissues from HIVE, AD and FTD patients showed that PINCH is increased and binds to hp-Tau. These studies address a new mechanism by which AD and HIV may intersect and identify PINCH as a contributing factor to the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated Tau.</p>

              <p>Limited regenerative capacity in adults makes neurons in the human CNS particularly vulnerable to stress. The heat shock response (HSR) machinery is one of the cell's first lines of defense against misfolded or abnormally accumulating proteins. Functions of the HSR include surveillance of proteins post-translationally and after cellular insult or stress. These stressors include diverse events such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy injury <xref rid="pone.0058232-Stern1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, Alzheimer's disease (AD) <xref rid="pone.0058232-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, HIV encephalitis (HIVE) <xref rid="pone.0058232-Anthony1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0058232-Patrick1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) <xref rid="pone.0058232-Yoshiyama1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> and can manifest, in part, as accumulation of hyperphosphorylated Tau (hp-Tau). Interestingly, in subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), the formation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) composed of hp-Tau <xref rid="pone.0058232-Ikeda1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> were associated with measles virus <xref rid="pone.0058232-McQuaid1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, suggesting that viral infection can also contribute to NFT formation. Aberrant proteins that cannot be repaired may be targeted to the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) for degradation. The HSR works with the UPS for the recognition and clearance of aberrant proteins through the binding of a series of chaperone proteins and attachment of ubiquitin molecules to the client protein. Briefly, the heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) has inherent ATPase activity, and studies suggest that Hsp90 may either 1) initiate the repair response for refolding and/or dephosphorylation, or 2) target clients including hp-Tau for UPS degradation by recruiting the E3 ubiquitin ligase, carboxy-terminus of heat shock-70 interacting protein (CHIP) <xref rid="pone.0058232-Luo1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. This recruitment is believed to be through CHIP's interaction with Hsp70/40 <xref rid="pone.0058232-Dickey1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0058232-Salminen1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Studies in the brains of AD patients show that the degree of CHIP expression is inversely proportional to the levels of aggregated Tau <xref rid="pone.0058232-Sahara1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0058232-Oddo1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Likewise, studies in mice deficient for CHIP show increased CNS accumulation of aberrant proteins and decreased proteasomal activity <xref rid="pone.0058232-Min1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Recent studies also confirm important roles for Hsp70 and Hsp90 in controlling abnormal Tau accumulation <xref rid="pone.0058232-Luo1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0058232-Voss1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0058232-Luo2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0058232-Luo3" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Consequent CHIP binding interferes with Hsp90-mediated refolding and facilitates ubiquitination of the client protein. However, if the cellular machinery fails to clear abnormal proteins, accumulation of aberrant proteins, such as hp-Tau may occur and lead to disease. Tau is ubiquitously expressed in the brain where it assembles and stabilizes microtubules in neuronal axons. Normally, the HSR complex sorts aberrant hp-Tau for either repair or degradation, as described above. Upon hyperphosphorylation, Tau dissociates from microtubules and may be redistributed to the cell body where it accumulates and forms fibrillary deposits consisting of paired helical filaments (PHF) to form NFT. Neurofibrillary tangles are composed in part of ubiquitinated hp-Tau and recent studies report that both the proteasomal and autophagosomal pathways are involved in hp-Tau degradation. However, controversy exists regarding the preferential degradation of specific forms of hp-Tau <xref rid="pone.0058232-Dickey1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0058232-Dolan1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.</p>
              <p>Many cellular factors have been identified as contributors to the decision-making process of whether a client protein will be repaired or degraded. In this context, we have discovered that Particularly Interesting New Cysteine-Histidine-rich (PINCH) protein is upregulated in the neurons of patients with CNS disorders that have a Tau misfolding component, such as HIVE and AD. During development, PINCH is required to maintain neuronal polarity and synaptodendritic communication <xref rid="pone.0058232-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. In health and during normal ageing, PINCH expression in the adult CNS is nearly undetectable in most cases with significantly lower levels in normal cases than in disease <xref rid="pone.0058232-Rearden1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. We first discovered that in the brains of HIV-infected patients, PINCH expression was recalled by neurons showing decreased levels of the synaptodendritic signaling proteins MAP2 and synaptophysin <xref rid="pone.0058232-Rearden1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0058232-Jatiani1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Our more recent studies show that PINCH is required for neurite extension in neurons challenged with TNF-α <xref rid="pone.0058232-Jatiani1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, a mediator of synaptic dysfunction in the pathogenesis of many CNS diseases including AD and HIVE. In this context, studies show that in the frontal cortex of HIVE patients, hp-Tau levels are also increased <xref rid="pone.0058232-Anthony1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0058232-Patrick1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p>
              <p>PINCH is a highly conserved protein composed of 5 double zinc-finger domains and has no reported catalytic activity <xref rid="pone.0058232-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. PINCH is a key component in the formation of multi-protein complexes and facilitates cell spreading, migration and survival. Although mammals have two PINCH proteins, 1 and 2, PINCH1 knockout is embryonic lethal, whereas PINCH2 knockout has no apparent consequences <xref rid="pone.0058232-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0058232-Chiswell1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. PINCH1 and 2 share approximately 82% homology, are encoded by different genes and in some studies, a partial compensation of PINCH1 and 2 for one another is reported in later stages of development <xref rid="pone.0058232-Liang1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. One of PINCH's most studied binding partners, integrin linked kinase (ILK), has been shown to interfere with GSK3-β-mediated Tau phosphorylation and, in some systems, ILK's activity is dependent on its binding to PINCH <xref rid="pone.0058232-Ishii1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Our data suggest that PINCH1 acts as a key component in the CHIP/hp-Tau complex and is important for neuronal response to stressors that activate the HSR.</p>

                <title>Induction of PINCH, Tau hyperphosphorylation and the Heat Shock Response <italic>in vitro</italic>
</title>
                <p>We reported increased PINCH protein levels in HIV-infected patients' brains in neurons showing a loss of synaptodendritic proteins and in neurons exposed <italic>in vitro</italic> to TNF-α or to the HIV protein Tat <xref rid="pone.0058232-Rearden1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0058232-Jatiani1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Apart from these observations, the role(s) that PINCH may play in neuronal signaling during CNS disease have not been addressed. To investigate the potential function of PINCH in neurons during CNS disease and to identify new PINCH protein-protein interactions, we conducted mass spectrometric analyses on neurons exposed to TNF-α <italic>in vitro</italic>. After exposure to TNF-α for 72 h and immunoprecipitation with anti-PINCH antibody, bands from the eluted fractions were analyzed. Along with the expected hits, such as ILK and Nck-2, other top hits included microtubule-associated binding proteins and heat shock protein response (HSR)-related proteins that are involved in the clearance of abnormal cellular proteins (data not shown).</p>
                <p>Neuronal response to HIV infection and AD involve heat shock proteins and changes in the microtubule-associated protein, Tau's phosphorylation state and its association with microtubules. To confirm the predicted involvement of HSR proteins, human neuronal cells were exposed to TNF-α, supernatant from HIV-infected PBMCs or cell-free virus and changes in levels of proteins were assessed. As previously reported, PINCH increased significantly in response to TNF-α <xref rid="pone.0058232-Jatiani1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> and these changes were accompanied by increased hp-Tau (*p&lt;0.005) and CHIP (**p&lt;0.001) protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0058232-g001">Figure 1A, B</xref>). Significantly more Tau was hyperphosphorylated in the TNF-α treated neurons (p = 0.0293) compared to the untreated neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0058232-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). No changes were observed in levels of Hsp90 or Hsp70 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0058232-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Neurons exposed to media from uninfected PBMCs showed low levels of PINCH and hp-Tau, whereas, exposure to supernatant from HIV-infected PBMCs increased PINCH, hp-Tau and CHIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0058232-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). As determined by ELISA, TNF-α levels in media from HIV-infected PBMCs ranged from 300–400 pg/ml at 4 days post- infection, ∼100 pg/ml in uninfected PBMC media, and was undetectable in media from cell-free virus or control media. Since neurons <italic>in vitro</italic> were exposed to 50–100 ng/ml TNF-α, it is likely that factors in addition to TNF-α are involved in PINCH induction. Increased hp-Tau was observed in neurons exposed to media from uninfected PBMCs, HIV-infected PBMCs and media containing cell-free HIV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0058232-g002">Figure 2A, B</xref>). Given that cell-free virus did not induce PINCH expression, our results suggest different mechanisms influence the generation of hp-Tau and PINCH in this scenario.</p>

                <p>To confirm mass spectrometric analyses results, immunoprecipitation experiments were conducted with lysate from neurons exposed to TNF-α. Immunoprecipitation of neuronal lysate with anti-PINCH antibody and Western analyses with anti-Tau (AT100) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0058232-g003">Figure 3A</xref>, arrows) and with AT8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0058232-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, arrows) indicated multiple hp-Tau immunoreactive bands phosphorylated at residues associated with PHF formation. Tau immunoreactive bands are detected both above and below the heavy chain (arrows). It is unclear whether Tau-immunoreactive bands exist corresponding to ∼50 kDa due to heavy chain cross-reactivity. Immunoprecipitation with the anti-Tau antibody (AT8) revealed two PINCH immunoreactive bands at approximately 37 kDa and 42 kDa, confirming the interaction of hp-Tau with PINCH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0058232-g003">Figure 3C</xref>, arrows).

                <p>To determine which region(s) of PINCH interact with Tau, five LIMS-specific deletion mutants were generated, each lacking one of the five LIM domains. Neurons were transfected with plasmids expressing full-length PINCH, or each of the five deletion mutants: ΔLIMS 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5. Lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody to capture only exogenously expressed PINCH and reacted with anti-Tau antibody. In the lysate from full-length PINCH expression, two bands are visualized at approximately 80 and 50 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0058232-g004">Figure 4A</xref>, arrows). No anti-Tau immunoreactive bands are present in the ΔLIM1 expressing lane and only a faint band is detected in the ΔLIM2 lane, suggesting that PINCH LIMS 1 and 2 are important for Tau interaction. Lysates from ΔLIMS 3, 4, 5 show clear immunoreactive bands with Tau indicating that these LIM domains are not involved in Tau interaction.

                <p>Our <italic>in vitro</italic> data in neuroblastoma cells show that PINCH and hp-Tau interact during the HSR upon treatments that induce hyperphosphorylation of Tau. Thus, to assess the relevance of these data to human disease, we assessed levels of soluble hp-Tau and PINCH in post-mortem brain tissue from normal controls, AD and HIVE patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0058232-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). PINCH is detected as a doublet at approximately 37 and 42 kDa (reminiscent of bands in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0058232-g003">Figure 3C</xref>), and compared to control, PINCH levels are increased in AD and HIVE, with a trend towards increased levels in more severe AD (compare Braak stages 1, 3, 5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0058232-g006">Figure 6A, B</xref>). Total Tau levels are similar in all cases. Since our <italic>in vitro</italic> data also showed that PINCH interacts with heat shock factors, double immunofluorescence labeling of brain tissue from a representative AD patient (Braak stage 3) was conducted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0058232-g006">Figure 6C–G</xref>). Confocal imaging suggested PINCH/hp-Tau co-localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0058232-g006">Figure 6C</xref>, arrows, arrowheads and asterisks). Higher magnification suggested PINCH co-localization with hp-Tau (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0058232-g006">Figure 6D</xref>, arrowhead), Hsp70 (6E, arrowhead) and CHIP (6F, arrowhead), but not with Hsp90 (6G). Immunoprecipitation of tissue lysate from an AD patient's brain supported the interaction of PINCH with hpTau as shown by two immunoreactive bands at approximately 55–60 kDa, 42 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0058232-g006">Figure 6H</xref>, arrows) and a weaker band at 82 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0058232-g005">Figure 5H</xref>, arrowhead).</p>

                <p>Further support for the interaction of hp-Tau and PINCH in diseases with a pathological component of hp-Tau was shown by significantly increased PINCH expression in the brain of the P301S human Tau transgenic mouse (Tau-Tg). Western analyses of different brain regions from the Tau-Tg mouse indicated increased soluble hp-Tau and PINCH in all regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0058232-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). Likewise, double-immunolabeling of hippocampal tissue indicated that in the P301S human Tau transgenic mouse, PINCH and hp-Tau were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0058232-g007">Figure 7C</xref>); whereas, in the control, immunoreactivity was not detected for either protein (Figure, 7B). As observed in AD and HIVE patients' brains, PINCH and hp-Tau appeared to co-localize in the neurons of the Tau transgenic mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0058232-g007">Figure 7C</xref>, arrowhead). Our results support numerous reports that hp-Tau levels increase in AD, HIVE and in the human-Tau transgenic mouse, and we now show that hp-Tau accumulation is accompanied by increased PINCH expression. These findings provide evidence for a possible role for PINCH in HIVE that intersects with neuropathological processes in AD.</p>

                <title>Changes in PINCH accompany decreased hp-Tau solubility</title>
                <p>Upon hyperphosphorylation of Tau, the accumulation of PHF and NFT are accompanied by loss of hp-Tau solubility. To determine expression levels and solubility of PINCH during loss of Tau solubility in disease, brain tissues from normal control, AD, HIVE and FTD patients were processed to separate proteins into different fractions based on solubility, with the RAB (RB) fraction being soluble, RIPA (RP) less soluble and the formic acid fraction (FA), insoluble (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0058232-g008">Figure 8A</xref>). As expected, in brain tissue from a normal control case, low levels of PINCH were detected in the RAB preparation containing soluble proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0058232-g008">Figure 8A</xref>). Low levels of hp-Tau were also detected in the RAB and RIPA fractions, with the majority of total Tau present in the highly soluble RAB fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0058232-g008">Figure 8A</xref>), confirming that most of phosphorylated Tau in patients without tauopathy is highly soluble. These results show that in patients suffering from neurodegenerative diseases with a tauopathy component, PINCH is increased and binds to hp-Tau. In AD, HIVE and FTD cases, PINCH is also detected at approximately 37 and 42 kDa in both the RAB and RIPA fractions, indicting that PINCH loses solubility in disease. In the Braak stage 5 case a faint PINCH band at 37 kDa is visible in the FA fraction supporting that PINCH may lose solubility in more severe disease stages.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Tau-related neurodegeneration is likely due to a combination of loss of normal function and gain of toxic function, and multiple factors contribute to both processes. Many reports link hp-Tau accumulation with induction of the HSR and several heat shock factors have been proposed as potential therapeutic targets for more efficient clearance of abnormal Tau <xref rid="pone.0058232-Voss1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0058232-Luo3" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0058232-Deture1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. The biological significance of PINCH expression during hp-Tau accumulation appears to relate to the cell's ability to clear hp-Tau. Our data show that during OA-mediated induction of Tau hyperphosphorylation, the absence of PINCH protein results in lower levels of hp-Tau. Possible explanations for the detection of less hp-Tau include the generation of less hp-Tau in response to OA, more efficient clearance of hp-Tau, or both <xref rid="pone.0058232-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Given that in some systems PINCH is required for proper ILK functioning <xref rid="pone.0058232-Ito1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0058232-Tu1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0058232-Xu1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref> and that ILK controls Tau phosphorylation via regulation of GSK-3β <xref rid="pone.0058232-Ishii1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, it is possible that silencing PINCH may impact the phosphorylation levels of Tau. On the other hand, PINCH was shown to interact with the ubiquitin E3 ligase, CHIP, and with hp-Tau and changes in this dynamic in the absence of PINCH may result in increased ubiquitination of hp-Tau. Further studies are required to address both of these possibilities.</p>
              <p>Members of the HSR machinery are not only important in chaperoning aberrant proteins to the UPS for degradation, but some factors, such as Hsp90, play critical roles in promoting stability of abnormal proteins and their accumulation inside the cell <xref rid="pone.0058232-Luo3" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. In fact, 2007 studies from Luo <italic>et al.</italic> describe Hsp90 as being a link between neurodegeneration and cancer <xref rid="pone.0058232-Luo1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. In these studies, inhibition of Hsp90 with 17AAG and PU24FCI, in both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> models of tauopathy, resulted in clearance of aggregated Tau <xref rid="pone.0058232-Luo1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. In this context, PINCH has been shown to play an important role in cell survival in cancer by conferring resistance to apoptosis via the ERK-Bim pathway <xref rid="pone.0058232-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. In fact, PINCH expression levels are significantly greater in many types of cancers, and in rectal cancer PINCH is an independent prognostic marker for worse outcome <xref rid="pone.0058232-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0058232-Holmqvist1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. In our studies, levels of Hsp90 were not altered by TNF-α, OA treatment, or by silencing PINCH1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0058232-g001">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0058232-g004">4</xref>). Likewise, neither PINCH nor hp-Tau was observed to interact with Hsp90 upon immunoprecipitation and Western analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0058232-g003">Figure 3</xref>). On the other hand, levels of CHIP were increased, and both PINCH and hp-Tau interacted with CHIP suggesting that the effects observed in this system may involve CHIP. However, the attachment of Hsp90 to its substrate is cyclic and its activity is ATP-dependent. Thus, our results may not be representative of all Hsp90 binding events that may have occurred and may not have captured changes in Hsp90 levels or its interactions with client proteins. Taken together, our data confirm an important role for PINCH in the HSR during accumulation of hp-Tau in AD, HIVE and FTD and in the human Tau transgenic mouse. Our <italic>in vitro</italic> data indicate that PINCH and Tau interact and that the first and second LIM domains of PINCH1 are important for this interaction. Silencing PINCH results in the detection of less hp-Tau in response to OA treatment, suggesting that PINCH may act to stabilize abnormal Tau or play a role in Tau hyperphosphorylation. Future confirmatory studies are required to elucidate the mechanism(s) through which PINCH is involved in hp-Tau formation and/or clearance.</p>
