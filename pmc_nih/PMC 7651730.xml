                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Approximately one million undiagnosed persons living with HIV in Southern and Eastern Africa need to test for HIV. Novel approaches are necessary to identify HIV testing options that match the heterogeneous testing preferences of high-risk populations. This pragmatic randomised controlled trial (PRCT) will evaluate the efficacy of a preference-informed, heterogeneity-focused HIV counselling and testing (HCT) offer, for improving rates of HIV testing in two high-risk populations.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>The study will be conducted in Moshi, Tanzania. The PRCT will randomise 600 female barworkers and 600 male Kilimanjaro mountain porters across three study arms. All participants will receive an HIV testing offer comprised of four preference-informed testing options, including one âcommonâ optionâcomprising features that are commonly available in the area and, on average, most preferred among study participantsâand three options that are specific to the study arm. Options will be identified using mixed logit and latent class analyses of data from a discrete choice experiment (DCE). Participants in Arm 1 will be offered the common option and three âtargetedâ options that are predicted to be more preferred than the common option and combine features widely available in the study area. Participants in Arm 2 will be offered the common option and three âenhancedâ options, which also include HCT features that are not yet widely available in the study area. Participants in Arm 3, an active control arm, will be offered the common option and three predicted âless preferredâ options. The primary outcome will be uptake of HIV testing.</p>

                  <title>Ethics and dissemination</title>
                  <p>Ethical approval was obtained from the Duke University Health System IRB, the University of South Carolina IRB, the Ethics Review Committee at Kilimanjaro Christian Medical University College, Tanzaniaâs National Institute for Medical Research, and the Tanzania Food &amp; Drugs Authority (now Tanzania Medicines &amp; Medical Devices Authority). Findings will be published in peer-reviewed journals. The use of rigorous DCE methods for the preference-based design and tailoring of interventions could lead to novel policy options and implementation science approaches.</p>

              <p>In 2018, 37.9 million people were living with HIV worldwide, and 770â000 died of HIV-related illnesses.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> HIV counselling and testing (HCT) is a cost-effective intervention for increasing HIV serostatus awareness,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 3</xref> a point of entry into HIV care and treatment, and an important means of primary and secondary HIV prevention.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> HIV Prevention Trials Network Protocol 052 conclusively demonstrated a marked reduction in HIV transmission among serodiscordant couples in which the HIV-infected partner was begun on antiretroviral therapy early in the course of infection.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Subsequently, public health officials and policymakers, considering treatment as prevention, have called for dramatic increases in HIV testingâas frequently as annually in many populations and semiannually among individuals at high risk.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p>
              <p>In 2014, the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) set for 2020 the ambitious 90-90-90 target: diagnosing 90% of all persons living with HIV (PLWH), initiating treatment for 90% of those diagnosed, and achieving viral suppression for 90% of those treated.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> While substantial progress has been made towards these targets since 2014, most countries remain short of at least one target, and the number of undiagnosed HIV infections in every region are considered a major hindrance to achieving the UNAIDS targets and ending the epidemic.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Novel approaches are needed to increase testing uptake, especially among high-risk groups.</p>
              <p>In order to establish the diagnosis of HIV in 90% of all PLWH in Eastern and Southern Africa, more than 1âmillion undiagnosed infected persons need to test, including 190â000 in Tanzania.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 6 9</xref> Tanzaniaâs 2017â2022 Health Sector HIV and AIDS Strategic Plan (HSHSP-IV) lists as a key challenge that HIV testing services âneed to be more efficient and ambitious to meet the 90-90-90 targets through more targeted testing approaches.â<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Evaluations of population preferences for testing have typically focused on the acceptability of specific testing options, such as home-based,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11â13</xref> provider-initiated,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14â17</xref> or workplace testing,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18 19</xref> usually without consideration or offer of other options. Results from these narrow assessments do not probe the potential diversity in testing preferences among target populations and cannot characterise which testing options will maximise uptake of testing.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20â22</xref></p>
              <p>Discrete choice experiments (DCEs), grounded in the economic theory of utility maximisation, are specifically designed to provide information about individualsâ preferences for varying characteristics of multiattribute products. The DCE method is based on the assumption that a product or service such as HCT can be described in terms of its characteristics, namely attributes and levels within attributes. Participants are repeatedly asked to choose between two or more alternatives in choice scenarios simulating real choice decisions. Each alternative differs in the arrangement of attribute levels presented to the participant. The choice scenarios are systematically varied by means of an experimental design.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23â26</xref> Relative attribute importance, the utility that respondents derive from the diverse options, and trade-offs, that is, the willingness to trade between attribute levels, can be quantified analytically.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> DCEs are used increasingly to understand patient perspectives and to design patient-centred interventions. Although DCEs have been used in various contexts related to HIV, including testing,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20 28â32</xref> prevention,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33â36</xref> service delivery,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37â39</xref> and treatment,<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40â44</xref> to our knowledge, DCEs have not yet been used to systematically design HCT interventions.</p>
              <p>Below, we describe the study protocol for a pragmatic randomised controlled trial (PRCT) that evaluates the efficacy of a targeted, preference-informed HCT offer for improving rates of HIV testing in high-risk populations. The testing offer is developed using data from a DCE and designed to match the heterogeneous HIV testing preferences in the target population. To our knowledge, this is the first PRCT in which the study conditions are optimised using data from a DCE, and the first PRCT that evaluates an intervention explicitly targeting preference heterogeneity.</p>

                <p>Phase D is a PRCT that includes three parallel study arms (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>). All participants will receive an HIV testing offer comprised of four invitation cards describing preference-informed HIV testing options. Participants will be asked to test for HIV using their individually most preferred of the four testing options given to them. Options will be identified using mixed logit and latent class analyses of data from a DCE with members of the target populations (see below). Arm 1 participants will be offered the common option and three âtargetedâ options, predicted to be jointly more preferred than the common option and comprising testing features widely available in the study area. Arm 2 participants will be offered the common option and three âenhancedâ options, which are also predicted to be jointly more preferred than the common option but include additional features that are not yet widely available in the study area. Arm 3 participants will be offered the common option and three options that are jointly predicted to be âless preferredâ than the common option. In other words, for arm 3 participants, the common option is the predicted most preferred of the four options; the other three options, on average, provide no additional value. Arms 1 and 2 are intervention arms. Arm 3 represents an active control arm: study involvement in Arm 3 is the same as in Arms 1 and 2. Four weeks (28 days) after the beginning of Phase D, participants will be sent an SMS reminder to test for HIV using any of the testing options given to them. The purpose of this study phase is to obtain estimates of the effect of a heterogeneity-focused HIV testing offer on rates of HIV testing.

                  <p>The design decision to offer three targeted, enhanced, and less preferred options was driven by practical considerations: (1) a choice from four alternatives (the common option plus three options specific to the study arm) is expected to be cognitively feasible for participants, (2) the implementation of 10 testing options (one common option, plus three targeted, three enhanced and three less preferred options) as part of this study is feasible from a logistical and budgetary perspective, and (3) the widespread implementation of three testing options that target preference heterogeneity is feasible in the study area. The statistical analysis of the DCE data (see below) will determine whether the testing offers differ between FBW and KMP.</p>

                  <title>Development and fielding of the DCE</title>
                  <p>A DCE with 300 FBW and 300 KMP recruited prior to the PRCT will characterise the patterns and variability in HIV testing preferences in the target population. The DCE development will follow guidelines and procedures established in our prior studies of HIV testing preferences.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21 23 49</xref> Focus group discussions with members of the target populations will be used to prioritise HIV testing features with respect to their expected influence on HIV testing decisions and to establish levels of features that represent plausible trade-offs in actual or hypothetical HIV testing interventions. Reconciling prior qualitative work<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> with the objectives of the PRCT, the DCE is expected to include feasible attributes and levels across three domains: privacy and confidentiality (eg, testing venue, different types of counselling), accessibility and value (testing availability, additional services provided) and perceived quality and accuracy (eg, type of sample for the HIV test).</p>
                  <p>In the DCE survey, respondents will be introduced to each attribute and level and asked to complete 12â16 choice tasks. Each choice task will include three hypothetical testing options; participants will be asked to identify their preferred alternative. The combination of alternatives presented to respondents as part of the DCE will be varied according to a d-efficient statistical design,<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> generated in Ngene software (ChoiceMetrics). Survey content and presentation will be tested in up to 40 guided individual pretest interviews. Pilot studies with at least 200 participants will yield statistical priors that inform the statistical design of the final DCE. DCE surveys will be administered in-person, in Kiswahili, using tablet devices, by trained research staff using the custom-built survey software, comet (Selway Labs).</p>
                  <p>Continuous recruitment and enrolment may result in overlap between DCE survey respondents and PRCT participants. All PRCT participants will complete the DCE survey to allow for comparisons of stated preferences (DCE survey responses) and revealed preferences (testing decisions).</p>

                  <title>Analysis of DCE data</title>
                  <p>The analysis of DCE data will follow established guidelines.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23 49</xref> To estimate mean (average) preferences in the study population, DCE data will be first analysed in Stata (StataCorp) using mixed, or random parameters, logit models,<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> which are commonly used for analysing DCE data,<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> but focus on average preferences. To model systematic variation in preferences across respondents, a random effects latent class logit (RELCL) model will be estimated in Latent Gold Choice V.5.0 (Statistical Innovations 2018). RELCL models allow for the joint modelling of systematic variation in preferences (latent classes) and random variation in preferences (random effects) across respondents.<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref> The Bayesian Information Criterion will be used to identify which model yields the best fit for the data.</p>
                  <p>To evaluate whether the distribution of preferences differs significantly between the two groups of participants (FBW versus KMP), participant type will be included in the model as a covariate. If the distributions of preferences differ significantly across groups, separate preference-informed testing options may need to be identified for FBW and KMP. On the other hand, if the preference distributions are broadly similar, the testing offer can be optimised for the joint preferences of both populations.</p>

                  <title>Targeted, enhanced and less-preferred options</title>
                  <p>The latent class analysis will identify statistical groupings of individuals with similar sets of preferences; these groupings are referred to as classes. Using parameter estimates from the latent class model, we will predict class-specific relative preferences for all feasible combinations of feature levels (ie, testing options), which, in turn, will be converted into predicted choice probabilities in a simulated choice between the respective testing option and the âcommon optionâ. Class-specific predicted choice probabilities will be aggregated across classes (taking into consideration the estimated class sizes) to calculate the share of the population predicted to prefer each testing option over the common option. These shares are used, as follows, to generate population-based rankings of all feasible combinations of three testing options. For targeted options, we will select from all options that combine features currently available in the study area the three options that jointly maximise the share of participants predicted to choose at least one of those three targeted options over the common option. Similarly, for enhanced options, we will select from all options that include additional features not yet widely available in the study area the three options that jointly maximise the share of participants predicted to choose at least one of those three enhanced options over the common option. For less preferred options, we will select the three options that jointly maximise the share of participants predicted to prefer the common option over all less preferred options.</p>

Each participant will be given four cards; each card will describe the characteristics of the testing option in a format similar to that presented in the DCE. The combination of cards given to a participant will be determined by the study arm assigned to the participant; references to specific testing venues may be varied according to participantsâ location of residence or preferred testing venue. Cards will have unique codes that allow for the tracking of participantsâ testing uptake across testing venues in the study area.</p>

                <title>Recruitment</title>
                <p>Participants for formative work will be recruited using convenience and snowball sampling. For DCE surveys and the PRCT, the goal is to employ a systematic recruitment approach that minimises biases. Mountain porters will be recruited from the Mweka gate of Kilimanjaro National Park. The Mweka gate is selected because of its proximity to Moshi (~15 km); four of six popular climbing routes descend through this gate. Porters exiting the gate will be approached sequentially, and eligible porters will be handed an invitation card containing contact information and an invitation to the studyâs research office for consent and enrolment. For the recruitment of female barworkers, bars will be randomised and visited in the order of randomisation. Eligible FBW will be consented at their place of work or given invitation cards containing contact information and an invitation to the studyâs research office for consent and enrolment. Recruited participants may receive reminder phone calls or SMS messages to come to the study offices for more information and study enrolment.</p>

                <title>Enrolment and informed consent</title>
                <p>Eligible individuals contacted for participation in the study will be informed by trained study personnel of the study purpose, procedures, risks, and benefits during the informed consent process. Only consenting individuals will be included in the study. Study participantsâ mobile phone numbers and the name and phone number of a contact person through whom they can be reached will be recorded to allow for phone-based follow-up.</p>
                <p>Enrolment into the trial will be conducted in three sequential stages. Approximately half the participants will be enrolled into Phase A and one quarter each into Phases C and D. This approach ensures variation in the exposure to pre-PRCT intervention components across participants, thereby allowing for the estimation of potential ordering effects as participants move through the different study phases. The staggered enrolment also ensures a better alignment of study timelines for Phases D and E across participants.</p>

Delays in reaching participants by phone and delays in participants returning to study offices will extend the duration of follow-up. In order to minimise loss to follow-up prior to the PRCT and reduce variability in the timing of the PRCT across participants, all participants in Phases A, B or C who are 91 or more days late for a follow-up assessment will transition to Phase D during their next in-person visit. Additionally, participants may be directly enrolled into Phases C and D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>). Study enrolment will continue until the target number of n=1200 participants in the PRCT (Phase D) has been reached. Follow-up will continue until 6 months after the last participant enters Phase D.</p>

                <p>The primary analysis involves the comparison of testing rates between study arms in Phase D. The effect of the interventionâa preference-informed, heterogeneity-focused, HIV testing offerâwill be described by differences in testing uptake between those offered targeted or enhanced options, relative to those offered predicted less preferred options. Statistical significance will be evaluated in a bivariate analysis using a Ï<sup>2</sup> test. Logistic regression analysis will evaluate the statistical significance of differences in a multivariate framework. Uptake of HIV testing within 3 months of the beginning of Phase D will be the binary outcome variable; study arm will be the key explanatory variable. Systematic variation in the efficacy of the intervention, for example, by gender or with HIV risk, can be modelled using interactions between study arm and the respective covariates.</p>
                <p>Survival models with up to five observations per participant (one each for Phases A, B, C, D and E) will be used to estimate the differential effects of study arm assignment, SMS reminders, invitations, and conditional financial incentives, on rates of HIV testing. The time until an HIV test following the beginning of the respective study phase constitutes the dependent variable. âExposureâ to SMS reminders, invitations, and a financial incentive are hypothesised to increase the âhazardâ of testing relative to no intervention. To control for potential ordering effects, participants exposure to intervention components in prior study phases (Phase B and C SMS reminders, Phase C testing offer, recent testing uptake) will be included as covariates.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>This study will evaluate whether an HIV testing intervention, which is uniquely designed using data from a DCE and explicitly targets preference heterogeneity, will improve testing uptake. If testing rates differ between study arms, the results will support our hypothesis that DCE-derived preference data can be used to systematically design HIV testing interventions that target heterogeneous preferences among and within high-risk populations and that offering such interventions will increase testing uptake in target populations. With novel approaches to testing urgently needed to reach the 90-90-90 targets, the DCE and targeted methods used in this study may be broadly used to develop cost-effective testing offers that match the preferences of high-risk populations across diverse settings.</p>
              <p>To our knowledge, this is the first PRCT in which the intervention conditions are designed using data from a DCE, and the first PRCT that evaluates an intervention explicitly targeting preference heterogeneity. If successful, the methods used to understand how different groups of users value key characteristics of a health intervention can readily be applied to other settings in which interventions are being developed or adapted to optimise their efficacy. This work may demonstrate the utility of DCEs as a tool in implementation research to replace the costly practice of iteratively evaluating narrowly focused interventions. Thus, even as we apply this approach to the specific area of HIV testing, the study has potential to significantly advance the fields of patient-oriented research and implementation science. The methods could be used to develop new approaches to adapt effective interventions to local contexts, by informing a priori which interventions should be rolled out, and with which modifications, in order to maximise uptake across different populations and subpopulations.</p>
              <p>Our study design and implementation approach have several unique components. First, the implementation of the study, in collaboration with all HCT providers in the study area, allows for the evaluation of testing uptake in a nearly closed system. Second, the use of an automated mHealth system to send large numbers of SMS messages according to prespecified algorithms reduces both error potential and cost. Third, the similarity between hypothetical choice scenarios presented in the DCE and actual HIV testing options given to participants allows for explicit comparisons between stated and revealed preferences. Fourth, the study design allows for separate estimates of the effects of reminder SMS, the issuance of HIV testing invitation cards and an incentive offer, on HIV testing rates. Finally, the approach for identifying the targeted, enhanced and less-preferred options is not contingent on the use of RELCL analysis and proprietary software; instead, it can be approximated using open source alternatives for example, in R. In a sensitivity analysis, we will evaluate the effect of specific model assumptions on the selection of testing options for the PRCT.</p>
              <p>The study is subject to several limitations. First, feasibility considerations limit the study area to include only HCT facilities in Moshi municipality. While coded invitation cards collected from all HCT providers offer definitive evidence of a completed HIV test, participants may test without invitation cards and may test outside the study area. Sensitivity analyses will characterise the effect of using only provider-documented testing uptake (primary outcome) versus provider-documented or self-reported testing uptake (secondary outcome) on estimates.</p>
              <p>Second, the preference estimates from the DCE, preference informed testing options, and estimated effect sizes are not generalisable to other high-risk groups in Tanzania or other parts of Africa. However, if this study is successful, it will support the broader use of stated preference methods to systematically elicit the preferences of key populations and facilitate corresponding adaptations to HIV testing options. We acknowledge that study eligibility criteria include literacy, and study procedures involve phone-based and SMS-based contact with participants. While literacy in the region was 96% in 2012 and, in 2017, 93% of urban households had a mobile phone<xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62 63</xref> the exclusion of illiterate persons and limited mobile phone access may influence the results. It is also possible that individuals who are likely to move (and thus may not be enrolled or are lost to follow-up) may have different preferences and opportunities for HIV testing.</p>
              <p>Third, participantsâ progression through multiple study phases may influence testing uptake in the PRCT. Ideally, all tangential intervention components (SMS reminders, invitation cards, incentives) could be evaluated alongside the preference-informed HIV testing offer as part of a multiarm RCT; however, the sample size required for such a trial is not feasible. A multistage enrolment approach and the inclusion of variables describing participantsâ exposure to SMS reminders, testing offers and HIV tests in prior study phases as covariates allow us to estimate the direction and magnitude of such ordering effects on uptake. In our study, we will not be able to estimate an unconditional effect of incentives on HIV testing uptake, as concurrent incentivised and non-incentivised testing offers were not considered viable among potentially closely knit community members (eg, barworkers in the same bar, porters climbing together).</p>
              <p>Finally, DCE surveys contain a limited set of testing characteristics; the finite range of attributes and levels is a limitation of DCEs in general. Preference-relevant and choice-relevant testing characteristics may differ in other settings, and changes in the testing environment and available testing options may occur during the study period. While adaptations to the preference survey and analysis of DCE data may be necessary and require technical expertise, such costs are expected to be far smaller than costs associated with large-scale, iterative trials of potentially ineffective HCT testing interventions.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, this study evaluates the critical link between preference-based intervention design and efficacy. If the PRCT indicates that a preference-informed, heterogeneity-focused HCT offer increases testing rates, the testing options evaluated in this study can be offered to high-risk populations in the study area, and the preference elicitation method and tools can be used to inform the design of testing options that better match the preferences of other high-risk populations, both locally and in other settings.</p>
