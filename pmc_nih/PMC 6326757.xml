              <abstract>
                <p>A functional HIV cure requires immune reconstitution for lasting viremia control. A major immune dysfunction persisting in HIV infection is the impairment of T helper cell migration and homing to lymphoid tissues such as GALTs (gut-associated lymphoid tissues). ART (antiretroviral therapy) does not fully restore T cell motility for tissue repopulation. The molecular mechanism dictating this persistent T cell dysfunction is not understood. Cofilin is an actin-depolymerizing factor that regulates actin dynamics for T cell migration. Here, we demonstrate that blood CD4 T cells from HIV-infected patients (<italic>n</italic> = 193), with or without ART, exhibit significantly lower levels of cofilin phosphorylation (hyperactivation) than those from healthy controls (<italic>n</italic> = 100; ratio, 1.1:2.3; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001); cofilin hyperactivation is also associated with poor CD4 T cell recovery following ART. These results suggest an HIV-mediated systemic dysregulation of T cell motility that cannot be repaired solely by ART. We further demonstrate that stimulating blood CD4 T cells with an anti–human α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> integrin antibody can trigger signal transduction and modulate the cofilin pathway, partially restoring T cell motility in vitro<italic>.</italic> However, we also observed that severe T cell motility defect caused by high degrees of cofilin hyperactivation was not repairable by the anti-integrin antibody, demonstrating a mechanistic hindrance to restore immune functions in vivo. Our study suggests that cofilin is a key molecule that may need to be therapeutically targeted early for T cell tissue repopulation, immune reconstitution, and immune control of viremia.</p>

              <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
              <p>Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has significantly extended the life span of HIV-infected patients, but it offers neither a cure nor full immune restoration. The natural course of HIV infection leads to multiple CD4 T cell defects (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><italic>1</italic></xref>), including the impairment of T cell migration and homing to lymphoid tissues such as GALTs (gut-associated lymphoid tissues) (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><italic>2</italic></xref><italic>-</italic><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr"><italic>4</italic></xref>). Even with near-complete viral suppression with ART, normal levels of CD4 T cell repopulation to lymphoid tissues are rarely achieved (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><italic>2</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr"><italic>3</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr"><italic>5</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr"><italic>6</italic></xref>), thereby dampening immune responses and preventing full immune reconstitution for lasting viremia control (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr"><italic>7</italic></xref>). In HIV-infected patients, the vast majority of circulating CD4 T cells are not HIV infected (0.2 to 16.4 HIV<sup>+</sup> cells per million) (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr"><italic>8</italic></xref>). Thus, the T cell migratory defect seen in patients likely results from a bystander effect from chronic signaling by viral (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr"><italic>9</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr"><italic>10</italic></xref>) and/or inflammatory factors (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><italic>1</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><italic>2</italic></xref>). However, the molecular mechanism dictating this persistent T cell dysfunction has not been fully elucidated. This has hindered the development of an effective therapy to restore T cell functions and to achieve persistent immune control of HIV.</p>
              <p>In the human immune system, T cell activity is mainly regulated by receptor signaling. Persistent signaling through cytokine or chemokine receptors frequently leads to T cell polarization and commitment to distinct lineages such as T helper cell 1 (T<sub>H</sub>1) and T<sub>H</sub>2. In HIV infection, the virus infects T cells through gp120 binding to CD4 and the chemokine coreceptor CXCR4 (X4) or CCR5 (R5) (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr"><italic>11</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr"><italic>12</italic></xref>). This binding also initiates aberrant signaling and may have pathogenic consequences (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr"><italic>9</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr"><italic>10</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr"><italic>13</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr"><italic>14</italic></xref>). In particular, HIV signaling through CXCR4 has been shown to activate an actin depolymerizing factor, cofilin, to promote the actin dynamics necessary for viral nuclear entry in blood resting CD4 T cells (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr"><italic>9</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr"><italic>15</italic></xref>).</p>
              <p>Cofilin is an actin-binding protein that binds and depolymerizes filamentous actin (F-actin) to regulate actin treadmilling (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr"><italic>16</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr"><italic>17</italic></xref>), a process in which monomeric actin (G-actin) is incorporated into F-actin at the (+) end and then dissociated from the (−) end. Cofilin-regulated actin treadmilling is the driving force in T cell motility and T cell migration to lymphoid tissues (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr"><italic>18</italic></xref>). Given that cofilin is a major part of the motility engine in T cells, we hypothesized that the T cell migratory defects seen in HIV-infected patients may directly result from cofilin dysregulation by persistent, pathogenic signaling occurring during HIV infection (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr"><italic>19</italic></xref>). Here, we examined cofilin phosphorylation in the peripheral resting CD4 T cells of HIV-infected patients in a large clinical study. Cofilin activity is regulated by cycles of serine 3 phosphorylation and dephosphorylation that control cofilin binding to F-actin for actin severing and depolymerization (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr"><italic>16</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr"><italic>17</italic></xref>). We confirmed that blood CD4 T cells from HIV-infected patients exhibit significantly lower levels of cofilin phosphorylation (hyperactivation) than those from healthy controls. These results suggest a systemic cofilin-regulated T cell migratory impairment that needs to be therapeutically repaired for T cell tissue repopulation.</p>
              <p>Integrins, such as the α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> integrin, play an important role in T cell tissue repopulation. Integrins are transmembrane receptors that mediate cell–extracellular matrix and cell-cell interactions to facilitate T cell trafficking and homing to tissues (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr"><italic>20</italic></xref>). This homing process involves synergistic, bidirectional signaling with chemokine receptors (inside-out and outside-in signaling) (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr"><italic>21</italic></xref>): Stimulation of chemokine receptors triggers chemotactic signaling that leads to the assembly of an intracellular complex connecting integrins to the actin cytoskeletons for integrin activation (inside-out signaling), while binding of active integrins to ligands can trigger further signals that lead to actin cytoskeletal rearrangement for cell spreading, retraction, and migration (outside-in signaling). Given the central role of cofilin in regulating actin cytoskeletal rearrangement, we tested whether stimulating the α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> integrin triggers synergistic outside-in signaling to modulate the cofilin pathway for repairing the T cell motility defect. Here, we demonstrate that stimulating α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> with an anti–α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> integrin antibody partially promotes CD4 T cell motility by modulating the cofilin pathway. Our results identify cofilin as a key molecule that may be therapeutically targeted to restore T cell motility necessary for T cell tissue repopulation, immune reconstitution, and immune control of viremia.</p>

                <title>Cofilin activation through HIV gp120-CCR5 signaling</title>
                <p>HIV binding to CXCR4 has been shown to activate cofilin to promote actin dynamics for viral nuclear entry (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr"><italic>9</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr"><italic>15</italic></xref>). We investigated whether HIV-mediated CCR5 signaling can also lead to cofilin activation in blood CD4 T cells. In contrast to X4 viruses, which infect both memory and naïve CD4 T cells, R5 viruses infect a subpopulation of memory CD4 T cells (fig. S1A), leading to their early depletion in the gut and chronic immune activation (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr"><italic>22</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr"><italic>23</italic></xref>). We quantified the CCR5 receptor on blood resting memory CD4 T cells and found that approximately 30% of resting memory CD4 T cells displayed the receptor on the surface (fig. S1B). To determine R5 HIV-mediated cofilin activation, we stimulated blood resting memory CD4 T cells with an R5 virus, HIV(AD8), or an R5 HIV envelope protein, gp120(BAL). As a control, we similarly stimulated blood resting CD4 T with an X4-tropic gp120 (IIIB). We observed cofilin activation by both the X4-tropic gp120 (IIIB) and the R5-tropic gp120(BAL), as well as HIV(AD8) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, A to C</xref>); this R5 HIV-mediated cofilin activation is also mediated through Gα<sub>i</sub>, as pertussis toxin (PTX) largely abrogated late cofilin activation (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). In addition, maraviroc, a CCR5 blocker, also abrogated the R5-tropic gp120(BAL)–mediated cofilin activation (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). In conclusion, both X4 and R5 viruses activate cofilin by triggering Gα<sub>i</sub> signaling through gp120 binding to their respective chemokine coreceptors.</p>

                <title>Cofilin hyperactivation in blood resting CD4 T cells of HIV-infected patients</title>
                <p>Given that the CD4 T cells in patients with HIV are chronically exposed to viral proteins such as gp120 (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr"><italic>24</italic></xref>), particularly during the acute phase, persistent viral signaling may trigger cofilin dysregulation and cause a T cell migratory defect, as seen in patients with HIV (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><italic>2</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr"><italic>3</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr"><italic>19</italic></xref>). We conducted a large clinical trial to examine cofilin phosphorylation in blood resting CD4 T cells (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). For this purpose, we developed a reverse-phase phospho-cofilin microarray that can quantify cofilin phosphorylation in a large number of clinical samples simultaneously (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>) (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr"><italic>25</italic></xref>). Blood resting CD4 T cells from patients with HIV, with ART (HIV + ART, <italic>n</italic> = 95) or without ART (HIV, <italic>n</italic> = 98), or from healthy controls (HC, <italic>n</italic> = 100) (table S1) were purified by negative depletion, unstimulated, and then lysed. Blindly coded cell lysates were then profiled with the phospho-cofilin microarray (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). We observed a highly significant reduction in cofilin phosphorylation in patients with HIV (HIV = 0.968; HIV + ART = 1.139; HC = 2.254; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). Unexpectedly, ART did not significantly restore cofilin phosphorylation (HIV = 0.968; HIV + ART = 1.139; <italic>P</italic> = 0.981). These results suggest that HIV-mediated cofilin hyperactivation may result from ART-irreversible, pathogenic polarization of T cells. This irreversibility appears to resemble the establishment of an early immune activation set point that dictates subsequent CD4 T cell depletion independent of viral load (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><italic>1</italic></xref>).</p>

                </fig>
                <p>We further examined possible correlations between cofilin hyperactivation and viral load/CD4 count. In untreated patients, there was only a weak correlation between cofilin phosphorylation and viral load (<italic>P</italic> = 0.043, <italic>r</italic> = −0.205; <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>), and there was no correlation between cofilin phosphorylation and CD4 T cell counts (<italic>P</italic> = 0.057, <italic>r</italic> = 0.193; <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). However, when ART-treated patients were categorized into immune responders (IRs) and immune nonresponders (INRs); the IRs had a significantly higher level of cofilin phosphorylation than the INRs (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>). Both IRs and INRs had the viral load suppressed to the limit of detection after 1 year of treatment; the INRs had less than 20% recovery of CD4 T cells or a CD4 T cell count below 200, whereas the IRs had greater than 20% T cell recovery and a CD4 count above 500. Thus, higher levels of p-cofilin in ART-treated patients were associated with a better CD4 T cell recovery after ART. We also followed ART-naïve patients after their p-cofilin profiling. Some of these patients were subsequently treated with ART (table S2). Again, the IRs had significantly higher levels of cofilin phosphorylation than the INRs (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>). These results demonstrate that pre-ART levels of p-cofilin can be used to gauge the degree of CD4 T cell damage and predict T cell recovery from ART.</p>

                <title>Direct effects of cofilin hyperactivation on T cell motility</title>
                <p>Cofilin hyperactivation has been shown to be associated with a migratory impairment of CCR6<sup>+</sup> and CXCR3<sup>+</sup> T<sub>H</sub> cells, which are prevented from trafficking from the blood stream to peripheral organs even in patients with aviremic HIV on long-term ART (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><italic>2</italic></xref>). T cell migration is controlled by cycles of cofilin phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, which are regulated by the LIM domain kinase (LIMK) through serine 3 phosphorylation (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr"><italic>16</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr"><italic>17</italic></xref>). To quantify the direct effect of cofilin hyperactivation on T cell migration, we used a recently discovered LIMK inhibitor, R10015 (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr"><italic>26</italic></xref>), to block cofilin phosphorylation in A3R5.7 CD4 T cells. We then performed CXCL12-induced T cell chemotaxis in the presence of cofilin hyperactivation.

                <title>Modulating the cofilin pathway using the anti-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> antibody Act-1</title>
                <p>To modulate the cofilin pathway, we had previously identified a marine toxin, okadaic acid (OA), that can activate LIMK and enhance cofilin phosphorylation and actin polymerization (<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr"><italic>27</italic></xref>). In a proof-of-concept study, OA was used to target the cofilin pathway to promote T cell migration both in vitro and in vivo in a murine model (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><italic>2</italic></xref>). The high toxicity of OA prevents its therapeutic use to restore T cell motility in humans. However, in a recent simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)/macaque study, the use of an anti–α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> integrin antibody unexpectedly promoted repopulation of CD4 T cells in a wide variety of immune tissues, including gastrointestinal tissues (GITs) (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr"><italic>7</italic></xref>). Integrins are cell surface adhesion molecules that mediate the cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions for T cell trafficking to tissues (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr"><italic>20</italic></xref>). This homing process involves synergistic, bidirectional signaling with chemokine receptors (inside-out and outside-in signaling) to initiate cell migration (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr"><italic>21</italic></xref>). Given that the anti–α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> integrin antibody promoted T cell trafficking and homing to lymphoid tissues in SIV infection (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr"><italic>7</italic></xref>), we investigated whether stimulation of T cells with the anti-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> antibody would trigger an “outside-in” signaling to modulate the cofilin pathway and promote T cell motility.</p>
                <p>In human peripheral blood, high levels of α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> were detected in a subpopulation of resting memory CD4 T cells (<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr"><italic>28</italic></xref>). In addition, culturing naïve T cells in interleukin-7 (IL-7) can greatly up-regulate α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> on the cell surface (fig. S3) (<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr"><italic>28</italic></xref>). We stimulated resting memory and IL-7–cultured naïve T cells with the anti–human α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> antibody Act-1 and then quantified cofilin phosphorylation by intracellular staining and flow cytometry. We observed that Act-1 (1 μg/ml) can directly trigger cofilin phosphorylation and dephosphorylation in a time course (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, C to E, H to J, and M to O</xref>), thereby demonstrating that the α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> antibody is capable of modulating the cofilin pathway. The time-dependent fluctuation of cofilin phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, beginning at 10 min and then returning to the basal levels at 15 min, resembles the cycling pattern of actin polymerization and depolymerization during chemotaxis (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, C and E</xref>, H and J, and M and O<bold>)</bold>. When blood resting CD4 T cells were similarly stimulated with CXCL12, the CXCR4 ligand known to trigger cofilin activation (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr"><italic>9</italic></xref>), we observed a similar cycling pattern of cofilin phosphorylation and dephosphorylation (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, B, G, and L</xref>). The α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> antibody–mediated transient cofilin activity was also partially dependent on Gα<sub>i</sub> signaling, as PTX abrogated late cofilin activation (30 min) (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, C and D, H and I, and M and N</xref>).</p>

                <title>Targeting the cofilin pathway using Act-1 to restore T cell motility</title>
                <p>Next, we investigated whether the α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> antibody is capable of restoring T cell migration. First, we used R10015 to induce cofilin hyperactivation to inhibit T cell chemotaxis (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>); we titrated R10015 on blood resting CD4 T cells of individual donors to determine an active dosage (10 to 20 μM) that can induce a low degree of cofilin hyperactivation (less than 50% reduction in p-cofilin), causing a mild 20 to 40% decrease in cell migration (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, A and B</xref>). At these dosages, R10015 did not affect the surface density of the α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> receptor (fig. S4). Then, we used Act-1 to stimulate T cells in CXCL12-mediated chemotaxis. We found that the use of Act-1 (1 to 50 μg/ml) restored T cell migration in the presence of R10015 (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>), demonstrating the capacity of the anti-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> antibody to rescue the migratory defects resulting from cofilin hyperactivation. As controls, we also tested whether Act-1 is a chemoattractant for CD4 T cells and whether Act-1 can promote T cell migration in the absence of R10015 (fig. S5<bold>)</bold>. We found that Act-1 was not capable of attracting CD4 T cells by itself, and nor could it stimulate significantly higher levels of T cell migration toward CXCL-12 in the absence of R10015 (fig.

                </fig>
                <p>We further investigated whether Act-1 specifically promoted the migration of the α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub><sup>+</sup> CD4 T cells by examining the cell subpopulation that migrated to the lower chamber of the Transwell plate (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). While R10015 inhibited the migration of all T cell subtypes, unexpectedly, the inhibitory effect was greater in the α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub><sup>high</sup> CD4 T cells, selectively diminishing their percentage in the migrating cell population (from 8.90 to 4.52%) (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). Act-1 effectively restored T cell migration and increased the percentage of migrating α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub><sup>high</sup> T cells from 4.52 to 12.0% (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, C and D</xref>, and fig. S6). These results demonstrated that the motility of α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub><sup>+</sup> CD4 T cells is prone to inhibition through blocking cofilin phosphorylation; the α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub><sup>+</sup> CD4 T cells may have a higher sensitivity to cofilin hyperactivation likely because cofilin dysfunction can affect the outside-in and inside-out signaling from both the chemokine receptor and the integrin receptor. This cofilin-mediated migratory impairment can be rescued by the anti-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> antibody Act-1, which may act through synergistic signaling with chemokines to modulate the cofilin pathway. For comparison, the percentage of the CCR7<sup>+</sup> T cell subpopulation was similarly analyzed and was found to be unchanged by R10015 and Act-1 (fig. S7). These results demonstrated that Act-1 selectively restored and promoted the migration of the α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub><sup>high</sup> CD4 T cells (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>), whereas it did not selectively increase the migration of CCR7<sup>+</sup> cells (fig.

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>It has long been speculated that HIV binding to chemokine coreceptors may trigger aberrant G protein signaling and CD4 T cell pathogenesis (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr"><italic>11</italic></xref>). Nevertheless, this speculation has not been solidified by experimental and clinical data. In this large clinical trial, we have demonstrated cofilin dephosphorylation occurring in the blood CD4 T cells of HIV-infected patients. Cofilin has been identified as a direct downstream target of HIV-mediated G protein signaling through the chemokine coreceptors (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr"><italic>9</italic></xref>). Cofilin hyperactivation can directly affect T cell migration (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr"><italic>18</italic></xref>), as cofilin is a major driver of actin treadmilling for cell motility (<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr"><italic>29</italic></xref>). In HIV infection, selective impairment of CD4 but not CD8 T cell homing (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><italic>2</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr"><italic>4</italic></xref>) is a major hallmark of HIV-mediated T cell dysfunction (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr"><italic>3</italic></xref>), and this implies a direct role of cofilin dysregulation in HIV-mediated CD4 T cell pathogenesis. The molecular cue for this cofilin hyperactivation likely results from early viral signaling from HIV gp120 (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr"><italic>9</italic></xref>) and chronic immune activation later in the disease course (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><italic>2</italic></xref>). During acute HIV infection, gp120 levels are very high with active HIV replication. CD4 T cells are exposed to these high levels of gp120 for extended periods of time before ART initiation. During the asymptomatic phase with ART, gp120 in the peripheral blood is at a low level. However, in infected lymphoid tissues, gp120 can be present in high concentrations (&gt;300 pg/ml) and is estimated to be in the range of 10 pg/ml to 10 ng/ml (<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr"><italic>30</italic></xref>). In addition, chronic immune activation persists even with ART. Thus, the combined effects of gp120 and chronic immune activation may exacerbate and polarize CD4 T cells toward an ART-irreversible pathogenic lineage. This HIV-mediated T cell polarization may resemble the irreversibility of T cell differentiation and lineage commitment following persistent cytokine receptor signaling. For example, when T cells are stimulated with IL-12 or interferon-γ for an extended period of time, they are polarized to express a transcription factor, T-bet, the induction of which becomes irreversible. The ART irreversibility of cofilin hyperactivation also appears to resemble the establishment of the early immune activation set point that dictates subsequent CD4 T cell dysfunction and depletion independent of viral load (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><italic>1</italic></xref>).</p>
              <p>While ART alone cannot repair cofilin dysfunction (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>), the combined use of ART plus the anti–human α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> integrin antibody Act-1 has been found to promote T cell motility and tissue repopulation (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr"><italic>7</italic></xref>). Although high dosages of anti-integrin antibodies can block integrin-ligand interaction and inhibit cell migration, these antibodies can also initiate an outside-in signal (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). In particular, if antibody affinity is not optimal or antibody is used at a nonsaturating dosage, then such antibody-induced signaling may synergize with chemokine signaling to promote cell motility. In vivo, Act-1 unexpectedly promoted the repopulation of monkey CD4 T cells in a wide variety of immune tissues including GITs (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr"><italic>7</italic></xref>), suggesting that in this SIV infection setting, Act-1 was not effective at blocking T cell homing but rather may have triggered an outside-in signal to promote T cell chemotaxis.</p>
              <p>Stimulation of integrin receptors has been known to trigger cytoskeletal signaling for cell adhesion and migration (<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr"><italic>31</italic></xref>). Integrin signaling is connected to the actin cytoskeleton mainly through the activation of downstream Rho guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases), such as Rho, Rac, and CDC42, which then activate the cofilin kinase, LIMK, to regulate cofilin phosphorylation (<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr"><italic>27</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr"><italic>31</italic></xref>). The α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> receptor has also been known to trigger actin signaling. Specifically, the cytoplasmic tail of the α<sub>4</sub> integrin has been shown to directly bind to a cytoskeletal and scaffolding protein, paxilin, that is involved in the activation of the Rho GTPase Rho, Rac1, and Cdc42 (<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr"><italic>32</italic></xref>). Activation of these Rho GTPases can lead to the activation of LIMK to regulate cofilin phosphorylation. In addition, the cytoplasmic tail of the β<sub>7</sub> integrin also directly binds to filamin A, a large actin cross-linking protein that connects transmembrane receptors with the actin cytoskeleton (<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr"><italic>33</italic></xref>). These previous studies provide possible signaling mechanisms by which Act-1 may modulate the cofilin pathway to promote α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> T cell motility.</p>
              <p>Given the time-dependent fluctuation of cofilin phosphorylation and dephosphorylation triggered by Act-1 stimulation (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, C, H, and M</xref>), it is possible that Act-1 stimulation may result in the sequential activation of two pathways: one leading to the activation of the cofilin phosphatase (slingshot) and one leading to the activation of the cofilin kinase (LIMK). We also compared the degree of p-cofilin fluctuation from Act-1 stimulation (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, C, H, and M</xref>) with that from CXCL12 stimulation (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, B, G, and L</xref>) and observed comparable p-cofilin changes. However, biologically, they are likely very different in terms of the spatial and temporal regulation of cofilin phosphorylation. CXCL12 is a natural ligand to trigger cofilin activity for chemotaxis, whereas Act-1–mediated cofilin activity is likely aberrant and not geared toward the precise regulation of T cell motility. Thus, this Act-1–mediated cofilin activity may not have biological significance in enhancing normal T cell chemotaxis, but it could have therapeutic effects on promoting T cell migration when normal chemotactic signaling is defective.</p>
              <p>A previous study by Teague and co-authors (<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr"><italic>34</italic></xref>) has found that direct stimulation of T cells with Act-1 alone did not trigger T cell activation. However, when used with an anti-CD3 antibody, the two antibodies together resulted in T cell activation. We also confirmed that Act-1 alone cannot activate resting CD4 T cells (fig. S8). These results suggest that α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> signaling can serve as an accessory or costimulatory signal, similar to what anti-CD28 costimulation does. It has been known that without anti-CD28 costimulation, the anti-CD3 stimulation alone cannot activate T cells by itself (<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr"><italic>35</italic></xref>). Similarly, in the Teague study (<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr"><italic>34</italic></xref>), without the anti-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> costimulation, the anti-CD3 stimulation alone also cannot activate T cells. Thus, both anti-CD28 and anti-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> stimulations share a similar accessory or costimulatory function. It has been known that the costimulatory function of anti-CD28 stimulation is to activate cofilin for the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, which is required for the formation of the immunologic synapse (IS) (<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr"><italic>36</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr"><italic>37</italic></xref>); this cofilin-regulated IS formation stabilizes cell-cell contact for full T cell activation (<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr"><italic>38</italic></xref><italic>-</italic><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr"><italic>40</italic></xref>). These previous results demonstrate that the anti-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> stimulation can replace the costimulatory function of the anti-CD28 stimulation, likely through similar activation of cofilin.</p>
              <p>In our in vitro assay system, stimulation of CD4 T cells with Act-1 can rescue the migratory defect caused by low levels of cofilin hyperactivation (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). However, if cofilin hyperactivation had progressed to a high level (50% or more decrease of p-cofilin), then Act-1 was not effective in restoring T cell motility (fig. S9). In addition to gp120, another viral protein, Nef, has also been shown to alter the cofilin pathway to cause cofilin dysfunction (<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr"><italic>41</italic></xref>). It is expected that for HIV-infected T cells, higher levels of HIV activity would be associated with greater degrees of cofilin dysfunction. Thus, our results suggest that early treatments of both HIV infection and immune dysfunction are important to prevent T cell polarization toward a pathogenic state in which cofilin-mediated T cell migratory impairment may become irreversible.</p>
              <p>Early restoration of CD4 T cells in the gut has been shown to be associated with immune reconstitution and effective control of viremia without the need for ART (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr"><italic>7</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr"><italic>42</italic></xref>). High levels of α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> are associated with memory T cell migration preferentially into mucosal tissues such as GITs (<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr"><italic>43</italic></xref>), in which CD4 T cells are severely depleted during HIV/SIV infection (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr"><italic>22</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr"><italic>23</italic></xref>). A full CD4 T cell repopulation in the gut is rarely achieved with ART (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr"><italic>3</italic></xref>), and persistent cofilin hyperactivation is likely a major reason (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><italic>2</italic></xref>). A key T cell subpopulation for maintaining mucosal integrity is the T<sub>H</sub>17 cells, which are depleted in both HIV infection and pathogenic SIV infection (<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr"><italic>44</italic></xref>). Although ART restores the T<sub>H</sub>17 cells in the bloodstream, it does not lead to full reconstitution of the T<sub>H</sub>17 cells in the mucosal compartment (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr"><italic>5</italic></xref>). Virologically, T<sub>H</sub>17 cells are highly permissive to HIV-1, and this permissiveness is linked to the expression of CCR6, CCR5, CCR9, and α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> (<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr"><italic>45</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr"><italic>46</italic></xref>). Recently, it has been shown that CCR6<sup>+</sup> and CXCR3<sup>+</sup> T<sub>H</sub> cells are impaired in trafficking from the blood stream to peripheral tissues (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><italic>2</italic></xref>), and these cells accumulate in the peripheral blood as a predominant viral reservoir (<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr"><italic>47</italic></xref>). We also observed the accumulation of α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub><sup>high</sup> CD4 T cells in the peripheral blood of HIV-infected patients (HIV infection of 0.5 to 2 years, ART-free; fig. S10). Our results are consistent with a recent finding by Mavigner and co-authors (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr"><italic>3</italic></xref>), who have investigated the trafficking of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells expressing the gut-homing receptors CCR9 and integrin α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub>, and found that these T cells remain in the circulation rather than repopulate the mucosa of the small intestine. In our study, we directly quantified the peripheral α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub><sup>hi</sup> CD4 T cells with the anti-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> antibody Act-1, which has been shown to promote T cell homing to the gut and other lymphoid tissues (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr"><italic>7</italic></xref>). However, the complete homing identity of these peripheral Act-1 high-staining T cells remains to be fully elucidated.</p>
              <p>Here, we have demonstrated that stimulating blood CD4 T cells with the anti-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> antibody can modulate the cofilin pathway and repair the T cell migratory defect caused by cofilin hyperactivation (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Our study has thus opened a new avenue for testing novel therapeutics that use such a “kick and go” strategy to restore T cell migration and tissue repopulation for immune reconstitution and immune control of viremia. Therapeutically, targeting T cell motility and the cofilin pathway would bring at least two major benefits (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>): For uninfected cells, the restoration of cofilin phosphorylation and CD4 T cell circulation and homing to GALTs and other lymphoid tissues may help immune reconstitution, and for infected cells, the circulation and homing of these latent HIV<sup>+</sup> cells to lymphoid tissues may lead to their reactivation and eventual containment by the restored immune system, reducing latent viral reservoirs persistent in the peripheral blood and in tissues. In sum, our study suggests that cofilin is a key molecule that needs to be therapeutically targeted to achieve a functional cure of HIV infection (<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr"><italic>48</italic></xref>).</p>

                  <title>Model of cofilin hyperactivation in HIV infection and therapeutic targeting of the cofilin pathway.</title>
                  <p>Early HIV signaling through chemokine coreceptors (CCR5 and CXCR4) and late chronic immune activation may trigger cofilin hyperactivation, impairing CD4 T cell migration and homing to lymphoid tissues such as GALTs. ART alone is not sufficient to restore T cell motility. For early, low levels of cofilin hyperactivation, stimulation of the upstream regulators of cofilin through antibodies (e.g., stimulating chemokine or integrin receptors such as the α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> receptor), receptor agonists, or activators of G proteins and GTPases may repair cofilin-mediated T cell migratory defect. For late, high levels of cofilin hyperactivation, it may need to use LIMK (the cofilin kinase) activators or the cofilin phosphatase (slingshot) inhibitors to directly inhibit cofilin dephosphorylation to restore actin dynamics. Therapeutically, targeting cofilin to restore T cell motility may bring two major benefits: (i) For uninfected cells, the restoration of CD4 T cell circulation and homing to lymphoid tissues such as GALTs may help immune reconstitution; (ii) for latent HIV<sup>+</sup> T cells, the restoration of T cell circulation and homing to lymphoid tissues may lead to their reactivation and eventual containment by the restored immune system, reducing latent viral reservoirs persistent in the peripheral blood and in tissues.</p>

                <title>Clinical study</title>
                <p>All clinical study protocols were reviewed and approved by the Ethics Review Committee of China Medical University (CMU), Shenyang, P. R. China, and written informed consent from each participant in the study was obtained. We initially enrolled and evaluated 200 HIV-1–infected patients from the HIV patient cohort of the Key Laboratory of AIDS Immunology of the National Health and Family Planning Commission in The First Affiliated Hospital of CMU. Among the HIV-infected patients, 98 had no previous or current ART at the time of the p-cofilin profiling, and 102 had ongoing ART for over a year, but 4 of the ART-treated patients had a viral load greater than 1000 copies/ml and were excluded from the study for possible drug resistance. The CD4 T cell count and viral load of these subjects were measured every 3 months. One hundred age- and sex-matched HC were enrolled from the HIV voluntary counseling and testing center of CMU. A summary of the subjects is listed in tables S1 and S2. Of the ART-naïve patients, 65 eventually received ART at around 6 months after the p-cofilin profiling and were treated for more than a year. All of these patients receiving ART reached undetectable plasma HIV-1 RNA. ART-treated patients were further evaluated and categorized into IRs and INRs. Both IRs and INRs were treated with ART for more than 1 year. IRs were those who had a CD4 T cell recovery greater than 20% and a CD4 T cell count more than 500 cells/μl; INRs had a CD4 T cell recovery less than 20% or a CD4 T cell count less than 200 cells/μl. For isolating blood resting CD4 T cells from study subjects, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were freshly obtained from the subjects and purified by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation, followed by negative isolation of resting CD4 T cells as previously described (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr"><italic>9</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr"><italic>49</italic></xref>). Briefly, monoclonal antibodies against human CD14, CD56, HLA-DR, CD8, CD11b, and CD19 (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) were used. Antibody-bound cells were depleted using Dynabeads Pan Mouse IgG (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Purified cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). One million resting CD4 T cells from each blood donor were lysed in 40 μl of SDS/T-PER extraction buffer [Novex Tris-Glycine SDS Sample Buffer, T-PER Tissue Protein Extraction Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and 2.5% 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma-Aldrich)]. Cell lysates were heated at 100°C for 8 min, immediately frozen and stored at −80°C, and then transported on dry ice to Theranostics Health (Gaithersburg, MD, USA) for p-cofilin reverse-phase protein microarray (RPPA) analyses. A total of 296 coded cell lysates were printed onto the microarrays and profiled; 3 lysates did not generate readable signals and were excluded from data analyses.</p>

                <title>Reverse-phase protein microarray</title>
                <p>Cofilin RPPA printing and analyses of cell lysates were provided by Theranostics Health (Gaithersburg, MD, USA). Details of RPPA have been published previously (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr"><italic>25</italic></xref>). The RPPA directly couples the phospho-cofilin detection antibody with highly sensitive amplification systems that can yield detection sensitivities to fewer than 1000 to 5000 molecules per spot with good linearity (correlation coefficient or <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.990 to 0.999) and interexperiment precision (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.973). Published between-run and within-run analytical precision in our studies was 3 to 13% CV (coefficient of variation) (<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr"><italic>50</italic></xref>). The RPPA technology has been developed and optimized for performance as a fluorescence-based calibrated assay, generally identical in design and analysis to standard ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) or standard clinical immunoassays. Each array consisted of patient cell lysates printed in triplicate two-spot dilutions (neat and 1:4), high and low controls printed in triplicate two-spot dilutions (neat and 1:4), and 6- to 10-point calibrators. The analyte concentration was determined by extrapolation to a nonparametrically determined curve fit of the calibration curve and reported in relative fluorescence units. For data normalization, each protein analyte value (relative p-cofilin value) was normalized to the total amount of protein printed on that spot with a fluorescent stain (Sypro Ruby Blot Stain; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) that binds to the amne group of proteins without bias. The protein loading value was also obtained by a calibrated assay technique. This total protein calibrator consisted of a protein lysate with a known concentration, which upon dilution spans the linear dynamic range of protein concentration. Each sample value was then extrapolated to the calibrator. The following were the quantified averages of the total protein levels from each test group: HIV (<italic>n</italic> = 98), 0.254; HIV + ART (<italic>n</italic> = 95), 0.259; and HC (<italic>n</italic> = 100), 0.252. There are no statistically significant differences in the total protein levels between the three groups (HC and HIV, <italic>P</italic> = 0.77; HC and HIV + ART, <italic>P</italic> = 0.51; HIV and HIV + ART, <italic>P</italic> = 0.64).</p>

                <title>Purification of resting CD4 T subtypes from peripheral blood</title>
                <p>All protocols involving human subjects were reviewed and approved by the George Mason University institutional review board. PBMCs were purified from the peripheral blood of HIV-negative donors by centrifugation in Lymphocyte Separation Medium (Corning, Corning, NY), and resting CD4 T cells were further purified by two rounds of negative selection as previously described (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr"><italic>9</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr"><italic>49</italic></xref>). Briefly, for the first-round depletion, monoclonal antibodies against human CD14, CD56 and HLA-DR, DP, and DQ (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) were used. For the second-round depletion, monoclonal antibodies against human CD8, CD11b, and CD19 (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) were used. Antibody-bound cells were depleted using Dynabeads Pan Mouse IgG (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). For further negative selection of the memory and naïve CD4 T cell subsets, monoclonal antibody against either CD45RA (0.02 μl per million cells) or CD45RO (0.1 μl per million cells) (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) was added during the second round of depletion. Purified cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), penicillin (50 U/ml) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and streptomycin (50 μg/ml) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Cells were rested overnight before infection or treatment. For α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> surface receptor up-regulation, resting CD4 T cells were also cultured in IL-7 (5 ng/ml) for 3 days.</p>

                <p>A3R5.7 cells were acquired from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) AIDS Reagent Program. A3R5.7 cells were derived from A3.01, which naturally expresses CD4, CXCR4, and α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub>. HIV-1(AD8) was provided by M. A. Martin. Virus stocks of NLENG1-ES-IRES(NL4-3), NLENG1-ES-IRES(Yu2), and HIV-1(AD8) were prepared by transfection of human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 T cells with cloned proviral DNA as described (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr"><italic>9</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr"><italic>49</italic></xref>). Viral titer (TCID<sub>50</sub>) was determined on the Rev-dependent green fluorescent protein (GFP) indicator cell (<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr"><italic>51</italic></xref>), Rev-A3R5-GFP (Virongy, Manassas, VA). For viral infection of resting CD4 T cells, cells were infected with envelope-negative GFP reporter HIV-1 virus NLENG1-ES-IRES, pseudo-typed with NL4-3 or YU2 envelope. Infection was performed by spinoculation for 2 hours at 1200<italic>g</italic> of 400 virions particles per cell at 37°C, in the presence of DEAE Dextran (5 μg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich). After infection, cells were washed and incubated for 6 days with or without IL-7 (25 ng/ml; R&amp;D Systems). T cells were stained with anti–CD45RO-Pacific Blue monoclonal antibody (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and analyzed by flow cytometry for CD45RO and GFP expression. For treatment of resting CD4 T cells with HIV(AD8), cells were pretreated with or without PTX (100 ng/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 hour at 37°C and then treated with HIV(AD8) (10<sup>3.5</sup> to 10<sup>4.5</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub> per million cells) for various times. Cells were fixed and stained for intracellular p-cofilin. For treatment of resting CD4 T cells with HIV gp120 (IIIB) (Microbix Biosystems Inc., Toronto, Canada), cells were treated with 10 nM gp120 (IIIB) for various times. For treatment with HIV gp120(BAL) (from the NIH AIDS Reagent Program), resting memory CD4 T cells were treated with or without maraviroc (1 μM) (from the NIH AIDS Reagent Program) for 1 hour at 37°C and then treated with HIV gp120(BAL) (100 nM) for various times.</p>

Samples were heated at 70°C for 10 min, separated by SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and then transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The membranes were washed in Tris-buffered saline (TBST) for 3 min and then blocked for 30 min at room temperature with 5% milk. The blots were incubated with a mouse anti-cofilin antibody (1:1000 dilution; BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and a rabbit anti–phospho-cofilin (serine 3) antibody (1:500 dilution; Cell Signaling) diluted in 3% milk-TBST and rocked overnight at 4°C. The blots were washed three times for 15 min and then incubated with DyLight 680 goat anti-mouse and DyLight 800 goat anti-rabbit antibodies (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD) (1:5000 diluted in blocking buffer) for 1 hour at 4°C. The blots were washed three times for 15 min and scanned with the Odyssey Infrared Imager (LI-COR Biosciences).</p>
