              <abstract>
                <p><italic>Mycobacterium bovis</italic> bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) has been used for 100 years and prevents disseminated tuberculosis and death in young children. However, it shows only partial efficacy against pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) in adults, so new vaccines are urgently needed. The protective efficacy of BCG depends on T cells, which are typically activated by pathogen-derived protein antigens that bind to highly polymorphic major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. Some T cells recognize non-protein antigens <italic>via</italic> antigen presenting systems that are independent of genetic background, leading to their designation as donor-unrestricted T (DURT) cells. Whether live whole cell vaccines, like BCG, can induce durable expansions of DURT cells in humans is not known. We used combinatorial tetramer staining, multi-parameter flow cytometry, and immunosequencing to comprehensively characterize the effect of BCG on activation and expansion of DURT cell subsets. We examined peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) derived from a Phase I study of South African adults in which samples were archived at baseline, 3 weeks, and 52 weeks post-BCG revaccination. We did not observe a change in the frequency of total mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells, invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells, germline encoded mycolyl-reactive (GEM) T cells, or γδ T cells at 52 weeks post-BCG. However, immunosequencing revealed a set of TCR-δ clonotypes that were expanded at 52 weeks post-BCG revaccination. These expanded clones expressed the Vδ2 gene segment and could be further defined on the basis of biochemical similarity into several ‘meta-clonotypes’ that likely recognize similar epitopes. Our data reveal that BCG vaccination leads to durable expansion of DURT cell clonotypes despite a limited effect on total circulating frequencies in the blood and have implications for defining the immunogenicity of candidate whole cell TB vaccines.</p>

As TB is transmitted through airborne droplets, adolescents and adults with pulmonary TB are thought to be the primary transmitters of the disease, rendering the current BCG vaccination strategy unable to control the epidemic. The development of new vaccines that have demonstrated efficacy against pulmonary TB is thus a priority for the field.</p>
              <p>Studies in murine and non-human primate (NHP) models have demonstrated an essential role for T cell responses in protection against M.tb challenge (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). However, it is not known which pathogen-derived antigens are targeted by protective T cells. Canonically, T cells are activated by foreign peptide antigens when bound to highly polymorphic major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. Peptide subunit vaccines are highly immunogenic, but there has been mixed efficacy in prevention of M.tb infection and TB disease (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). More recently, T cells have been shown to recognize non-peptide antigens through MHC-independent modes of recognition. For example, T cells are activated by lipids and small molecules presented by cluster of differentiation 1 (CD1) and major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-related protein 1 (MR1), respectively (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Further, T cells with a γδ T cell receptor (TCR) can recognize non-peptide antigens presented by butyrophilin molecules, CD1, and MR1 (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>–<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Vγ9Vδ2 T cells are the most abundant subset of γδ T cells in human blood and are activated by phosphoantigens present in tumors and bacteria (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Because CD1, MR1, and butyrophilin exhibit limited sequence diversity, the T cells that act through these systems are called donor-unrestricted T (DURT) cells and express semi-invariant TCRs (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). The two highest frequency semi-invariant DURT cell populations in human blood are invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells that recognize lipids presented by the CD1d isoform and mucosal associated invariant T (MAIT) cells that recognize metabolite antigens presented by MR1 (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>–<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).</p>
              <p>DURT cell populations have been associated with the immune response to BCG and M.tb in murine and non-human primate studies. In a murine model of pulmonary BCG infection, MAIT cells were recruited to the lung, which was associated with reduced bacterial burden (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Induced MAIT cells can also inhibit BCG replication in the lungs of infected mice (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Further, NKT cells are activated and proliferate following BCG infection in mice, but NKT cell frequency returns to baseline following infection (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). In non-human primates, BCG vaccination induces a robust expansion of γδ T cells and mycobacterial lipid-specific T cells and induces activation of MAIT cells (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>–<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). In fact, adoptive transfer of γδ T-cells in a non-human primate model of M.tb-infection reduced the bacterial burden and prevented dissemination of disease (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Finally, in a study of BCG-vaccinated rhesus macaques, CD8+ iNKT cells were expanded in animals that were able to control subsequent M.tb infection (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Taken together, these data highlight a potential role for DURT cells in mediating a protective immune response to BCG vaccination in animal models. Whether whole cell vaccines, such as BCG, modulate DURT cells in humans is unknown.</p>
              <p>Here, we sought to comprehensively evaluate changes in DURT cell populations after BCG vaccination in humans. We leveraged samples collected in the context of a Phase I study of the safety and reactogenicity of BCG revaccination, with or without INH pre-treatment, in South African adults with latent TB (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were archived at baseline or 3 weeks and 52 weeks post-BCG. We employed combinatorial tetramer staining and multi-parameter flow cytometry to define the frequencies and phenotypes of DURT cells. We also used immunosequencing of TCR-α and TCR-δ chains to define specific TCR rearrangements, or clonotypes, that undergo expansion after BCG vaccination. Surprisingly, we found no durable changes in DURT cell frequencies using flow cytometry. However, we were able to define TCR-δ clonotypes that were expanded in many individuals up to one year after BCG vaccination. Our data thus reveal that BCG induces sustained changes in the DURT cell repertoire that may contribute to a protective immune response.</p>

                <title>Clinical Cohorts</title>
                <p>Healthy 18 to 40-year-old South African adult participants were recruited from Worcester in the Western Cape, South Africa. All participants were strongly TST positive (≥ 15mm induration when tested with PPD RT-23), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-seronegative, and received BCG at birth. All participants had a baseline BCG scar and large TST induration (&gt;15mm), thus mitigating against poor baseline responses to BCG. Additionally, participants were screened for the presence of active tuberculosis using chest radiography, sputum microscopy and culture (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). These individuals participated in a phase I clinical trial to evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of BCG revaccination, with or without INH pre-treatment, and were randomized in parallel into two groups as previously described (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Participants included in the present study received a course of 6 months of isoniazid within a maximum period of 7 months, followed by BCG vaccination and a subsequent period of observation. Danish strain 1331 BCG Vaccine SSI (Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark) was administered intradermally at an adult dose of 2-8×10<sup>5</sup> CFU. Isoniazid (Westward Pharmaceutical Corporation, Eatontown, NJ, USA) was administered daily at 5 mg/kg rounded up to the nearest 100 mg, with a maximum dose of 300 mg per day. Isoniazid adherence was monitored by pill counts at clinic visits and random urine isoniazid metabolite testing. Heparinized whole blood was collected from participants and processed within 45 minutes of phlebotomy, as previously described (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), at enrolment, 1 month after isoniazid preventive therapy initiation, at BCG vaccination, at 3 and 5 weeks, and 52 weeks post-vaccination. For this study, PBMC donated at enrolment, BCG vaccination, 3 weeks post-vaccination, and 52 weeks post-vaccination were analyzed. The 3 week post-vaccination time point was selected because previous data demonstrate that classical BCG-induced CD4+ T cell responses are detectable at this time point (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Samples were chosen from the parent study on the basis of availability of cryopreserved PBMC at each of the three time points tested. The distribution of age, sex, and body mass index (BMI) was similar between the parent study and samples tested in this study (<xref rid="SF4" ref-type="supplementary-material"><bold>Supplemental Table 1</bold></xref>) (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>).</p>

                <p>Soluble biotinylated CD1b monomers were provided by the National Institutes of Health Tetramer Core Facility (Emory University, Atlanta, GA). The loading protocol for CD1b monomers was based on previously published loading protocols using a 40-fold molar excess of mycolic acid (MA) and 100-fold molar excess of glucose monomycolate (GMM) (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>–<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). For GMM-loaded CD1b tetramers, C32-GMM derived from <italic>Rhodococcus equi</italic> was dried down and sonicated into 50 mM sodium citrate buffer at pH 4, containing 0.25% CHAPS. For MA-loaded tetramers, synthetic MA with a methoxy functional group distal to the head group (α-MA-methoxy cis, Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, Alabama, 791281P-1mg) was dried down and sonicated into 50 mM sodium citrate buffer at pH 4 containing 0.06% CHAPS. The sonicates were transferred to microfuge tubes, and 20 μl of CD1b monomer was added. GMM-loaded tetramers were incubated in a 37°C water bath for 2 hours with vortexing every 30 minutes, and MA-loaded tetramers were incubated at 37°C overnight. At the end of the incubation, the solution was neutralized to pH 7.4 with 6 μl of 1 M Tris pH 9. Finally, 25.5 μl of Streptavidin conjugated to ECD, 15.4 μl APC (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, SA1017, S868), 10.2 μl BV510, or 10.2 μl BV650 (BioLegend, San Diego, CA, 405234, 405232) was added in ten aliquots every 10 minutes. The final product was filtered through a SpinX column (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, CLS8160-96EA) to remove aggregates and stored at 4°C until use.</p>
                <p>PBS-57 (synthetic analogue of α-galactosylceramide (α-GalCer))-loaded and 5-(2-oxopropylideneamino)-6-D-ribitylaminouracil (5-OP-RU)-loaded MR1 monomers were provided by the National Institutes of Health Tetramer Core Facility (Emory University, Atlanta, GA). Tetramers were prepared as previously described (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Briefly, 10 μL of the loaded stock monomers was incubated with 28.8 μL of streptavidin conjugated to PE (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, S866), or 10.2 μl BV421 (BioLegend, San Diego, CA, 405225) that were titrated in at ten aliquots of 2.88 μL or 1.02 μl every 10 min to facilitate tetramerization, respectively.

The supernatant was decanted, and the cells were resuspended in RPMI 1640 (Gibco, Waltham, MA) supplemented with 10% FBS (Hyclone, Logan, UT, SH3007003HI) (R10 Media) and enumerated using the Guava easyCyte (Millipore) with guavaSoft v.2.6 software. Cells were then rested overnight at 37°C/5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 2 million cells per mL in R10 media. The following day, the cells were centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 5 minutes and plated at a density of 1 million cells per well in a 96-well U-bottom plate. The PBMC in the 96-well plate were washed with FACS buffer (1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (Gibco, Waltham, MA, 14190-250) supplemented with 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, A9418-100G)) and centrifuged at 1800 rpm for 3 minutes. Next, the cells were washed twice with PBS and stained with Green Live/Dead stain (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, 50-113-7443) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Following a 15-minute incubation at room temperature, the cells were washed twice in PBS. They were then blocked with 50% human serum (Valley Biomedical, Winchester, VA, HS1004CHI) in FACS buffer for 10 minutes at 4°C. The wells were washed twice with FACS buffer and then resuspended in 50 µl FACS buffer supplemented with 50 nM Dasatinib (Cayman Chemicals, Ann Arbor, MI, 11498) and anti-CCR7 antibody for 30min at 37°C (<xref rid="SF5" ref-type="supplementary-material"><bold>Supplemental Table 2</bold></xref>).

Optimal titre for tetramer staining was determined prior to use. After this incubation period, the cells were washed twice with FACS buffer and then labelled with a cocktail containing antibodies specified in <xref rid="SF5" ref-type="supplementary-material"><bold>Supplemental Table 2</bold></xref> in FACS buffer supplemented with 1 mM L-ascorbic acid (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, A4403-100MG) and 0.05% sodium azide (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, S2002-5g) for 30 minutes at 4°C. Antibody cocktail was centrifuged at 3,500 rpm for 5 min prior to use to remove antibody aggregates. After two final washes in FACS buffer, the cells were fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA, 15712-S) and acquired on a BD LSRFortessa (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) equipped with blue (488 nm), green (532 nm), red (628 nm), violet (405 nm), and ultraviolet (355 nm) lasers using standardized good clinical laboratory practice procedures to minimize the variability of data generated.</p>

                  <title>Identification of Expanded Meta-Clonotypes</title>
                  <p>We identified TCR-δ clones (N=1822 at the amino acid level) expanded from (i) pre-vaccination to (ii) 3 weeks post-vaccination or 52 weeks post vaccination using the Differential Abundance tool in the Adaptive Biotechnologies ImmunoSEQ Analyzer toolkit. This tool uses a binomial method to determine expanded clonotypes, defined by an exact nucleotide sequence match (alpha = 0.01, Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted). Biochemical properties (length, hydrophobicity, bulkiness, polarity, acidity, aliphatic, basic, aromatic, charge) of the CDR3 region of expanded clonotypes were computed using the alakazam R package (version 1.0.2) (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). From the expanded clones, we computed pairwise CDR-weighted distances between all TCRDV clonotypes (defined as δ-chain amplicons identical at the amino acid level) using the Python package tcrdist3 (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>) implementing the TCRdist metric (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Briefly, for each clone we found all clones present at 3 weeks and 52 weeks within 18 TCRdist units, which is equivalent to 1-2 AA substitutions or gaps in the CDR3 junction depending on the biochemical similarity of residues substituted. We refer to these groups of similar TCRs defined by a centroid sequence and TCRdist radius as “meta-clonotypes,” which allow for quantification of similar TCRs across all the samples. We retained meta-clonotypes that were public (i.e., those formed from clones from at least two individuals). Additionally, the CDR3s of each meta-clonotype were aligned to the centroid and a position-specific motif pattern of conserved amino-acid residues was defined to further restrict meta-clonotype membership when searching for similar sequences in bulk repertoires (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Alignment positions with five or fewer distinct amino acids were considered conserved. The motif constraint is permissive of substitutions in select positions relative to the centroid, however these substitutions are penalized by the radius constraint. Where a gap exists, that position was made optional in the motif. The motif was encoded as a regular expression, with the “.” character indicating non-conserved positions and specified degenerate amino acid indicated by the set of allowable residues in brackets (e.g., “D[ST][LV]LGDT[RG]T?DKL”). All tested meta-clonotypes are summarized in <xref rid="SF6" ref-type="supplementary-material"><bold>Supplemental File 1</bold></xref> (see supporting information), as they may provide useful priority, and likely donor-unrestricted, features for independent validation in separate BCG study cohorts.</p>

For each bulk repertoire sample, we tabulated the number of templates associated with each meta-clonotype, i.e., those that were ≤ 18 TCRdist from the centroid TCRDV-CDR3 search sequence and matching the position-specific CDR3 motif. For each bulk repertoire sample, we also computed the effective sequence depth as the number of total templates associated with TCR-δ chain amplicons. For each exact-clonotype and meta-clonotype, we estimated a maximum likelihood beta-binomial model based on clonotype-counts (W) and total sample counts (M) and the visit number. The model formula was specified as cbind(W, M - W) ~ visit using the bbdml function in R package corncob 0.1.0 (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>), where visit was coded as a categorical variable with values V01 (0 weeks) or V28 (52 weeks).</p>

                <p>The frequency of MAIT cells, as defined by T cells staining with 5-OP-RU-MR1 tetramer and with anti-TRAV1-2, did not change between 0 weeks and 3 weeks or 52 weeks-post BCG revaccination (p = 0.523 and p = 0.720, respectively, Wilcoxon signed-rank) (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figures 1B, C</bold></xref>; <xref rid="SF1" ref-type="supplementary-material"><bold>Supplemental Figure 1</bold></xref> and <xref rid="SF5" ref-type="supplementary-material"><bold>Supplemental Table 2</bold></xref>). We also observed that MR1-restricted T cells that do not utilize TRAV1-2 were not different at either the 3 week or 52 week time point compared to 0 weeks (p = 0.496 and p = 0.589, respectively, Wilcoxon signed-rank) (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 1D</bold></xref>). We used immunosequencing to compare the frequency of the canonical MAIT cell TCR-α chain rearrangement, which is defined by the use of TRAV1-2 and TRAJ33 and a fixed CDR3 length of 12 amino acids. Again, we found no difference in clonotype frequencies between the 0 week and the 3 week or 52 week time point (p = 0.936 and p = 0.756, respectively, Wilcoxon signed-rank) (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 1E</bold></xref>).</p>
                <p>Next, we compared the frequency of iNKT cells between 0 weeks and 3 weeks or 52 weeks as defined by staining with α-GalCer-CD1d tetramer or as a TCR-α chain rearrangement of TRAV10, TRAJ18, and a CDR3 length of 15 amino acids. We were unable to detect a change in frequency of iNKT cells between 0 weeks and 3 weeks or 52 weeks by either flow cytometry (p = 0.496 and p = 0.901, respectively, Wilcoxon signed-rank), or immunosequencing (p = 0.936 and p = 0.417, respectively, Wilcoxon signed-rank) (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figures 1F, G</bold></xref>). Taken together, these data reveal that innate-like T cells that do not specifically recognize mycobacterial antigens do not undergo clonal expansion after BCG re-vaccination in humans with a positive TST.</p>

We used a dual-tetramer labelling strategy incorporating tetramers loaded with two mycobacterial glycolipid antigens, mycolic acid (MA) and glucose monomycolate (GMM), that were each labelled with two distinct fluorochromes.

This finding suggested a modest and transient expansion of mycolipid-specific T cells after BCG vaccination.

                <p>Having thus queried the frequencies of iNKT, MAIT, mycolipid-specific, and γδ T cells in a targeted manner, we next took an ‘unsupervised’ approach to identify any/all clonotypes that were expanded after BCG vaccination. We selected for TCR clonotypes (as defined by an exact match for V gene, J gene, and CDR3 sequence) that were significantly expanded post-revaccination (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 3D</bold></xref>). In this plot from a representative individual, relatively few sequences are expanded, and only clones that are expanded at the 3 week or 52 week time point were included in the subsequent analyses (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 3D</bold></xref>). Importantly, a mean of 56% and 50% of expanded clones across all individuals met the criteria outlined above for TCR-δ sequences, emphasizing a significant enrichment above all clones at the 3 week and 52 weeks timepoints, respectively, and highlighting the durable nature of this expansion (p = 0.0003 and p &lt; 0.0001, respectively, Wilcoxon signed-rank) (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 3E</bold></xref>). To extend these findings we next compared the gene usage of TCR-δ expanded clones to TCR-δ gene usage of all TCR-δ clones and detected a significant enrichment of TCRDV2, which was detected in 71% of expanded clones and only 49% of TCR-δ clones at the 3 week time point (p = 0.045, Wilcoxon signed-rank) (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 3F</bold></xref>). This enrichment was accompanied by a reduction in TCRDV1 usage among TCR-δ expanded clones, which was reduced to 11% from 31% (p = 0.004) (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 3F</bold></xref>). We detected no significant enrichment in TCRDV3 frequency among expanded clones (p = 0.079, Wilcoxon signed-rank) (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 3F</bold></xref>).

                <p>To examine durably expanded clones, we identified meta-clonotypes, groups of highly biochemically similar TCRs, that were expanded in more than one individual at the 52 week timepoint compared to baseline (see Methods). Each meta-clonotype was defined as a ‘neighborhood’ of biochemically similar TCRs using tcrdist3 (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). We then used these meta-clonotypes to identify and quantify TCRs in the bulk repertoires at each timepoint. We tested whether individual clonotypes or meta-clonotypes were more likely to be detected in samples 52 weeks post-vaccination relative to baseline (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 4B</bold></xref>). After adjustment for multiple comparisons, we could not infer that any meta-clonotypes were significantly increased or decreased in abundance after BCG vaccination (q-value &gt;0.2 or &lt;0.2).</p>
                <p>However, within this cohort, the meta-clonotype with the most individually significant association (p = 0.04) at 52 weeks post-revaccination was TRDV*02+CACDTLLGDTRTDKLIF (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 4C</bold></xref>).

              <p>In summary, we comprehensively profiled DURT cells after BCG revaccination in a cohort of South African adults and found no evidence that total frequencies as measured by flow cytometry were changed. However, analysis of the TCR repertoire clearly revealed that BCG induces clonal expansion of a subset of γδ T cells that is still detectable up to one year after vaccination. Further, we were able to identify a public meta-clonotype with shared biochemical properties that increased in frequency in nine of twenty participants following BCG revaccination. While whole cell mycobacterial vaccines are known to induce protective T cells that target mycobacterial proteins, our data reveal that BCG also induces long-term expansion of T cells targeting non-peptide antigens.</p>
              <p>To our knowledge, this study is among the first to evaluate the effect of BCG on T cell responses to mycobacterial glycolipid antigens in humans. Previous studies have attempted to do this <italic>via</italic> cross-sectional study designs using historical cohorts (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). Instead, we used longitudinally collected samples from an interventional clinical trial. We also employed lipid-loaded CD1 tetramers, which we incorporated into a validated assay for immune monitoring studies (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Despite the rigor of our approach, we did not detect any changes in the frequency of T cells targeting mycolic acid and only a transient increase in the frequency of GEM T cells that was not recapitulated by immunosequencing. One explanation for these negative findings is that the route of immunization may affect how DURT cells respond to BCG. We and others have recently demonstrated clonal expansion of MAIT cells, γδ T cells, and CD1-restricted T cells in the blood and lungs of non-human primates after intravenous administration of BCG (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>), and intravenous BCG induces greater expansion of Vγ9Vδ2 T cells than intradermal or aerosol vaccination (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). Another possibility is that the responses present at baseline and after treatment with isoniazid may still have been too high to observe any changes after vaccination (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). The participants we chose to study had previously been vaccinated with BCG, and had a positive TST &gt;= 15mm, suggesting that they were infected with M.tb. High levels of pre-existing immunity prior to BCG revaccination may have impeded our ability to detect clonal expansion. A recently published study directly addresses this limitation by studying infants, who are mycobacteria naïve, yet arrived at a similar conclusion regarding γδ T cell expansion after BCG vaccination (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). However, even infants are not truly immunologically naive to antigens that modulate DURT cells. Vγ9Vδ2 T cells differentiated into effector cells within the first 10 weeks after birth, and this was likely driven by environmental antigen exposure and was not affected by BCG vaccination (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). Nevertheless, BCG vaccination at birth does lead to an expansion of total γδ T cells, supporting the possibility that non-Vγ9Vδ2 T cells are preferentially affected in this clinical setting (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>).</p>
              <p>The stability of MAIT and iNKT cell frequencies following BCG revaccination was unanticipated given the body of literature implicating MAIT and iNKT cells in the T cell response to BCG (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). However, this may be a product of the unique biology of DURT cells, such as high precursor frequency, memory phenotype acquisition during T cell development, and the recognition of endogenous ligands (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). Further, it is possible that the kinetics of MAIT and iNKT cell expansion are highly transient, and the timing of sample collection was not optimal to detect these changes. In addition, recently stimulated iNKT cells can exhibit hyporesponsiveness for at least one month following stimulation, which due to the chronically infected nature of these participants, may have affected their proliferative capacity (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). Further, iNKT and MAIT cells have been shown to have reduced proliferative potential compared to conventional CD4 and CD8 T cells (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>), which may have contributed to their lack of expansion after BCG. A recent study revealed that the protein subunit vaccine H4:IC31, induces T cells that co-express CD3 and CD56 and showed that <italic>in vitro</italic> restimulation of T cells by BCG elicits responses from DURT cells (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). Previous work has also demonstrated that BCG revaccination transiently expanded peripheral blood frequencies of BCG-reactive IFN-γ+ MAIT cells, indicating that the functional profiles of DURT populations may be affected, while the frequency may remain unchanged (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). The simultaneous identification of DURTs by tetramer and their functions by flow cytometry is technically challenging but could be circumvented by single-cell transcriptional profiling (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). These data reveal that BCG may modulate iNKT and MAIT cells independently of changes in total frequencies as a result of clonal expansion.</p>
              <p>This hypothesis is supported by our results examining γδ T cells as well as a recent study examining MAIT cells after human challenge with <italic>Salmonella paratyphi</italic>. Following infection, the total frequency of MAIT cells did not change appreciably, but the frequency of activated MAIT cells increased as did the frequency of specific clonotypes identified by deep-sequencing the TCR-β repertoire of sorted T cells (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>). As the biased but variant TCR-β chain in DURT populations can affect antigen response, it is possible that expansion of particular TCR-β clonotypes occurred following BCG revaccination that we were unable to quantify without first sorting the DURT cells (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>). In addition, non-canonical MR1 and CD1d-restricted T cell populations may be modulated by BCG revaccination, such as non-MAIT MR1-restricted T cells (MR1Ts) and Type II NKT cells with diverse TCRs. Our study was not designed to detect modulation of T cell populations with diverse TCR usage and ligand recognition patterns, and these populations are of interest to further evaluate upon characterization of potential ligands and TCR properties (<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>–<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>). Finally, epigenetic changes in myeloid cells following BCG vaccination (trained immunity) may be part of the mechanism by which BCG vaccination exerts its protective effect in children and adolescents (<xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>, <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>). Similar mechanisms may be at work to modify the functional potential of iNKT and MAIT cells following BCG vaccination.</p>
              <p>We provide clear evidence that BCG modulates the γδ T cell repertoire independently of changes in total frequencies, which would be expected for conventional MHC-restricted T cells (<xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>). TCR-δ clonotypes that were durably expanded after BCG revaccination expressed Vδ2 more frequently and were characterized by similar biochemical features (increased CDR3 lengths, acidic and bulky residue content, and a reduced charge) compared to unenriched sequences, suggesting these T cells could be targeting specific antigens present in mycobacteria. Given the small sample size and the requirement for multiplicity adjustment across all meta-clonotypes, this study was not powered to identify population-level induction of meta-clonotypes by BCG or avoid confounding by clinical and demographic factors, such as INH pretreatment, in this population of antigen-experienced individuals. However, the meta-clonotype we describe here shares conserved hydrophobic amino acids that have been previously described to be important in phosphoantigen recognition by Vγ9Vδ2 T cells, suggesting a possible antigenic target for this T cell population (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>–<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). In a previous study, nearly all BCG- and isopentenyl pyrophosphate-expanded Vγ9Vδ2 T cell clones sequenced expressed a hydrophobic or neutral amino acid residue in the 5’ portion of the CDR3 sequence (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). Further, a subset of Vγ9Vδ2 T cells was found to be specifically induced by BCG and shown to be more cytolytic than those derived from canonical phosphoantigen stimulation (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). The effect was shown to be mediated by methylglucose-containing lipopolysaccharides (mGLP) present in the mycobacterial cell wall (<xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>). In addition, immunization of macaques with (E)-4-hydroxy-3-methyl-but-2-enyl pyrophosphate (HMBPP) elicits Vγ2Vδ2 T cell responses and reduces TB infection following challenge (<xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>). The antigen specificity of the expanded T cells we describe here and their contribution to protective immunity remains to be determined.</p>
              <p>Recent studies have revealed that BCG revaccination of adolescents or intravenous BCG vaccination of non-human primates can prevent M.tb infection (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>). These data raise the question of which aspects of the immune response to BCG are required for protection against M.tb. Our results are notable for showing no modulation in the total frequency of iNKT cells, MAIT cells, and CD1b-restricted T cells. These negative data are important findings in the context of immune correlates of protection but also the confounded literature describing the effect of BCG on these T cell populations in humans (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). By contrast, our study revealed expansion of γδ T cells following BCG revaccination, thus highlighting this DURT subset as an important target for further study in the context of BCG as well as other novel vaccine strategies.</p>
