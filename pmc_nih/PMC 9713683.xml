                  <p>In this cluster randomized trial with 49 general practitioners (GPs) caring for 389 children and youths, child mental health training for GPs increased childrenâ€™s receipt of mental health care (GPs more likely to counsel, parents more likely to report that their children had received mental health care) compared with GPs instructed only to refer.

                  <p>Overall, 49 GPs cared for 389 children who scored greater than the cutoff on the SDQ (216 children in intervention group, 173 in control group). Patientsâ€™ mean (SD) age was 8.9 (2.9) years (range, 5 to 15 years), and 182 (47%) were female patients. At 6 months, children in the intervention group had greater odds of receiving mental health care during the study (odds ratio [OR], 3.0; 95% CI, 1.1 to 7.7), parents were more likely to report that intervention GPs had discussed parent (OR, 2.1; 95% Cl, 1.1 to 3.8) and child (OR, 2.0; 95% Cl, 0.9 to 4.8) psychosocial issues, and intervention GPs were more likely to say they had provided counseling (OR, 1.8; 95% Cl, 1.02 to 3.3). However, there was no greater improvement in SDQ scores among children seen by intervention vs control GPs. Adjusted for clustering within GP, the variables used for balanced allocation (practice size, practice ownership, and study wave), and the other variables associated with change in SDQ scores over time, there was not a significant time-treatment interaction at either the 3- or 6-month follow-up points (linear combination of coefficients for intervention, 0.57 [95% CI, â€“1.07 to 2.22] and â€“0.08 [95%CI, â€“1.76 to 1.56], respectively). In a subgroup of GPs with practices composed of 50% or more children, children seen by intervention GPs improved to a significantly greater extent (â€“3.6 points; 95% CI, â€“6.7 to â€“0.46 points; effect size <italic>d</italic>â€‰=â€‰0.66; 95% CI, 0.30 to 1.01) compared with those seen by control GPs.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Worldwide, 10% to 20% of children develop mental health problems, but most remain untreated,<sup><xref rid="yoi220081r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).<sup><xref rid="yoi220081r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> For adults, integrated care has proven to be a way to fill a similar gap,<sup><xref rid="yoi220081r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> but there have been few studies among children, most coming from higher-income countries.<sup><xref rid="yoi220081r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="yoi220081r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> We conducted a child integrated care trial in Iran, an LMIC whose medical system resembles other countries with a mix of public and private insurance and with general practitioners (GPs) as a gateway to services across the lifespan.<sup><xref rid="yoi220081r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Iran launched adult integrated care in 1989 with a collaborative model linking urban GPs with community mental health centers (CMHCs).<sup><xref rid="yoi220081r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> GPs collaboratively manage adult mental health problems but only detect and refer children and youths (ie, patients aged &lt;16 years). We investigated the efficacy of adding a child and youth component to the existing adult program in Tehran. We hypothesized that trained GPs would provide more mental health treatment to children and youths and that children and youths with mental health problems seeing trained GPs would experience greater improvement in symptoms. We planned subgroup analyses to explore variation in outcomes by child, parent, and GP characteristics.<sup><xref rid="yoi220081r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="yoi220081r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="yoi220081r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="yoi220081r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p>

                <title>GP Participants</title>
                <p>GPs were recruited from the 75 GPs participating in the adult collaborative care program and provided written informed consent. All were eligible unless they saw few or no children. GPs in the program receive periodic training in mental health care and receive incentives if patients complete follow-up visits. GPs are visited by psychologists from the CMHCs to audit and discuss cases. GPs can refer patients to the CMHCs for consultation or ongoing care.</p>

                <p>Child and youth participants were aged 5 to 15 years, seeking care for any reason from a participating GP. During 2 to 3 weeks for each GP, research assistants systematically approached adults accompanying potentially eligible children (henceforth referred to as <italic>parent</italic>). Children in distress (as determined by the GP or their office staff), unable to speak Farsi, or in active treatment at a participating CMHC were excluded. Consenting parents answered the parent form of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ),<sup><xref rid="yoi220081r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> an instrument measuring childhood mental health and behavioral problems. Children scoring greater than the Iranian cut points<sup><xref rid="yoi220081r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> (total problems score â‰¥15 for age 5-11 years and â‰¥17 for age â‰¥12 years) were enrolled in the trial. Parents consented to provide information about their child, themselves, their interactions with the GP, and other care their child might receive.</p>

                <title>Randomization and Masking</title>
                <p>Consenting GPs were randomized to receive either enhanced training as described in the next section (intervention group) or a refresher in identification and referral alone (control group). Intervention GPs were encouraged to treat nonacute child mental health problems if parents and patients were willing; control GPs were instructed to continue referring to a CMHC. All GPs received support from the program as before.</p>
                <p>Randomization used the Stata routine ralloc to create a nonfactorial balanced list of allocations in which GPs were assigned in blocks of 2 or 4 to the intervention or control group, such that 2 GP characteristics (practice size [small: &lt;20 patients of all ages/d; large: â‰¥20 patients of all ages/d] and ownership [private vs public]) were balanced in the intervention and control groups. Practice ownership was hypothesized as important for balancing because privately insured patients might have more access to mental health services outside the collaborative care network,<sup><xref rid="yoi220081r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> and practice size was hypothesized to be (inversely) related to the amount of time GPs would be able to spend with individual patients. The balancing process also created allocations across 3 waves of GPs entering the study at intervals of 3 to 4 months. One investigator (L.W.), blinded to GPsâ€™ identities, randomly ordered a list of consenting GPs and matched GPs sequentially to the first open slot on the allocation list that matched their practice characteristics. This yielded each GPâ€™s treatment and wave assignment.</p>
                <p>Research assistants assessed outcomes by telephone. Assistants knew which GP the child had seen but were blinded to training assignments. GPs were not given SDQ scorings but knew that it had been administered.</p>

                <title>Primary Outcome</title>
                <p>The primary outcome was the parent-rated SDQ total problems score, measured at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. These time points were selected in recognition of the curvilinear pattern of improvement often seen in studies of child mental health treatment<sup><xref rid="yoi220081r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> and to allow maximal use of data should children be lost to follow-up at 6 months. The SDQ is a brief (25-item) tool covering emotions (low mood and anxiety), attention, conduct, and peer interactions. It is sensitive to clinically important change, and its total score represents the mix of problems that children and youths often present in primary care. The Farsi version of the parent SDQ for younger children has been validated against the Farsi Child Behavior Checklist<sup><xref rid="yoi220081r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> and the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia present and lifetime version.<sup><xref rid="yoi220081r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup></p>

                <p>At baseline and 6 months, parents reported on their childâ€™s mental health care in the prior 6 months. Parentsâ€™ mental health status, a factor associated with child mental health,<sup><xref rid="yoi220081r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> was measured with the 28-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ)<sup><xref rid="yoi220081r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. The GHQ, previously used in Iran, has good sensitivity and specificity for common mental disorders (cut-point â‰¥24), and can be used as a continuous measure of distress.<sup><xref rid="yoi220081r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="yoi220081r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup></p>
                <p>Immediately following each childâ€™s enrollment visit, GPs were asked (1) if they believed the child or youth had a behavioral or emotional problem warranting treatment and, (2) if so, what treatment they provided (eg, counseling, medication, referral), if any. Independently, parents reported on whether emotional or behavioral problems (the childâ€™s or their own) had been discussed. We asked both parents and GPs about visit content because, in a prior study, we found that parentsâ€™ and doctorsâ€™ recall could differ.<sup><xref rid="yoi220081r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup></p>

                <title>Statistical Analysis</title>
                <p>The power calculation, following methods outlined by Hemming et al,<sup><xref rid="yoi220081r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> was based on a plan to recruit at least 45 GPs from the collaborative care network. The first step ignored clustering within GPs and estimated, based on a minimally detectable effect size of approximately <italic>d</italic>â€‰=â€‰0.34 and a 2-sided alphaâ€‰=â€‰.05, a power of 0.8,<sup><xref rid="yoi220081r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="yoi220081r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> needing 135 patients per study group (270 total patients). The second step adjusted this number for clustering. A review of adult primary care studies from high-income countries found a median intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.01 for a general mental health screening measure<sup><xref rid="yoi220081r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>; 270 patients among 45 GPs yields clusters of 6; an estimated ICC of 0.01 yields a design effect of 1â€‰+â€‰([6â€‰âˆ’â€‰1)â€‰Ã—â€‰0.01)â€‰=â€‰1.05, or a sample size at outcome of approximately 284. Assuming a 20% loss to follow-up would require enrolling 355 patients.</p>
                <p>Study groups remained masked until exploratory analyses were completed. Missing items in the SDQ and GHQ were addressed using methods described for the scales.<sup><xref rid="yoi220081r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="yoi220081r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> Of 1106 SDQs administered at baseline, less than 1% had 1 or more missing items; all but 3 (&lt;1%) could have total scores imputed.<sup><xref rid="yoi220081r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> Of 448 GHQs administered at baseline, 59 (12%) had 1 or more items missing. All but 13 (3%) could be scored by prorating subscale totals.<sup><xref rid="yoi220081r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup></p>
                <p>Analyses were conducted in 3 stages: (1) effect of intervention on change in SDQ scores from baseline to the 3- and 6-month follow-ups; (2) effects of intervention on secondary outcomes, including receipt of mental health care during the study, change in parental mental health, and parent and GP reports of care at the index visit; and (3) planned subgroup analyses corresponding to GP characteristics. We additionally explored possible heterogeneity related to parent and child characteristics (child age, child gender, and parent GHQ status).</p>
                <p>As planned, we initially used multilevel regression (child or parent observations clustered within GPs) with the interaction of time (as a categorical variable) and GP group assignment as a predictor of child or parent outcomes.<sup><xref rid="yoi220081r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="yoi220081r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> A similar approach, but without a time-group interaction, was used for outcomes that referred only to the enrollment visit. We used random-intercept regression models, included covariates used in the balanced allocation (study wave, practice size, practice ownership),<sup><xref rid="yoi220081r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> and fit the model using maximum likelihood with Stata mixed and melogit commands for continuous and binary outcomes, respectively.

                <p>GP recruiting occurred in January to February 2018. Of 75 GPs in the collaborative, 70 initially indicated interest, and 53 provided consent and were randomized (26 control, 27 intervention). Two GPs who were randomized could not be scheduled for training (both control participants), and for 2 GPs, no eligible patients were recruited (1 each in the intervention and control groups) (<xref rid="yoi220081f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Intervention and control GPs were similar in practice characteristics, but intervention GPs were more likely to be female (14 [54%]) compared with control GPs (5 [22%]) (<xref rid="yoi220081t1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). All but 2 GPs were in solo practice; the 2 at the same site worked nonoverlapping shifts.</p>

                <p>A total of 1170 eligible child-parent pairs were approached from May 2018 through February 2019, when the sample size for SDQ positive children was achieved; 619 of those eligible saw intervention GPs and 551 control GPs. Of these, 1111 provided consent and were screened (589 in the intervention group and 522 in the control group [95% for both groups]). One patient seeing an intervention GP could not be screened because of incomplete data; 4 parents seeing control GPs initially consented but declined screening; 1106 parents (588 seeing intervention GPs and 518 seeing control GPs) completed the SDQ screening. A total of 216 children (37%) seeing intervention GPs and 173 (33%) seeing control GPs screened positive (total, 389). Intervention GPs ultimately had from 1 to 20 screen-positive children and control GPs from 2 to 15 (<xref rid="yoi220081f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
                <p>Child participants seeing intervention and control GPs were similar. The childrenâ€™s mean (SD) age was 8.9 (2.9) years (range, 5-15 years), 182 (47%) were female patients, and their mean (SD) SDQ total problems score was 20.2 (3.9; range, 15-31) (<xref rid="yoi220081t1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Approximately 18% (67 patients) had seen a mental health professional in the 6 months prior to screening. Parents seeing intervention and control GPs were also similar. Most parents were childrenâ€™s mothers (346 [89%]). Parentsâ€™ mean (SD) age was 37.4 (6.6) years (range, 23-66 years), and their mean (SD) GHQ score was 29.1 (14.3; range, 1-74). Nearly half (177 [46%]) reported not always having enough money for expenses. Most had seen the participating GP at least once previously.</p>

Adjusted for clustering within GP, the variables used for balanced allocation (practice size, practice ownership, and study wave), and the other variables associated with change in SDQ scores over time, there was not a significant time-treatment interaction at either the 3- or 6-month follow-up points (linear combination of coefficients for intervention, 0.57 [95% CI, â€“1.07 to 2.22] and â€“0.08 [95% CI, â€“1.76 to 1.56], respectively). Using the same adjustments, the intervention was not associated with significantly greater improvement in any of the SDQ subscale scores. eAppendix 2 in <xref rid="note-YOI220081-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 2</xref> demonstrates that similar results were obtained through alternative approaches to analysis (outcomes modeled as post-pre change in individual child SDQ scores, post-pre change in mean SDQ score per GP, interaction of mean SDQ score per GP with time, time modeled as a continuous variable).</p>

However, there was a statistically significant interaction of treatment with GP practice composition (child- vs adult-predominant) (<xref rid="yoi220081f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>; eTable 4 in <xref rid="note-YOI220081-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 2</xref>). From the multilevel model with a 3-way interaction term for treatment, time, and practice composition, the intervention-control difference in SDQ scores at 6 months was significantly larger among children seen by child-predominant GPs compared with children seen by adult-predominant GPs (â€“3.6 points; 95% CI, â€“6.7 to â€“0.46 points). As for the GPs overall, among child-predominant GPs, the intervention was associated with greater odds of the GP counseling (OR, 3.3; 95% CI, 1.0 to 10.3). Similar results were found from the alternative methods of analysis presented in Supplement 3.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>We found that a brief training for generalists in collaborative care increased the odds that children and youths with positive SDQ scores would receive mental health care when they came for routine medical visits but did not result in greater improvement of child Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire scores (the primary outcome measurement). GPs in both study groups were trained to recognize child and youth mental health problems and did so similarly. But intervention GPs were more likely to say that they had counseled about child mental health problems, and parents seeing intervention GPs were more likely to say that the GP had discussed parent and some child psychosocial problems.</p>
              <p>We do not know why, despite this increased care, that training only seemed to improve child outcomes among GPs in child-predominant practices. Their counseling could have been more impactful if they were able to incorporate prior knowledge of children with what was taught in the training. The child-predominant GPs may also have had more positive attitudes toward caring for children and families and communicated this positivity to parents. Studies of GPs with special interests have found that their attitudes and confidence are, understandably, shaped by their prior experiences.<sup><xref rid="yoi220081r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> Conversely, we found that the trained adult-predominant GPsâ€™ patients improved the least. It may be that these GPs relative lack of experience with child and youth problems could have led to treatment attempts that were off-putting to parents and children.<sup><xref rid="yoi220081r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> If replicated, this effect could call for caution when trying to promote child and youth collaborative care among clinicians with limited experience working with children and their families.</p>
              <p>Among the GPs overall, female gender and longer time in practice had opposite influences on child outcomes. We suspect that social change and emigration from LMICs could result in cohorts of GPs with divergent training and practice styles.<sup><xref rid="yoi220081r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> Neither of these GP characteristics, however, was related to response to training.</p>

It was not powered to examine all the complexities of collaborative care.<sup><xref rid="yoi220081r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> We do not know the specific content of visits, and adult-predominant GPs might have caught up to their child-predominant colleagues with additional training, practice, and coaching. Although we followed up families for only 6 months and further improvement might have been seen later on, reports of outpatient care for common child and youth mental health problems suggest that the most rapid phase of improvement takes places within 3 to 4 months.<sup><xref rid="yoi220081r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup></p>
                <p>We caution, too, that our study took place within an existing collaborative and might not generalize to GPs overall or to other collaboratives. Brief trainings might not benefit generalists not already comfortable with adult mental health. Additionally, the results might not translate to clinicians who care only for children, since the GPsâ€™ attention to parents might have played a role in childrenâ€™s improvement. Conversely, had screening been a routine clinical practice within the collaborative, detection rates and child outcomes might have been better.<sup><xref rid="yoi220081r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup></p>
                <p>Strengths include enrolling a relatively large number of clinicians of a type commonly providing primary care in countries across the income spectrum<sup><xref rid="yoi220081r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="yoi220081r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> and demonstrating an impact on a heterogeneous population of children. We were also able to document improvements despite living conditions that worsened markedly during the study.<sup><xref rid="yoi220081r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup></p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>In this cluster randomized trial, GP training on managing common child mental health problems did not demonstrate greater improvement in child SDQ scores. However, the findings suggest that adding a child component to adult collaborative care may improve service access, but not all generalists may benefit equally from child training. As mental health training for generalists spreads, identifying clinician characteristics associated with patient outcomes and tailoring training to cliniciansâ€™ capabilities may help make the most efficient use of scarce training resources.</p>
